                         After one and half year of implementation, the project's main component show good progress, notably in budget formulation, budget execution, documentation and monitoring,
                         despite a challenging environment. The consolidation and institutionalization of these initial results depend to a large extent upon the normalization of the budget process and the

                         modernization of the legislative and regulatory framework. Most technical assistance activities of the debt management component have been delivered but institutional development
                         remains to be achieved and is contingent on the adoption of the decree setting up the public debt department in accordance with the law and on the gradual transfer of expertise and
                         competencies to the department. Advice to strengthen the department's back office is underway. The aid coordination and training components have started with the appointment end
                         of 2010 of the respective national adviser and training coordinator. The MoF's aid coordination role and information system are being strengthened, including through the recent
                         interface with the Center for Development and Reconstruction's (CDR) comprehensive project database. The development of the MoF's training strategy and modules has started,
                         notably based on the important diagnostic and streamlining work undertaken in the budget preparation and execution component. The project's macro-fiscal component has not yet
                         started but technical assistance and training foreseen can be provided as soon as the new unit/ team has been set up in the Ministry of Finance.
