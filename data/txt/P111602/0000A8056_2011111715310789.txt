                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR4914



                         The project implementation to date showed good progress in three out of five components, namely budget formulation and budget execution, aid coordination, as well as training and
                         capacity building. The macro-fiscal component has not yet been launched and the debt management component had to be reduced to the back office function due to lack of political
                         will. The situation has now changed and the new Minister of Finance made the development of the Ministry's macro-fiscal analysis and public debt management capacity a priority
                         given the important fiscal challenges facing the country. The fall of the Government in January 2011 delayed reform implementation and weighted negatively on the project

                         performance. The formation of a new Government since June 2011 and the fact that it holds a majority in Parliament creates a more favorable environment for reform. Pending
                         decisions, decrees and legislation can now be put back on track so as to push policy reforms and consolidate the technical achievements under the EFMIS project. This is notably the
                         case for the Public accounting law, dated 1963 and whose modernization is supported by the project. Likewise, the macro-fiscal and public debt components imply institutional and
                         organizational reforms requiring the adoption of corresponding cabinet decrees. All these decrees are now in the pipeline for approval/ enactment. This is an important step for the
                         consolidation of the project's good technical work and its translation into better outcomes in terms of public financial management and institutional strengthening.

                         This further requires the normalization of the budget process and the adoption of a budget, which has been lacking since 2005. The modernization of the budget preparation methods
                         and instruments, notably through the development of a comprehensive budget circular and capacity building of budget officers in the Ministry of Finance and line ministries have not
                         yet translated into more strategic or sustainable resource allocations. Stricter enforcement of this budget circular (and the inclusion of sector ceilings and costing norms), the adoption
                         of a budget and the empowerment of the budget directorate, whose director position is still vacant are needed. Likewise, the adoption of the new budget classification, in line with
                         international standards, will improve financial transparency and budget management.

                         Regarding budget execution, good progress has been made, notably on the review of the legal and regulatory framework, on cash planning and management, on budget execution
                         monitoring and control, on bookkeeping and accounting, as well as on the functional review of the IT systems currently underway. However, these intermediary results need to be
                         consolidated through the revision of the Public Accounting Law, the enforcement of the cash management directives, the development of clear guidelines on accounting and the
                         thorough review of the Ministry's information system. The new Minister of Finance shares these priorities and has requested support from the project. The necessary technical and
                         financial resources will thus be devoted to these essential tasks. This should enable Management to address the most pressing issues with the IT system, while developing a clear
                         strategy and action plan for the development of a modern and integrated financial management information system in the medium term.

                         The debt component has gained momentum for the above mentioned reasons and the regulatory framework upgrading, technically supported by the project, is back on track. the
                         decrees on the public debt directorate and on the high debt committee are both pending approval. In the mean time, work on the consolidation of the Ministry's back office and public
                         debt database has gained traction, thanks to the new appointment of a manager and the mobilization through the project of expertise from a high official from the Turkish debt office.
                         The public debt strategy needs to be updated and this represents a first opportunity/ test of collaboration between the various stakeholders.

                         Progress has been made under the aid coordination and training components despite their late start at the end of 2010. After the interconnection of the aid management databases
                         between MoF and the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the different data formats now require a common identifier to be agreed upon as soon as possible.

                         The Ministry's training and capacity building activities have been developed in close cooperation with the Institute of Finance. New training modules have been developed and taught
                         on budget preparation and execution, and trainers have been trained within MoF. These efforts now need to be consolidated through the development of a genuine training policy for
                         MoF and the nomination of trainers in each directorate/ unit.

                         The project's financia l implementation reflects the initial delays and the lack of progress in the macro-fiscal and debt management components. However, implementation should pick
                         up in the next semester considering the new political will on these reforms, the extension of key expert contracts and of the PIU as well as the addition of new activities, such as an
                         external IT audit. This will also translate into higher financial execution rates.

                         Considering the initial delays, aggravated by the political stalemate during the first semester, the new Minister of Finance has requested a 21 months extension to complete the
                         project and achieve its objectives. In view of the strong political will and the new reform momentum, this extension has been granted by the Bank on September 9, 2011. The project's
                         new closing date is June 30, 2013. While the authorities confirmed the relevance of and commitment to the initial project design and results framework, a detailed implementation
                         action plan for the extended period was agreed upon to better prioritize efforts and monitor progress.
