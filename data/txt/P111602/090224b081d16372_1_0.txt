                         This ISR is a desk update, to reflect the extension of the Project Closing Date, from June 30, 2013, to September 15, 2013. The implementation of EFMIS had been slow especially in
                         the first two years of the project. This was mainly related to (i) the political deadlock that constrained PFM reforms, (ii) a weak regulatory framework that limited the execution of some
                         activities, and (iii) the weak staff and absorptive capacities within the MoF. However, this situation has changed in the past 24 months with the increased political support for PFM
                         reforms, along with the extensive capacity building and technical assistance that was provided throughout the life of the project. This resulted in a considerably accelerated rhythm in

                         the implementation of EFMIS.

                         While the objectives of the Project remain relevant, the translation of the project's important results into outcomes might be hampered by the current political situation since the
                         resignation of the Cabinet last April and by the impact of the crisis in neighboring Syria.

                         The current EFMIS grant will cover the cost of tasks and activities under the current results framework. The grant is not subject to an ongoing suspension of disbursements, and no
                         audit reports are outstanding.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The extension comes at the request of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in the Minister’s formal letter dated May 31st, 2013. It aims to consolidate the recent institutional achievements
                         and to minimize the lag between the current project and the Bank’s follow up Fiscal Management Reform Project 2, currently under preparation.The extension allows for the
                         completion and the consolidation of the tasks and deliverables currently identified in the Project’s results framework. No additional activities will be supported, no changes to the
                         Project’s components and their related development objectives are envisaged, and no reallocation between disbursement categories will occur.
