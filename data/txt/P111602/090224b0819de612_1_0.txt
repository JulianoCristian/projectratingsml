                         The prospects of achieving the Project’s expected output and outcomes have improved, particularly for the two components, macro-fiscal and debt management, which started late.
                         The macro fiscal unit has been established, following the Ministerial decree issued in March and most importantly it has been staffed. Thus, the Project’s technical assistance and
                         training activities aimed at helping build the Ministry’s macro-fiscal analytical capacity could start since the last mission. Likewise, the new public debt department has started the work
                         on the medium term debt strategy, in close cooperation with the macro-fiscal team and forecast. This strategy is due to be validated by the new High Level Debt Committee by June,

                         2013. Good progress has been made on the budget preparation and budget execution components, despite important external constraints, such as the absence of a voted budget
                         and severe human resource constraints in the IT department. Numerous public financial management training and capacity building activities took place, thus supporting the technical
                         work done under the various components. Some progress has been made on aide coordination, although the institutional positioning of this cross-cutting function within government
                         is unclear and the aid management information system is not yet fully operational.
