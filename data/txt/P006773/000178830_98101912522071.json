        Government in its efforts to foster agricultural development\n            by facilitating farmers' access to markets and by\n            lowering transport costs through the construction and\n            rehabilitation of rural roads. It would also strengthen\n            rural road maintenance and FNCV's overall\n            administration. The project consists of: (a) construction of\n            about 710 km of rural roads; (b) rehabilitation of about 710\n            km; (c) engineering for about 710 km; (d) purchase of hand\n            tools for labor-intensive maintenance; (e) procurement of\n            maintenance equipment and related spare parts; and (f)\n            technical assistance to improve FNCV's management\n            information system. The project faces no unusual risks. The\n            works included under the project are considered to be well\n            within the capability of FNCV. The Working Capital Fund to\n            be set up under the project will ensure the timely\n            availability of financial resources and thus provide for\n            speedy project execution."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
