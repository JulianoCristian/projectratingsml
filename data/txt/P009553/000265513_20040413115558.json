The Request specifies how the Bank has\n            violated its own policies, including: lack of support for\n            the private sector and an unwillingness to take seriously\n            the concerns of the private sector of the jute industry.\n            The Request specifies that the Bank has given more\n            opportunity to the public mills and not consulted the\n            private sector on issues such as wage policy reform,\n            privatization of public mills and technical assistance and\n            training.
