Lessons learned from the project are: 1) the\n            program confirmed the experience elsewhere that broad\n            internalization of the reform program by the borrower and\n            its executing agencies, accompanied by solid political\n            commitment and consensus at the highest levels of decision\n            making are essential ingredients for any successful\n            International Development Association (IDA) structural\n            reform operation; 2) it is important that IDA and the\n            Borrower reach a common understanding as to the possible\n            outcome of a program. In the case of Jute Sector Adjustment\n            Credit (JSAC), IDA's perception that the jute\n            industrial output could decrease substantially was different\n            from that of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB's) that\n            total output would remain constant; and 3) in cases of\n            significant downsizing of installed industrial capacity it\n            is important to provide a social safety net for the benefit\n            of displaced workers as was recognized under the Program.\n            However, it is also important to consider ways to mitigate\n            the adverse effects of the industrial restructuring on\n            livelihood in the associated sectors -- e.g. farmers in the\n            case of jute mill restructuring."}, "docdt": "1998-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
