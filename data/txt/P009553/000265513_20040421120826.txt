NOTICE OF REGISTRATION 
Dear  Sir: 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
- Bangladesh:  Jute Sector Adjustment Credit 2567-BD
 
 
 
The Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) received on November 13, 1996, a Request for Inspection (the 
“Request”) dated August 6, 1996 from a group of citizens of Bangladesh who state that they are 
shareholders/CEOs of private sector jute mills (the “Requesters”) and  claim that their rights/interests have 
been adversely affected by acts and omissions of the International Development Association (“IDA”).  The 
Requesters claim that IDA’s omissions and failures relate to the design and implementation of the above-
referenced project, and are a result of alleged violations of various unspecified provisions of IDA policies 
and procedures--which seem to relate to ODs 8.60, 13.05 and 13.40--as well as of IDA’s failure to require 
the Borrower to comply with the conditions of the Development Credit Agreement for this operation.  
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 17 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the “Operating 
Procedures”), I am notifying you that I have, on November 25, 1996, which is also the date of the dispatch 
of this notice, registered the Request in the Inspection Panel Register. 
 
All  communications  with  the  Requesters  in  connection  with  the  Request  will  be  sent  to              
Mr. Kh. Raisuddin Ahmed at the address listed below. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of IDA Resolution No. 93-6 and paragraph 18(d) of the 
Operating Procedures, IDA Management is hereby notified that it must provide the Panel no later than 
December 27, 1996 with written evidence that it has complied, or intends to comply with the relevant 
policies and procedures in the implementation of the above-referenced project. The essential criteria for the 
response to the Request are set out in paragraph 33 of the Operating Procedures. 
 
The Request has been assigned  IPN Request Number RQ96/3. 
 
  
Sincerely 
yours, 
 
 
  
 
Richard E. Bissell 
  
Chairman
