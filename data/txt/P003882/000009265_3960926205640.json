Specifically, it involves:\n            (i) increased productive capacity in the export-oriented\n            manufacturing sector by strengthening the ability of the\n            financial system to provide term loans for projects\n            contributing to non-oil export development. It also entails\n            (ii) support for the effective implementation of the ongoing\n            policy and institution-building initiatives under the\n            technical assistance component of the EDP. The project\n            covers both direct and indirect exporters. In addition, the\n            project provides the five state-owned commercial banks, two\n            private banks and two non-bank financial institutions with\n            long-term funds to support about 110 non-oil export-oriented investments."}, "docdt": "1988-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
