          from the Borrower to Participating Entities
1.   The interest rate  payable  by  Participating Entities to the
Borrower on funds out of  the  Loan  shall  be a variable rate per
annum  equal  to  the  average   weighted  interest  cost  of  the
Participating Entities'  (excluding  PDFCI  and  UPPINDO) loanable
funds arising out of their customer deposits (i.e., excluding free
funds from government  and  parastatal  agencies) over a six-month
period. This rate will  be  determined  according to the following
formula and adjusted every six months:
                 6
                   rT (T ) + rS (S ) + rD (MD )
     I = (1/6)      t   t     t   t     t    t
                  (T  + S  + D ) - (RT + RS + RD)
                    t    t    t      t     t    t
                 t = 1
Definitions
t    =    the last day of each of the most recent six months prior
          to an Interest Period for which BI has consolidated data
          on the deposit base of the Participating Entities1
rD   =    interest rate payable on Participating Entities' demand
 t        deposits, at time t
rT   =    interest rate payable on Participating Entities'
 t        time deposits, at time t
rS   =    interest rate payable on Participating Entities' saving
 t        deposits, at time t
Dt   =    the amount of Participating Entities' demand deposits,
          at time t
Tt   =    the amount of Participating Entities' time deposits, at
          time t
__________________________
1/ In this formula,  Participating  Entities  do not include PDFCI
   and UPPINDO.
St   =    the amount of Participating Entities' saving deposits,
          at time t
MDt  =    minimum average balance of Participating Entities'
          demand deposits outstanding during month immediately
          preceding time t
RT   =    reserves on time deposits of Participating Entities, at
 t        time t
RS   =    reserves on savings deposits of Participating Entities'
 t        at time t
RD   =    reserves on demand deposits of Participating Entities,
  t       at time t

I    =    interest rate applicable on Subsidiary Loan (from the
          Borrower to all Participating Entities) for each
          interest period.
2.   Notwithstanding the above cost-of-funds formula, the
relending rate will not be less than the interest rate on the Loan
plus a margin of 1.75%.
