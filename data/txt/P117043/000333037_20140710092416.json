Public Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Paraguay were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: strong national\n            ownership proved once again to be a crucial element of a\n            successful operation. The strong commitment with the reforms\n            is evidenced by the fact that despite the political\n            instability during the Program's implementation,\n            changes were made and outcomes achieved. A strong knowledge\n            background was essential for the choice of policy actions,\n            simultaneously combining relevance and political\n            feasibility. Sustained engagement on the part of the Bank\n            continues to be critical to effectively support reform\n            processes over the medium and long term. The uninterrupted\n            relationship between the Bank and the counterpart even at\n            times when significant reform was not feasible laid grounds\n            for an effective partnership when the opportunity was\n            presented. Supporting a policy area that counts on the clear\n            commitment from the government allows for increasingly\n            complex reforms. In particular, the Government's focus\n            on large taxpayers shows its commitment to shift from\n            improving basic core processes to second generation reforms,\n            and the program's successful support of these measures\n            exhibits the Bank's adequacy as a development partner\n            in the policy area."}, "docdt": "2014-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
