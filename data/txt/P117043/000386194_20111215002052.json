Executive Directors welcomed the Loan, and its\n            support to public sector reform. Directors noted the\n            operation's close integration with government\n            priorities and the World Bank's country assistance\n            strategy for Paraguay. They noted that the improvement in\n            the efficiency of public financial management and the\n            enhanced tax revenue collection would contribute to poverty\n            reduction and macroeconomic stability in the medium term. In\n            this regard, Directors stressed the importance of\n            strengthening institutional capacity; fostering governance\n            and equitable growth; focusing on challenges in delivering\n            social services; and addressing political risks to\n            implementing prudent fiscal and monetary reforms. Directors\n            also highlighted the need for robust outcome indicators,\n            close collaboration with authorities, the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) and other development partners."}, "docdt": "2011-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
