Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Program for Paraguay is to\n            contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the public\n            sector. This is expected to be reached via the following\n            specific objectives: (i) exerting effective state-owned\n            enterprises (SOE) oversight; (ii) improving central\n            administration's internal financial control; and (iii)\n            strengthening the tax system. This Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) supports the Government reform plans and builds upon\n            the significant achievements in several areas of a previous\n            programmatic DPL in 2009. The operation was conceived within\n            the context of the FY09-13 Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) to support the implementation of the government reform\n            plans. Building on the dialogue developed in partnership\n            with the government, the Bank intends to contribute to the\n            government plan's overall objective of achieving\n            sustainable and more equitable growth by providing direct\n            support to three of its pillars: (i) macroeconomic policy;\n            (ii) SOEs; and (iii) state modernization. This DPL focuses\n            on three program components: (i) state oversight of\n            state-owned enterprises; (ii) public sector financial\n            control (central administration); and (iii) the tax system."}, "docdt": "2011-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
