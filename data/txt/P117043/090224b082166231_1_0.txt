                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The overall development objective of the proposed PSDPL is to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector. This is expected to be reached via the
                         following specific objectives: (i) exerting effective Oversight of SOEs; (ii) improving Central Administration’s internal financial control; and (iii) strengthening the Tax
                         System.
                         Contribution to the CPS: The proposed DPL isfully consistent with the current World Bank Group CPS (2009-2013): two out of the three cross-cutting themes addressed
                         by the CPS program – governance, poverty reduction, and equitable growth – are supported by the PSDPL.
