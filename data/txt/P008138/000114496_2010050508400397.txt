                    Description of the Project
     The main objectives of the  Project are to help modernize and
restructure OSE, aiming at reducing operating costs and increasing
productivity so as to enable  OSE to operate without subsidies and
to provide adequate  services  to  low-income groups at affordable
prices. Other specific Project objectives comprise:
          (i)  meeting  short-to   medium-term   water  demand  at
               minimum cost through  water  savings resulting from
               rehabilitation of  facilities  and the introduction
               of  new  operational,  maintenance  and  commercial
               practices, as well  as,  through expansion of water
               provision resulting  from  improved water treatment
               installations, rehabilitation of transmission mains
               and  expansion   of   the  Montevideo  distribution
               network;
         (ii)  improving water quality and service reliability;
Page  9
        (iii)  improving OSE's  financial  performance by reducing
               recurrent costs, particularly  through increases in
               labor productivity; and
         (iv)  implementing a  revised  sector strategy, including
               cost  recovery   policies   and   a  cost-effective
               investment plan to  meet  the  long-term demand for
               water and sewerage services.
     The Project consists of the  following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Bank and OSE may agree upon from time
to time to achieve such objectives:

adequate customer relations, all  of  the foregoing to include the
improvement of the  required  logistic and administrative systems,
such  as  personnel  management,  transportation,  purchasing  and

of  the  above  will  be  achieved  by  means  of:  (i)  technical
cooperation and  training  under  corporate twinning arrangements,
(ii) technical assistance and  cooperation through the utilization
of consultants'  services  for  planning  and  coordination of the
activities  under  the  Project,  and  (iii)  the  preparation and
