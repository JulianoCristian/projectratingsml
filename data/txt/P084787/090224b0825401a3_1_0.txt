                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the pilot program is to improve the process for identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or
                         land-poor recipients selected through a transparent and well-targeted process as indicated by:
                         (a) the adoption rates of improved land management and agricultural production systems in SLC sub-projects;
                         (b) proportion of land recipients which meet poverty criteria and were landless or land-poor prior to project interventions;
                         (c) the effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures under the project, related to challenges to the land recipient selection process.

                         The process for identification and use of state land transferred to poor and formerly land-less recipients has improved considerably as demonstrated by the adoption rates, number of
                         land recipients and effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures. All land recipients who have settled in the Social Land Concession (SLC) sites are adopting backyard
                         and agricultural farming using improved agricultural technology learned in project-sponsored training and demonstration plots compared to the project target of 60%. To date, a total
                         of 3,148 land recipients (104% of the target) have been selected for all SLC sites, and a total of 10,273.13 hectares (103% of the target) have been completely registered as state

                         private lands for all project SLC sites. Land has been used as follows: (i) 5,575.54 hectares (54%) for agriculture; 266.13 hectares (3%) for residences; 950.40 hectares (9%) for
                         public infrastructure; 1,648.63 hectares (16%) for community forestry; and the balance of 1,832.43 hectares (18%) as reserved agricultural and residential lands. A recent survey
                         suggests that the projectâ€™s accomplishments have led to increased incomes which have enabled beneficiaries to acquire additional assets (motorcycles, cows, etc.) and make shelter
                         improvements. The socio-economic status of land recipients and their families on going assesses, and gain a better understanding of their livelihoods and problems and results were
                         meant to show the project's impacts and inform the design of any follow up intervention.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As some land recipients have occupied their lands for five years now, the project has started processing titles. Land title certificates should be delivered to them by the end of 2014.
                         The project is scheduled to close in March 2015 following the recent restructuring; however, due to the varying stages of implementation progress in the project sites, continued
                         strengthening of service provision to beneficiaries is required. Continued financial support for the project would strengthen the sustainability of livelihood improvements for land
                         recipients.
