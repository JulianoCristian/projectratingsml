Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The development objective of the pilot program is to improve the process for identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and
 formerly landless or land-poor recipients selected through a transparent and well-targeted process as indicated by: (a) the adoption rates of
 improved land management and agricultural production systems in SLC sub-projects; (b) proportion of land recipients which meet poverty criteria
 and were landless or land-poor prior to project interventions; (c) the effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures under the project,
 related to challenges to the land recipient selection process.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project had continued good and steady progress towards achieving the PDO and its relevance remained in line with the Government’s Sub-Decree
 19 on Social Land Concession Program. All four PDO indicators have been achieved to date, with a minor shortfall (rate was 57 percent compared to a
 target of 60 percent). The activities and accomplishments have provided good lessons learned for the identification, development and sustainability of
 future SLC sites. To date, a total of 3,148 land recipients (104% of the target) have been selected for all SLC sites, and a total of 10,273.13 hectares
 (103% of the target) have been completely registered as state private land for all project SLC sites. Land has been used as follows: (i) 5,575.54
 hectares (54%) for agriculture; 266.13 hectares (3%) for residences; 950.40 hectares (9%) for public infrastructure; 1,648.63 hectares (16%) for
 community forestry; and the balance of 1,832.43 hectares (18%) as reserved agricultural and residential lands.
 The security of land tenure is considered the biggest benefit derived from the project. The first request for Social Land Concession (SLC) titling has
 been received by Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC) now awaiting signature by Senior Minister to officially
 initiate the process. Steps have already been taken to start the titling process for eligible land recipients. Expectations are for a free titling for SLC
 recipients or for a costing that does not exceed the (low) systematic titling fees. This will send a very positive message to project beneficiaries as well as
 to the broader public and press when first titles could be distributed to SLC beneficiaries in the coming months.
 The life of land recipients is closely link to having of land. Having land has provided them housing security, food security and opportunities to improve
 their socio-economic condition. A recent survey undertaken by the project for 50 randomly selected families showed that, the average family gross and
 net cash income has increased (US$2,300 gross cash income from all sources such as on-, off- and non-farm, which compared in 2011 was only
 US$470 of family income when baseline data was gathered). Increased incomes enabled beneficiaries to acquire additional assets (motorcycles, cows,
 etc.), make shelter improvements and some of them made an effort to send their children for higher education.
 The settling-in support and capacity building provided to those that have settled in the SLC sites contributed to a positive impact on improving their
 livelihoods. In future, the establishment of a community-based revolving fund for example, may help shift the decision making process for service
 delivery more towards the beneficiaries, and instill a greater sense of ownership towards change. The infrastructure works under the project have been
 completed since early June 2014, nine months before the project closing date. Some infrastructure outputs, particularly roads, had to be reduced
 compared with the original plan as the construction cost increased approximately 25% due to construction materials and labor inflation. All seven
 schools constructed are in operation, except the recently completed school in Thmey SLC site, which is in preparation for operation. All three health
 posts have completed. Two of them are in full operation while the recent one in Chambak SLC is in preparation for operation.
 For sustainable use of the infrastructure investment, Infrastructure Repair and Maintenance Committees (IRMC) were established in each site. The
 IRMC committee facilitates involvement from community people in repairing roads and other infrastructures. the IRMC in Tipo SLC, for example, has
 called for emergency repair of spillway where some parts of constructed scour protection were damaged by 2014 flood through contribution their own
 labors and no-cost local materials. In order to effectively implement the maintenance works, it is recommended to use guidelines on local contribution
 collection and other relevant sections of the commune/Sangkat implementation manual.

         pig raising in all site, 3) Kampost in all site, 4) rice production in KPT and KRT, 5) fruit tree in all site, 6) home gardening in all site
         and 7) vegetable production and market in all site. The aim of demonstration and training provided to the land recipients to help
         them plan and manage their agricultural lands and backyard gardens. To date, a total of 578 courses were provided under the
         project which include land preparation, shaping the soil for water management, incorporating crop residue and fertilizers,
         planting techniques, timing of planting, etc.

               Comments
               Reports are prepared regularly (quarterly, semester and annually) from sub-national level and then sent to NCDDs and GSSLC
               for consolidation. The timeliness of report submission to the Bank has generally improved, but still needs some improvement.
               Sometimes the reports submitted late to WB in average 1 week because some of sub-national advisers were reduced.
