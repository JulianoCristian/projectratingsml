F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Financing Agreement)

The Financing Agreement states, “The objective of the Project is to improve the process of
identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless and
land poor land recipients through a transparent and well-targeted selection process”.

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

In the Project Appraisal Document the PDO reads as follows: “The development objective
of the Pilot Program is to improve the process for identification and use of state lands
transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or land-poor recipients selected through
a transparent and well targeted process.” The PAD formulation used the term “Pilot
Program”, whereas the FA formulation used the term “Project”. Nonetheless, the Project
was the main source of financing for the Pilot Program.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2004, poverty in Cambodia was estimated to have declined to 35% from 47% in
1993/94 driven mainly by garment manufacturing and tourism. However, progress was
uneven with higher poverty declines in urban than in rural areas. Income inequality
between urban and rural areas was increasing while inequality within the rural population
accounted for 86% of the overall increase in inequality for the country. A 2004 poverty
assessment highlighted increasing landlessness and land poverty amongst the rural poor.
The poverty assessment identified access to land as the utmost critical asset for the rural
poor as rural households were dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Landlessness
was estimated to have increased from 12.6% in 1997 to 19.6% in 2004. During that period,
15% of the poor and 13% of the poorest quintile were landless in rural areas and 40% of
the rural population that farmed less than 0.5 Ha were unable to meet even half of the
nutritional requirements of a typical rural family.

2.      There was an urgent need for the country to improve the management of its state
land areas. State land constituted about 80% of Cambodia’s 18.1 million Ha land area and
only a total of 2.5 million Ha that had been distributed to households in 1989 was
considered to be strictly private. The remaining area was largely occupied by both large
and small landholders and primarily consisted of forests and protected areas, military
development zones and other state lands. Institutional accountability in the management of
state lands was a challenge and there was little knowledge of the evolving legal framework.
Public disclosure mechanisms were weak as was enforcement of existing laws. This led to
regular informal possession of land, inefficiencies and corrupt practices in dealing with
state lands. Increasing landlessness and speculative pressures on land continued to drive
encroachment on state lands largely through conversion of forested or degraded forest
areas. The activities outside the legal framework often resulted in conflict as more powerful
interests attempted to ‘grab’ land insecurely held by small farmers with potential to cause
irreversible, negative environmental and social impacts in areas of high conservation value
and amongst indigenous people’s communities. In 2005, the Government issued Sub
Decree 118 on State Land Management that de-concentrated land use allocation to the
provincial level, working with Commune Councils (CCs) and districts to develop a more
participatory and transparent framework for the use and management of state lands.

3.      The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) initiated the distribution of land to the
landless and land poor through Social Land Concessions (SLCs) as a key component of its
strategy to enhance the agricultural sector. In the Rectangular Strategy and National
Strategic Development Plan (2006 – 2010), RGC committed to “accord priority to the
strengthening of land tenure rights of the people who needed small lots of settlement and
family production within the social land concessions framework, as a mechanism to assist
poor households and vulnerable groups. SLCs are defined in Cambodia’s Land Law and
regulated by Sub Decree No. 19 on SLCs of March 2003. Under Sub Decree No. 19,
Government defined two types of SLCs: ‘nationally-initiated” and “locally-initiated”.
Locally-initiated SLCs were generally much smaller and primarily intended to meet the



                                             1
needs of new families and other landless and land poor people to obtain land with legal
tenure security within a commune as an alternative to illegal, anarchic settlements.
Commune Councils had primary responsibility for planning and implementing locally
initiated SLCs with support from provincial and district line agencies, as well as non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society organizations.

4.      In support of RGC’s Rectangular Strategy and National Strategic Development
Plan, the Bank committed to support the country’s SLC program by committing resources
to test mechanisms aimed at assisting poor households’ access land. The Bank was viewed
by the Government and other donor partners as uniquely positioned to support an initiative
based on the improved governance of state lands as part of poverty reduction. The World
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2005-2008, extended to 2011) fully supported
the governance reform process in a number of challenging areas such as public financial
management, trade facilitation and decentralization. Under natural resource management,
the Bank was working across broad areas of important land resource management (forestry,
protected areas and land tenure and distribution) to support enhanced mechanisms for
assessing and responding to broad land resource use concerns and tradeoffs, and
sustainable access to such resources by local communities, consistent with national and
global priorities.

5.      The Bank, along with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation – Deutsche
Gesellschaftfür Technische Zusammenarbeit (now called GIZ) – had been long-term
partners of the government in developing and implementing its land agenda. The Bank
supported the formulation of Cambodia’s overarching land policy in 2001 that provided
the basis for the Land Law (2001) and also took a lead role in supporting a national dialogue
on Cambodia’s agrarian structure to share international and domestic experiences relevant
to decisions regarding the role of small holders and large plantations in the development of
the rural economy. Given the challenges of policy reform, governance and technical
complexity, the Government requested support from the Bank and GIZ - as the two lead
donors on land policy – to facilitate the development of practical approaches to
implementation of state land distribution to the poor, working with local commune
councils. The Bank agreed to provide a grant and a credit through a Specific Investment
Loan (now IPF) over a period of five years from 2008 – 2013 and GIZ committed to
provide assistance and support to the Government, relevant technical line departments at
sub national level and commune council for technical implementation of project activities.
Separate complementary grant financing from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF)
was approved for three (3) NGOs to support implementation of SLCs 1.


1
 A total of $2,368,088 in JSDF funding was given to 3 NGOs (Wathnakpheap (WP), Life With Dignity (LWD), Localized from Lutheran
World Federation (LWD) and Habitat for Humanity International – Cambodia (HfHI-C)) to support the SLC program initiated by RGC.
The objective was to build capacity of voiceless in gaining access to land and livelihood; to test community based mechanisms and
procedures for civil society and government collaboration for land tenure security; and to pilot a rights based approach to SLC planning
and implementation for sustainable poverty reduction. The grants were implemented over a five year period in 6 sites (outside of LASED
project area). All three NGOs successfully implemented Social Land Concession (SLC) programs with direct finance from JSDF. They
built transparent and participatory mechanisms to provide the poor and landless residential and/ or agricultural land as well as basic
infrastructure to ensure sustainable livelihood. They helped respective local authorities establish and implement transparent processes
and procedures to implement SLC successfully. Implementation Completion Memorandums are available which include more detailed
information.




                                                                   2
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.      As stated in the Financing Agreement, the objective of the Project was to improve
the process for identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and
formerly landless and land poor land recipients through a transparent and well-targeted
selection process.

7.     The associated key indicators are the following:

       •   At least 60% of land recipients adopt improved soil management and
           agricultural production systems.
       •   At least 90% of land recipients selected matched the selection criteria agreed
           for those specific SLCs.
       •   At least 70% of challenges to land recipient selection were reviewed and
           decision taken through the program dispute resolution mechanism.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      The PDO was not revised. Changes to indicators are detailed in Section 1.7 “Other
Significant Changes”.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The project expected to benefit about 3000 landless and land-poor households with
land coverage of 10,000 Ha. Beneficiaries, allocated residential and/or agricultural plots,
derived direct benefits from allocated plots, site preparation assistance, settling-in packages
and other social and infrastructure services provided by the project. By project end, about
3,148 households had benefitted from project interventions and 10,273 Ha of land were
distributed to them.

10.    Secondary beneficiaries included:

       •   Farming households in surrounding areas who benefitted from improved
           services (access roads, schools and health posts) and improved marketing and
           trade in the area.
       •   Local traders who benefitted from increased production and trade.
       •   Non-land recipients residing in the SLCs who benefitted from social and
           infrastructure services.
       •   Commune Councils, district, provincial and national level staff who benefitted
           directly from training and capacity building developed through the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)




                                              3
11.        The project financed four major components as follows:

12.     Component A – Commune Based Social Land Concession Planning and Land
Allocation (US$1.5 million): The component aimed to support 20 communes (later
revised to 7) to prepare Social Land Concession Sub-project Plans, including: (i)
identification, environmental and social screening and registration of state private lands for
SLCs; (ii) soliciting application from screening and selecting eligible landless and land
poor from the commune, and; (iii) developing the SLC sub-project plan with land recipients
for submission to their respective Provincial Land Use and Allocation Committee
(PLUAC) for approval. The support included training, incremental operating costs and
equipment for the communes, as well as provision of state land mapping registration
services by Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC).

13.     Component B – Rural Development Services and Investments (US$5.7
million): The component financed implementation of 20 (later revised to 7) approved SLC
sub-project plans, including basic SLC site preparation, first year settling in assistance for
land recipient (LR) families, and second and third year rural livelihood support. Financing
was for civil works, goods, technical assistance and training. The component provided
grants to the commune councils working with LRs, to contract civil works, goods, technical
assistance and training services identified in approved SLC sub-project plans. SLCs were
to include initial priority support for the first year settling-in needs of the LRs, including
land preparation and plot demarcation, access tracks, portable water wells, household kits
with shelter materials, focused health and agricultural support. During the second and third
years of SLC sub-project implementation, LRs were to receive additional livelihood
development assistance as part of broader village support for extension and training for
agricultural and other economic activities and additional community infrastructure.

14.    Component C – Sustainable and Transparent Program Development (US$4.0
million): The component financed the development of institutional capacity at the
national, provincial and district levels to support transparent and sustainable
implementation of locally initiated SLCs in LASED project areas and nationally. Financing
covered technical assistance, salary incentives under the Merit Based Performance
Incentive (MBPI) 2, incremental operating costs, training, vehicles and goods for key
government agencies involved in supporting locally initiated SLCs. Complementary

2
  Government initiated a Merit Based Pay Initiative approach that introduced key elements of modern and efficient civil service
structure, including clear description of positions, competitive selection, annual performance reviews and limitation of salary
incentives to those provided through the MBPI system. The MBPI rates introduced a broader salary range as an incentive for
performance and promotion. The MBPI Sub Decree was signed in 2005 and piloted in the context of the Public Financial Management
Reform Program in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. In 2008, the Government issued Sub Decree 29 SE that specified pay levels
and implementation arrangements for the MBPI. Through the Government-Donor Working Group on Civil Service Reform and the
Public Financial Management Program, implementation of MBPI in different Government agencies was being monitored and
evaluated to determine its effectiveness in promoting the broader civil service reform agenda. Emerging from a conflict situation and
having to re-establish working systems, we have observed cases (for example, Afghanistan) where the absence of additional
compensation for civil servants has led to implementation road blocks because people do not have adequate incentives for taking on
additional responsibilities to their regular job functions, as was the case in Cambodia. In the context of LASED, MBPI was
introduced on a pilot basis to MLMUPC and MoI pending a broader application in the context of the development of sectoral
programs for land and decentralization. The 66 government staff who received payments through the MBPI worked at national and
sub-national level for LASED, at least for a significant share of their time. Considering that the project was implemented by 2
ministries at national level, and involved several more departments at sub-national level in 3 provinces, working at 8 project sites, 66
covered staff was considered to be a manageable number.



                                                                   4
funding for NGO involvement was sourced through JSDF to support local communities
and encourage participation, transparency and dispute resolution.

15.     At the national level, support was provided to the General Secretariat for Social
Land Concession (GSSLC) in the MLNUPC to strengthen policy development, public
information sharing, training and monitoring of SLCs with special focus on LASED project
provinces. GSSLC facilitated SLC sharing of experiences, proposed policies and
procedural changes to the National Committee for Social Land Concession and facilitated
the coordination of key public agencies, donors and NGOs at the national level. At the
provincial level, support financed capacity building of the PLUAC Secretariat and specific
line departments for their role in: i) training and public information; ii) ensuring that CCs
received technical guidance for SLC sub-project planning and implementation; and iii)
assessing SLC sub-project proposals and plans including monitoring and reporting to
GSSLC. At the district level, the District Working Group (DWG) supported and worked
closely with CCs to understand and meet requirements of SLC sub-project planning and
implementation. The DWG provided CCs with technical support to ensure consistency
with LASED SLC sub-project guidelines and facilitated reporting between CCs and
PLUAC on progress of SLC planning and implementation.

16.    Component D – Project Administration (US$1.8 million): The component
financed capacity strengthening for project implementation support including
procurement, financial management and donor-specific reporting. Financing was for
technical assistance, training, incremental operating costs, vehicles and goods. At the
national level, the component supported strengthening of the National Committee for the
Management of Decentralization and Deconcentration (NCDD) Secretariat (now called
National Committee for Sub-national Democratic Development Secretariat) in contract
administration, financial management, procurement oversight and coordination with the
Independent Procurement Agent 3 and reporting. At the provincial level, Provincial Rural
Development Committees (PDRC) were strengthened in the areas of financial
management, procurement, contract administration and technical support units.

1.6 Revised Components

17.       No revisions were made to project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.     A number of changes were instituted during project implementation that were
reflected in four Level 2 restructurings as follows:

          •     In 2010, Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) canceled the MBPI, Priority
                Mission Group (PMG) and other salary supplements and incentive schemes in


3
 In December 2007, an Independent Procurement Agent (IPA) was recruited by the Government to carry out procurement under all
Bank-financed projects in Cambodia, following instances of fraud and corruption identified in other projects in the portfolio.




                                                               5
                   response to the global economic and financial crisis and to address imbalances
                   in civil service pay. This was later replaced by the Priority Operating Costs
                   (POC) in January 2012, which was a temporary scheme meant to address the
                   short term issue of service delivery and reform implementation. The changes
                   were not unique to the project and were applied to the entire country portfolio.
              •    In 2012, a revision was made to the target number of communes to be covered
                   (20) by the project as the communes already covered were much bigger in terms
                   of area coverage and land recipients than originally estimated. At the design
                   phase, it was assumed that LASED-SLC sites would be of smaller area and
                   coverage. As the project resources could only cover the existing seven
                   communes, the Government proposed a revision to the indicator to read as
                   “seven (7) communes submit approved LASED-SLC plans”. Another
                   intermediate indicator 4 was transferred to a different component more relevant
                   to activities undertaken and a core sector indicator 5 was introduced as part of
                   key outcome indicators
              •    In 2013, the project closing date was extended by one year from June 30, 2013
                   to June 30, 2014 and grant proceeds partially reallocated to enable full
                   completion of remaining rural infrastructure contracts in the final sites and to
                   cover costs of the infrastructure investments for the various project sites
              •    In 2014, a nine-month project extension up to March 31, 2015 was approved
                   along with reallocation of grant proceeds to allow continuation and completion
                   of planning for rural infrastructure contracts in last project sites and for
                   anticipated project locations of the next phase. The extension was meant to
                   accommodate and support preparatory work for the follow on-operation.

19.    Furthermore, the Provincial Rural Development Committee-Executive Committee
(PRDC-ExCom) - a part of the provincial organizational structure - was replaced by the
Provincial Administration in 2011. This change did not affect project implementation and
management as the same personnel were involved in the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The project was the main source of financing for pilot activities to identify and test
practical and efficient mechanisms of identification and use of state lands that could be
applied more broadly in the SLC program. The design was well aligned with the country’s
Land Law (especially the sub decrees on SLC and state land management), the Rectangular
Strategy, and the National Strategic Development Plan.

21.    The PDO was kept simple and process-oriented to align the project’s approach with
the Government’s overall strategy. Indicators were simple and measurable. The complexity

    “Women’s Participation in training, workshops and as applicants (head of households or cosignatory)”

5
    “Target land area with use or ownership rights recorded as a result of the project”




                                                                      6
and risks associated with land distribution were recognized from the onset and strongly
influenced the modest approach taken at project start with expectations to eventually scale
up activities gradually based on experiences and institutional capacities. It was anticipated
that a demonstration of effective implementation of mechanisms could strengthen political
will to prioritize suitable state land allocation for distribution to the poor. The choice of a
specific investment loan (now IPF) was appropriate for the project.

22.     Initiated in 2004, the formal preparation of LASED was interrupted from 2005 –
2007 because government disengaged while mis-procurement problems which led to the
suspension of another project (Land Management and Administration Project, LMAP)
implemented by MLMUPC were resolved. The preparation process was completed in 2008
and drew from: (a) results of the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) which was
conducted by the Government in collaboration with the Bank, GIZ and Oxfam GB; and (b)
domestic and international experiences, including study tours to Malaysia and the
Philippines. Several alternatives were considered at the design stage but the general
consensus was for the development of a locally-initiated SLC approach that could lend
itself to working within existing institutional systems where transparency and
accountability mechanisms could be reasonably integrated and made more responsive to
beneficiary priorities. To minimize Government implementation complexities and capacity
constraint risks, the project identified a limited set of critical services that could be provided
directly by RGC in conjunction with an International Procurement Agent with contracts
for most support services being handled by communes based on existing administrative
and technical support arrangements in the country.

23.     Risks and mitigation measures: Critical risks identified at appraisal were related
to forestry, land issues and management of fiduciary issues. Based on domestic and
international experiences, the project developed a number of key framework documents
that identified critical issues and outlined approaches and mitigation measures to be taken.
The project also drew from the implementation experience of the broader portfolio in
Cambodia to strengthen the integrity of the Government service delivery aspects of the
program that included: (i) utilizing the Independent Procurement Agent for all Government
procurement; (ii) ensuring the opportunity and resources for civil society participation in
all aspects of project implementation from the outset; and (iii) strengthening accounting
for operating cost expenditures and ensuring frequent process monitoring to identify
“symptoms” of possible irregularities in the delivery of services to beneficiaries. To that
effect, the project prepared the following documents: (i) Good Governance Framework
(GGF) that paid close attention to fiduciary risks; (ii) Civic Engagement Framework, which
broadened participation for civil society support in the procedures for information
dissemination and clarification, including dispute resolution mechanisms, and (iii)
Strategic Communications Program meant to contribute to an accurate understanding of
the project and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. Furthermore, safeguards
documents, financial management and procurement assessments all identified potential
risks along with associated mitigation measures.

24.   Adequacy of participatory process: The preparation process for the project was
conducted in a highly participatory manner. The Government assembled a multisectoral



                                                7
team of stakeholders who would play a critical role in the implementation stage of the
project. The National Project Preparation Team (NPPT) working under Cambodia’s
Council for land policy led the preparation of the project for government. NPPT was
housed in MLMUPC and comprised of representatives from MLMUPC, MoI, Ministry of
Rural Development (MRD), Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and
Ministry of Commerce. GIZ also provided technical support to NPPT for the preparation
process. At design, extensive consultations were held with beneficiaries, local
communities, NGOs, large landholders, researchers, local and national officials, donors
and technical specialists to discuss land distribution issues affecting the poor. The
Government was extremely committed to working with the Bank and GIZ based on the
latter’s collective experience in supporting the country’s policy development for land use
and administration. Particularly, the Government had expressed strong interest in
improving its land allocation procedures and requested the Bank to directly support the
entire SLC process so as to develop a transparent and participatory delivery model for the
allocation of SLCs.

2.2 Implementation

25.      Implementation of project activities was carried out through existing government
structures with additional project support to build systems, procedures and capacity. The
institutional framework was quite complex. The management and coordination structures
required mechanisms to organize and coordinate the implementation of multiple inputs
across a wide range of disciplines involving many departments from national to sub-
national level (see attached graph in Annex 10). Given that the SLC process was new to
many and the level of coordination and collaboration required was equally unfamiliar to
most, the expectations of meeting set targets in the early years may have been overly
ambitious. Many of the implementation challenges occurred during the first two years of
the implementation period and contributed to a much slower start to activities than planned.

26.     Procurement was a major part of implementation of the project as almost all of the
rural development services and investments financed under the second component were
infrastructure contracts. It took almost two years from project initiation before procurement
was fully operational, in part, due to delays in recruitment of the technical assistance
required to support preparation of designs, specifications and estimates. There were also
initial delays in procurement with the Independent Procurement Agent mainly due to
coordination challenges between the Government and IPA.

27.     The implementation of the rural development services and investments component
not only required timely procurement of competent contractors but also needed to ensure
that different investments were properly sequenced and avoided seasonal delays. The level
of multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination was something that the staff in
provincial administrations – who were the focus of this work – were not accustomed to.

28.    The Government’s decision to discontinue the Merit Based Performance Incentive
in 2010 did affect project momentum as the scheme to replace it – the Priority Operating
Costs- only came into effect a year later (2011) and did not run for the full duration of the



                                             8
project (up to 2013). Instead, per diem payments were used to remove disincentives for
government staff to visit the field and support the project.

29.    The world financial and economic downturn that began in 2008 not only impacted
the Government’s decision to discontinue MBPI but also affected the project budget. The
budget envelope was reduced by $800,000 due to exchange rate fluctuations between the
dollar and SDR. The loss required adjustments to scale back planned activities and
implement them within the available resources.

30.     The identification, classification and registration of land for SLCs was a
challenging undertaking for those involved in the process. The design stage had anticipated
that SLC lands would be sourced from 3 main sources (canceled economic land
concessions, recovered illegally occupied lands and degraded forest lands), however,
implementation experience showed that much of the land that did eventually come under
the SLC was largely from degraded forests (96.5%) and the rest came from recovered
illegally occupied lands (5.5%). There were challenges in understanding what exactly
qualified as ‘degraded forests’ which caused some SLC proposals to be rejected by the
Forest Administration (FA) – under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries -
which was the deciding authority on degraded forests. Commune Councils, which oversaw
the identification and registration processes, did not involve the FA early enough in the
process to potentially address such issues as this could have minimized resultant delays.

31.     The presence of Unexploded Ordinances (UXOs) in one of the registered sites in
Memot District (administered with MoI as Sreleu Senchey village/site) also contributed to
implementation delays as it required recruitment of a demining agency, Cambodia Mine
Action Center (CMAC) to clear lands for settlement. The removal of UXOs in the LASED
– SLC site was completed in May 2011 (under a 9-months contract). Upon completion of
UXO clearing activities, CMAC certified that the site was safe for habitation and the land
recipients immediately established their houses and started cultivating the agricultural land
awarded to them. The unexpected expenditures related to contracting CMAC had to be
accommodated in the budget envelope which necessitated some adjustments to other
planned activities. Although the SLC was already registered, land recipients could not
move immediately as planned, which contributed to the delayed initiation of livelihood
activities.

32.      Between 2009 and 2011, Cambodia was also adversely affected by a series of
natural disasters in the form of floods, drought and storm surges. Flooding in some SLC
sites in Kratie and Memot caused extensive damage to mostly cassava farm lands owned
by LRs that caused a food security crisis as beneficiary investments were wiped out. With
little to no savings, affected families became vulnerable to food insecurity. The loss in
potential earnings from agricultural production was also a setback for livelihood
development at the affected sites.

33.    Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPBs) were based on commune-based SLC
plans, with coordination and consolidation at the provincial level. They were then
consolidated at national level for approval and incorporated into provincial and Commune



                                             9
Investment Plans. Project funding was also delayed by capacity constraints that affected
the timely preparation and approval of AWPBs. GIZ played a critical role in filling the
resources gap by supplying cash for work, access roads and agricultural inputs to alleviate
the effects of delay in release of IDA funding caused by delayed approvals.

34.    At the time of the Mid-Term Review in 2011, five SLCs were registered and an
additional two sites were in the final stages of the registration process. A close review of
the above-mentioned implementation challenges was undertaken in addition to the
following:

       •   Reassessment of project scope and number of communes given that area already
           registered under the five communes represented about 70% of the target
           coverage and 40% of targeted land recipients. The project had to determine a
           realistic number of communes that could be effectively covered within the time
           and resource constraints available to the project
       •   Assessment of the impact of the institutional changes (Provincial
           Administration or PA) on overall project management and implementation at
           the sub-national level including absorptive capacity and priority technical
           assistance/training required
       •   Reassessment of project investment policies and guidelines given that some of
           the priority needs of land recipients were not limited to SLC/LASED sites but
           also required some access tracks for connection to the nearest roads

35.    The project was restructured as documented in Section 1.7 to adjust original
expectations to the ground realities. As confidence levels were gained in implementation,
with SLC plans approved, and as procurement and other project systems became
operational, the latter part of the implementation period focused on procurement and
implementation of the site investments alongside development services to implement the
plans and settle landless and land-poor families. Towards project end, implementation
focus shifted to completion of remaining activities and consolidation. The adjustments,
subsequent actions and reassessment of risks led to significant improvements in
implementation that resulted in substantial achievement of key indicators and satisfactory
achievement of the PDO ratings.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     M&E design. The project had established a monitoring system to track results
framework indicators along some additional SLC implementation and development related
indicators. The nature of the project and its design were such that the majority of indicators
were quantitative and relatively easy to collect and measure. Two of the outcome indicators
included in the design were linked to measuring success of processes used. By midterm,
it was clear that the process had been mostly worked out, and the focus turned to ensuring
impact and sustainability, so the baseline survey and beneficiary livelihood surveys were
conducted.




                                             10
37.     M&E implementation. Progress in settlement and development of plots was
assessed directly at the Commune level. Data was entered into an excel spreadsheet
database at the provincial level and compiled at the national level. Data was collected by
sub-national/provincial teams for preparation of quarterly reports and aggregated at the
national level on a quarterly basis. The national team verified figures and data with
provincial teams and updated the M&E database on a quarterly basis. Establishment of the
system and spreadsheet database only became fully operational at the later stages of the
project when an international consultant was recruited to develop a more comprehensive
system and manual. Once established, the monitoring system and excel database were able
to adequately capture the development performance of the project through the quantitative
results framework indicators as well as additional SLC related indicators identified.

38.     The baseline survey for the project was only completed in January 2011, two and a
half years after project effectiveness, and a Mid-term Review in May 2011.The project
carried out small (limited coverage) annual land recipient beneficiary livelihood surveys to
assess different aspects of impact, including production, income, access to market, etc. The
GIZ team carried out annual food security surveys using Household Food Insecurity
Access Scale (HFIAS) and Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) methods to assess
food security in LASED SLCs and control villages. This was in part to support their
technical assistance efforts on land use and management planning.

39.      The project, with support from the World Bank and GIZ, held workshops to assess
lessons learned and produced documentation such as the “LASED Annual Lessons Learnt
Workshop (2011)” and the “LASED Lessons Learnt and Experiences Workshop (2012)”
listed in Annex 9. Surveys conducted such as the “LASED Limited Beneficiary
Assessment Report (2014)” used randomized controls and drew from the baseline survey.
Overall, the surveys and case studies provided adequate information to assess project
results. The various surveys and assessments carried out were considered by the ICR to be
adequate for providing evidence on project results—although they could have been better
coordinated—and obviated the need for the Impact Evaluation that was originally planned
in the PAD.

40.     M&E utilization. The quarterly reports generated from data collection were used
for decision-making and evaluation purposes. The required quarterly, bi-annual and annual
reports were generated using data from the M&E system. The project generated livelihood
surveys used data drawn from the M&E system. M&E data was also used as a basis for the
preparation of the project’s annual work plans and budgets (AWPB). The ability of the
reporting to capture and explain depth of change and progress with appropriate supporting
analysis was fairly limited and could have been improved, particularly with regard to
performance of individual beneficiaries and in terms of the use of the land allocated for
productive assets.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41.    The project triggered six (6) safeguard policies. These included environmental
assessment, natural habitats, forests, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples and



                                            11
physical cultural resources. The project was classified as Environmental Category B, based
on its potential for limited and small scale impacts from development of land and
agricultural use.

42.     Environmental Safeguards. The project complied with environmental safeguard
procedures and guidelines (Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01; Natural Habitats
OP/BP 4.04; and Forests (OP/BP 4.36). Environmental assessment and the application of
safeguards principles (including mitigation and monitoring) were integrated into SLC
planning. The early adoption of participatory land use planning was effective in ensuring
that proposed project sites were sourced from degraded forests and in delineating
remaining forests within the sites. There was no conversion of community forests, water
bodies or common green areas for residential and agricultural uses. These were delineated
in coordination with the Forestry Administration, relevant line departments, land recipients
and Commune Councils. Provincial LASED working groups were expanded to include
Forest Administration, Environment, Water Resources and Meteorology, Rural
Development, and Women Affairs to ensure that environmental issues were considered and
screened at the commune and provincial planning levels. Environmental impacts from land
site and infrastructure development activities were negligible with mitigation measures
factored into Environment Assessment and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) in
both design and contracts. Delineated community forestry areas were also well maintained
by beneficiaries.

43.     Social Safeguards. The project triggered Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12),
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10), and Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11)
safeguards. The project was implemented in line with all safeguard policies and their
associated policy frameworks and guidelines. The social safeguard screening conducted
during SLC land planning process confirmed that no land taking was required for the
establishment of SLC sites. A small proportion of land (5.5%) initially identified for
potential inclusion in the project SLC sites was from recovered illegally occupied lands.
Given that the legal status of existing land occupants was usually unknown and took time
to verify whether they occupied lands formally or informally, it was agreed that land in this
category would not be included as potential SLC land under the project. Rather, after
surveying such pieces of land, the existing land-users would remain but not as part of the
potential SLC lands.

44.     Provincial “hotspots” maps were prepared to identify areas with environmental
importance, UXO, Economic Land Concessions, indigenous peoples or cultural sites, so
that these could be avoided in the selection of possible SLC sites. The potential for
involuntary resettlement issues with existing families on the identified SLC sites was
mitigated through provision of three options: (1) give up land and accept a SLC plot
through the “lucky draw” procedure, (2) accept some adjustments of their existing plots to
fit the SLC plan and become eligible for title and other SLC services, or (3) not join the
SLC, in which case their existing land would be excluded from the SLC. Lands still
occupied or used by encroachers were excluded from the registered sites. However,
encroachers were not excluded from utilizing the public services provided in the project




                                             12
sites including access to schools and health posts. The cut-off date mechanism 6 provided
a fair and transparent way to avoid further encroachment. Issues that were encountered
were addressed through negotiation with local and provincial authorities. The selection of
beneficiaries was conducted in a transparent manner and they were adequately informed of
their rights and responsibilities associated with moving to the sites. Guidelines related to
avoidance of land predominantly occupied by indigenous people (IP) population were
complied with. Selection criteria included multiple objective criteria against which
potential eligible applicants were assessed which protected all groups, including IPs,
against discrimination in the selection process and allowed them to access project benefits.

45.     Fiduciary Compliance. The financial performance rating of the Project was
moderately satisfactory during the course of project implementation. All audit opinions on
the audited annual financial statements of NCDD and GSSLC were unqualified (clean)
during the project period; however, there were general delays in the submission of some
reports. The project prepared quarterly IFRs although submission of reports was generally
delayed due to time taken to consolidate technical aspects in the report. Some control
weaknesses were identified and appropriate actions were taken to address them. The high
turnover of FM consultants and counterpart staff during project implementation presented
major challenges. Financial management consultants were engaged to support and build
capacity of the counterpart staff and while this improved financial management
performance, more was required to effectively transfer critical FM skills and systematically
build up capacity of project staff.

46.     Procurement Arrangements. All procurement was carried out in accordance with
provisions of the Bank’s Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.
The sub-national level procurement followed the Commune/Sangkat Fund Project
Implementation Manual and the Guidelines on Commune/Sangkat Procurement while the
procurement process for national level procurement (National Competitive Bidding)
followed the Government’s Standard Operating Procedure and Procurement Manual for
Externally Assisted Projects/Programs in Cambodia. These procedures and manuals were
acceptable to IDA and broadly consistent with the provisions of Section I of the Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits applicable to LASED Project.
Consistent with the strict procurement approach in place at the time for all projects in the
Cambodia portfolio, it was agreed in the case of LASED to allow NCDDS to take care of
only procurement through the direct contracting method, procurement from UN agencies,
and single source and sole source selection, and to allow the Communes to carry out only
small packages (under $40,000 for civil works and $20,000 for goods) under Component
II of the project, while the rest of packages were to be procured through the Independent

6
 The Cut-off date – public knowledge of plans to establish an area for SLC has been found to trigger accelerated encroachments and
squatting beyond what may already exist in the area. An early cut-off date for eligibility regarding entitlements for compensation for
loss of assets within an SLC areas is therefore required (the date of the government declaration of the areas as an adjudication areas).
The cut-off-date is defined as the date two months prior to the first public information meetings on the SLC with the Commune
Council and the Commune population. The CC will use existing records on residence and land use within the Commune to provide a
baseline on authorized occupation within proposed SLC areas. This information will be verified by the CC and PLUAC, and through a
public meeting during the SLC planning process.




                                                                  13
Procurement Agent. There were coordination challenges between the Government and IPA
that led to procurement delays in the first year. The absence of a technical advisor and high
turnover of procurement staff at NCDDS also contributed to delays as there was no
technical expertise to provide inputs for infrastructure procurement. Procurement progress
improved significantly following the recruitment of national and international consultants
who also supported the training of procurement staff at the sub-national level. Post-reviews
were carried out throughout project implementation and procedures were generally found
to be in line with the Bank’s procurement guidelines with no cases of mis-procurement
identified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.     In terms of sustainability, the expectations placed on SLC programs go beyond land
allocation and obligate programs to meet infrastructure needs and deliver necessary support
service requirements to enable land recipients to derive benefits from land allocated. Based
on lessons that have emerged from implementation (see Section 6), a follow-up proposed
project is being prepared (LASED-II) which is proposed to focus on consolidation and
enhancement of livelihood opportunities for land recipients in the existing sites as these
activities came much later than originally planned and require incubation for long-term
sustainability. It is envisaged that the proposed project would address the remaining
priority needs of beneficiaries by providing land recipients a package of agricultural
services and infrastructure support to make their lands productive and sustainable. In
addition, the proposed project is expected to provide support to eligible land recipients to
apply for issuance of full land titles.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.     Relevance of Objective: The relevance of the project’s objective remains high. The
project financed pilot activities to test processes and develop systems, tools, procedures
and capacities for the implementation of Sub Decree No. 19 on SLCs supported by the
Land Policy 2009. The project is fully in line with the government policies and poverty
reduction objectives laid out in the National Strategic Development Plan (2009 -2013; and
2014-2018) and the 3rd and 4th Rectangular Strategy documents, in which government
committed to “accord priority to the strengthening of land tenure rights of the people who
need small lots for settlement and family production within the SLC framework, as a
mechanism to assist poor households and vulnerable groups”. These policies stress the
importance of distributing and using state lands for private and public purposes in a
transparent and equitable manner that responds to the needs of the population. The project
was also aligned with the Bank’s 2005 Country Assistance Strategy 7 goal of improved
broad-based rural growth based on enhanced management of natural resources.



7
    The 2005 Country Assistance Strategy, which was extended to 2011, was the last one completed.




                                                                 14
49.     Relevance of Design and Implementation: The relevance of design and
implementation arrangements is rated substantial. The project set out to pilot and test
processes that could be integrated into a broader government program and included a clear
statement of objectives that was to be achieved through four main components. The first
component included activities that were relevant to achieving the improved process of
identification and use of state lands objective. The component provided technical support
for the preparation of SLC sub-project plans with land recipients and financed approved
plans that directly impacted on the objective of improving the use of state lands. The
component also supported the registration of state lands and recipient selection processes
that allowed the project to better understand the key constraints faced in implementing
these procedures and identifying measures to address bottlenecks. This also contributed to
improving the identification process as set out in the objectives. In addition, the selection
of eligible beneficiaries fed into validating the transparency and targeting processes used.

50.      The link between the second component and the objective was also clear. By
supporting eligible households to receive support packages as agreed in the SLC plans,
opportunities were being created for land recipients to invest more time and resources on
productive assets, and to receive training on improved soil management practices. The
provision of public infrastructure and other services such as roads, schools, latrines, small
irrigation and open wells contributed to enhancing community livelihoods. Overall, there
was a strong link to improving the use of state lands

51.      The third component was meant to strengthen capacity of implementing staff to
undertake the SLC process. The component facilitated learning and experience sharing
from selected activities that had been initiated under the component by providing technical
facilitation to broaden options for SLC sources in order to test the institutional strength and
identify areas of weakness that required attention. The added incentive of MPBI served to
ensure that staff were sufficiently motivated to carry out assigned tasks and make the
necessary adjustments when required. These interventions, along with the administrative
interventions of the fourth component, were expected to strengthen the institutional
capacity for government staff to carry out these processes. Therefore, they did contribute
to the overall objective.

52.   Rating: Given the above considerations, relevance of objective, design and
implementation is rated as Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.    Rating: Substantial

54.     LASED’s systems, procedures and processes worked well enough to meet the
development outcomes envisaged in the project. The project financed pilot activities to test
processes in the implementation of social land concession programs, which successfully
identified, surveyed, screened, mapped, accepted and met the project target of registering
7 SLCs as public state lands for social land concessions. The combined land coverage of
the SLCs (10,273 ha) and land recipients (3,148) exceeded project targets of covering



                                              15
10,000 ha of land and 3,000 land beneficiaries respectively. The guidelines set out in the
Project Implementation Manual for participatory and transparent preparation were fully
adopted by all SLCs as they were able to prepare and submit approved SLC plans for land
use. All land recipients selected matched the selection criteria set out in the SLCs and all
complaints related to the selection process were reviewed and resolved through established
complaints handling channels. With regard to improvements in land use, in addition to
meeting the targets for provision of settling in support for land recipients, the project
successfully provided key infrastructure services as well as agricultural training through an
agricultural extension package. Access to these services enabled almost 60% of LRs to
engage in agricultural production using improved technologies and practices. The
interventions led to notable improvements in food security as noted in the GIZ Food
Security Survey and also improved income generated from agricultural activities (refer to
paragraph 55 and footnote 9 and 10). Overall, three out of the four PDO level indicators
were fully achieved and targets exceeded, while one outcome indicator target was
substantially achieved. The key project achievements are summarized below (and detailed
outputs by component are presented in Annex 2).

55.     Adoption of improved soil management practices and agricultural production
systems through technology demonstrations and access to technical services contributed
to increasing average household incomes and reduced food insecurity for LRs: The
project successfully allocated both residential and agricultural plots to 3,148 8 eligible land
recipients out of which 3,074 LRs received SLC agricultural plots. While there were
challenges faced in moving to allocated plots, 57% of LRs (PDO -1: Target of 60%
substantially achieved) that received agricultural plots, particularly in the older SLCs, had
engaged in agricultural practices that involved inter/mixed cropping of cash crops with
rubber, fruit trees and other permanent crops; introduction of permanent of permanent
crops and improved management practices of water techniques through retention and
drainage. A LASED Livelihood survey 9 showed that the majority of interviewed land
recipient households grew rice and cassava, and invested an average $176 for agricultural
cultivation that earned them $394 as average net on-farm income. This represented a 55%
increase in on-farm income when compared to $255 found by the baseline survey in 2010.
Food insecurity had also significantly declined over a four year period according the 2014
annual GIZ Food Security Survey 10 carried out in 4 LASED sites (Kratie Round 1: from

8
    Intermediate Indicator 4: Target of 3000 was exceeded.

9
  A small livelihood survey was conducted by an independent consultant, on behalf of the LASED project in September 2014 that aimed
to review the use of agricultural and residential land as well as off-farm activities of land recipients in four Social Land Concession sites
of LASED. Interviews were conducted and data collected from 267 randomly selected households from LASED sites and it found that
the majority of interviewed land recipient households grew rice and cassava, and invested an average $176 for agricultural cultivation
that earned them $394 as average net on-farm income. As most LRs started farming own land for the first time and with little or no prior
farm management experience, many LRs continued to engage in off-farm activities to supplement their incomes. The survey showed
that earnings from off-farm incomes were more significant (up to $1506) and combined for an average household income of $1901,
which was 61% higher when compared to $1,176 found by the baseline survey in 2010. Further, an independent Food Security Survey,
funded annually by GIZ as part of its technical assistance to the project, showed that in Kampong Cham SLC where the main crop was
cassava, land recipient households earned a net income from $1250 - $1400 per Ha. In Kratie SLC, net earnings from cassava per
household were between $997 -$1150 per Ha and $375 - $450 per Ha for rice. In both surveys, net incomes did vary across different
SLCs based on the size of agricultural land use, quality of land preparation, soil quality and extent to which proper management
techniques/technologies were adopted.

10
 With regard to food security, the 2014 GIZ-funded Food Security Survey carried out in four LASED sites showed that the percentage
of household food security had improved dramatically due to among other factors, increased use of agricultural plots, less droughts and



                                                                    16
96% in 2010 to 36% in 2014; Kratie Round 2: from 95% in 2012 to 30% in 2014; Tbong
Khmum (formerly part of Kampong Cham): from 100% in 2010 to 34% in 2014; and
Kampong Thom: from 98% in 2012 to 32% in 2014)

56.     The project built strong collaboration with various line departments that supported
LRs on adaptation and adoption of technologies, especially agricultural technologies that
aimed to improve soil fertility and increase income generation. Demonstration sites were
set up in each commune to transfer relevant and appropriate techniques of improving soil
management and agricultural production system. The project delivered 530 courses of
agricultural management courses in livestock and crop production and demonstrated seven
(7) technologies (PDO -4: Target of 1 was exceeded). A total of 18,936 participants (53%
women) were trained in chicken raising, pig raising, compost making, rice production, fruit
tree management, home gardening and vegetable production. Improved management
methods and adoption of technologies. A livelihood survey undertaken on behalf of
LASED in 2014, found that 80% of land recipients had adopted and implemented skills
and techniques of modern agricultural and business techniques on their farm activities to
improve soil fertility and agricultural production.

57.      The selection process developed by the pilot was successful in effectively targeting
landless and land poor eligible recipients to receive land and led to replication of
procedures in other government programs for land allocation. The project was effective
in utilizing transparent mechanisms and participatory selection processes that involved “ID
Poor System” and worked with NGOs supported through JSDF funding to optimize the
transparency process by collaborating in public information dissemination and providing
oversight in the selection process. Critical attention was paid to awareness raising and
explanation of process and criteria for land recipients to understand proper implementation
of procedures and required actions. The selection process was so effective that all LRs
(100%) selected for the SLC program met the eligibility criteria to receive land (PDO-
Indicator 2: 90% target was exceeded).

58.     The processes described in the Government guidelines were based on and adjusted
following experiences in LASED communities. In addition to implementing the LASED
project, the project team at the national level in the Ministry of Land Management Urban
Planning and Construction were implementing Social Land Concession Projects for former
armed forces where knowledge and experience gained from training and implementation
of LASED project led to adoption of procedures in other SLC programs. The land
identification process followed steps similar to LASED safeguard procedures of
participatory land screening, preservation of protected areas and cut off of existing lands
used by people. In the land planning process, the mapping process followed in LASED was

floods and supplementary food safety net through GIZ sponsored Rice Banks. The survey sampled a total of 655 randomly selected SLC
households and 230 households randomly selected from control villages. The survey found that SLC households facing food shortages
decreased dramatically in each of the surveyed sites. The survey also noted that around 30% of LASED SLC households still faced food
shortages compared to 45% of households in the control groups. The agricultural production systems of most households, while
improved, remained fragile and required more support to develop stability and resilience.

distribution of land to land recipients used the lottery selection process as in the LASED
project. This demonstrates the learning and shift in mindset that has taken place. The
government has recognized the significant and potential contribution of SLCs to poverty
reduction and is committed to scaling up the program.

59.     Conflict resolution mechanism effectively addressed disputes related to selection
criteria. The Complaint Handling Mechanisms established as part of project
implementation was effective, particularly in addressing complaints received during the
land recipient selection process. The project received 687 complaints during the land
recipient selection process that were jointly reviewed by commune councils and NGOs.
All 678 complaints were reviewed and screened against the selection criteria and scoring
system. About 44% (297) of complaints were found to be from non-eligible households or
unrelated to the process. Remaining 56% (381) of complaints were re-assessed and scores
adjusted accordingly. About 207 of the aggrieved applicants increased their scores
sufficiently to be successfully allocated land. Remaining applicants remained on the
waitlist for the next consideration of plots. End results of the reassessment process were
made public for further public discussion and acceptance. The process complied with
guidelines and principles laid out in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) and
decisions taken were relayed to complainants in a timely manner. The involvement of
NGOs in the review process enhanced trust between Commune Councils and communities
and increased transparency in the procedures set up. All the complaints received (100%)
were addressed and decisions reportedly accepted by complainants (PDO –Indicator 3:
Target of 90% was exceeded)

60.      Provision of infrastructure support services along with settling-in support for
land recipients contributed to increased agricultural production as well as expenditure
savings from improved road access. By project end, a total of about 215 km of road had
been constructed that included 71km of clearing access tracks, approximately 123km of
earth roads and 21km of laterite roads. LRs reported that the road investments had
facilitated transport of their agricultural products to the markets and improved mobility and
access to services, facilities and opportunities outside the SLC sites. The 2014 livelihood
survey also interviewed 20 households randomly selected from land recipients in Tipo 1
SLC, Kampong Thom province where new roads had been constructed. Indications were
that travel time reduced from 96 minutes to 39 minutes for travel outside the commune,
which also resulted in transportation savings of about $3.27. The project also constructed
7 primary schools in the 7 communes where a total of 983 students have been enrolled with
30% attending from nearby villages. All three health posts planned under the project were
constructed and were providing services to SLC members and surrounding communities.

61.     At the time of ICR, a number of support packages and capacity building services
had been provided to LRs that had settled in the SLC sites: (i) 1,225,944 kg of rice was
distributed as part of the food for work program; (ii) 2,490 residential starter kits and 3,074
agricultural starter kits were distributed along with 2,226 housing construction materials,
2,687 latrine materials and other plating and livestock inputs such as seeds, seedlings,
chickens and demarcation poles. All eligible households (100%) that settled in the SLC



                                              18
sites received support packages 11. Based on the 2014 livelihood survey, a comparison
between rice yields of households that used local rice variety and land recipients that used
improved varieties distributed by the project found significant differences in harvest yields.
Whereas the local variety provided 800-900kg of paddy rice yield, the improved variety
yielded up to 1500kg of paddy rice per hectare of rice field.

3.3 Efficiency

62.           Rating: Substantial

63.     Methodology: Financial and Economic Analysis (FEA) 12 for the ICR of the project
was carried out for model households of the Land Recipients (LRs) and for the project as
a whole. The analysis covered the without-project option 13, the with-project option, and
the project’s incremental effect. The incremental effect is the net effect the with-project
option has over the without-project option, which assumes that investments would have
been financed by the Government itself, as was done elsewhere in Cambodia. Data for the
ICR’s FEA were based on the project’s records and gathered from field visits to five (5)
project sites, and telephone interviews of beneficiary households’ representatives at two
other sites. The discount rate used was 14 per cent 14 and the period for analysis was 20
years. More details on the methodology and assumptions are provided in Annex 3.

64.     Overall, the ICR’s FEA results were different from those of the PAD due to
significant differences between (a) economic conditions at appraisal and during the
project’s implementation stages relating to prices, wages, and market opportunities for
Cambodia’s agricultural produce; and (b) the PAD’s assumptions and actual delivery and
conditions of the project concerning the number of project sites, the number of model
households 15, the surface areas of agricultural land, the start-up year of agricultural land
use, the trend and pattern of agricultural land use, start-up support costs for LRs, and
income of off-farm labor and livestock. The PAD did not look at any qualitative benefits
of the project. It did not present financial analyses. For economic analysis, it presented
only the EIRR.


11
     Intermediate Indicator-6: Target of 100% fully achieved.

12
  In the FEA, all three key measures, NPV, BCR and IRR, were analyzed, but only IRR are presented in this section for the sake of
space and simplicity.

13
   The without the project option (i.e., without the Bank’s investment) means that investment by Government would have been made
too as evidenced by SLC projects carried out by the Government per se at other locations/sites. However, investments by the
Government and by the Bank have some differences. The Government focused solely on hard infrastructure (land allocation) while the
Bank’s focus was on both hardware and software (land allocation and associated services). The software aspects include, for example,
processes, procedures, agricultural services, etc. Although the Government invested in hardware infrastructure at its SLC sites, the
investment was very limited.

14
     The 14 per cent discount rate was chosen to match with that used in the project appraisal.

15
   The Project was actually implemented at eight (08) sites in three (03) provinces and had 24 model households receiving varied sizes
of agricultural land, but PAD looked at only two (02) sample provinces, two sample sites and four model households with equal
agricultural land size.



                                                                    19
65.     Non-quantifiable benefits: Generally, the project generated qualitative benefits
rather than costs. The non-quantifiable benefits produced by the project included (a)
improved governance in land allocation and management, (b) community solidarity and
mutual assistance, (c) sustainable land use practices, and (d) decrease/prevention of
out/overseas migration for risky jobs.

66.     FEA of model households: All financial measures for all types of model
households fared better in the with-project case when compared to those in the without-
project case. The incremental effect of the project was significant. In the with-project
case, FIRR was 29.24-113.93 percent. The incremental FIRR was 34.35-139.77 percent.

67.     Values of the with-project EIRR were far below the PAD’s for model households.
This was because the start-up costs for LR households was much higher than the PAD’s
estimate and LR households at most project sites received less than the 3 ha of agricultural
land assumed in the PAD, regardless of household size. The EIRR for model households
in the PAD was 16.30-21.10 percent. The EIRR for model households of the actual project
was 7.03-13.79 percent. However, the incremental effect was much better with the
incremental EIRR at 16.4-40.27 percent.

68.     Economic analysis of whole Project model 16: For the whole project model, land
use trends and patterns at all sites were accounted for, which required that the analysis be
done for two time-periods. The first was for a 20 year-period (2008-2027) beginning from
the start of the project, and the second was for a 30-year period (2008-2037). The latter
was to account for sites added at the later stages. The economic performance of the with-
project option was better than that of the without-project option, and the incremental effect
was substantial. The with-project EIRR was 13.66-16.96 percent, and the incremental
EIRR was 32.3533.33 per cent. 17

69.     Sensitivity Analysis: Three key variables—produce prices, yields, and production
costs (including wages)—were used to test the sensitivity of the results of the economic
analysis to changes in assumptions. The FIRR in the with-project scenario was very
sensitive to changes in prices and yields, while in the incremental analysis it was very
sensitive to costs and yields. For example, when produce prices declined by 10 percent,
the FIRR decreased by 15 percent. When costs rose by 10 percent, the incremental FIRR
decreased by 15 percent. The EIRR of the project was very sensitive to changes in prices
and yields, in that order. For example, when produce prices decreased by 10 percent, the
EIRR declined by 20-30 percent. However, the order was reversed for the incremental
EIRR, which was very sensitive to changes in yields and prices. For example, when yields
were down by 10 percent, the incremental EIRR declined by 16-17 percent.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

16
     PAD’s overall Project EIRR was estimated at 19.9 per cent for 20-year analytical period.

17
   In the analyses two cost scenarios were covered: Scenario A and Scenario B. Scenario A included all project expenditures/costs
(inclusive of project expenditures on administration, operation, processes). Scenario B included only expenditures/costs directly related
to the beneficiaries. This was the start-up support cost for them. The presentations and discussions in this text only cover Scenario B.




                                                                   20
70.    Rating: Satisfactory

71.    Given that the relevance of objectives, design and implementation are substantial;
achievement of project development objectives is substantial and efficiency considerations
are substantial, the overall outcome rating is assessed to be Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.     Poverty Impacts: Land recipients in LASED SLC sites have taken important steps
to improve their livelihoods. At the start of project activities, almost all families belonged
to the group of poor households (classified as ID Poor 1 and 2) and where characterized by
severe food shortages. The most recent LASED Food Security Survey shows that almost
70% of all households were classified as food secure and more than 80% of those were no
longer part of the population group classified as ID Poor 1 and 2. However, even as LRs
have shown an upward movement on the poverty ranking, they remain extremely
vulnerable to falling back as more support is required for them to comfortably sustain gains
made.

73.     Gender Aspects: The project worked to ensure that women were given equal
opportunities in land allocation and developing their livelihood skills. Gender equality was
mainstreamed into the distribution of land and in livelihood development support. The
gender analysis and gender segregated needs assessment conducted in all SLC sites played
an important role in encouraging women to participate in project activities. Out of 3148
families that were allocated land in the SLC program, 34% of SLC land recipients were
female headed households. Out of the total population of land recipients selected for the
SLC program, 51% of project beneficiaries were female. Additionally, gender responsive
training courses were also mainstreamed into training plans and women’s participation in
all these activities stood at 53%.

74.     Social Development: The Complaints Handling Mechanism was effective in
addressing the challenges of the beneficiary selection process but much more was required
to address the challenges of encroachers. The project made provisions in the guidelines not
to exclude encroachers that chose to participate in the program and went further to allow
unwilling participants to access public infrastructure facilities and services in the SLC sites.
The project was very deliberate in providing sufficient time for potential land recipients to
register their interest in the SLC program. The added support of NGOs for outreach and
attention paid to record keeping and documenting processes enhanced legitimacy of the
process. As the information about cut-off dates was widely disseminated and well
understood by beneficiaries, it was widely accepted as a legitimate resolution mechanism
whose decisions were acceptable to most potential land recipients. This was found to be
effective in ensuring that no further encroachment on SLC land occurred. For the cases
where encroachment had occurred after the cut-off date, cases were resolved through strong
high-level local and provincial support. Other measures taken to minimize possible land



                                              21
conflicts included provisions for alternative lands within the SLCs as compensation in the
event that an agreement could not be reached. More importantly for long term stability, the
project agreed to a systematic land registration and titling process that would apply to all
commune residents including encroachers.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.      As documented under Section 2.2, the identification of potential lands that could
be converted to SLC areas was found to be challenging and commune councils played the
most critical role in this process. Commune Councils had little knowledge and experience
in this field but were supported through technical assistance provided by District Working
Groups and higher level provincial teams. Support was further reinforced by working with
NGOs to identify eligible applicants and land recipients by using a systematic and
transparent process. Working with the NGOs enabled Commune Councils to leverage
constrained resources and minimize risks of complaints and conflicts as NGOs provided
critical support in ensuring that knowledge about CHM was widely disseminated, and that
land recipients were properly supported to file complaints. NGOs also provided close
monitoring of the process to ensure that complaints were fully addressed. NGO support
contributed to strengthening community ties and enhanced trust and credibility in the
processes implemented by Commune Councils.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

76.     Although the project development objective was process oriented, the project did
have notable impacts on beneficiary households’ food situation, even though this was not
formally part of the objective. According to the GIZ Food Security Survey Results of 2014,
households facing food shortages declined dramatically in LASED sites sampled in four
provinces: (Kratie Round 1: from 96% in 2010 to 36% in 2014; Kratie Round 2: from 95%
in 2012 to 30% in 2014; Tbong Khmum (formerly part of Kampong Cham): from 100% in
2010 to 34% in 2014; and Kampong Thom: from 98% in 2012 to 32% in 2014). The survey
also noted that around 30% of LASED SLC households still faced food shortages compared
to 45% of households in the control groups.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

77.    Rating: Significant

78.     Much of the success of the SLC program is anchored in the Commune Council’s
capacity to undertake a critical number of functions. Commune Councils are considered as
the driving force for the program given that they are primarily responsible for the SLC
identification process, beneficiary selection process and coordination of other stakeholders
in development of the annual implementation plan. Effective execution of these functions
requires development of adequate technical capacity complemented by the required
financial resources to efficiently deliver results. Continued capacity weaknesses at the sub-
national level could compromise the replicability of SLC identification process and
integration into the overall Government framework; increase risk of elite capture in the



                                             22
beneficiary selection process and create delays in the provision of critical services that
incentivize beneficiaries to invest their time and resources in land development and
utilization. At the time of the ICR, around 57% of the 3,074 land recipients that had been
allocated agricultural plots had settled on the plots and began cultivation activities. In
addition, almost 80% of land recipients who were allocated residential plots had settled on
their plots. Further settlements were expected and required concerted efforts from relevant
staff at the sub-national level. The risk is significant.

79.     The use of government systems was important for creating ownership and
influencing the policy direction of land management and tenure. Various incentives were
introduced during project implementation to increase service delivery performance of
Government agencies combined with technical training. However, over-reliance on
government systems could risk restricting opportunities for land recipients who require
flexibility in a process that can easily lend itself to their evolving needs and circumstances,
including the option for private sector support for related services. The Government has
already demonstrated broadening its strategic approach by working closely with NGOs and
therefore the risk is considered to be moderate.

80.     Livelihood improvement for land recipients was an integral part of project
implementation and addressing their immediate requirements as they moved to their new
locations was crucial for their settlement and an important step towards earning a living.
As the beneficiary selection process targeted the poorest and vulnerable groups most
susceptible to shocks, inadequate interventions that do not provide quick and tangible
benefits in terms of returns to labor and food security would only serve to further aggravate
their vulnerability and poverty situation. It is now well recognized that appropriate support,
taking into account the needs and labor availability in recipient households, is needed to
help develop the SLC land as productive assets. The necessary flexibility in government
agencies’ responses and support is increasing, however, it still needs further strengthening.
The risk is moderate.

81.     At the time of the ICR, Government had provided land titles to 250 households
(roughly 22%) who had met the eligibility criteria (which includes 5 years of residence on
the plot) that were supported under the LASED project. The title applications for the
remaining households are currently going through the Government’s systematic land titling
process. The land titles enable eligible recipients to derive benefits by way of tenure
security, access to formal credit markets, and opportunities to increase investments and
productivity. The issuance of titles for the first group of land recipients took longer than
expected. Delays in the processing of land titles could risk affecting the realization of the
full economic benefits to the land recipients. Going forward, this process should be
expedited. The risk is moderate

82.    Infrastructure services were provided by private contractors with supplemental
support from the Department of Rural Development. However, sustainability for these
investments is very much linked to the operations and maintenance capacity of SLC
communities. Without sufficient systems in place to generate the required revenue for




                                              23
O&M, there is a risk of jeopardizing the long term maintenance of infrastructure and
compromising access to other services and markets. The risk is significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

83.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.    The project design tackled an issue that was relevant and consistent with the
development agenda of the Government as well as the Bank’s CAS. The PDO was process
oriented and aligned the project’s approach with the Government’s priorities in the sector.
Indicators were simple and measurable. Recognizing the sensitivity of land issues,
substantial effort went into incorporating relevant diagnostic work, understanding and
incorporating lessons from relevant projects, domestic and international experiences, and
developing frameworks that aimed to address the most critical risks identified. There was
an adequate mix of skills in the preparation phase and sufficient budget allocated for the
preparation process. There was strong collaboration with the Government, which had a
deep interest in supporting the pilot.

85.     However, given that the project financed pilot activities, the design could have been
enhanced with inclusion of indicators to measure whether or not the pilot was successful
in leading to a scaling up of the approach. Although the design recognized the importance
of sequencing of activities to achieve project success and that infrastructure services had
to be in place prior to land recipients moving into SLCs, the team did not adequately
anticipate the length of time it would take to have services in place. An expedited process
should have been facilitated such as advance preparation of procurement documentation at
design which could have saved critical time for the project team to focus on other major
issues that required attention.

(b) Quality of Supervision

86.    Rating: Satisfactory

87.    The Bank team carried out regular implementation support and was responsive to
the needs of the Borrower, maintaining a consistent team of local and international staff
and consultants to provide fresh perspective and specific expertise as required. The task
team was pro-active in responding to various issues in a timely and constructive manner.
The project triggered 6 safeguards which were closely reviewed by the Bank safeguards
team during each mission to ensure compliance with the frameworks that had been
developed. The fiduciary team worked closely with the project team providing continuous
guidance and technical support in light of challenges experienced with high fiduciary staff
turnovers. Fiduciary and safeguard issues were adequately addressed. The team was very
responsive to addressing key issues that arose during implementation through restructuring
and adjusting expectations to reflect ground realities and ensured that the MTR was held


                                             24
on time. The project also greatly benefitted from having a TTL based in Phnom Penh
alongside other key technical staff that were field based which enabled easy accessibility,
quick decision making and timely provision of implementation guidance. A strong
collaborative network was built with stakeholders and partners such as GIZ and NGOs.
Joint implementation and technical support missions were carried out to ensure consistency
in approach and alignment with expectations set.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

88.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.     Given that quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory and quality of
supervision is rated as Satisfactory, the overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

90.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The Royal Government of Cambodia was highly committed to the project and was
closely involved in the preparation process and provided feedback to the Bank team. The
Government had laid the legislative platform on which the project would build on and were
flexible in adopting guidelines and measures that supported successful implementation.
The Government was responsive to many of the issues that could not be resolved at project
level by setting up various working groups to work with communities and address
concerns. Even though, the Merit Based Performance Incentive scheme was discontinued,
the Government made an extra effort to replace it with POC to ensure that the public
delivery system continued to function as efficiently as possible in meeting the needs of the
project. However, the Government was challenged in meeting its commitment of ensuring
the availability of three sources of land for SLCs (land was sourced from degraded forest
lands and recovered illegally occupied lands but none could be sourced from canceled
economic land concessions as these could have also taken longer to secure given the
potential legal obstacles). Meeting this commitment could have potentially provided
additional options that could have contributed to accelerating the identification and
registration process.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

92.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     There was strong coordination between the two responsible ministries supported by
clear distinction of roles and responsibilities. Systems, procedures and processes were new
to the implementing agencies and the learning curve was steep as noted by the
extraordinary effort made to deliver results while managing the different institutional layers



                                             25
that were part of the implementation process. The project team demonstrated strong
commitment to the project and utilized much of the capacity support provided by GIZ to
be effective in delivering results. The project complied with all legal covenants with the
exception of undertaking an impact evaluation as explained in Section 2.3. The project
team paid close attention to complying with safeguard measures that ensured fairness in
the treatment of all stakeholders impacted by the SLC program (see Section 2.4). Data on
indicators was collected regularly and the system updated however, it was not well
integrated for more strategic decision making as discussed in Section 2.3. While the project
team is commended for having met the objectives of the project through learning and doing,
there were a number of shortcomings which, if properly addressed, could have produced
even better results for the project. The Baseline Survey was initiated fairly late and only
completed 2 and half years after project effectiveness. Given that the majority of
procurement packages were to be procured by IPA and the IPA was engaged on time, the
absence of technical expertise to provide inputs for procurement to be initiated from the
start, was the critical issue that was not adequately addressed and led to implementation
delays that affected transition of land recipients and contributed to the slow settling in
process observed. Delays in the preparation and approval of the Annual Work Plan and
Budget affected timely provision of IDA funding for settlement packages, which also had
negative effects on the communities. These factors combined to further delay the
consolidation process of livelihood activities for land recipients and resulted improved but
lower than expected results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

94.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.    Given that Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory and
Implementing Agency is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, the overall Borrower’s
performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

96.    Important lessons have emerged from the pilot, some of which have been
incorporated into LASED II design. They are outlined below:

97.      SLC process can be effectively used to target poor landless and land-poor
households for inclusion in the SLC program. There were nine key steps followed in the
selection of land recipients and while procedures were considered laborious, they ensured
credibility and maximized transparency in the process. This process ensured that the people
targeted for the project intervention were the people who were selected and benefited. In
addition, as staff became more familiar with the procedures and guidelines, efficiencies
were gained in identifying processes that could run in parallel rather than sequentially, e.g.
initiating SLC planning alongside land recipient selection process eliminated one step and
helped to shorten the process without compromising credibility and transparency.
Furthermore, involvement of NGOs not only contributed to enhancing the credibility of the
selection process but also helped to improve working relations between the commune



                                             26
councils and beneficiaries. Their involvement in community mobilization and awareness
raising expanded outreach to increase participation of potential beneficiaries and helped to
leverage commune councils limited resources for similar activities.

98.      Involving Key stakeholders at the beginning of the SLC identification process
can accelerate critical decisions affecting SLC registration. The majority of land in SLC
sites were sourced from degraded forests administered by the Forest Administration (FA).
Initial delays were experienced in securing approval for land concessions with relevant
authorities because they were not involved at the beginning stage of the process, rather,
they were consulted only for approval at a later stage. Involving them at the earliest stage
of the identification process can reduce delays in reaching consensus and help to streamline
approval procedures. This along with improving capacity at sub-national level to undertake
these activities would serve to further improve the process.

99.     Complaints handling mechanism adequately addressed grievances arising from
the selection process. Particular measures had been taken during the project’s
implementation to minimize to the extent possible, conflicts and complaints. Allocation of
specific plots to households could be a potential source of conflict because land quality
varies across communes and within communes as well. By instituting a lottery process, the
project was able to effectively minimize potential conflict as beneficiaries felt that the
lucky draw system was more credible as it placed everyone on equal footing. The
involvement of NGOs in providing oversight to the selection process ensured that
complaints were received and adequately addressed. NGOs worked closely with
beneficiaries in facilitating their rights to be heard by helping them fill out required
paperwork and following up on complaints filed. This close collaboration with
beneficiaries improved transparency and credibility perceptions of the process as well as
overall relations between Commune Councils and SLCs. Many of the conflicts arising from
this process were resolved at the sub-national level as a result of this improvement.

100. Settling-in support in the form of land clearance and preparation at the transition
stage is critical to support beneficiary households most of who do not have assets and
regular income. The support provided by GIZ in this regard proved to be an important
coping mechanism for most households who were also heavily indebted. This allowed them
to work on their agricultural lands without falling further into the debt trap as most common
approach to land clearance was to borrow money from money lenders and repay once
product was harvested. The returns from investments were used to address household needs
and pay down debt. Early and comprehensive support for land preparation is crucial to
quickly establishing sustainable agriculture-based livelihoods. This needs to be preceded
by infrastructure services that help to accelerate settlement of land recipients. The
sequencing of project activities in the SLC program is critical to have any meaningful
impact. The identified and agreed advance actions should be in place before project
effectiveness, otherwise, it would have significant effects on procurement start up.

101. Public-private partnership arrangements should be developed with specialized
service providers and NGOs to complement Government efforts. The focus on livelihoods
requires a more differentiated and flexible approach as the needs of beneficiaries are



                                             27
constantly evolving. The linkages with line departments to provide critical extension
services is very much welcome and needed because increasing production and productivity
are essential for livelihoods development, however, they are not sufficient for increasing
household incomes as this requires access to markets along with marketing services and
inputs and responsiveness to changing market dynamics. These may not be readily
available in the public delivery system. There is space for collaboration with private sector
service providers and NGOs to support beneficiaries in taking advantage of market
opportunities.

102. Coordination with line agencies needs to be strengthened to provide
comprehensive support services to communities, this requires strong capacity at the
secretariat level to coordinate these relationships. The pilot demonstrated ability to bring
line agencies together for provision of services to land beneficiaries. It was also clear that
more was required to address many of the critical factors necessary to support vulnerable
groups such as the need for timely inputs, market information, access to new technologies
and access to finance among others. Bringing together the kind of technical support that
provides a full menu of important services required to improve and sustain livelihood
activities requires timely provision of services from responsible line agencies sequenced to
maximize impact. To effectively facilitate this kind of coordination, the responsible
secretariats at the national level would need to be further capacitated with the required
technical expertise and appropriate financial resources. This would also require that the
M&E system become well integrated and institutionalized within all the structures of the
project to allow for comprehensive and timely monitoring and decision making linked to
actual needs. Additionally, it would improve resource allocation and efficiency of
processes.

103. For sustainable scale up of the SLC program, Government will need to invest in
developing institutional capacity at all levels of government structures involved in the
process. The pilot program implemented activities mainly with support of national and
international consultants and while this did help to demonstrate potential for scale up, it
cannot be a substitute for having sufficiently capacitated and well enumerated staff to
implement and scale up the program in a more sustainable manner.

104. Comprehensive and integrated livelihood approach and support is required to
truly transform landless and land-poor land recipients into small holder farmers. The
needs of this group are many and need to be addressed in a very integrated and holistic way
if the expectation is to derive maximum benefits from land use and minimize/eliminate
selling labor for wages. Needs include security for the land (land title); social safety
nets/insurance (they are the most poor and most vulnerable to fall back into destitute in the
event of a disaster); access to technologies that enhance production/productivity; access to
market information and finance to invest in their lands. An integrated livelihood support
package would place them firmly on a sustained path of poverty reduction.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Commune-Based Social Land Concessions Planning and Allocation:

1.      A total seven communes SLC plans were submitted and approved by the respective
PLUACs. And a total for eight SLC sites located in these seven communes in the three
provinces were registered (Original target of 20 communes was revised through a
restructuring because the sites were larger than originally planned in terms of land area
covered as well as the number of land recipients. Therefore, the Government submitted a
request for restructuring which included the decrease in the number of communes from 20
to 7 communes.

2.      The SLC sites covered a total of 10,273 hectares (103% of the target achievement)
and provided residential and/or agricultural lands to 3,148 land recipients (which 74
families have received residential land, 658 families received agriculture land and 2,416
families received both lands). The identification and registration of the SLCs involved
extensive consultation and negotiation, surveys, screening, preparation of documentation,
approval at different levels and legal registration. All sites were assessed for suitability and
availability, and screened against a provincial “hotspots” map to make sure that the area
would not trigger any safeguards issues (i.e. no conversion of remaining forest, not
affecting indigenous peoples, etc.). Existing families on the sites were provided with three
options: (1) give up their land and accept a SLC plot through the “lucky draw” process; (2)
accept some adjustment of their existing plots to fit the SLC plan and become eligible for
title and other SLC services; and (3) not join the SLC, in which case the existing land was
excluded from the SLC.

3.      The Project Implementation Manual defined steps and sub-steps required for
participatory and transparent preparation and approval of the land use and full SLC plans.
This included a number of land surveys, participatory assessment, land classification,
mapping, agro-ecosystem analysis, infrastructure needs assessment, participatory land use
and infrastructure planning, safeguards and legal compliance and preparation of the full
SLC plan. The process included public information and consultation at several stages. The
SLC plans were prepared and approved through this process for all 7 SLCs.

Component B: Rural Development Services and Investments:

4.     Plots for land recipients, community forests and other protected areas, and other
community sites have been demarcated. The settling-in supports and capacity building
have been also provided to all LRs in the SLC sites (100%).

5.     The project provided various in-kind support to the beneficiaries to help them
during the initial relocation and transition phase, which included: (i) rice assistance/food
for work; (ii) residential starter kits; (iii) agricultural starter kits; (iv) construction materials
for housing; (v) latrine materials; and (vi) other plating and livestock inputs such as seeds,
seedlings, chickens, etc. The training and capacity building activities were also conducted
through the various sub-national/provincial agencies. The project delivered 530 courses of



                                                 31
agricultural management courses in livestock and crop production and demonstrated seven
(7) technologies. A total of 18,936 participants (53% women) were trained in chicken
raising, pig raising, compost making, rice production, fruit tree management, home
gardening and vegetable production. Improved management methods and adoption of
technologies led to increased net income from on-farm activities and significant
improvements in the security situation of most LRs.

6.      The infrastructure works under the project were completed. Community
infrastructure included construction of 7 primary schools, 3 health posts and 51 ponds for
areas where wells failed and for irrigation. In addition, 312 open wells and 127 pump wells
were constructed and erected. 501 kms of road comprising residential agricultural and
feeder roads were constructed in the 7 SLCs. All have been completed and are operational.
Infrastructure Repair and Maintenance Committees (IRMC) were established in each site.
The IRMC committee facilitated the involvement of communities in repairing and
maintaining roads and other infrastructures, although more is required for long term
sustainability.

Component C: Sustainable and Transparent SLC Program Development

7.     This component supported the implementation of Components A and B through
building institutional capacity at the national, provincial and district levels. Exchange and
mutual learning between LASED and other SLC stakeholders at the provincial and national
level were conducted. Important lessons learned were shared in formal and informal
meetings and workshops. IEC materials were also produced and shared with relevant
stakeholders through print and the NCDDS website.

8.      Out of the 3 identified potential sources of land (cancelled economic land
concessions, recovered illegally occupied lands and degraded forest lands), the project
managed to obtain land for SLCs from 2 of the 3 sources: (a) degraded forest lands (94.5%);
and (b) recovered illegally occupied lands (5.5%). While the target was not met, the
sourced lands were sufficient to provide all the land required to meet the objective of the
project.

9.      Legal, technical and operational procedures and experiences on SLC
implementation have been continuously improved and shared with various stakeholders.
The knowledge sharing was done through annual project workshops, land governance
training and NGO forum. IEC materials were also produced and shared through print
medium and the NCDDS website. This allowed national and sub-national GRC institutions
to meet implementation requirements and document and update improvements in the SLC
process in the Project Implementation Manual.

10.    Staff providing support to the project were closely monitored prior to release of
MBPI and while this was later discontinued and its successor (POC) also ended in 2013
prior to project completion, all recipients were assessed to carry out their LASED
responsibilities effectively.




                                             32
Component D: Project Administration

11.     This component aimed to ensure sufficient capacity of LASED project
implementation, focusing on procurement, financial management/audit and donor specific
reporting. Planning, review and coordination of meetings among the LASED Team
(GSSLC, NCDD and Sub-National) at all levels were held on a regular basis, including
project management meetings with the project stakeholders (concerned agencies, NGO
partners, Bank and GIZ) to discuss LASED operations issues and post-project
sustainability. Procurement was implemented in line with Bank and Government
guidelines. 100% of prior and post procurement reviews complied with the procurement
guidelines of the Bank. All procurement packages, with the exception of 2 packages, were
procured and delivered successfully. One package (earth road) could not be procured as
the bids submitted exceeded the available budget and one contract (construction of a
school) was terminated due to breach of contract. Financial audit reports were ‘unqualified’
throughout project implementation. Minor internal control weaknesses were identified and
corrected. The project had an M&E system and a database had been established and
regularly updated. The system was adequate to produce required reports but could have
been better integrated for more strategic decision making. Capacity levels of staff required
further strengthening in terms of analysis and clarity of reporting.




                                            33
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       Project sites. The EFA at appraisal was based on the analysis of only two of eight
project sites. The ICR analysis is based on project records, and data gathered from field
visits to five (5) project sites (Thmey, Chambak, Dar, Sambok, and Choam Krovean), and
telephone interviews of beneficiary household representatives of the Project in Changkrang
and Tipo.

2.       Farm sizes. The areas of agricultural land in hectares (ha) given to households of
different sizes are different at different sites. At appraisal, it was assumed that each
household, regardless of their sizes, would receive three hectares of land for farming.
However, this varied by household size. Although the Project began in 2008, the first
beneficiary households started their settlements in the very first communities (i.e., Sambok,
Changkrang and Choam Krovean) in 2009 after certain basic arrangements were made. In
the first year, the beneficiary households were not able to cultivate their given agricultural
land and only initiated agricultural activities in the second year when they were able to
clear enough land (on average 0.5 ha) using settling-in assistance and family labor and
resources. The beneficiary households expanded the cultivation of their agricultural land
on annual basis thereafter.

3.       Crops. Agriculture remains largely subsistence in Cambodia. There is no exception
for the farming of the Project beneficiary households. Their agriculture was highly
weather-dependent, and thus yields were dictated mainly by rainfall. If they were to grow
rice for rice/food security purpose they would need two (02) hectares or more of
agricultural land if the land has below average soil fertility. Soil of agricultural land of all
sites, except Choam Kroven, had low fertility. Most of the lands were in upland conditions,
which are suitable generally for “chamcar” crops such as maize, soy bean, cassava, mung
bean, sesame, water melon, husk melon, sweet potato, and upland rice. Enterprise budgets
for the main crops that were commonly grown by the project’s beneficiary households on
the given agricultural land were prepared. These crops include rice, field crops (cassava,
mung bean, soy bean, sesame and maize) and a tree crop (cashew). For each site, average
crop yields and representative cropping patterns and systems for relevant categories of the
beneficiary households were used in the FEA. Actual rice yield was much lower than that
assumed by the PAD.

4.      Prices. When confronted with global financial and economic crises in 2008/2009,
Cambodia experienced significant inflation in prices, especially of basic food items. The
general level of prices rose, on average, 3.1 percent during the project’s implementation
phase. Prices of inputs, labor, and produce were higher than at appraisal. Farm-gate prices
of crops produced by the Project’s beneficiary households also significantly increased.
These varying prices were applied in the FEA models, to the extent possible for the relevant
locations. Average prices of inputs, labour and produce reported by different beneficiary
households at each site were used. In particular, there was a significant difference in the
wage rate assumed in the PAD, Rl 5,016/md, compared to that used for the ICR, Rl
20,000/md. Other agricultural inputs (including fertilizers, seeds, propagative materials,
machinery) were readily available through local markets and were of reasonable quality.



                                              34
   5.      Start-up support cost. Start-up support cost was estimated at US$1,013/hh for
   Memot (Choam Krovean) and US$1,079/hh for Kratie, in the PAD. The actual start-up
   support cost per household was calculated to be US$1,657.9-1,689.2/hh. It was, therefore,
   relatively higher than that of the PAD’s estimate. The start-up support cost included the
   Project’s extension and technical support services to the beneficiary households. Unlike
   the PAD’s assumption, the services were not provided for the full five years. Therefore,
   limited improvement of yields and cropping system practices was realized.

   6.      Qualitative benefits. The FEA is quantitative in nature. It is, therefore, unable to
   capture the qualitative benefits generated by the project. Interactions with the Project’s
   beneficiary households and observations during field visits demonstrated that the Project
   brought about several important qualitative benefits for the project households and society
   at large. These benefits include: (a) good governance, (b) community solidarity and mutual
   assistance, and (c) more sustainable land use.

   7.      Opportunity cost of capital and period of analysis. The opportunity cost of
   capital was estimated to be approximately 14 percent (according to the National Bank of
   Cambodia). Although this is higher than the 12 percent rate often assumed for Bank
   operations, 14 percent is consistent with the PAD analysis. The period of the FEA is 20
   years.

   8.      Household income. The analysis included both on-farm and off-farm income.

   9.      Economic analysis. The currency used in the financial analysis was. Unlike the
   financial analysis, where the Khmer Riel (Rl) was used, the currency used in the economic
   analysis was US$, at market exchange rates. Costs (e.g., family labor, cost of rice
   production) and benefits (e.g., benefit of rice production), which were not entered in the
   financial analysis, were incorporated in the economic analysis to reflect the costs and
   benefits to the economy.

   10.     In the economic analysis of the model households, only Project’s cost incurred
   directly to the Project’s beneficiary households were included. This was the start-up
   support cost. This cost was not entered into the financial analysis for the spending was not
   made by the Project’s beneficiary households. For the Project’s economic analysis, two
   scenarios were provided. One (Scenario A) covered all costs of the whole Project, while
   another (Scenario B) only took account of direct costs relating to the Project’s beneficiary
   households.

   FEA Results. Model households

11. Farm income. With the Project, most household types had negative farm income in the
    immediate/near term; but all would do better and much better, over the short, medium and
    long runs, than without the Project (Table A1 – Table A7, and Fig. A1a – Fig. A21c,
    Appendix A). At 14 percent discount rate, the beneficiary households would have a per
    capita daily income two times to six times higher than the cash poverty line calculated for



                                                35
Cambodia’s rural areas by the World Bank, which was Rl 3,914/person/day. This was,
however, the annual average estimate for the period of 20 years. In the near term, the
situation was hard for many beneficiary households.

12.    Return to family farm labor. Trend of return to farm labor in the with-Project and
without-Project scenarios is similar. In the near term, return to family farm labor was
negative; negative return to farm labor in the with-Project case was larger than in the
without-Project case. Over the medium term, return to farm labor turned positive. Over
the long term, such return was very large and became static. Return to farm labor under
the with-Project condition was generally much larger than that under the without-Project
condition.

13.     Financial NPV, BCR and IRR. The PAD did not have any analyses of the three
financial measures. All household types in the with-Project scenario were much better, on
all three financial measures, if compared with those in the without-Project scenario. In the
without-Project case FNPV ranged from Rl 6.12 million (small household in Tipo) to Rl
22.85 million (large household in Changkrang). FBCR ranged from 1.2 (small household
in Tipo) to 3.4 (medium-sized and large household in Dar). FIRR was in the range 20.86
percent (small household in Tipo) – 185.6 percent (medium-sized and large household in
Dar).

14.    The incremental effect on the financial side due to the Project was significant. The
incremental FNPV ranged from Rl 5.3 million (small household in Thmey) to Rl 20.6
million (large household in Choam Krovean). The incremental FBCR was 1.64 (small
household in Choam Krovean) – 7.58 (medium-sized and large households in Dar). The
incremental FIRR fell in the range of 34.35 percent (small household in Chambak) – 139.77
percent (large household in Choam Krovean).

15.      Economic NPV, BCR and IRR.In addition to the economic costs concerning the
households, Project costs that related directly to the households were incorporated. ENPV
for all types of households at all sites were negative and EBCR were below 1.0 (Table 5).
The EIRR was only 7.03 percent (all households in Dar) – 13.79 percent (medium-sized
and large households in Changkrang). These results were far below the PAD’s. In the
PAD’s models, the lower bound of EIRR was 16.3 percent (small household with 3.0 ha in
Memot), and the upper bound was 21.1 percent (medium-sized household with 3.0 ha in
Kratie). Size of agricultural land distributed by the Project to each household (be it small,
medium-sized or large household) ranged from 1.0 ha to 3.0 ha. In most of the Project
sites, each of the medium-sized and large households got less than 3.0 ha.

16.    Although the with-Project scenario looked unpromising, the incremental effect was
much better. The incremental ENPV ranged from Rl 553.34 (medium-sized and large
households in Changkrang) to Rl 3,564.84 (large household in Tipo). The EBC value was
1.08 (medium-sized and large households in Changkrang) – 1.96 (large household in Tipo).
The EIRR fell in the range from 16.4 percent (medium-sized and large households in
Changkrang) to 40.27 percent (small household in Changkrang).

17.      Whole Project model. For the whole Project model, all sites were included in the
computation process. Trend in and pattern of land use were accounted for. Two time
periods were considered (Table 1). The first was for 20 year-period beginning from the
start of the Project (2008-2027). The second looked extended, 30-year period (2008-2037),
but it only tried to take account of the late comer sites, when their final units of land were
exhausted. The without- and with-Project situations were analyzed. Analysis of
incremental effect was conducted as well.

18.    In the without-Project situation, ENPV were negative, BCR were less than 1.0, and
EIRR was 4.0 percent (20 year-period) – 9.0 percent (30 year-period) for Scenario A, and
5.17 percent (20 year-period) – 10.13 percent (30 year period) for Scenario B.

19.   In the with-Project situation, all the three economic measures were better.
Nonetheless, ENPV was negative and BCR were below 1.0. EIRR was 10.26 percent (20

year-period) – 13.88 percent (30 year-period) for Scenario A, and 13.66 percent (20 year-
period) – 16.96 percent (30 year-period) for Scenario B.

20.    The incremental effect was remarkable. Incremental ENPV was US$2.1 million
(20 year-period) – US$3.7 million (30 year-period) for Scenario A, and US$3.9 million (20
year-period) – US$5.5 million (30 year-period) for Scenario B. Incremental BCR was 1.25
(20 year-period) – 1.42 (30 year-period) for Scenario A, and 1.61 (20 year-period) – 1.80
(30 year period) for Scenario B. Incremental EIRR was 20.30 percent (20 year-period) –
22.24 percent (30 year-period) for Scenario A, and 32.35 percent (20 year-period) – 33.33
percent (30 year-period) for Scenario B.

21.     Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analyses of produce prices, yields, and production
costs (including, labor cost) were carried out. Produce prices were allowed to decrease by
10 percent. Yields were set to decline by 10 percent. Costs were assumed to rise by 10
percent.

22.    Off-farm income was not considered important in the current FEA, if compared
with the PAD’s. Therefore, sensitivity analysis of the models as regards off-farm income
was not conducted. Interviews with the Project’s beneficiary households showed that most
households seemed to devote their family labour to cultivate agricultural land given to them
by the Project

23.    Whole Project model. The results of the sensitivity analysis for the whole Project
model are summarized hereunder.

       (a) Under the with-Project condition, extreme impact on EIRR, for both periods
           covered in the analysis and for both scenarios (Scenario A and Scenario B), was
           due to produce prices followed by yields. Costs had a relatively/least moderate
           impact on EIRR; when costs varied by one (01) percent, EIRR changed by less
           than one (01) percent. Impact of all three variables on EBCR ranged from
           relatively/least moderate to moderate/unitary. Produce prices had moderate
           impact on EBCR followed by yields and costs. Costs had least moderate impact
           on EBCR. On ENPV, produce prices had significant impact followed by yields
           and costs.

       (b) For the incremental results, extreme impact on EIRR, for both analytical periods
           and scenarios, was due to yields tailed by produce prices. Costs had least
           moderate impact on EIRR. Yields also had most significant impact on EBCR.
           While produce prices had unitary/moderate impact on EBCR, costs had least
           moderate impact on it. Yields had extreme impact, as well, on ENPV followed
           by produce prices. Costs had least moderate impact on ENPV.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.   No beneficiary survey was carried out as part of the ICR preparation, however, the
     project used information from the LASED’s Limited Beneficiary Assessment (BA)
     Report undertaken in July 2014.

2.   The LASED implementation had carried out an own Beneficiary Assessment. While
     the initiative was commendable, design and implementation suffered from significant
     methodological issues. The 4-pages design proposal already lacked crucial
     information that should have guided the BA. Sampling techniques were unclear;
     contents of the questionnaires was confusing and did not undergo appropriate testing;
     survey administration, including the training of involved interviewers and data entry
     staff was not done properly.

3.   Coding and data base design did prevent a comprehensive and meaningful analysis
     of the many questionnaires that were collected from the field. Translations back and
     forth between Khmer and English did not help eliminating inconsistencies.
     Numerous duplications were discovered during re-evaluation of questionnaires.

4.   Despite all the shortcomings, the collected information formed the basis for a few
     case studies and the derivation of general conclusions about the socio-economic
     status of sites and beneficiary families.

5.   The methodological issues with the BA were acknowledged by the design team and
     lessons have been documented. Future survey activities (as envisaged in LASED II)
     will benefit from the experience and are expected to be implemented more effectively
     and efficiently.

6.   Based on the available information and a thorough reexamination and analysis with
     the support of a specialized consultant, below observations could be confirmed and
     documented:

     (a)       The BA data collected was wide ranging and clearly structured with 1441
     beneficiary households in the three provinces. More than half of them were selected
     from Kratie. An overwhelming majority of them identified themselves as Khmer.
     Nearly 82 percent of them received residential land, and 97.5 percent received
     agricultural land.

     (b)      Data showed that 96 percent of the agricultural land recipients cultivated
     the agricultural land. Many were able to put their land or additional land units into
     production because of GIZ's land clearing support scheme. On average, the
     beneficiary households cultivated 1.11 ha of the given agricultural land.

     (c)      Family food security of the beneficiary households improved only slightly
     during the project life. The situation could not be better because Cambodia at large
     was negatively affected by many critical events (such as global economic meltdown,



                                           42
natural disasters) that occurred during 2008-2012. These events were completely
beyond project control.

(d)        The beneficiary households expressed many views about improving their
living conditions and thus the project result. However, two are worth for
consideration: (i) additional services (including, agricultural land clearing and
preparation, agricultural extension, water and sanitation, education, and health care);
and (ii) local infrastructure improvement.

(e)      The detailed Beneficiary Assessment Report and the cleaned data sets of a
limited number of survey questions are available.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.     Although this WB document is not an intense “learning ICR”, the implementation
completion and results missions in March and May 2015 conducted intensive discussions,
meetings and field visits to meet with the beneficiaries, villagers and affected people to
learn and document their experiences and perceptions. Wrap-up meetings were held at
MLMUPC on March 10 and May 20, 2015, to discuss the main project outcomes with
broad participation from Government agencies as well as other donors and diverse
stakeholders.

2.     During project implementation already, annual lessons-learned workshops were
conducted among LASED and JSDF implementing agencies (LWD, HfHI-C,
Wathnakpheap), including the participation of project beneficiaries and all other relevant
stakeholders such as GIZ the World Bank. Results and documented lessons-learned were
incorporated into the subsequent AWPBs, as well as in the Recipient PCR and in this ICR
document.

3.      The Recipient project completion report has been compiled by an external
international consultant. The process included 6 detailed discussions and 2 mains
stakeholder workshops in December 2014 and February 2015.The workshops
reports/results/comments have been incorporated under “final recipient project completion
report” and the report has been submitted to the World Bank in February 28, 2015.


4.      The ICR mission in March 2-10, and May 4-20, 2015 included broad participation
from stakeholders at all levels. Below table list of attendees and persons met in Cambodia
at the missions and wrap-up in March and May, 2015:

5.      A presentation was made on preliminary findings of the ICR mission. In general,
there was agreement on the analysis and the ratings. Specific points were raised and
finalized and documented in the Aide Memoire of the Implementation Completion and
Results Mission report, as well as in the management letter dated April 1, 2015 and June
18, 2016 to the government counterparts, which also form as a basis for this final write up
of the ICR. In addition, the mission team also received a copy of the final recipient’s project
completion report (PCR) on February 28, 2015. The Recipient’s PCR Executive Summary
submitted to the Bank for inclusion in the ICR report on June 30, 2015.

6.         The main results and recommendations derived are summarized as below:

           (a) The project has been successful and, as demonstrated by the high level of
               achievement of the PDO and intermediate results indicators, the Implementing
               Agencies have done an excellent job of project implementation. The Bank team
               would nevertheless like to highlight key points for further consideration by the
               government and the international community.

           (b) Although the project has been completed, a number of actions are
               recommended for further activities to consolidate gains from the project. The
               below provides a summary of the actions recommended throughout this
               document:

                •   LASED is demonstrating that the provision of land to the poor, even with
                    relatively limited additional support, can be an effective mechanism for
                    poverty reduction through economic growth as land recipients work hard
                    to quickly convert their land into productive farms which can move them
                    relatively rapidly to food security and beyond to income generation which
                    contributes to agricultural sector growth and diversification. However, the
                    willingness of land recipients to continue to invest in their land is


                                                    47
                dependent on demonstrating that their tenure security is well protected
                from any continuing encroachments on the SLC areas.

            •   LASED has demonstrated that RGC can utilize formal, transparent,
                consensus-based approach for identifying and transferring state land to
                SLCs. However, the ability to scale-up this experience is unclear given the
                continuing challenges in reaching consensus on the allocation of state land
                from current claims and management to SLCs, particularly at the national
                level.

            •   LASED has demonstrated that clear operational processes, based on RGC
                legal framework, combined with effective communication and
                transparency can bring national and local level authorities, communities,
                NGOs and development partners into a common, collaborative
                Government-led effort to support poverty reduction with better results for
                the target group – even in the traditionally conflictive domain of land
                management. It is also helpful in review the experience of LASED and
                that of other national and locally-initiated SLCs to identify opportunities
                to streamline and simplify procedures while maintaining the high level of
                transparency and participation of stakeholders.

7.      Overall Poverty Reduction Context: At project appraisal, it was estimated that
approximately 200,000 rural households were landless, and employment opportunities
through rural to urban migration are insufficient, with most rural employment based on
seasonal labor, resulting in significant underemployment. Accordingly, SLCs were viewed
as a means to put unused land into production so as to increase rural labor productivity
resulting in improved food security and poverty reduction with economic growth.

8.      The SLC approach appears to remain highly relevant. While agriculture’s share of
GDP declined from 42% to 28.7% from 1998 to 2014, agriculture’s share of employment
declined significantly from 77.5% to 48.7% over the same period. The growth of
employment generation in the manufacturing and services sectors remains relatively low,
unlike growing overseas migration, indicating that unless productivity in agriculture is
improved, there will be continuing growing disparity between urban and rural incomes. As
increasing the returns to agricultural labor requires more land or technology, SLCs are well
placed to address this priority issue in Cambodia, and in fact, experience in the field
confirms this approach as SLC recipients have been able to increase their incomes from
typically Riel 2 million to Riel 3million per year from occasional agricultural and non-
agricultural labor, to Riel 3 million to Riel 5 million in the first year and Riel 6 million to
Riel 10 million per year (well above the food poverty line) in subsequent years where
previously uncultivated land was put into production. Further, SLC sites are already
resulting in broader economic activity through shops, local agricultural marketing
arrangements and other mechanisms for linking the communities growing incomes to
broader economic growth in the SLC communes and districts. Accordingly, the ICRR finds



                                              48
that LASED remains highly relevant given the overall poverty reduction and economic
growth context.

9.      Land Availability: At project appraisal, 70 to 80% of land in Cambodia was named
as state land with limited and sometimes contradictory mapping regarding assigned use
and oversight agency responsibility. It was also noted that there were often conflicting
claims to state land and significant, un-regularized occupation, sometimes conflicting
agendas of state agencies in terms of land use priorities, and reluctance on the part of most
state agencies at the national to release land from their direct management. As in the case
of other countries in South-East Asia (c.f. Thailand, Indonesia) essentially all land in
Cambodia not formally recognized for other uses was considered as forest lands, often
regardless of actual land use characteristics. This was anticipated as the primary source of
unoccupied land but with a focus on identifying degraded forest areas, which were in the
process of being occupied through illegal, sporadic settlement. At the same time, it was
proposed to seek land released from cancelled economic land concessions (ELCs) as well
as resulting from the recovery of large-scale illegal land occupations, though there was no
prior experience with pursuing land for SLCs prior to LASED. Given this situation, the
willingness of RGC to support the reallocation of land between current classifications so
that land could be assigned to SLCs was seen as a key project risk.

10.     In order to facilitate a more transparent and technically effective approach to the
allocation of state lands, RGC established the legal framework to support the process of
land use planning, land allocation, state land registration and, in the case of SLCs, transfer
to private ownership for land recipients as a pre-requisite to proceeding with LASED.
LASED was intended as an instrument to drive practical application of these legal
instruments – in particular the Provincial Land Use and Allocation Committees (PLUACs)
and the state land registration process. Given that these mechanisms were largely to be
tested, the willingness and ability of government institutions to implement these multi-
stakeholder processes was viewed as still continue a significant project risk.

11.     The current context continues to reflect many of the challenges identified at
appraisal, and these have slowed, but not stopped the project from progressing with the
identification and registration of state lands for SLCs. LASED has supported the first-ever
implementation of the State Land management procedures, and confirmed that these have
generally worked well at the sub-national level. The provincial and local-level agencies
with LASED support have generally demonstrated the institutional capacity to implement
the new procedures and processes with appropriate participation and transparency.
However, national level support for assignment of land to SLCs has been more problematic
with the rejection of a number of provincial proposals of SLC areas in both degraded forest
and cancelled ELC areas. Difficulties in coordinating land use priorities are not limited to
ELCs but are also currently seen in the internal RGC conflicts regarding the granting of
agricultural and mining concessions in protected areas and protected forests without any
consideration of the application of the state land management legal framework. It is
noteworthy that despite the continuing challenges associated with the overall state land use
context, LASED has been able to support the effective implementation of the state land
management processes in the project area provinces and with the result that appropriate



                                             49
land areas have been registered as State Private Lands for SLCs in full compliance with
the law. Accordingly, the impact of the context risks identified at appraisal regarding high-
level political will for assignment of state land to SLCs and willingness to implement the
legal framework and processes, has delayed and reduced but not prevented LASED from
progressing towards its development objectives through the transparent and participatory
identification, screening, consensus building and registration of state lands for SLCs.

12.     LASED has confirmed the interest of communes and the support of provinces for
commune-initiated SLCs. In Kratie and Kampong Thom, where provinces were asked to
submit requests for SLCs to the provincial authorities, most communes have provided
proposals based on Commune Land Use Planning or less formal mechanisms for
identifying proposed land areas. However, it was noted that commune level uncertainty
regarding ability to seek subsequent SLCs, and the length and technical requirements of
the state land processes naturally encourage a focus on larger SLC areas in order to
economize on technical staff time relative to the land to be made available, as well as on
fixed infrastructure costs such as access tracks, schools and health clinics. RGC is
considering some streamlining of SLC procedures for nationally-initiated SLCs.
Accordingly, for commune-initiated SLCs to be scaled-up, it is necessary to continue
review the experience under LASED and other SLC programs, and to streamline the
procedures while conserving transparency and participatory aspects which ensure the
credibility of the SLC process with possibility that schools and health clinics can be at least
partially streamlined supported through the Commune/Sangkat investment funds.

13.      LASED anticipated that communes would utilize the commune land use planning
(CLUP) to identify potential SLC sites in the context of other land use priorities. This has
proven to be very useful in Kratie as the basis for systematic proposals from communes
which were better screened than the sketch map proposals from other provinces which did
not utilize CLUP. However, given the technical challenges of the CLUP approach and the
absence of information at the commune level on national and provincial claims on state
lands, the CLUP has not been continued as a mainstream land use planning instrument for
communes in Cambodia, with the focus now moving to provincial land use planning.
Accordingly, it has been simplified local land use planning tool which utilize information
from the national and provincial levels and facilitate better screening and accuracy of
commune driven SLC proposals.

14.      At appraisal, UXO was identified as a potential risk where financing of livelihood
support was conditioned on certified clearance of SLC area prior to settlement. Specific
procedures for clearance were initially not anticipated. During implementation, significant
UXO contamination was identified in the Kampong Cham SLC site. Given pressure to
settle the area to avoid wide-spread encroachment, RGC worked with its partners and the
on-going USAID and CMAC program to clear and certify the area relatively rapidly.
LASED procedures have to anticipate situations of UXO contamination and the procedures
to follow to address the problem so as to minimize delays in provision of uncontaminated
land to SLC recipients.




                                              50
15.     Transparent Selection of Land Recipients: At appraisal, provision of SLCs to
unqualified recipients was considered a major risk which LASED attempted to address
through utilizing transparent and participatory selection processes. This was achieved by
using the “ID Poor System” and by working with NGOs to assist with public information
dissemination and observation of the selection process, as well as implementation of a
complaints handling mechanism which again involved NGOs. These measures have been
considered by all stakeholders to be highly effective with priority having been given to the
poorest households and with well over the target 90% of recipients fully meeting the SLC
recipient criteria. The main issue which stakeholders raised regarding recipient selection
was whether some criteria of capacity to farm the land received should be used to screen
applicants. Accordingly, the land recipient selection processes under LASED are
considered highly effective and the collaboration of RGC with NGOs exemplary. It is
recommended that this approach will be expanded to other SLC programs.

16.     In order to support the confidence in the SLC process and ensure that any problems
are identified and addressed, a complaints handling mechanism was included as part of the
LASED procedures. The complaints handling mechanism used the Commune/Sangkat
suggestion boxes and a PLUAC review group which includes NGOs, systematically
reviewing and addressing complaints, most of which were associated with those who did
not bother to enroll in the program but decided ex post to try to receive land. The system
was generally found to be effective as complaints were addressed systematically and
transparently. Nonetheless, experience indicates that the process could be improved
through earlier village meetings, use of check boxes to shorten complaint forms and more
frequent collection and recording of complaints. Accordingly, the complaints process has
proven effective and has been well implemented but can be further improved to permit
more rapid review and resolution of complaints.

17.      Livelihood Development: At project appraisal, the willingness and ability of SLC
recipients to meet basic food security needs and eventually earn sufficient income to escape
poverty was questioned by those expecting land recipients to either abandon or illegally
sell their land to return to full-time wage labor. At the same time, the need for SLC
recipients to be able to complement initial farming production with wage labor during
initial years of SLC establishment was a critical assumption for the viability of livelihoods.
In order to mitigate this risk, SLC title eligibility requirements established minimum levels
of farming required on land received. Food for work was planned for distribution during
first growing season prior to harvest, and extensive information campaigns were planned
with provincial and district authorities and NGOs to remind SLC recipients of their
responsibilities. There are no confirmed reports of abandonment or illegal sales of SLC
plots. SLC plots are being developed for agriculture with food or cash for work assistance,
and recipients are able to find sufficient, complementary wage labor to meet basic needs.
However, all stakeholder emphasized need to provide some initial land clearing to “jump
start” production in the first year – normally a half hectare which they were expected to
complement with an additional half hectare on their own. Analysis of the actual farm
models indicates that households are most likely to meet their basic expenditure needs,
including probable medical expenditures, and to sustain this income by beginning with one
hectare of cleared land dedicated to a short-term cash crop, such as cassava, in combination



                                             51
with investments in medium and long maturity crops such as cashew, rubber, mango and
pepper which raise income and provide some diversification against price risks with
cassava. Accordingly, it is suggested that LASED consider systematically ensuring a
minimum area of cleared land (0.5 to 1 ha) for each SLC agricultural plot to accelerate
own-livelihood development, while maintaining food or cash for work support in first year,
and to promote diversification of cash crop production.

18.      At appraisal, it was assumed that SLCs would need a broad package of both public
and household support services as minimum requirements. Public and private assistance
packages included access tracks, roads, pump wells, latrines, schools, health posts,
household kits, building materials, agricultural materials and a number of training services
related to agriculture and health. Land recipients and other stakeholders indicated that the
priorities for SLC support beyond land are as follows (in order): (a) Improved road access
to site; (b) Access tracks to fields; (c) Initial land preparation/clearing; (d) Food /cash for
work; (e) Pump wells (but issues of water quality); (f) Schools; (g) Basic housing materials;
(h) Revolving funds; and (i) Facilitation of community building/problem solving.
Accordingly, it is suggested to consider prioritizing the provision of these services in
LASED and other SLC programs, with other services provided as funding permits.

19.    LASED anticipated a focus on food self-sufficiency amongst SLC recipients based
on food crop production. In practice, emphasis has been on cash crops which raise
concerns regarding nutritional balance, particularly for young children. Household gardens
have proven popular as residential plots generally provide sufficient space for vegetables
and some fruit trees. Accordingly, agricultural support to SLC recipients should include a
household gardening and nutrition component.

20.     Institutional context: At appraisal, Cambodia’s decentralization and de-
concentration process was advancing based on a focus on commune level governance
through elected councils with technical support from district and provincial level staff of
RGC line agencies. In order to ensure sustainability of institutional arrangements, LASED
implementation was based on a commune led approach which would utilize the existing
systems for channeling investment support for implementation at the commune level, with
technical support provided through provincial line agencies with back-stopping from
national departments of line ministries. This approach has ensured mainstreaming of
implementation into line departments, but given normal delays in adopting new procedures
and gaining familiarity with the processes under the pilot program, there have been
significant implementation delays, particularly in terms of procurement. This has resulted
in additional dependence on the GIZ-funded consulting team to go beyond technical
cooperation to more direct implementation support.            Accordingly, for future pilot
programs which introduce challenging procedures and new institutional partnerships, the
use of decentralized project implementation units should be considered to work directly
with local authorities and support technical processes and coordination of different
implementation partners as line agencies gain familiarity with the new approaches.

21.    Given the challenges of land issues in Cambodia, and the introduction of new
procedures and partnership approaches, the insufficiency of RGC staff incentives was



                                              52
highlighted at appraisal as a risk to effective implementation. Consistent with the general
approach agreed between RGC and donors, a Merit-Based Pay Initiative (MBPI) was
adopted for GSSLC and NCDD staff implementing LASED. However, the MBPI was
discontinued by Government in January 2010. A new, interim approach – the Priority
Operating Costs (POC) was introduced in mid-2010. The absence of incentives during the
early part of 2010 had a noticeable impact on staff performance, particularly at national
levels. Accordingly, particularly in the case of innovative and challenging pilot programs,
appropriate staff incentives are required to encourage staff to overcome inevitable
implementation challenges and take risks accordingly.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

(a) Summary of Borrower’s ICR:

1.      The Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) Project was
initiated in mid-2008 to develop and pilot test the systems, procedures, tools and capacities
for pro-poor land distribution through the government’s Commune-Based Social Land
Concessions (SLC) Program, and through practical implementation, allocated/awarded
some 10,000 hectares to around 3,000 landless or land-poor households. This aimed to
operationalize the Sub Decree No. 19 of 2003 on SLCs through a technically and
administratively robust system based on transparency and the rule of law. The total project
financing of US$13 m. was provided through contributions from the World Bank (IDA
credit of US$2.8 m. and IDA grant of US$8.7 m.), GIZ (US$1.2 m. grant through its
“LASED” Project) and the Royal Government of Cambodia counterpart (US$0.3 m.). The
project was initially planned for 6 years but was extended by 1 ¾ years to the end of March
2015. The project worked in 7 communes in the three provinces of Kratie, Tbong Khmum
(formerly part of Kampong Cham) and Kampong Thom.

2.     The project built on previous work carried out since 2004 by the World Bank, GIZ
(formerly GTZ) and RGC to develop strategies, systems and tools for SLC implementation.
The project also built on and combined with the GIZ LASED Project, initiated in 2007.

3.      The project helped to develop and implement a ten-step SLC process and involved:
(1) supporting communes to identify and register suitable SLC land, identify and select
eligible beneficiaries, and prepare detailed land use and development plans for each SLC
site, and then (2) providing site preparation, settling-in support for land recipients (LR) and
basic community infrastructure and services to implement these plans.

4.     The project was implemented through government structures from national to
provincial, district and commune levels, and also the various structures needed to
implement commune-based SLCs as set out in Sub Decree No. 19. Commune Councils are
responsible for initiation, planning and implementation of SLCs with approval, technical
support and supervision through District Working Groups (DWG), Provincial Land Use
and Allocation Committees (PLUAC) under the Provincial Governor, and the General
Secretariat for SLC (GSSLC) under the MLMUPC. The project provided technical support,
capacity building and M&E through the GSSLC / MLMUPC, provincial line departments
and DWGs. Operational support, procurement, financial management and reporting were
provided by the NCDDS. These included managing contracts and the flow of funds to the
provinces and communes. Supporting project teams were established in the provinces,
under the GSSLC and the NCDDS. This rather complex institutional framework required
strong multidisciplinary and multilevel collaboration and coordination, annual work plans
and budgets, contracts with provincial line departments, and regular LASED team meetings
linked with provincial meetings.

5.     The project aimed also to develop and implement robust processes based on
transparency, the rule of law and the avoidance of social or environmental harm. The



                                              54
project triggered six WB safeguard policies (included environmental assessment, natural
habitats, forests, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and physical cultural
resources) and it is classified as Environmental Category B. The project developed and
implemented a number of safeguards instruments (EA-EMP, RPF, IPPF, CHPF and PIM)
to address the requirements of these safeguard policies by using safeguard instrument such
as SLC planning, monitoring and implementation processes to avoid or mitigate and
minimize potential impacts. This required building strong participation of local
communities, public consultation and a transparent grievance resolution mechanism into
the SLC and project implementation processes. This included developing and
implementing resettlement policy, indigenous people and cultural heritage frameworks and
environmental management plans so that risks could be avoided or reduced to acceptable
levels.

6.      The project used almost all of the US$13 million provided and delivered almost all
of the planned inputs. Inputs included a total of 44 full time government staff, around 30
line department focal persons with technical inputs from many more line department staff,
and 22 employed national TA and commune support staff. Around 66 government staff
received salary incentive through the government’s Merit Based Performance Incentive
(MBPI) and the Priority Operating Costs (POC) schemes when these were in operation and
this was judged to have worked satisfactorily. All except one of the 190 procurement
packages were successfully procured, and all except one of these were implemented
satisfactorily. Procurement, financial management and fiduciary compliance and
safeguards compliance were assessed by the joint WB GIZ implementation support
missions on a regular basis and were all judged to have been satisfactory. The overall
performance of government, and the GIZ TA support were both judged to have been
satisfactory.

7.      The World Bank and GIZ provided supervision and implementation support
through monitoring, review and “No Objection Letter” (NOL) procedures, as well as
regular (every 7 months on average) joint implementation support missions with significant
multidisciplinary teams reviewing different aspects of the project in some detail. These
processes were very useful to keep the project on track although at times, rather demanding
and time consuming. The overall performance of the World Bank was judged to have been
satisfactory.

8.      The project encountered and largely overcame a number of significant challenges
during implementation. The difficulty of mastering the demanding procurement procedures
and slow recruitment of the full-time TA delayed implementation at the start of the project.
World Bank support on procurement helped to resolve many issues. Many challenges
stemmed from difficulty of implementing the many steps and sub steps of the SLC process,
many of which were new or involved new ways of working. These included the
identification and legal registration of SLC sites, beneficiary selection through transparent
processes, dealing with encroachment in SLC sites after identification, preparing and
approving SLC plans, and procurement and coordination of the implementation of the
many contracts needed for SLC site preparation, settling-in support, and community




                                             55
infrastructure and services. The strong support of the SLC process by senior decision
makers at all levels of government was instrumental in resolving many of these issues.

9.      The project successfully achieved almost all its planned outputs and intermediate
results indicators. Under the Commune-Based SLC Planning and Land Allocation”
Component A, all the target intermediate results indicators were fully achieved.
Specifically, a total of seven SLCs (target is 7) covering 10,273 ha (target is 10,000), were
identified, surveyed, screened, mapped and registered as public state land for SLC. These
were in seven communes in the three target provinces. Full SLC plans were prepared and
approved for all seven SLCs (target is 7). A total of 3,148 eligible landless or land-poor
households (target is 3,000) of whom 34% were female-headed, were selected and
allocated SLC plots (either agricultural, residential or both) through a transparent process
with participation, public disclosure and a satisfactory grievance redress mechanism (678
eligible complaints were received and resolved). In addition, the experiences gained
through practical implementation allowed a number of improvements to be made to the
SLC procedures, documentation, tools and capacities. Also, the project has surpassed the
World Bank’s land administration and management core sector indicators on: (1) target
land area with use or ownership rights recorded as a result of the project (10,273 hectares
vs. target of 10,000); and (2) target population with use or ownership rights recorded as a
result of the project (15,226 vs. target of 12,690).

10.     The target intermediate results indicators under the Rural Development Services
and Investments Component B, were also substantially achieved. All land recipients
(target is 100%) at the seven SLCs received the planned settling-in support, and around
98% (target is 80%) of the planned public infrastructure and services were provided.
Settling-in support included provision of residential starter kits for 2,490 households
(HHs), agricultural starter kits for 3,074 HHs, 1,313,365 kg of milled rice as “food for
work” to support land preparation, shelter materials for 2,226 HHs, solar panels for 2,499
HHs and latrine materials for 2,019 HHs. Agricultural households were supported to
prepare and plough the first half hectare of their land. The site preparation and community
infrastructure provided included demarcation of all residential, agricultural, community,
forestry, etc. plots, and construction of 186 km of residential roads, 270 km of agricultural
roads, 45 km of connecting roads, 127 pump wells, 51 ponds, eight schools and three health
posts. A total of 1,090 training courses in agriculture, gender mainstreaming, public health,
education, water use and hygiene, environment, forestry and land law courses were
provided to a total of 47,569 participants of whom 53% were female (target is 60%). The
agricultural training was a key component in helping the LRs to make the transition to an
agriculture-based livelihood and introduced a number improved technologies and good
practice. All schools and health posts have been taken over by the ministries of Education
and Health, respectively, and are staffed and in operation. The wells and roads have been
taken over by the communities and Commune Councils, respectively, with monitoring and
support from the Provincial Department of Rural Development (PDRD).

11.    The Sustainable and Transparent SLC Program Development Component C
was concerned with building the institutional capacity for implementation of the SLC
process at national and sub-national levels. The target intermediate results indicators under



                                             56
this component were also substantially achieved. These include the: (1) sourcing of SLC
sites from pre-determined sources, including the testing and documentation of the
processes and experiences; and (2) sharing of SLC knowledge and experiences among
various stakeholders; and (3) POC recipients effectively carrying out LASED
responsibilities. SLC land was successfully sourced from two of the three planned sources.
Mostly was from degraded forest (94.5%) with some (5.5% from recovered illegally
occupied land. No land was sourced from economic concessions. A total of 26 training
courses and 15 workshops were carried out or attended by number of different staff and
stakeholders (around 18% female). A range of SLC manuals, tools and information,
education and communication (IEC) material was produced and distributed including the
Project Implementation Manual (PIM) which contains the forms and tools needed for the
SLC process), the sub-decree on SLC, social and environmental safeguards documents,
draft M&E manual and preliminary database, The training and supporting materials,
combined with the wealth of practical experience and learning by implementation of the
SLC process has led to continued improvement in knowledge and capability for all main
stakeholders. The successful implementation of the whole SLC process (Components A
and B), provides the main evidence that the SLC related institutions have developed
sufficient SLC capacity. Continued adoption and use will depend on the resources being
made available as well as government policy.

12.     The Project Administration Component D aimed to ensure sufficient capacity
for LASED project implementation, focusing on procurement, financial management and
audit, as well as donor-specific reporting. Compliance with fiduciary procedures and
regulations and reporting requirements indicates that the intermediate results indicators
were substantially achieved.

13.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was substantially achieved. The PDO
had three linked outcome indicators. The first relates to the adoption of improved soil
management and agricultural production systems by at least 60% of LR. Around 57% of
the 3,074 LR that had been allocated agricultural plots had settled on and started to cultivate
their plots. They have adopted at least one of the improved agricultural production systems
and practices promoted through the agricultural extension training. In addition, around 80%
of those allocated residential lots had settled on their plots. Further settlement is expected,
particularly in the newer SLCs, and so the 60% target was almost completely achieved.

14.     The second and third PDO outcome indicators concern the development of a
replicable SLC “mechanism” on land recipient selection and dispute handling, based on
transparency and the rule of law. The ten-step SLC process developed and improved
through the project worked successfully and was fully documented. This included SLC
land acquisition and planning, land recipient selection and plot allocation through a
transparent process, site preparation, and provision of settling-in support and community
infrastructure and services. The targets relating to land recipient selection and transparent
dispute resolution were fully achieved. Some elements of the process have already been
adopted by other projects. Further streamlining and greater involvement of the private
sector are areas identified for further improvement. In addition, the project has also
surpassed the World Bank’s agriculture core sector indicator on “technologies



                                              57
demonstrated in project areas. The project has demonstrated and trained in 7 improved
agricultural technologies (target was one) covering chicken raising, pig raising Compost,
rice production, fruit trees, home gardening and vegetable production and marketing.

15.      The project has already achieved a significant beneficial impact on the livelihoods
and lives of the majority of land recipients that settled on the SLCs. The majority of these
households have improved their incomes, some considerably. The 2014 beneficiary survey
carried out by the project found an average household (agricultural and off-farm) income
of US$1,901 compared to US$1,176 found by the baseline survey in 2010. The annual food
security surveys found also that food security had improved remarkably, with almost all
households facing food shortages at the start compared to around 33% by 2014 (compared
to around 45% in 2014 for control groups). Anecdotal evidence from discussions with the
SLC households confirms these findings and indicates further that almost all households
are very satisfied with their transformation from poor landless or land-poor farm laborers
to proud farm owners who manage their own farms and are more in control of their own
lives. Although there are differences between SLCs, genuine human communities are
beginning to develop with an active life around schools, local shops and other community
facilities. Several of the SLCs have been registered as official new villages within the
commune.

16.     Although lives have improved for almost all land recipients that settled on the
SLCs, agriculture has not sufficiently taken root, and a majority of households remain
relatively poor, with some food insecure. In addition, the gains for some (e.g. female-
headed or poorer) households are vulnerable to community level or broader shocks.

17.     If there are no major shocks, the growing confidence and capacities of the majority
of households and the communities as a whole are likely to sustain and support further
improvement. Shocks however are part of the agricultural and rural development
experience, and there is a risk that sustainability could be undermined. A relatively small
amount of additional support would consolidate, protect and spread the gains for a majority
of households, and speed up and spread the natural growth and development processes that
the project has contributed to.

18.     The overall conclusion is that the LASED Project was very successful and has
been rated as “satisfactory”. This was not an easy undertaking with many aspects of
implementation that were new to Cambodia. After a slow start, the project managed to
achieve, exceed or almost achieve all its main objectives and targets. A total of 3,148
households were allocated land in eight SLC sites located in seven communes, covering
10,273 hectares. The majority of these households have substantially improved their
livelihoods and general well-being, although much remains to be done. The SLC
“mechanism” developed with detailed procedures, documentation, tools and capacity, will
support technically competent, transparent and well-managed implementing of other
commune-based SLC projects. The learning gained will support further improvements to
SLC-related policies and the development of the SLC program in Cambodia.

19.    The project was implemented through a strong team-based collaborative approach
involving much exchange of ideas and learning. Key lessons learned have been compiled
and are summarized in this report. These concern the following.

       (a) Implementation of SLCs needs strong management with close access to key
           decision makers:
       (b) Strong, competent and balanced project teams should be established at an early
           stage:
       (c) Develop public – private partnership arrangements whereby specialised private
           sector service providers and NGOs can be used to complement the work of
           government agencies in the implementation of SLCs:
       (d) Further strengthen the capacity of Commune Councils to prepare and enable
           them to perform decentralised functions and decision making responsibilities
           for more responsive and locally appropriate implementation.
       (e) Develop more comprehensive, coherent but flexible and participatory
           approaches to community and agricultural / livelihood development before the
           land recipients move to the SLC site:
       (f) SLC projects need a systematic and coordinated M&E system which includes a
           well-focussed and coherent programme of evaluation and learning to support
           project improvement and policy discussions:

20.     Considering the positive experiences and learning from the project and that it was
designed at least in part, as a pilot project to test and improve the commune-based SLC
process, two main recommendations are made for follow up actions. These relate to: (1)
strong support for the implementation of the proposed LASED II, and (2) a structured, in-
depth and evaluative study to generate the learning from LASED that can guide broad pro-
poor land policy development in Cambodia.

(b) Comments on draft ICR:

21.     Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF): Actually, our technical team provided
comments on the LASED’s Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) since
09 March 2015 as per requested by Dr. Boramy, Director of LASED. We rechecked again
on the final draft ICR that your provided attachment and so from our technical side doesn’t
have any more comments (received via email on September 10, 2015 and September 15,
2015, respectively).

22.    General Secretariat for Social Land Concession (GSSLC), Ministry of Land
Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC), and National
Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD), Ministry of Interior
(MoI): Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) Project is the
part of the Royal Government of Cambodia Social Land Concession Program. It was
implemented by teams of national and sub-national level with fully cooperation financial
support from the World Bank (WB) and technical assistant from Government of Germany
through GIZ and also implemented with cooperation of 3 Non Government Organization
(NGOs) are Life with Dignity (LWD), Wattanakpheap (WP) and Habitat for Humanity in



                                            59
Cambodia (HBHC), which received funding from Japan, administered by the WB through
Japan Social Development Fund.

23.     The detail activities and the achievement of the project are descripted in the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) as well as result framework analysis, rating of
the project performance, assessments, lessons learns, and comments, which are covered
overall the project gold and as the project Director I accepted this full report.

24.     LASED is the piloting Project on social land concession and since we started to
prepare a concept note in 2005 and continuing to implementation stage and then now we
reach the goal of the project, we had seen that at the beginning we as implementers faced
many challenges such as many procedures and capacity. But with willingness and
commitment we overcome those challenges and we see the great result that poor and
hopeless peoples got benefit from project activities.

25.    We had learned a lot on working as a team contains of multi-institutions at national
and sub-national and also with development partners and NGOs and the main activities
were discussions, facilitations, cooperation, conversation, brainstorming and participation
with fully respect each other of the team members.

26.     We had seen that we reach some result of the project, but we are still concerning of
the sustainable of the livelihood for those families, who received land from the project and
we should keep take care them for a lite bit more time toward their better in life and till
they can stand by themselves.
