satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: social land\n            concession (SLC) process can be effectively used to target\n            poor landless and land-poor households for inclusion in the\n            SLC program. Involving key stakeholders at the beginning of\n            the SLC identification process can accelerate critical\n            decisions affecting SLC registration. Complaints handling\n            mechanism adequately addressed grievances arising from the\n            selection process. Settling-in support in the form of land\n            clearance and preparation at the transition stage is\n            critical to support beneficiary households most of who do\n            not have assets and regular income. Public-private\n            partnership arrangements should be developed with\n            specialized service providers and Non-Government\n            Organization\u2019s (NGOs) to complement government efforts.\n            Coordination with line agencies needs to be strengthened to\n            provide comprehensive support services to communities; this\n            requires strong capacity at the secretariat level to\n            coordinate these relationships. For sustainable scale up of\n            the SLC program, government will need to invest in\n            developing institutional capacity at all levels of\n            government structures involved in the process. Comprehensive\n            and integrated livelihood approach and support is required\n            to truly transform landless and land-poor land recipients\n            into small holder farmers."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T23:34:01Z"}
