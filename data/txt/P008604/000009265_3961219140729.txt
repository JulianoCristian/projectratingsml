MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
POLISH POWER GRID COMPANY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Polish Power Grid Company (PPGC) in the amount of US$160 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed currency pool loan would be on standard
IBRD terms with a 17 year maturity including four years of grace and would help
to finance investments in the Polish high voltage transmission system.
2.    Background.    The  Polish  Government  launched  in  1990  an  Economic
Transformation Program. In that context it sought the Bank's cooperation to
develop an energy policy that would enhance efficiency and competition in the
energy sector. Implementation started with the Energy Resource Development
Project (Loan 3215-POL), followed by the Heat Supply Restructuring and
Conservation Project (Loans 3377/83-POL), which included an energy Sector
Adjustment Loan (SECAL; Loan 3377-POL), and the Katowice Heat Supply and
Conservation Project (Loan 3809-POL). The SECAL supported a comprehensive energy
sector restructuring program, including demonopolization, commercialization and
privatization of energy sector enterprises where possible, price adjustment
towards economic levels, and introduction of a sound regulatory framework.
3.    Energy Sector Restructuring. Under the energy sector restructuring program
major changes have been and are being implemented in order to make the energy
sector more competitive and viable. Demonopolization has proceeded apace. The
power sector is completely demonopolized and consists of one transmission
company, 34 generating enterprises and 33 distribution enterprises. Substantial
restructuring is expected to take place between the generators based on
economic/financial criteria, grouping them into a small number of competitive
companies. Coal mines have been restructured into seven large and three small
companies. A closure program for eight out of 71 mines is underway, and four
other mines are expected to be slated for closure shortly. The Polish Oil and
Gas Company, the last remaining monopoly, has divested itself of some service
companies; this is to be followed by separation of the exploration and
distribution  companies.    To  enhance  competition,  the  first  gas  and oil
exploration and production licenses were awarded to AMOCO and British Gas;
contracts for coal-bed methane exploration and production were awarded to AMOCO
(IFC has an US$8.7 million equity stake in an AMOCO-operated coalbed methane
project in Poland) and McCormick. In the district heating sector, significant
restructuring is underway with a new emphasis on network efficiency improvements,
energy conservation, cost reduction and competitiveness with other heat sources.
Since June 1991, the number of district heating enterprises has increased from
50 to about 500, largely as a result of the break-up of regional monopolies.
4.    Progress has also been made in enterprise commercialization but less so in
privatization.   The Polish Power Grid Company was created as a joint-stock
company in August, 1990. A February 1993 law transferred the responsibility for



2
commercialization of the power and coal sectors to the Ministry of Industry. All
power   distribution   enterprises   were   commercialized   in  July,   1993.
Commercialization of the generating plants has lagged behind: only three out of
34 have been commercialized and commercialization of the remainder awaits a
decision on the restructuring of the generators (para 3). All coal enterprises
were commercialized in March, 1993 into seven multi-mine companies and three
single-mine companies. In the gas sector the Polish Oil and Gas Company is
expected to be commercialized by the end of 1995. In the district heating sector
about 100 out of 500 enterprises have been commercialized, including those of
Gdansk, Gdynia and Krakow, all Borrowers under the Bank's Heat Supply
Restructuring and Conservation Project. Those enterprises have started to spin
off service companies which, in several instances, have been privatized. Six
small DHEs have been privatized, which makes the district heating sector the
first energy sector in Poland where actual privatization of operating companies
took place.   However,  it is unlikely that privatization of larger energy
enterprises, such as electricity generating plants, will occur in the near
future.
5.    PPGC is fully owned by the Polish Treasury.   Public ownership of a
transmission company is considered desirable when the future ownership structure
of the generating and distribution companies has not yet been decided upon, or
as long as there is insufficient experience with private ownership of these
segments of the power sector.   In those cases, public ownership provides
stability of the most critical part of the power system in a rapidly changing
environment.
6.    Continued implementation of the Government's energy sector strategy is
critical for the development of the sector, and good progress has been made in
energy pricing policy.  Coal prices, adjusted for quality, are now being set
virtually freely by the market and have almost reached import parity levels.
Coal mine operating subsidies have been eliminated except for those mines that
are being closed down, and coal export controls have been suspended. Prices of
network fuels, though still being controlled, have reached on average about 60%
of estimated economic levels.   Household prices for power and gas are now
significantly higher than the corresponding industry prices, while household
subsidies for heat and hot water consumption have been reduced from 78Z in mid-
1991 to about 10% by January 1,1995.   These subsidies have been eliminated
already in many major cities and are expected to be eliminated in most of the
country by the end of 1996. The current system of approximately quarterly price
adjustments is expected to result in modest real price increases for the network
fuels over the medium term.
7.    The SECAL's energy pricing conditionality stipulated that household prices
for gas and electricity should reach parity with industry price levels and that
household prices for district heat should reach 60% of the industry price, i.e.,
subsidies should be reduced to 40%.  Those targets were met.   Nevertheless,
significant further work needs to be done for all prices to reach economic
levels.  The relatively greater adjustment effort would need to be focused on
household prices, because their price levels range from 50-66% of estimated
economic levels, depending on the type of fuel. However, the Bank recognizes
that special measures should be taken to protect the lowest income groups. This



3
could be done through measures that do not encourage excessive use of energy.
The Bank and the Government are engaged in a policy dialogue on how to proceed
with price adjustment to ensure that energy prices would reach economic levels,
based on Polish economic costs, in the medium term.
8.    The Government has prepared a draft energy law for presentation to the
Parliament. This law would set up the future energy regulatory framework and
establish an Energy Regulatory Agency.  As it stands, the draft provides for
competition in the network fuel subsectors and for open access to new entrants.
The Energy Regulatory Agency would have adequate autonomy, subject to overall
accountability to the Council of Ministers. The Bank/ESMAP will cooperate with
the drafting of secondary legislation, permits, licenses, statutes and training
of personnel for the future Energy Regulatory Agency.
9.    Electricity Market.   Under the emerging electricity market framework
designed by PPGC with the cooperation of qualified consultants, long term (up to
20 years) power purchase agreements are now being signed between PPGC and the
individual generators for 80% of each generator's output. About 15-20% of each
generator's output would be sold to PPGC under short-term (up to 1 year) power
sales agreements. In the long run, about 5% could possibly be sold on a daily
(spot market) basis. The short-term and daily contracts would have higher profit
margins than the long-term contracts, in order to compensate for uncertainty.
PPGC would sign contracts with all generators connected to the 220 and 400 kV
network. Generators connected to the 110 kV network would have the option to
sign contracts either with PPGC or directly with the distribution companies.
10.   The long-term power purchase agreements were developed in cooperation with
the Bank and USAID. Such agreements are of paramount importance to investors and
lenders, since under limited recourse financing only the revenues from the sale
of power are available to cover debt service payments and dividends. Payments
are divided between capacity and energy charges.   Capacity charges cover all
fixed costs, including debt service and depreciation. The energy charges cover
the variable portion of the costs associated with power generation plus a profit
margin. Separate grid charges have been established, on the basis of which supply
competition could develop over time. Access to transmission and distribution
networks would be open to competing power sources, including independent power
producers. Franchising, under which one company would operate the system but the
assets themselves would be owned by another company, would be another possible
way of enhancing efficiency within distribution.   This option is currently
favored over the concession option, under which one company owns and operates the
assets for an extended period of time.
11.   Integrated Resource Planning.   Demand for electric power in Poland has
fallen sharply since 1990, although modest growth resumed in 1995. Therefore,
projects focusing on rehabilitation (rather than capacity expansion) and
introduction of economically justified pollution control equipment now have
priority. During project preparation the Bank and PPGC, under USAID, Austrian
and French grant financing, initiated a program aimed at encouraging an
economically more efficient allocation of power sector resources. This program
covered supply-side resource planning at generation, transmission and
distribution levels and demand-side resource planning (measures for modifying the



4
timing and level of consumer demand).  As a result PPGC, in cooperation with
Polish institutes and local and foreign consultants, completed a least-cost
generation investment study in 1994 and established an integrated resource
planning unit. Further training for that unit would be provided from the Bank
loan's technical assistance component.
12.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.   This project is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy as discussed by the Board of Directors during the
presentation of the Katowice Heat Supply and Conservation Project on November 17,
1994 and according to which the Bank would aim at: (i) assisting the Government
in addressing the most critical structural issues (public finance reform,
downsizing of large loss-making sectors and financial sector reform); (ii)
supporting private sector development and catalyzing private sector financing or
participation; and (iii) financing medium-sized projects in social and economic
infrastructure with increased emphasis on projects at the local government level.
The Bank's strategy in the energy sector envisages projects that support priority
rehabilitation and modernization investments in the power, district heating and
gas subsectors that enhance energy conservation and efficiency and reduce
environmental pollution.   In the coal subsector the Bank aims to assist the
Government's downsizing efforts by helping to mitigate the social cost of
restructuring.
13.   Under the Energy Resource Development project (Loan 3215-POL) the Bank
supports gas pricing reform; domestic production of gas; and increased private
sector participation in developing petroleum resources.  Under the SAL (Loan
3247-POL), coal prices were decontrolled and the first steps were taken towards
elimination of energy-related subsidies and cross-subsidization of household
energy consumers. Under the Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project
(Loans 3377/83-POL), in particular the SECAL of that project (Loan 3377-POL), and
under the Katowice Heat Supply and Conservation Project (Loan 3809-POL), the Bank
broadened and deepened its support for further comprehensive energy sector
restructuring (para 3). While good progress has been made on energy pricing, the
Government and the Bank are engaged in a policy dialogue about the additional
measures needed to bring energy prices to their economic levels (para 6) and to
introduce the new regulatory framework (para 8).
14.   In preparing this project, the lessons learned in past power projects were
applied.   Special emphasis was put on ensuring that all preparatory work
necessary for project implementation was done prior to loan effectiveness.
Furthermore, the project takes place within the framework of the continuing
policy dialogue with the Government regarding the energy sector restructuring
program, particularly as it relates to achieving further improvement in energy
pricing policies, introduction of a sound regulatory framework, and integrated
resource planning. This is consistent with the principal recommendations of the
Bank's 1992 Energy Sector Policy Paper.
15.   Proiect Description.   The project comprises:   (a) investments in:  (i)
rehabilitation and upgrading of key 400 and 220 kV substations; (ii)
modernization of high voltage transmission lines; and (iii) provision of shunt
reactive power compensation for the 400 kV system; and (b) technical assistance
to PPGC through consultancy services and staff training.

16.   Satisfactory performance of the Polish power system can only be achieved
by ensuring a self-sufficient and reliable system that also meets the
requirements of the West European Union for the Coordination of Production and
Transmission of Electricity (UCPTE), which Poland intends to join in 1997.
Various studies were undertaken to determine the optimal transmission network
configuration through the year 2010 and to design the transmission investment
program accordingly. This program, of which the project is an integral part,
represents the optimal sequencing of these investments. It consists of urgently
needed rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing facilities (lines and
substations), combined with a long-term functional reconfiguration of the high
voltage 400, 220 and 110 kV networks.  The latter would gradually reduce the
current subtransmission function of the 110 kV network and enable it to become
a distribution network only.
17.   The project is part of a larger investment program to reinforce Poland's
high voltage grid. The Bank loan would finance only the direct foreign exchange
costs of those high priority components for which procurement and implementation
can start immediately.   Not included under Bank financing are, for example,
construction of a major substation and two major new transmission lines for the
Ostrow system, due to the fact that their right-of-way acquisition and
environmental assessments are not sufficiently advanced.
18.   Environmental Aspects.   The project is rated environmental category B.
Audible noise within the substations is taken care of through noise suppression
techniques as part of the project design. Population resettlement would not be
required. Provision will be made for oil containment at the transformers for all
substations, together with fire prevention water deluge systems. None of the
equipment to be installed under the project will utilize Poly-Chlorinated
Biphenyls (PCBs), a highly toxic substance that was until recently used as a
coolant in electricity networks worldwide. A study undertaken by PPGC and
reviewed by the Bank has found that there is no PCBs present in the high voltage
network.
19.   Transmission losses would be reduced through network reinforcement and
rehabilitation.   This would reduce the need for energy production and would
provide further incentives for the permanent decommissioning of some of the
oldest and most polluting generating units. The project fits, therefore, well
in Poland's climate strategy under the Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as with its obligations
under the Second Sulfur Protocol.
20.   Procurement would be carried out by PPGC's procurement unit.  The unit has
qualified staff, is well equipped and has received training in international
procurement by specialized Bank staff.   The project includes a retroactive
financing provision for up to 10% of the loan amount to cover eligible
procurement expenditures incurred before the date of the loan signature.
21.   All equipment and materials to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds
would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Goods manufactured in Poland would receive a domestic preference in bid
evaluation in line with the provisions of the Bank's procurement guidelines for
international competitive bidding. All bidding packages for equipment estimated



6
to cost US$300,000 equivalent or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review
of procurement documentation. Other contracts would be subject to ex-post review
after contract award. Consulting services to be financed from the loan proceeds
would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. All documents relating to procurement of consulting services would
be subject to the Bank's prior review.
22.   The total project cost is estimated at US$276 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$168 million (61Z). The Bank would provide 95X
of the foreign exchange financing, including interest during construction. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amount and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 15068-POL, dated November 3, 1995, are also attached.
23.   The Borrower of the Bank loan will be PPGC.  The entity is well managed and
capable of implementing the project within the agreed timetable. Its financial
position and viability are sound. PPGC is not dependent on the state budget and
would finance its investment program entirely from net internal cash generation
and borrowings. Hence, the project would not have a negative fiscal impact.
24.   Agreed Actions. PPGC agreed to the following principal actions:   (a)
present a proposal to introduce a sound corporate financial management
organization and thereafter implement this; (b) prepare a comprehensive program,
including detailed guidelines, for the rehabilitation of the interconnected high
voltage network and thereafter issue these guidelines; (c) prepare a program to
introduce environmentally constrained economic dispatching and thereafter
implement this; (d) prepare a PCBs study for the 110 kV distribution network; (e)
generate funds from internal sources sufficient to obtain a 30X net internal cash
generation ratio based on a three-year moving average; and (f) maintain a debt
service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times the annual debt service.   The
Government agreed that it will review and revise air pollution emission standards
for the power sector and ensure compliance with these standards on a least-cost
basis.
25.   Benefits.   The benefits calculation is based on PPGC's entire six-year
investment program, which has an estimated rate of return of 21%. This method
has been followed because the benefits of the project cannot be objectively
quantified in isolation from other components of the program. PPGC's incremental
transmission and net export revenues have been used as a proxy for the economic
benefits; these revenues were calculated on the basis of 1995 tariffs and
import/export contracts and assume no tariff or contract price increases in real
terms.   Quantifiable benefits can be described as follows:   (a) enhanced
reliability of the transmission system, resulting in reductions in system
disturbances such as outages and faults; (b) reduced transmission losses and
operation and maintenance costs; (c) increased income from power wheeling and
exports.   The benefits of the program, and the project's success, would be
measured based on these criteria.   The program would also lead to reduced
environmental pollution, but those benefits have not been quantified.   The
economic rate of return would go down to 12% if: (i) investment costs were to
increase by 50%; or (ii) all benefits were to decrease by 40%; or (iii)



7
increase by 50%; or (ii) all benefits were to decrease by 40%; or (iii)
investment costs were to increase by 20% and all benefits were to decrease
simultaneously by 25%.
26.   Without the program, self-sufficiency and reliability of the Polish power
system would not be ensured. As a result, Poland would not be able to meet the
performance and interconnection criteria that would allow it to become a UCPTE
member. For PPGC this would mean, inter alia, that a portion of its domestic
sales and export contracts would be on an interruptible basis and at lower
contract prices; electricity exports to Germany would cease; and operating and
maintenance costs and transmission losses would increase, resulting in
inefficiency in system operation and dispatching. In addition, the environmental
benefits of the program would not be achieved.
27.   Risks. The main risk associated with the project is the possibility of
delayed nationwide increases in electricity prices needed to ensure that
consumers receive the proper economic signals. Such a delay could negatively
affect the Grid's internal cash flow, needed for further system improvements.
However, this risk is manageable, given the Government's commitment to energy
price reform as demonstrated in energy pricing adjustments undertaken since 1990
and its efforts to introduce an energy regulatory framework, combined with recent
favorable changes in asset revaluation and depreciation policy. Furthermore, the
project's cash flow is based on the conservative assumption of zero price
increases in real terms over the medium term. Price decreases in real terms are
highly unlikely over the medium term and would, in first instance, only lead to
a slowing down of the pace of investments and their associated benefits. The
risk of procurement and implementation delays are manageable because: (a) PPGC
has set up a procurement unit that has received training from specialized Bank
staff; (b) adequate staff has been allocated to the different project management
activities. This staff could, if necessary, be assisted by consultants who would
provide both functional support as well as training under the project's technical
assistance component; and (c) tight reporting schedules on procurement and
implementation progress during supervision.
28.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
