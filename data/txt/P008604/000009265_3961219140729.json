The\n            project comprises the following major components: 1)\n            substation modernization program, consisting of the\n            modernization of strategic substations in the Western and\n            Central-Western regions of Poland to meet the design\n            performance levels required for the system reliability and\n            international interconnections and shunt reactive\n            compensation at specific substations to ensure steady\n            voltage control; 2) the 220 kilovolt line modernization\n            program; and 3) technical assistance to PPGC."}, "docdt": "1995-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
