The key lessons convey that the\n            sustained project management successfully implemented the\n            program, through the involvement of leading groups at the\n            Provincial, Prefecture, and County levels, who supported\n            full time management offices, thus, greatly enhancing relief\n            operations. Likewise, the consistent involvement of local\n            communities in reconstruction efforts, in both Inner\n            Mongolia and the Yunnan Province, was an important\n            participatory factor towards a satisfactory long-term\n            sustainability. Furthermore, the adoption of simplified\n            procurement procedures had a definite and positive impact on\n            the efficiency of the program, with satisfactory compliance\n            rates, even when on occasions, the lowest bid was rejected\n            in lieu of high-quality work. Regardless of success, it is\n            suggested that appropriate financial tracking systems should\n            be in place at project inception, thus, avoiding\n            implementation delays and/or sanctioning of expenditures,\n            particularly for emergency lending. In addition, early\n            availability of funds could be essential to address disaster\n            repairs in a timely fashion."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
