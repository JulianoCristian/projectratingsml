increase fish production in the 100-250 m depths of\n            South China Sea, thus relieving pressure on near-coastal\n            resources; (ii) develop coastal mud flats and low-lying land\n            for aquaculture; (iii) increase production of fruits on\n            sloping land; (iv) bring new land into agricultural\n            production and improve river flow conditions in the Pearl\n            River delta; and  provide modern agroindustrial facilities\n            for handling and processing. To achieve these objectivess\n            the project proposes: (1) provision of 86 fishing vessels;\n            (2) construction of about 4,000 ha of ponds and 11,000 cages\n            for aquaculture; (3) improvement of 10,700 ha and\n            establishment of 3,300 ha of orchards on uncultivated hilly\n            lands; (4) land reclamation works for improvement and\n            expansion of 6,500 ha of surgarcane; (5) establishment of\n            agroprocessing facilities to utilize locally available raw\n            materials; and  (6) a poverty alleviation package comprising\n            studies, infrastructure and development loans for households\n            and village groups in a recognized poverty area."}, "docdt": "1991-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
