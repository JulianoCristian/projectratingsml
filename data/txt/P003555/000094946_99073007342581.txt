GUANGDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AND
EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
(CREDIT 2307-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)  for the Guangdong
Agricultural Development Project and Earthquake Reconstruction Program, Credit
230'70-CHA. The IDA Credit for this project in the amount of SDR 121.7 million ($162
million) was approved on November 5, 1991 and made effective on March 27, 1992.
Apart from SDR 50.63 million, which was transferred to an Inner Mongolia and Yunnan
Earthquake Reconstruction Program, as was agreed by the Government of China and
IDA. during the mid-term review (separate ICR -Report no. 19470 will be submitted by
the 'Urban Development Sector Unit to the Bank Group), all of the credit was disbursed.
The last disbursement took place on May 29, 1998.
The ICR was prepared by an IDA mission' that visited the project area in January
1999. The Borrower had prepared an evaluation of the project's execution and extensive
supporting documentation, which provided the basis for the report. In addition, the ICR
is based on materials in the project file and the results of field visits combined with
extensive discussions with the project staff in Guangdong Province.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives and Description
1.  The main objectives of the project were to assist the Borrower and Guangdong
Province to (a) increase fish production in 100-200 m depth of the Northern Continental
Shelf of the South China Sea, relieving pressure on near-coastal resources; (b) develop
land unsuitable for agriculture, coastal mud flats and shallow water areas for aquaculture;
(c) increase fruit production on sloping land; (d) bring new land in the Pearl River Delta
into agricultural production; (e) provide modern agroindustrial facilities for handling and
processing; and (f) alleviate poverty in limestone mountain areas.
2.   The project components included: (a) marine fisheries--provision of 86 fishing
vessels; (b) aquaculture--construction of ponds and cages and improvement of support
facilities; (c) fruit production--improvement and establishment of litchi, longan and
pornelo orchards; (d) sugarcane and vegetable production--land reclamation works; (e)
agroindustries--construction and equipping of facilities; (f) limestone mountain poverty
alleviation--program of sub-loans, infrastructure and studies; and (g) institutional
development-- research, training, study tours and consultants' services.
3.   The overall project objective was consistent with the development priorities of the
Guangdong Government. The project comprised components that addressed several
conLstraints to productivity in each subsector: replacement of outdated, limited-range
fishing vessels to increase the volume of catches, while shifting fishing efforts from the
overexploited shallow coastal waters to the relatively underexploited deeper offshore
areas; land reclamation with the multiple purposes of expanding the agricultural area,
improving navigation and increasing drainage capacity; fruit tree expansion and
rehabilitation, taking advantage of the province's subtropical climate, to increase
production while utilizing hilly lands with limited alternative uses; introduction of
erosion control measures to reduce siltation in the delta's network of estuaries; and
generation of additional income for farmers in mountainous areas.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.   Major Revisions.  The following major changes took place during project
implementation. (a) Marine Capture Fishery: the number of vessels was reduced from 86
to 28. Auxiliary facilities such as the cold storage and wharf were also reduced



v
accordingly. Such adjustment was in line with the fisheries resource situation, and hence
more realistic; (b) Land Reclamation: the Modaomen development area of Zhuha was
replaced by Zhongshan Municipality, and the crop area was adjusted accordingly from
6,446 ha to 4,998 ha, since Zhuhai was rezoned as a commercial development area, and
agricultural development activities were discontinued; (c) Qingyuan Poverty Reduction:
investment in the expansion of the Yingde Sugar Plant was replaced by 1,500 ha of off-
season snow pea planting, because the expansion was funded by the government; and (d)
Construction of two agroprocessing plants was canceled due to market changes.
5.  Attainment of Project Objectives.  The project substantially achieved the
objectives of agricultural growth in Guangdong Province. As a result of satisfactory
performance of most subcomporents--marine fishery, aquaculture, land reclamation, fruit
development, Qingyuan poverty alleviation--and the partial agroprocessing component,
the economic rate of return (ERR) of each component has been reestimated at 19.6, 16.7,
20.7, 26.7, 18.5, and 11.2 percent, respectively. The overall ERR for the project as a
whole has been estimated at 22.2 percent, somewhat below the appraisal estimate of 28
percent due to increased capital construction costs for the land reclamation, fruit
development and Qingyuan poverty alleviation components and reduced benefits for the
aquaculture (shrimp disease) and agroprocessing (market change) components. In
addition to production growth, the project gained good social and environment benefits.
It also contributed to the technology advancement and management capacity
enhancement of the project management offices at various levels.
6.  Project Cost. The total project cost at appraisal was estimated at $303.79 million.
As a result of substantial adjustment and devaluation of the Renminbi (at the time of
appraisal, $1=Y 5.32, which was adjusted to $1=Y 8.3), the actual total project cost at
project completion was $242.16 million, of which 42.7 percent was financed by the IDA
credit (53.3 percent at appraisal). It was agreed during the mid-term review that the
unused portion of the credit would be transferred to an Earthquake Rehabilitation
Program in Inner Mongolia and Yunnan, which was later increased by the refund
mentioned in para. 22 of the main text, making the total transfer SDR 50.63 million,
representing about 41 percent of the credit amount.
7.  Major Factors Affecting the Project. Among the major factors affecting the
project, some were beyond the control of the government, or the implementing agency,
such as natural disasters, market changes and the unexpected fast economic development
of Guangdong. Others were related to fund shortage, management problems and
government regulatory policy on banking and financing.
8.   Sustainability. Sustainability of the investments and improvements made by the
project is assessed as likely. However, close and continued attention by the provincial
government will be required to: (a) fund operation and maintenance (O&M) adequately
through appropriate channels; (b) create new market channels, instead of waiting for
outsiders to collect the products; hence the information systems need to be established
and improved; (c) establish reliable sources for fish fingerlings to reduce dependence on
captured wild ones. For this purpose, a more aggressive program of hatchery support
facilities should be considered; (d) promote the household responsibility system in



vi
agricultural production; (e) continue efforts in research and proven technology transfer;
(f) vary structure adjustment, to reduce risks caused by market changes.
9.  IDA and Borrower's Relationship.  In general, the relationship between IDA
and the Borrower was good. A lot of good suggestions both during the project
preparation and implementation stages with regard to the project concept, the project
design, and technical issues were appreciated and accepted by the Borrower. The
Borrower did a good job on project feasibility studies of the various components, and
conducted successfully the appraisal of the Qingyuan Poverty Reduction Component
under the guidance of IDA. It cooperated well with IDA missions. The case of
misallocation of project funds was handled effectively by both sides.
10.  Assessment of Project Outcome.  The project's overall outcome is viewed as
satisfactory, since the most important objectives of agricultural growth and development,
and poverty alleviation are achieved with a relatively high degree of sustainability. The
overall ERR at completion is estimated at 22.2 percent, which is impressive though
somrewhat below the appraisal estimate, in view of the difficulties the project faced
throughout the project implementation, including natural disasters of various kinds and
market changes, etc. Overall the project has a fairly strong development impact through
the provision of scarce investment funds for the expansion of agricultural production.
The project is not viewed as highly satisfactory, because of the delay in commissioning
of some of the agroprocessing production and the need for the Borrower to refund some
of thae credit to IDA.
Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
11. Future Operations. For those works completed successfully, the main focus will
be shifted to O&M  of the completed works.  Further improvements are under
consideration, such as variety adjustment to maximize profits and to minimize the risks;
and replacement of low-value fish species with high-value ones.  Technology
advancement would continue to play an important role in the future operations and a
market strategy would be formed. While doing so, fund sources, organization and
maniagement, technology applied, and monitoring indicators would be clearly defined.
For those subcomponents that did not do well during project implementation, an action
plani would be worked out, indicating ways to improve the performance, especially with
planits under the agroprocessing component, such as closure or regrouping the assets and
liabilities, with the purpose of revitalizing those potential successors and avoiding further
losses.
12. Key Lessons Learned. The main lessons learned are: (a) keep the project design
simple; (b) ensure proper institutional arrangements are in place for complex projects; (c)
allow flexibility in project design and activities adjustment; (d) ensure procurement
arrangements are in line with project design and planning; (e) encourage proven
techmology transfer; (D involve the private sector in agroprocessing; (g) ensure
beneficiary participation; and (h) plan the replication of project activities.

AND
EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
(CREDIT 2307-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
i.   To support the Government's decentralization efforts, the World Bank Group
assisted a number of provinces with a series of agricultural development projects in the
late 1980s and early 1990s. Guangdong was selected as one of them for the following
reasons:
* Guangdong Province entered a period of rapid economic growth after the
economic reforms conmmenced in 1978. Among the initial four Special
Economic Zones (SEZs), three were located in the Province (Shenzhen, Zhuhai
and Shantou). The total production value of the Province in 1989 reached 54.9
billion yuan and per capita income of the rural population reached 955 yuan.
Nevertheless, there was still 10 percent of the population whose income was far
below the provincial average, and the national average.
- Guangdong determined to continue to position itself as a forerunner of an
export-oriented economy with little or no control on prices and the market
mechanism. In addition to the development of the Pearl River Delta area,
additional efforts were promised to be made to develop interior regions,
particularly the mountainous areas where relative poverty was still prevalent.
2.   The Bank Group became familiar with Guangdong through its involvement in the
Rubber Development Project (Cr. 1417/SF 005-CHA), which covered the two provinces
of Guangdong and Hainan. Other agricultural development projects (ADPs) of a similar
nature financed by the Bank Group include the provinces of Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi,
Hebei, Henan and Shandong.
B. Project Objectives and Description
3.   The objectives of the project were to: (a) increase fish production in the area
beyond 100 m depth of the Northern Continental Shelf of the South China Sea, while
relieving pressure on near-coastal resources; (b) develop land unsuitable for agriculture,
coastal mud flats and shallow water areas for aquaculture; (c) increase production of



2
fruits on sloping land; (d) bring new land into agricultural production and improve river
flow conditions in the Pearl River Delta; (e) provide modem agroindustrial facilities for
handling and processing; and (f) formulate and implement a poverty alleviation package
focused on the limestone mountain areas of the province.
4.   The project had the following components: (a) marine capture fisheries--provision
of 86 fishing vessels (66 steel trawlers, 14 refrigerated steel trawlers, and 6 wooden purse
seiners) and support facilities, including five cold stores/ice plants and one wharf; (b)
aquaculture--construction of 2,538 ha of brackish water fish ponds, 734 ha of freshwater
fish ponds, 330 ha of shrimp ponds, 440 ha of oyster cultivation area, 11,000 net cages
for marine and freshwater fish culture and support facilities, including three feed mills
and two hatcheries; (c) agriculture--improvement of 10,700 ha of recently planted litchi,
longan, and pomelo orchards and establishment of 3,282 ha of new litchi and longan
orchards on uncultivated sloping land; (d) land reclamation works, including seadikes,
land leveling, drainage and related infrastructure for the improvement/expansion of
6,446 ha of sugarcane; (e) agroindustry--establishment/expansion of facilities to produce
frozen fruits and vegetables, canned fish, yogurt drink, fruit juice, candied fruits and
jams, dried fruit and fruit pulp, instant noodles, health foods, feed additives and rosin
derivatives; and (f) limestone mountain poverty component--construction of an off-
season vegetable production base in Yanshan County with a cold store; mulberry
development in Qingxin County with a silk plant, fish culture, and development of
sugarcane production including expansion of the existing Yingde Sugar Plant.
5.   The overall project objective set at the time of appraisal was consistent with the
development priorities of Guangdong Government and its Eighth Five-Year
Development Plan (1991-95). The project comprised components that addressed several
constraints to productivity in each subsector: replacement of outdated, limited-range
fishing vessels to increase the volume of catches, while shifting the fishing effort from
the overexploited shallow coastal waters to the relatively underexploited deeper offshore
areas; land reclamation with the multiple-purposes of expanding agricultural area,
improving navigation and increasing drainage capacity; fruit tree expansion and
rehabilitation, taking advantage of the province's subtropical climate, to increase
production while utilizing hilly land with limited alternative uses; introduction of erosion
control measures to reduce siltation in the delta's network of estuaries; and generation of
additional income for farmers in mountainous areas. It was also in line with the Bank
Group's country assistance strategy for the agricultural sector.
C. Achievement of Project Objectives
6.   General. The project substantially achieved the objectives of agricultural growth
in Guangdong Province. As a result of satisfactory performance of most subcomponents--
marine fishery, aquaculture, land reclamation, fruit development, Qingyuan poverty
alleviation--and the partial agroprocessing component, the economic rate of return (ERR)
of each component has been reestimated at 19.6, 16.7, 20.7, 26.7, 18.5, and 11.2 percent,
respectively. The ERR for the project as a whole has been estimated at 22.2 percent,
slightly below the appraisal estimate of 28 percent due to increased capital construction



3
costs for the land reclamation, fruit development and Qingyuan poverty alleviation
components and reduced benefits for the aquaculture (shrimp disease) and agroprocessing
(market change) components.
7.   Physical Results. The project was generally successful in achieving its physical
targets which were revised during project implementation and at the project mid-term
review (MTR). The main revised targets are as follows:
*  Marine Capture Fishery: The number of vessels was reduced from 86 to 28.
The cold stores were reduced accordingly from five to one and the wharf was
canceled. This was because the original proposal was too ambitious. At the
time when the project was prepared, Guangdong proposed procurement of 200
fishing vessels. It agreed to reduce to 86 after repeated discussions with the
Bank missions. Nevertheless, the Bank team thought it might still be too
ambitious in view of the resource conditions of the South China Sea. Hence
prudent procurement arrangement was made: the whole procurement be done in
three batches with only 28 vessels under the first batch. It was also decided that
the second and the third batches would not start until the procured first batch
vessels were operational well and the fish resources proved to be sufficient.
Therefore such adjustment represented a more realistic target. The reduction
was also caused by limited interest of fishing enterprises and fishermen in steel
vessels.
*  Land Reclamation: the Modaomen development area of Zhuhai was replaced by
Zhongshan Municipality, and the crop area was adjusted accordingly from
6,446 ha to 4,998 ha. This is because Zhuhai was rezoned as a commercial
development area and agricultural development activities were discontinued.
-  Qingyuan Poverty Reduction: Investment in the expansion of the Yingde Sugar
Plant was replaced by 1,500 ha of off-season vegetables. This is because (1)
the expansion of the plant was funded by the local government as a local
industrial development project; and (2) the project objective of improving
farmers' income could be more directly met by fully utilizing the climate
advantage of Qingyuan with a high-value, off-season vegetable.
*  The Shenzhen Feed Additive Plant and Shenzhen Foodstuff Processing Factory
were canceled due to market changes.
8.  In terms of physical targets, the project has to date fully achieved its
plarnned/revised targets, and in some cases exceeded them, for the marine fishery, land
reclamation, fruit development, Qingyuan poverty alleviation and agroprocessing
comrrponents, and partially for the aquaculture component. At credit closing, 28 fish
vessels (22 trawler and 6 wooden purse seines) were in operation. The new and improved
litchi, longan and pomelo orchards were established on an area of 13,977 ha. The land
reclamation and improvement affected a total of about 4,945 ha. Ten agroprocessing
plants were constructed. All the above completed physical targets are 100 percent of the



4
SAR and MTR estimates. The poverty alleviation component in Qingyuan county
exceeded appraisal estimates substantially for off-season vegetables (135 percent of SAR
estimates). In the Qingyuan poverty area, 1,600 ha of mulberry, 2,857 ha of off-season
vegetables, 606 ha of freshwater fish ponds, and 2,600 ha of sugarcane have been
established. Most of the targets under the aquaculture component were also achieved,
with the exception of the fish and shrimp pond construction, which was about 607 ha less
than the appraisal. This was mainly caused by a shrimp disease that started nationwide in
1993 and the sea dike consolidation, leaving less investment for pond construction.
9.   Project Cost. The total project cost at appraisal was $303.79 million. As a result
of substantial adjustment and devaluation of the Renminbi (at the time of appraisal,
$1 =Y 5.32, which was adjusted to $1=Y 8.3), the actual total project cost at project
completion was $242.16 million, of which 42.7 percent was financed by the IDA credit
(53.3 percent at appraisal). It was agreed during the MTR that the unused portion of the
credit would be transferred to an Earthquake Rehabilitation Program in Inner Mongolia
and Yunnan, which was later increased by the refund mentioned in para. 22, making the
total transfer SDR 50.63 million, representing 41 percent of the credit amount.
10. Agricultural Benefits. The investment in the two agricultural components (land
reclamation and fruit development) has brought significant benefits in terms of increased
agricultural yields and production. The total cost of the two agricultural components was
about $132.4 million or 55 percent of total project costs, compared to the SAR estimate
of $120.7 million. In the land reclamation component, the area completed and yields for
sugarcane, lotus and banana currently achieved in the project area have equaled or
exceeded the appraisal estimates of yields at full development. The total annual output
increased during the project period (in 1998) by 273,479 tons for sugarcane, 26,325 tons
for lotus, 17,951 tons for banana, and 952 tons for fish. As for the fruit development
component, although the unit yields for longan and litchi achieved to date (initial year in
1998) are only about 27 to 55 percent of the full development targets, they show a
promising increasing trend toward achieving the SAR-projected yields and are likely to
be reached ahead of the appraisal schedule at full development year, mainly due to the
large role played by science and technology. Fruit tree outputs increased substantially in
1998 by 33,000 tons for litchi, 8,100 tons for longan, and 40,500 tons for pomelo. Table 6
shows the area cultivated, yields and production achieved for each component.
11. Marine Culture and Aquaculture Benefits. Likewise, most of the production
targets of the marine capture and aquaculture components were achieved; some exceeded
the appraisal estimates. Marine capture is now possible in relatively unexploited waters,
or in the 100 m depth of the Northern Continental Shelf of the South China Sea. The
project developed freshwater and brackish water fish and shrimp ponds on 2,627.1 ha,
oyster ponds on 440 ha, and built 11,000 freshwater and marine net cages. The cost of the
marine culture and aquaculture components amounted to $57.4 million or 24 percent of
the total project costs, compared to the SAR estimate of $124.72 million (costs were
reduced due to the revised physical targets during the project MTR). The yields and
production of fish and oyster were reported to be satisfactory, generally exceeding
appraisal estimates. Again, shrimp is an exception, as its yields and production were



5
seriously affected by the shrimp disease. The financial impact of the shrimp disease
problem has been substantial, but the high returns on specialty fish production have
compensated for the losses, at least in economic terms. The ERRs were reestimated and
range from 11.3 percent for shrimp ponds in Shanwei to 23.4 percent for freshwater net
cages in Jiangmen.
12. Agroprocessing Benefits. The operation of the agroprocessing plants is marginally
satisfactory compared with the other components of the project. The total cost of this
comrLponent (10 plants) was $27.7 million or 11 percent of the total project cost. This
corrmpares to an appraisal estimate of 12 plants for a total cost of $35.8 million (costs were
reduced due to the revised physical targets and reduced lending from the local bank). All
agroprocessing facilities were fully constructed as designed and approved by the Bank
Group. However, among the 10 completed plants, some of the plants experienced
significant initial problems with raw materials availability, changing market conditions
and inadequate working capital. This led to delays in commissioning, and some plants
have yet to reach their designed output levels. To date, all but two agroprocessing plants
have been commissioned and are operational. (Two are operating well and the outputs
exceed the appraisal target. Six are operational but the output targets have yet to be
reached.) The other two agroprocessing plants are not operational but are expected to find
alternate use and start operation in 1999-2000. Great efforts are required to overcome
the problems described above. The consolidated ERR for the agroprocessing component
amounted to 11.4 percent, lower than the estimated ERR at appraisal, mainly due to the
problems described above.
13.  Poverty Reduction.  The project has effectively reduced the incidence of
poverty for the 57,933 household beneficiaries under the Qingyuan poverty alleviation
conmponent. Annual production increased by about 0.39 million tons for off-season
vegetables, 0.2 million tons for sugarcane, and 4,231 tons for fish in the Qingyuan
poverty area. In 1998 cash income reached 15,000 Yuan/ha for sugarcane, 20,000
Yuan/ha for lotus and 27,000 Yuan/ha for banana producers. The production gains from
high-value cash crops have helped to raise the income level of the farmers. Among the
57,933 household beneficiaries, 27,748 graduated from the poverty group, with the
average per capita income reaching 1,000-1,200 Yuan. Per capita income of the
households engaging in fish culture and fruit production was raised to 1,000 Yuan and
2,000-5,000 Yuan respectively, in 1998. Over 90 percent of the project farmers built new
houses and basically achieved subsistence level of food production.
14. Technology Advancement. Technology advancement was stressed, especially
under fruit and sugarcane development. In total, 37 (35 for fruit and 2 for sugarcane)
research themes were carried out and most proven technologies were applied through the
training program under the project. As a result, fruit bearing of both longan and litchi
was advanced; product quality was improved, hence market competitiveness was
enhanced. The sales price of the project longan at present is much higher than those
produced by the nonproject areas, and even higher than that of Thailand; and the unit
production of pomelo reached 20.62 tons per ha in 1998, representing a 114 percent



6
increase over that of the preproject stage.  Sugarcane production during the first year
reached 90 tons/ha and increased to 120 tons the third year, which was quite high.
15. Social and Environment Benefits. The project enabled better use of sloping land
through fruit development, and promoted environmental improvement: vegetation in the
project area was raised from 30 percent before the project to over 80 percent at present;
the silt inflow into the Pearl River in the Meizhou project area was reduced from 0.7
kg/m3 in 1991 to 0.41 kg/m3 in 1995 when construction was completed; soil and water
erosion was reduced from 4,510 tons/km2 to 2,210 tons/km2. Tidal land development
was accelerated through aquaculture. With this project, Guangdong carried out for the
first time an annual fisheries resource survey and, based on this, a fisheries management
plan was formulated, thus contributing to the prevention of overfishing. Implementation
of the fruit and land reclamation components enabled creation of additional job
opportunities. Induced by large economic gains, enthusiasm of the project surrounding
areas also arose, which was especially obvious in fruit production.
16. Covenants. Covenants focused on (a) establishment of a special account and
revolving fund for fishing vessels, sugarcane production and agroindustries; (b)
environmental aspects (particularly effluent control); (c) marine fish resources
management and monitoring; (d) ownership transfer of fishing vessels; and (e) project
auditing and reporting.  The covenants that are not complied with related to
agroprocessing.
D.  Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors Not Generally Subject to Government Control
17. Natural Disasters.  Natural disasters are among the main factors affecting
performance. The frost and flood in 1992-93 in Meizhou damaged about 63 percent of
the improved orchard and some 60,200 seedlings died; part of the pomelo orchard was
washed away. Additional funds were spent on rehabilitation activities. Other natural
disasters include the severe typhoon in 1993 in Zhongshan, the nationwide shrimp
disease that started in 1993 and the most serious flood in 50 years happened in 1994 in
Qingyuan, all had serious impacts on project implementation, either increasing the
project cost, delaying the implementation, or reducing the physical targets.
18. Market Change.  Market change had serious adverse effects on many project
activities. The silk knitting plant under the Qingyuan poverty alleviation component is a
typical example. Silk production was in its peak stage when the project was prepared.
However, dramatic market changes took place two years after in 1994, resulting in a drop
in silk cocoon purchasing prices; and silk processing was thus affected. The completed
silk knitting plant is not in operation today.
19. Unexpected Fast Economic Development. Fast economic development, which
was unexpected at the time of project preparation, led to the revision of project activities.
Soon after the project started its implementation, Zhuhai was rezoned as the commercial



7
area,, As a result, Zhuhai's land reclamation activity had no other choice but to be
replaced by Zhongshan. Similarly, Guangzhou-Qingyuan Highway was constructed by
the provincial government, which enabled transportation of fresh vegetables from
Qingyuan to Guangzhou in two hours; hence the cold storage constructed under
Qingyuan poverty reduction component became unnecessary.
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
20. Shortage of Working Capital. Shortages of working capital delayed
implementation of some of the agroprocessing plants. Usually such funds were borrowed
by the plants from the local banks. However, total lending by the local banks to the
project activities was only 37.4 percent of the appraisal estimate. The reduced lending
was related to the overheated economy in China in 1993, and the macro policy changes
the following year, especially with respect to banking and financing.
Facitors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
21. Project Management Change of project management from the Provincial
Agricultural Commission during project preparation to the provincial Department of
Finance at the beginning of project implementation had caused some managerial
problems of the project in the initial years: technical support from the line agencies was
weakened, and misuse of procured materials was discovered.
22. Refund and Reallocation. As a result of misuse of procured materials mentioned
in the above paragraph, IDA asked the project office to refund in 1996 a total of
$10,166,350.41. Eight municipalities were involved in such refund and covered areas of
fruit development, land reclamation and aquaculture. The procured steel through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) was exchanged for other materials used by cage
construction, water pipes and wires; part of the chemical fertilizer was sold to the local
input supply cooperative for purposes of receiving the same amount of fertilizer the
folloawing year. The Bank Group was not consulted nor informed of such exchanges.
The government of China (GOC) and IDA agreed during the MTR to reallocate some
SDR 50.63 million to an Earthquake Rehabilitation Program in Yunnan and Inner
Mongolia.
23. Overinvestment In Land and Buildings. Overinvestment in land and buildings
by many agroprocessing plants, induced by the overheated economy in 1993, further
deteriorated the funding shortage problem of the agroprocessing plants.
E. Project Sustainability
24. Sustainability of the investments and improvements made by the project is assessed
as likely. (a) Overall, good arrangements have been made for handover of the
components for operation and maintenance (O&M) and management to the responsible
agencies. (b) Facilities under the project were generally built to high design and
construction standards, and should be able to operate efficiently.  (c) During



8
implementation, the Project Management Office (PMO) promoted effective training and
employment based on qualifications for management and staff for the various facilities,
which should enable efficient operation. (d) Many project components are able to
maintain high levels of income, which is a great incentive to the farmers to continue the
work. (e) Experience gained under the project, especially that of the fruit development
and land reclamation components, is highly replicable and is being used elsewhere. (f)
The Government has a strong commitment to continue to provide strong financial support
to activities like land reclamation and poverty alleviation, which would otherwise be
barely sustainable.
25. Although project sustainability prospects are in general good, close and continued
attention by the provincial government will be required to: (a) fund O&M adequat'nly
through appropriate channels; (b) establish and improve the information system to have
new market channels;  (c) ensure reliable sources for fish fingerlings to reduce
dependence on captured wild ones. For this purpose, a more aggressive program of
hatchery support facilities should be considered; (d) promote the household responsibility
system in agricultural production; (e) continue efforts in research and proven technology
transfer; (f) diversify the economy to reduce risks caused by market changes; (g)
formulate a sound action plan to overcome the difficulties/problems the processing plants
are facing.
26.  Regarding the above issues for project sustainability, project management has
expressed its strong endorsement and commitment.
F. IDA Performance
27. IDA performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was
detailed and is viewed as satisfactory. Overall, IDA performance was appreciated by the
provincial government, especially with regard to the conduct of the marine fisheries
resource survey, formulation of the annual fisheries resource monitoring plan, and sea
dike safety. The procurement package prepared by the IDA mission for the Zhongshan
land reclamation was very much appreciated, as it enabled Zhongshan, which had a late
startup, to catch up with others and complete the work in a timely manner.
28.  IDA performance in project supervision was satisfactory.  Nine supervision
missions were undertaken in five years till 1997, when the physical project works were
completed, with generally two missions per year before 1995 and once per year both in
1996 and 1997. The supervision missions made significant contributions to (a) help
improve of the management skills and competence of PMO staff, to enable them to
follow strictly IDA procedures and rules; (b) resolve technical issues; (c) advise on
design and scope changes, to better meet the local conditions and the market need. In
most cases, the advice provided by the supervision missions had a positive influence on
the project. Many project agencies realized the importance of the supervision
recommendations and most of them were carried out. A special supervision mission was
sent to the field in 1996 when the misuse of procured materials was discovered and
special account was banned.



9
G. Borrower Performance
29. The performance of the project implementing agencies, the provincial PMO, in
conjlanction with PMOs of the line agencies, as well as the municipal and county PMOs
and the related development corporations, was generally satisfactory with the main
exception of the above described case of misappropriation of procured materials. These
agencies prepared several comprehensive feasibility studies for the project, which
covered many of the technical and institutional factors. The provincial PMO also
successfully prepared the appraisal report for Qingyuan poverty alleviation component,
which was highly appreciated by IDA. Early on during project implementation, the
Provincial PMO was shifted from the Agricultural Commission to the Provincial Finance
Bureau. Performance during the transition period were less than satisfactory, but links
with the technical agencies was improved after the supervision missions pointed out the
problem. Such link was strong especially at the municipal/county level. Project staff at
all levels were generally committed to the project objectives and demonstrated project
ownership. The project components were for the most part implemented in line with the
agreed implementation arrangements and most of the changes to designs were addressed
as they occurred. Strong financial support was given by the Borrower. The government
cournterpart fund was greatly increased from $12 million at the time of appraisal to $44.2
million at project completion, to allow for fulfillment of set targets. The Borrower was
cooperative with the IDA missions and followed recommendations of the supervision
missions. Project accounts were audited in a timely manner, and in general the audit
reports were received by IDA on time. A special audit was carried out at the request of
IDA. However, supervision of and guidance to the agroprocessing component were
inadequate.
H. Assessment of Outcome
30. The project's overall outcome is viewed as satisfactory, since the most important
objectives of agricultural growth and development, and poverty alleviation were achieved
with a relatively high degree of sustainability. The overall ERR at completion is
estimated at 22.2 percent, which is impressive, though somewhat below the appraisal
estimate in view of the difficulties the project faced throughout the project
implementation, including the natural disasters of various kinds and market changes, etc.
Overall the project had a fairly strong development impact through the provision of
scarce investment funds for the expansion of agricultural production. The project is not
viewed as highly satisfactory because of delay in some of the agroprocessing
commissioning and the need for the Borrower to refund some of the credit to IDA.
I. Future Operations
31.  The Provincial PMO will be maintained and will continue to work closely with line
agencies to help solve problems and issues arising from project operation.



10
32. The mechanism that integrates scientific research, training and production would
be continued in fruit production and marketing strategies would be worked out.
33. Diversified crop production on the reclaimed land would be the major focus in
future, for purposes of reducing risks to the minimum, while ensuring maximum
profitability. Panyu has already adopted a multicropping structure of sugarcane, lotus
and fish rearing. In the future, improved varieties would be used. Zhongshan is creating
a program to establish a high-yielding banana orchard. In addition, sea dike safety
monitoring would be strengthened. Such work would be carried out by the land
reclamation companies, who have the necessary staff and technology and will continue to
receive financial support from the governnent.
34. A plan is being worked out for the installation of an on-board icemaker, or the use
of supply boats, so as to bring the role of the steel vessels into full play.
35.  With regard to the agroprocessing component, a special action plan needs to be
worked out by the provincial PMO, in consultation with municipal PMOs and the
relevant plants, which should describe in detail the necessary steps to overcome the
problems/difficulties encountered by each plant, such as closure or reorganization of
assets and liabilities, etc. Qingyuan is working out a plan to sell the silk plant by auction.
It is also considering making alternative use of the cold storage, to be open to the public
and to store a variety of products.
J. Key Lessons Learned
36. Simpler Project Design. It would be better if simpler project design would be
considered in the future. This was quite a complex project, which covered almost all
aspects of agriculture. The Qingyuan poverty reduction component is in fact an
integrated regional agricultural development project by itself. The complexity of the
project design required enormous inputs of both IDA and the Borrower during design and
supervision, to cover the full range of skills required by the project.
37.  Involvement of the Private Sector in Agroprocessing. In principle, IDA should
limit its finance in agroprocessing plants. If it is financed, it is vital to have private sector
involvement for purposes of supplying adequate counterpart funds and technology,
management transfer and use of their existing marketing channels. Similarly, adequate
working capital must be assured at appraisal. Adoption of international standards of
technology and adequate management training should receive attention.
38. Proper Institutional Setup. For a complex project, while keeping the PMO in a
nonsector agency, to play an overall coordination role, technical support of the line
agencies is essential, in aspects of providing technical support and being responsible for
implementing the line components. Key persons of PMO should remain relatively stable
during the whole process of project implementation.



11
39. Proven Technology Transfer. A problem frequently encountered by other
projects was difficult transfer of proven technology due to financial constraints.
However, this was not an issue in this project, thanks to the strong financial support of
the financial departments at various levels. Such transfer has promoted success of the
fruit development component.
40. Retaining Flexibility In Project Activities. Experience of this project has shown
that success of a project is only achieved if flexibility is provided in adjusting the project
activities based on changing conditions. Marine capture was successful because of target
adjustment; the silk knitting plant was unsuccessful because no adjustment was made,
even when the market changed and there was no potential for improvement.
41. Beneficiary Participation. Beneficiaries played an active role in project
activities and the authorities involved cooperated closely with each other during the
implementation of the project, which is the basis of the project success.

ANNEX A: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
(April 1999)
1. Project Objectives
1.1 To increase fish production beyond the 100m depth of the Northern Continental
Shelf of the South China Sea, meanwhile relieving pressures on near coastal
resources;
1.2 To develop land unsuitable for agriculture, coastal mud flats and shallow water
areas for aquaculture;
1.3 To increase production of fruits on sloping land;
1.4 To bring new land into agricultural production and improve river flow conditions in
the Pearl River Delta;
1.5 To provide modern agroindustrial facilities for handling and processing;
1.6 To formulate and implement a poverty alleviation package focused on the limestone
mountain areas of the province.
2. Project Background
2.1.1    Guangdong agriculture entered a period of rapid growth after the economic
reforms. However, the benefits of rapid agricultural development have not been
evenly spread through the province. In particular, farmers in the mountain areas in
the northeast continue to be poor and annual income was substantially below the
provincial and national averages. The province has to fully utilize its available land
resources and to develop the hilly and low-lying land. The management of fruits
planted on a large scale at the end of 1980s needs to be strengthened and improved
in order to increase production capacity. 75% of the fishing vessels in the province
were small boats below 20hp, mainly operating within 100m depth of the offshore.
2.2     The project consists of six components: marine capture fisheries, aquaculture,
agriculture, agroindustry and limestone mountain poverty alleviation. They are
mainly located within 16 municipalities and 42 counties in the province.
2.3     The initial steps of the project are divided into four stages:
2.3.1    Identification.  The project was identified by IDA and China Government
in 1988.



29
2.3.2    Preparation. FAO of CP have sent specialists mission both in March 1989
and February 1990 to assist Guangdong Provincial Government in preparing for the
project.
2.3.3    Preappraisal . The Bank's Preappraisal Mission conducted field trips and
preappraisal in project areas in May 1990.
2.3.4    Appraisal. In February 1991, the Mission of World Bank conducted appraisal
of the project.
2.4     The Bank appraised that the total investmnent in the project accounts for
$3,038 million, including 12,170 million SDR (equivalent $162 million) from IDA
which makes up 53.3% of the total.
2.5     Credits from IDA are from MOF to Guangdong Province with repayment
over 15 years, including 5 years of grace period. The annual interest rate is 6%, and
annual commitment rate is 0.5%.
2.6     In February 1991, World Bank undertook negotiations with China in
Washington. The Project Agreement and Development Credit Agreement were
signed and adjusted in December 1991, officially effective in March 1992.
2.7     Allocation of Credits by IDA
2.7.1    In the course of project implementation, Guangdong has discussed about the
credit adjustments with Bank's Project Monitoring Mission. Guangdong suggested
transferring part of credits from marine fishery to civil works of aquaculture, which
was approved by the Bank.
2.7.2    After several talks with Bank's Mission, residual credits resourcing from
cancellation of some sector projects and changes of exchange rate were transferred
to earthquake construction project.
2.7.3    The allocation of credits after adjustment is as follows:
Item        Appraisal        Actual

2.8     Adjustment during Project Implementation
As approved by the Bank, the following projects have been adjusted:
2.8.1   Marine fishery
Item                 Appraisal     Adjustment
Steel pair trawler   66            22
Refrigerated trawler    14         cancelled
Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shantou
Zhanjiang cold stores    1 for each    cancelled
Wharf                              cancelled
2.8.2    Aquaculture
About 480 ha of brackish water ponds in Zhuhai-leizhu and 330 ha in Modaomen
were transferred to Jiangmen-lidongwei 293.3 ha, Mazongsha 534 ha and Jiangmen-
heshan 110 ha of freshwater ponds.
3. Project Results
3.1.1    Project Implementation Progress
3.1.2    Total Investment: Actual investment is $242.16 million, making up 80% of
that at appraisal, among which: $103.46 million from IDA, $103.46 million
supporting capitals self-raised by China. This big change in investment is mainly
due to the adjustment in marine capture component.
3.1.3    The project began in March 1992, and was completed in June 1998.
Construction plans were mostly completed, a large part of sector projects are
operating well.
3.1.4    Credit Disbursement by IDA. Actual disbursement is 71.43 million SDR
(equivalent to $10.346 million), and the last disbursement took place on May 29th,
1998. Please see table 4 for its comparison with appraisal report.

International Tendering Company, China National Instruments Import & Export
Corporation International Tendering Company and Guangdong Machinery Import &
Export Cooperation are authorized to invite bid. The total procurement of $59.41
million is completed, occupying 46% of that at appraisal. Please see Table 3 for
detailed procurement package.
3.2     Project Actual Results
3.2.1   Marine fishery
A. 28 fishing vessels are constructed, making up 100% of that at mid-term adjustment
and 33% of that at appraisal, with 58 ones less than the 86 vessels at appraisal. There
are mainly two reasons for the change: one is due to the changes of fishery resources
in South China Sea. As the captured fish available decrease year by year, China
updated its Marine Fishery Policy toward South China Sea in order to maintain the
ecological sound cycle. It includes elimination of old vessels and limitation of new
vessel. The quota for new vessel is deemed to decrease year by year and till the year
of 1999 the construction of new vessels will fully stop and the index for fishery
output will be zero. Another reason is due to the high expense of capture. As the cost



31
for marine capture increase year by year, fisherman's feeling for capture is hurt
deeply. Thus, project unit proposed to cancel some vessels.
B. 1 cold store is established, making up 100% of that at mid-term adjustment and 20%
of that at appraisal, with 4 ones less than the 5 stores at appraisal; the planned one
wharf is cancelled. Because cold store and wharf are supporting facility of vessels, it
is natural that relative adjustments should be made as the fishing vessels have been
reduced.
3.2.2    Aquaculture
A. Brackish water ponds
a. 1,126 ha of brackish water ponds are developed, reaching up 65% of that at
mid-term adjustment and 44% of that at appraisal. Reasons for the decrease are as
follows: 1) in Jiangmen-fenghuojiao, the base design for the pond is narrow and
small at appraisal. In the course of implementation, it is found that the mud flat is too
soft. Therefore, the original design was altered to solidify the base. As restricted by
the local landform, the total area can not be expanded. Therefore, the enlargement of
pond base brings the pond area much smaller. 2) In Jiangmen-yanan project area,
Guangdong Agriculture Project encountered difficulties after mid-term adjustment.
For a time, the agriculture account was blocked by the Bank, which affected the
progress of disbursement. The project unit thus advanced not to continue the project.
3) As harassed by typhoon in Zhuhai-xiazha, sea dikes there were destroyed. More
investment is used to repair and solidify the dike. But due to the slow domestic
supporting fund, recovery progress for fishing pond is slow, and some of them are
not ready until now.
b. 1,409,000 m3 of sea dikes are constructed, reaching up 102% of that at mid-
term appraisal and 152% of that at appraisal.
c. 4 cold stores are established, reaching up 100% of that at mid-term appraisal
(a cold store in Maodaomen was cancelled at mid-term appraisal) and 80% of that at
appraisal.
B. Freshwater ponds
1,293 ha of freshwater ponds are developed, making up 176% of that at
appraisal. At mid-term appraisal, three new project areas (Jiangmen-lile-
mazongsha, jiangmen-lidongwei and jiangmen-heshan) are designed, adding
937.3ha more project areas in total. Therefore, the final completion area is higher
than that at appraisal.
C. Shrimp culture
a.    208 ha of shrimp ponds are developed, making up 100% of that at mid-term
appraisal and 63% of that at appraisal. The original area for shrimp pond is 330ha,
which are distributed into two project areas. Before mid-term appraisal, one project area
(Meilong) is transferred to a new area (Xiaomo), no area changes have been made.
However, due to shrimp disease in mid-term adjustment, the Bank denied the shrimp
project and Xiaomo shrimp project area had to be cancelled.
b.    30,600 m3 sea dikes are constructed, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
D. Oyster culture
440 ha of oyster beds are completed, reaching up 100% of that at appraisal.



32
E. Marine net cages
a. 8,000 marine net cages are constructed, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
b. 257,000m3 sea dikes are constructed, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
F. Freshwater net cages
3,000 net cages are constructed, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
3.2.3   Agriculture
A.   2,130 ha of litchi are newly planted, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
B.    1,150 ha of longan are newly planted, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
C.    7,517 ha of litchi are improved, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
D.    1,180 ha of longan are improved, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
E.    2,000 ha of pomelo is improved, making up 100% of that at appraisal.
3.2.4    Land Reclamation
4,996 ha of land are developed, making up 100% of that at appraisal and 77% of
that at appraisal. The adjustment is due to that Zhuhai-modaomen project unit
proposed to cancel the project right at the beginning of the implementation.
Therefore, mid-term appraisal added Zhongshan land-reclamation project (531.8ha).
The total project area is reduced.
3.2.5    Agroprocessing
Ten agroprocessing plants are established, making up 83% of that at appraisal.
Due to some factors in identification and bidding, two plants are cancelled.
3.2.6    Poverty Alleviation
A.    1,600 ha of mulberry are cultivated.
B.   2,857 ha of vegetables are cultivated.
C.    3,000 ha of sugarcane are cultivated.
D.   606 ha of freshwater ponds are developed.
E.    1 agroprocessing plant is established.
4. Achievement of Project Objectives
4.1 As an agricultural development project first undertaken by Guangdong Province
with Bank Loans, the project has been invested on a large scale. It includes various
components like marine fishery, aquaculture, agriculture, land reclamation,
agroindustry and poverty alleviation. The project is carried out in 42 counties under
16 municipalities. The implementation of the project has contributed greatly to the
economic growth in rural areas of Guangdong Province.
4.2 The implementation of the project benefits comprehensively the project areas by
improving their infrastructure construction and developing overall utilization of
resources. It allows the vessels to fish off-shore in relatively unexploited deep
waters. By taking advantageous of subtropical climate in the area and developing
those hilly land unsuitable for other plantation, it has increased fruit production
through establishment and expansion of new fruit orchards. Development of coastal
mud flats and low-lying land enlarge the supply of aquatic products. In the project,
measures are taken to prevent soil erosion, which slows down the sedimentation at
the outlet of the Pear River Delta, which creates more cultivated area. In poor rural



33
areas, the project also improved farmers' annual incomes and living conditions on
the increase.
4.3 The implementation of marine fishery project has increased the capacity of fishing
in deep-sea waters. The good equipment and safety function of project vessels have
improved fishing efficiency and made fishing last longer. Fishing are capable in
underutilized water deeper than lOOm. The annual capacity of fishing is 28,580t.
4.4 The aquaculture project not only makes use of low-lying land and coastal mud flats
at coastal zone for aquaculture, it also undertakes net cage culture by use of aquatic
freshwater and brackish water. The project has newly established the high standard
1,126 ha of brackish water ponds, 1,293 ha of freshwater ponds, 208 ha of shrimp
ponds and 440 ha of oyster beds. About 8,000 marine net cages and 3,000
freshwater net cages are constructed along with supporting facilities.
4.5 The project of fruit plantation promotes production capacity of orchards through
improvement of road infrastructure such as road and irrigation system, of production
conditions and orchard management. The project has upgraded those which were
originally low productive, including upgrading 7,517 ha of litchi, 1,180 ha of
longan, 2,000 ha of pomelo. The project has increased high-quality litchi by 2,130
ha, longan by 1,150 ha. At orchard's full development, litchi has an annual
production of 601,00t, longan 34,400t and pomelo 40,500t. Achievements have also
been made on researches on high and steady capacity of fruit production, protection
of flower and fruit from falling, prevention of insects, storage and refreshment of
fruit. All above bring positive effects on future fruit production and development.
4.6 The project of land reclamation has increased the reclamation areas by 3,406.7 ha
and strengthened 1,539 ha. Monitoring on sea dikes, establishment of new road and
bridges, construction of facilities on water and power supply all guarantees the
production's smooth-going in reclamation areas. In 1998, the reclamation land had
2,297 ha of sugarcane plantation with an output of 282,500 ton, 1,015 ha of lotus
with an output of 27,405t, 478.7 ha of banana with an output of 17,95 1t, 1,154 ha of
aquaculture with an output of 952t.
4.7 Most of the agroindustry project has been completed. The project has introduced a
batch of advanced facilities and technological design. However, because of market
changes and long construction period, there are only Guangzhou Frozen Fruit &
Vegetable Plant, Shenzhen Yogurt Drink Plant, Shenzhen Spirulina Food Plant and
Lianshan Rosin processing and Perfumery Plant and Meizhou Longan Drying Plant
in operation at present. Their production capacities have not reached the designed
level. Some of processing plants may go into operation this year, and some may
have to be cancelled. The project can be said not reaching up to the construction
objective.
4.8 The project of poverty alleviation provides 56,330 households poor farmers with
productive capital. With the capital, 1,600 ha of mulberry trees have been planted



34
and silkworms are raised. Due to the price changes of silkworm cocoon, the scale of
mulberry plantation and silkworm raising have been greatly reduced. About 2,857
ha of off-season vegetables and 2,200 ha of sugarcanes are planted; 606 ha of
freshwater ponds and other supporting facilities are established. All these projects
involve farmers with direct management. The project has also resettled farmers from
bare living-condition and poor-cultivated limestone areas to suitable places,
providing them with daily necessities and productive capital. At the same time, 400
ha of cultivated land (for sugarcane and rice farming) are developed to improve
farmer's living standard. According to SAR, a small cold store and silk
manufacturing factory are established to provide further processing services for local
products. The implementation of the project had increased input in production,
promoted productivity and improved management mode. The annual output of off-
season vegetable is 39,100t, sugarcane is 165,000t, and aquatic products 5,000t.
4.9 To meet the requirement of different production stages, the project management
staff, technicians, farmers and fisherman participating in the project have received
training at municipal, county and township level. Good results have been achieved.
The construction period has seen about 250,000 project management staff, farmers
and fishermen in technical and managerial training. Materials on relevant techniques
and daily management knowledge have been distributed, which helps to improve
farmer's management knowledge in project areas.
4.10 The project has altogether sent 14 missions and 69 technicians and managerial staff
to countries like U.S.A, Canada, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Thailand, Philippines,
Holland, Australian, Brazil etc to study advanced techniques management and
processing designs on marine fishery, aquaculture, plantation, land reclamation,
agroprocessing etc. The study tours equipped a batch of managerial staff and
technicians with advanced management skill and techniques. They play a key role in
the implementation and later operation of the project, and will function more in
future project utilizing foreign capitals.
4.11 The project has achieved good social benefits. The implementation of the project
makes full use of local labor powers. There are 358,213 persons involving directly
in the production. Meanwhile, the project encourages the development of other local
industries, such as services before or after production processes, which contributes
to the increase of farmers' income. The project also sets a model in project areas,
which helps to promote the local agricultural production up to high levels. hi
general, the project contributes a lot to economic growth, market booming and
poverty alleviation in project areas.
4.12 The project has a great impact on environment. The project has turned the original
coastal mud flats and low-lying land into aquaculture area and cultivated land,
which enlarges the plantation area and improves waterway conditions. Coverage on
sloping land has increased, which benefits a lot on soil and water conservation,
afforestation and environmental protection.

5. Factors Affecting the Project
5.1 As an organizing and coordinating agency for the whole project, Provincial PMO
plays a key role in seeing to the project going smoothly. At the preparation stage,
Provincial PMO was an affiliate of Provincial Agriculture Commission (AC). But as
the project involves too many lines of business, a single line agency can not take the
responsibility of the whole project's management. In order to manage the project
efficiently, the responsibility should be taken by a comprehensive economic agency.
Since the Planning Commission has shifted its function to macroeconomic planning,
it left the responsibility to Provincial Financial Department (PDI). In 1991,
Provincial Government decided to transfer the Provincial PMO to PFD, at the same
time, Provincial Agriculture Project Office (under the AC) and Aquaculture Project
Office are maintained. Together with Provincial PMO, these three offices take
different duties to implement and manage the project. Practice has proved that the
efficient management of Provincial PMO functions decisively in project
implementation.
5.2 Efficient management of Project Offices (PO) at all levels ensures the success of
project construction. Being standing agencies, the provincial, municipal and county
POs put emphasis on project management. The PO lay out a series of regulations
and managerial processes. At the beginning of the project in 1992, the Provincial PO
established several rules and regulations on Guangdong's agriculture utilizing World
Bank loans, such as Project Management Regulations, Finance Management
Regulations and Accounting Measures, which provides procedures and references
for the project implementation in a strict way.
5.3 Close cooperation and coordination among relevant trades and comprehensive
management agencies guarantee the smooth-going of project construction. As a
comprehensive agriculture development project, the project touches upon finance,
planning, agriculture, aquaculture, Bank Of Agriculture (BOA), environmental and
audit agencies. Leaders and specialists from these agencies participate actively and
coordinate closely in the process of the project, which ensures the smooth
implementation of the project.
5.4 Farmers' active participation is another factor of project success. In the course of
project implementation, farmers in project areas show great enthusiasm toward the
project. In particular, farmers in project items like agriculture, aquaculture and
Qingyuan poverty alleviation actively and willingly raise supporting funds by many
means, which contributes a great deal to the implementation of the project. After the
construction of the project, farmers organize spontaneously various technique
associations, providing planter and culturer with services before, in or after the
production process. These associations play active roles in transferring knowledge,
exchanging experiences, and providing information as well as circulation channels.
5.5 Technique assistance by foreign consultants guarantees the quality of key projects.
After the project began, at the government expense (not included in the Bank's



36
disbursement), many specialists are invited to form a specialist group. At the same
time, from the short list provided by the Bank, Dr. Staple, specialist in fishing
management of marine resources from Australia, was chosen to join the group. He
was invited to Guangdong to help formulate Guangdong Marine Fishery
Management Plan (South China Sea fishing areas), and to provide consultative
services in sector project of marine fishery.
5.6 The delay of supporting funds is a common problem in sector agroindustry project.
Furthermore, the complicated procedures of procurement and long extension of time
prolong the construction period, which affects the project's benefit.
5.7 As the first provincial project of Guangdong, lack of experience is a common
problem to the staff from provincial levels to county levels. This is mostly reflected
in the agriculture plantation project.
5.7.1    While translating the section 3.33 of SAR, the part that research projects
should be approved by the Bank was missed out, which brings procedure problems
for PMOs at different levels. The result is that the disbursed $ 650,306 for research
project was refunded by the Bank.
5.7.2    As to the bidding and procurement for agriculture plantation goods, the
procedure complies with the Bank's standard. But the distribution of procured goods
adopted the way to meet the actual need for production. However, as the way was
not addressed to and approved by the Bank, money was returned to the Bank for not
abiding to regular procedures. The procured goods are chemical fertilizer and steel,
with the former equivalent to $ 2,421,613.70 and the latter $3,506,049.11.
5.8 Natural disasters damage some sector projects.
In 1994, the coastal zones of Guangdong were severely attacked by violent Typhoon
7. Brackish water aquaculture along the coastal zones was destroyed. The periphery
of sea dikes in Zhuhai aquaculture project was damaged greatly and restoration of
the construction increases project cost.
In 1995, the coastal zones of Guangdong were attacked again by violent Typhoon.
Maoming plantation, Jiangmen aquaculture and Qingyuan poverty alleviation areas
were damaged once more.
5.9 Great changes are made during mid-term adjustment, which brings a big disparity
between the actual completion and the appraisal. The biggest change took place on
marine capture project, in which the 86 vessels are reduced to 28 ones. This is due to
the change of fishery resources in South China Sea, and the increased cost has
lowered fisherman's confidence in fishing.
6. Project Substantiality
6.1 Most of the sector project has realized returns on investment. The extension of
operation will bring better benefits. To guarantee the completeness of facilities and
develop the project further, Guangdong will go on laying emphasis on the
management of post-stage project. Through these measures, best results are



37
achieved. As the market development of Guangdong is relatively quicker than other
provinces in China, the government seldom interferes with economic performance
of trades and industries in Guangdong Province. Economical means are employed to
adjust economics. Project management undertakes exactly in the same way. The
industries and farmers are responsible for their own operation and management. The
government agencies (including project agencies at all levels) only provide
assistance and consultative services at the later stage of the project.
6.2 It is basically self-managed projects by farmers in agriculture, aquaculture and
Qingyuan Poverty alleviation, the government only offer technique service and
services after production process. In view of China Agriculture Technique
Popularization Law, technique popularization stations at municipal, county and
township level should undertake researches, experiments, demonstrations and
technical popularization and consultation services to assist farmers in their
production.
6.3 Necessary assistance should be provided to marine fishery project in order to bring
project unit into normal production. Project management agencies will go on
formulating Guangdong Annual Fishery Management Plan (Annual Plan) so as to
guide the production of project units.
6.4 Researches on operation status of agroindustry project will be undertaken. Provided
by market economy, economic means will be adopted to recombine assets that have
been improperly operated, so that the project can go on smoothly and obtain
benefits.
7. The Bank's Performance
7.1 As a large investment involving various trades and fields in many municipalities
and counties, the Bank has offered substantially assistance on fund, information,
technique guidance, project management and operation means, which plays a key
role in the smooth implementation of the project.
7.2 Due to market and local situation changes, adjustment has been made on project
contents fixed at appraisal in project operation process approved by the Bank.
Typical example is the implementation of sector marine fishery project. Since the
project can be adapted timely to cater to the needs of market and the project, project
units express common positive attitudes toward this.
7.3 Since the implementation of the project in 1992, about 9 missions, 41 persons in
total from the Bank have come to project areas to monitor project operation and
provide assistance and advice.



38
8. The Borrower's Performance
8.1 The Government of Guangdong Province is responsible for the overall
implementation of the project. The Provincial Leading Group (PLG), being
responsible for the coordination of activities among various agencies and trades
involved, is chaired by the Standing Vice-Governor and assisted by representatives
from Provincial Government (Vice-General Secretary), Guangdong Financial
Department, the Provincial Planning Commission, Provincial Agricultural
Department and Provincial Department of Aquatic Products. Directors from various
agencies and trades consist of Group's members. The Provincial Project
Management Office, being the standing agency directly under PLG, is in charge of
project's implementation, management, procurement, monitoring, and coordination
and services provision. As to project preparation, appraisal, operation and
integration with agreement, the office has functioned a lot.
8.2 As a daily management agency of PLA, Provincial Financial Department ensures
the overall implementation of the project, in particular with project's on-lending,
recuperation and supporting funds raising.
8.3 Provincial Auditing Department is in charge of the auditing of the project. Advises
are put forward timely on problems found in auditing, which helps a lot in project
implementation. The Department also submits Auditing Reports to World Bank in
time.
8.4 Provincial Agricultural Department, Provincial Department of Aquatic Products,
and Bureau of Environmental Protection are respectively in charge of technical
guidance, services and environmental monitoring.
8.5 Under the direction of PLA and Provincial PMO, PMOs at municipal and county
levels are responsible for the overall operation of the project. They cooperate with
other authorities concerned to help relevant project units in their work.
8.6 According to the Bank's Appraisal Report and fundamental management
procedures in China, project construction unit selects design agency to undertake
technique design and drafts annual work programs, then submits them to province
and municipal authorities for approval.
8.7 Procurement lists are put forward by construction unit in view of project design.
Provincial PMO gathers them and undertakes checks. Then after permission from
China's relevant authorities and approval from the Bank, the procurement mode is
established. Provincial PMO then delegates the procurement to tendering agency to
organize procurement and appropriates the goods to construction unit as planned.



39
8.8 PMOs at various levels are in charge of daily monitoring and appraisal. They
submit cascadely work progress to provincial PMO. Provincial PMO then submits
progress report of project implementation to the Bank per half a year.
9. Project Evaluation
9.1 It is estimated that during a 15-year economical cycle, the project can gain a profit
of
RMB18,900 million. FIRR of the project is 30.2% and EIRR is 31.2%, basically
reaching up the objectives at appraisal.
9.2 In general, the project is rightly selected. However, the implementation of marine
fishery and agroindustry do not get desired results. It is proper to adjust marine
fishing project at Mid-appraisal. Being a comprehensive developing program, the
project's complicated design causes great difficulties in its implementation.
Typically is the case with the aquaculture project. According to the original design,
the Bank's disbursement rate for civil works in aquaculture is zero, money mainly
comes from the 50% supporting funds submitted to the province by each vessel
project city. While the vessels have to be constructed in three times, which lasts
several years, the construction period for aquaculture is only 1-2 years, this affects
greatly the disbursement for aquaculture. Practically, design in this way is not
scientific and reasonable. Besides, the preparation period from identification to
implementation extends too long. Till the implementation of the project, some
factors like resources, production and market have changed, which damages the
smooth implementation of the project.
9.3 With the efforts of project units and supports from provincial government, the
project can be said to progress as planned.
10. Future Operations
10.1 After its implementation, the project will operate in accordance with market
economy. In the light of the principle which assumes sole responsibility for one's
own profits or losses, the industries and farmers will determine their own modes of
operation and management.
10.2 PMOs at each level will be maintained. Apart from monitoring and evaluating later
stage development of the project, they will assist and urge the repayment of the
Bank's loans.
10.3 Provincial PMO will be maintained. It will continue to cooperate with each
technique and trade authority and assist project units in solving non-operational
problems that need government help.
11. Experiences and Lessons Learned



40
11.1 Devotion from government at each level is a key factor for project's success.
Active participation of farmers and close cooperation between related agencies lay a
solid foundation on the project's success. Fund from the Bank is an important
assurance for the project. Financial support at each governmental level functions
remarkably in the implementation of the project.
11.2 The issue of insufficient supporting capitals has postponed the construction period
of some sector projects. The complicated procedures in procurement affected the
project's progress. The long preparation period for appraisal has had great influence
on agroprocessing projects. Due to market changes, these projects are operating with
difficulties after their implementation.
11.3 The sophisticated design process of the project leads the implementation of the
project in a fix.

ANNEX B: ICR MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.  A Bank Mission composed of Zhu Zhengxuan (EACCF), Li Qun (EASRD), Zhang
Kaiping, Andrew Kaelin and Cheng Enjiang (Consultants) visited Guangdong Province
from January 26 to February 6, 1999, to discuss implementation completion of the
project. The Mission held discussions with PMOs at various levels, the relevant line
agencies, the Provincial Auditing Bureau, as well as beneficiaries in Panyu, Maoming,
Qingyuan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmeng and Zhaoqing. Site
visits include land reclamation areas, fruit tree plantation, poverty alleviation component,
steel vessel, fish culture and agroprocessing plants. A final wrap-up meeting with
members of the Provincial PMO was held on February 6, 1999 in Guangzhou.
2.   The Mission found that the PMO staff at all levels were well prepared for the
review: The draft ICR of the Borrower was submitted to the Mission upon arrival,
together with detailed tables necessary for financial and economic analysis. The Mission
was particularly impressed by the PMO staff for their flexibility and willingness to
accommodate the various random field visits at short notice. Therefore the mission
would like to express its thanks to the provincial authorities for the courtesy, cooperation
and hospitality extended to the Mission during its stay in Guangdong Province.
3.   This draft Aide-Memoire summarises the findings and preliminary conclusions of
the ICR mission and provides a basis for discussion at the final meeting in Guangzhou.
In the light of these final discussions and as agreed between Government, IDA and the
mission, the Aide-Memoire will be finalized and attached to the ICR.
Major Findings of the Mission
4.  Revisions during project implementations   Following major revisions took
place during mid-term review:
*  Marine Capture fishery: Number of vessels was reduced from 86 to 28. The
cold storage was reduced accordingly from 5 to 1 and the wharf was cancelled,
as this is a more realistic target.
*  Land Reclamation: the Modaomen development area of Zhuhai was replaced
by Zhongshan Municipality, and the crop area was adjusted accordingly from
6,446 ha to 4,998 ha. This is because Zhuhai was rezoned as commercial
development area, hence agricultural development activities discontinued.
*  Qingyuan Poverty Reduction: Investment to the expansion of Yingde Sugar
Plant was replaced by 1,500 ha of off-season snow pea, as the expansion was
invested by the government.
*  Shenzhen Feed Additive Plant and Shenzhen Foodstuff processing Factory were
cancelled, due to market changes.



42
5.  Project Implementation    Overall, most physical targets for the components
covering aquaculture, horticulture, land reclamation, agro-processing and poverty
alleviation are full met or exceeded. The only exceptions are for the fish/shrimp pond
construction under aquaculture component and sugarcane production under Qingyuan
Poverty Alleviation Component. Area of pond construction was reduced because of
occurrence of shrimp disease started nationwide in 1993 . The sugarcane area was lag
behind the target because part of the land was used for rice production, so as to feed the
settlers. Following table shows attainment of physical targets:

6.   Project Operations  In general, the project is operating well. According to the
preliminary estimate, most of the yields and production achievement for various crop and
fishes under marine capture fisheries, land reclamation and poverty alleviation
components were met or exceeded the levels projected at appraisal. Fruit development
succeeded well in the initial years: the fruit bearing is advanced, quality is greatly
improved with the introduction of the improved varieties and market competition is quite



43
strong. Therefore the production targets are likely to be reached, or even ahead of
schedule.  Nevertheless, silk production under poverty alleviation component is
experiencing great difficulty, due to market change. Cold storage under the same
component is idle, as a result of infrastructure improvement (construction of Guangzhou-
Qingyuan Highway enabled transportation of fresh vegetables just harvested to
Guangzhou in a 2-3 hours). Operations of other activities under this component are
satisfactory. Performance of Agroprocessing plants differs: two plants are doing well,
with production targets exceeded, two are expected to be operational in 1999/2000, and
seven are now operating but not at full capacity. Such delayed and low capacity
operation are due to shortage of working capital, or market change. The managers are
trying to overcome difficulties.
7.   Project benefits    The project gains good benefit, in addition to the
agricultural production increase, which include: (a) strengthening of marine resources
management; (b) proven technology transfer; (c) improvement of farmer's income; (d)
environment improvement; (e) better utilization of the slope, tidal lands and expansion of
farmn land; and (f) social benefits.
8.   Project costs   At the time of appraisal, the project cost was estimated as US$
303.79 million. Substantial revision of the scope for marine capture fishery resulted in
cost savings. In addition, about US$ 10,166.350.41 was asked to be refunded (details in
Para. 10 ). It was agreed that both the saved cost and the refunds be transferred to a Earth
Quake Rehabilitation Program in Yunnan and Inner Mongolia, totaling SDR 50.25
million, or 41% of the credit amount, making the actual cost of this project to US$ 242.16
million. Among which, 42.7% was IDA credit. The last disbursement took place on
May 29, 1998.
9.   Covenants      Covenants were focused on (a) establishmnent of a special account
and revolving fund for fishing vessels, sugarcane production and agroindustries; (b)
environmental aspects (particularly effluent control); (c) marine fish resources
management and monitoring; (d) ownership transfer of fishing vessels; (e) project
auditing and reporting.  The covenants which are not complied with relate to
agroindustry.
10. Refund and Reallocation   As a result of misuse of procured materials, a total of
US$ 10,166,350.41 was asked to be returned to the IDA in 1996. 8 municipalities were
involved in such refund and covered areas of fruit development, land reclamation and
aquaculture. The procured steel through ICB was exchanged for other materials used by
cage construction, water pipes and wires; part of the chemical fertilizer was sold to the
local input supply cooperative for purpose of receiving the same amount of fertilizer the
following year. The IDA was not consulted nor informed of such exchanges. The
Government of China and IDA agreed during the MTR to reallocate some SDR 50.63
million to an Earthquake Rehabilitation Program in Yunnan and Inner Mongolia.
11.  Project organizations   The provincial Project Management Office was
shifted from the Provincial Agricultural Commission during project preparation to the



44
provincial Department of Finance at the beginning of project implementation had caused
some managerial problems in the initial years: technical support from the line agencies
was weakened, and misuse of procured materials was discovered. At the strong
recommendation of earlier supervision missions, links of PMO with line agencies was
improved, especially at municipal/county levels. Many experienced project staff have
remained stable and quite committed to the project objectives.
Future Operations
12. The mission discussed with the Borrower the future operations, which is
summarized as follows: (a) Emphasis be laid on O&M. Sea dykes safety should
continue to receive close attention and disaster resistant capacity of the project works
should be further enhanced; (b) For those activities which are unlikely sustainable, such
as silk plant and the cold storage, an action plan , such as auction or alternative use of
the facilities, would be worked out, for purpose of avoiding further losses. Likewise, an
action plan would be worked out for plants under agro-processing component, indicating
in detail the necessary steps to overcome problems/difficulties, such as closure or
reorganization of assets and liabilities, etc.. (c) To maximize economic benefit, variety
adjustment or diversified economy was considered by local governments, such as
construction of high yielding banana orchard in Zhongshan, replacement of low value
fish species by high value ones under the aquaculture component, for purpose of reducing
market risks, or increase income; (d) The proven technology transfer would receive
continued support from the government; (e) more aggressive hatchery program was
considered to provide reliable sources of fish fingerlings and to make the aquaculture
component real sustainable. While doing so, a plan should be worked out indicating
fimding sources, organization arrangement, technology and monitoring indicators.
Follow up
13. The mission will prepare an ICR report, which will be sent to the World Bank by
Mid-March, 1999. The ICR includes a Part II section which presents a review of
implementation performance and results from the Borrower's perspective. A guideline
on the preparation of the part II is presented in the Attachment.



45
Attachment    Detailed requirement for further preparing ICR
1.   The mission received and discussed with the Borrower its draft ICR, and
recommended the following areas while revising and finalizing the report:
2.   Achievement of Project Objective and Project Impact.
* Explanations should be provided if there are substantial changes with regard to the
targets, objectives, activities under each component, and cost (such as orchard
subproject).  Causes for such changes, such as project design revisions, under
estimate of physical quantities and base unit costs, changes in exchange rates,
implementation delay, and performance of contractors;
* Poverty alleviation and /or other social economic benefits should be addressed. This
refers to, in particular, the improved livelihood of about 56,330 households in
limestone mountainous and an additional 1,200 resettled households; the number of
beneficiaries, incremental employment opportunity for farmers and the role of women
in each component and the project as a whole.
3.  Major Factors Affecting the Project.  Any   major  issues  or  problems
encountered, and their impacts on the project implementation should be addressed under
this section. An assessment should be made, as to whether the procurement and
disbursement were according to planned schedule. Clarification should be made for any
delay.
4.   Project Sustainability/Future Operation. Major factors affecting sustainability
or future operations be discussed, such as continued government commitment and
support; policy environment; institution/management effectiveness; economic, technical,
financial, and environmental viability; social impact, local participation, and incentives
for participants to sustain the project. The Mission found during its field visit that a lot of
project areas have their future plan in mind, which should be put into the report. Section
of experience and lessons learnt should also be strengthened.
5.  In order to enable completion of the ICR report of the IDA, additional information
is requested, which is as follows:
6.   Complete project investment costs and benefit analyses for each component by
finalizing:
* The actual detailed investment costs by components, expenditure category, and year
in Yuan and US$ based on actual investment costs from the annual financial and
physical progress reports (including additional local costs for Marine Fisheries and
Orchard Development components);



46
* The current farm-gate prices (1998) for all farm inputs and outputs in each component
and area (the World Bank price projections or the actual export and import prices in
Guangzhou should be used to estimate farm-gate prices in 1998 constant terms for
traded inputs and outputs with domestic and international transport and handling);
* The actual crop and farm budgets by year (to full development) for orchard
development, land reclamation, and poverty alleviation subprojects and components:
(i) detailed crop budgets should reflect actual scenarios for litchi, longan,
pomelo, sugarcane, lotus roots, grain, vegetable, and mulberry production in
each subproject area;
(ii) projected yield should be the actual yield from 1992 to 1998, and the
estimated yield (to full development) based on the experiences of the existing
project in each sub-project area; and
(iii) the amount applied of seed, fertilizer, and farm chemicals should be the
actual average and the incremental level with optimal farm input applications
(with/without project) in each area.
* The actual fann budgets (per hector) by year (to full development) for brackish water
and freshwater fish and shrimp ponds, and oyster beds components (detailed inputs
and outputs should be included by different kinds of fish);
. The actual area developed and sown by year (based on the actual phasing of
investment expenditure in each component) in aquaculture, orchard development,
land reclamation, and poverty alleviation sub-projects and components;
* The actual cropping pattern and intensity for above area and components;
* The actual developed new fishing vessels (wooden purse seines and steel trawlers),
marine net cages and freshwater cages by year and areas with detailed outputs and
inputs for each fishing vessel and cage in the South Chine Seas, Huizhou, Zhuhai,
Chaozhou and Shantou area; and
* The actual and projected financial statements for each agroprocessing plant with
detailed outputs, operational and financial costs (all expenditures).
7.   Formulating farm household survey data from sampling of predetermined areas
selected for typical beneficiary families of pomelo, litchi, longan, sugarcane, lotus roots,
grain, vegetable, and mulberry production household in Meizhou, Maomin, Panyu, and
Qingyuan areas (especially for 1,200 voluntary resettled families and about 56,330
households in existing limestone mountains poverty area), including detailed income from
crop and fruit production, sideline and others, and expenditures for investment and
operation cost, taxes, and other charges with and without project.



47
8.   Finalizing the summary tables on actual investment costs, procurement,
disbursement and financing plan for the whole project according to the original estimates
of the SAR and of the mid-term adjustment.
9.   Complete summary tables of Key Indicators for project implementation and
operation with the original estimates of the SAR and of the mid-term Review, and actual
completion at the end of the 1998.
10. General: All tables using the original SAR figures should be carefully checked for
consistency of items and figures used in the SAR
