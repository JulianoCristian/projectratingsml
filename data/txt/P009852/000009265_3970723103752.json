It\n            will assist the Government of West Bengal in accelerating\n            the development of its family welfare program in the State\n            generally and more specifically in four selected districts\n            with a total population (1985) of approximately 12.2\n            million. It will comprise the following major components;\n            (a) service delivery; (b) demand generation, including\n            information, education and communication activities and\n            population education; (c) training; (d) monitoring and\n            evaluation; and (e) project management. Project risks\n            pertain to the difficulties of persuading some 2 million\n            couples to change their attitudes toward the acceptance of\n            family planning and maternal and child health practices\n            aimed at improving the health of childern and limiting\n            family size. In view of the experience gained from previous\n            Bank Group projects in India, and the project support to be\n            provided by the GOI Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,\n            risks associated with project implementation are expected to\n            be minimal."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
