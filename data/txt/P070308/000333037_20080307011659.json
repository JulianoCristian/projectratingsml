Telecommunications and\n            Postal Sector Reform Project for Algeria were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: competition, brought about by liberalization in\n            the telecommunications sector, is the most effective driver\n            for sector performance. Consistent and strong political\n            support is critical in a project that aims to introduce more\n            private sector participation in the postal and\n            telecommunications sector, especially in an economy that has\n            long been driven by Government intervention. In a project\n            supporting telecommunications sector liberalization, an\n            upfront solid institutional communication strategy is needed\n            to convey and rally all stakeholders, in particular the\n            unions to the strategic objectives of the reform and the project."}, "docdt": "2007-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
