                  (Second National Low-Income Housing Project)

Dear Sirs:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced
Project between the Republic of Ecuador (the Borrower) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank),
dated May 24, 1988, and to the Project Agreement of the same date
between Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV) and the Bank.
      In accordance with discussions held in Washington, D.C.,
between Bank staff and representatives of the Borrower and BEV on
October 19, 1988, concerning the above referenced project, the Bank
is pleased to inform you of its agreement to extend the date of the
utilization of the Lending Instrument and Variable Interest Rate
System by BEV.  Therefore, the Bank proposes to amend Section 2.17
(b) the Project Agreement as follows:
      "(b)  Not later than August 1, 1989, BEV shall begin
utilization of the Lending Instrument and the Variable Interest Rate
System, on an exclusive basis, in all of its lending operations,
including those referred to in Section 2.16 (a) of this Agreement."
      If you agree with the proposed amendment, please confirm this
by signing the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us
duly dated.
