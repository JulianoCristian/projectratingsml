ECUADOR
SECOND NATIONAL LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:     Republic of Ecuador
Beneficiary,: Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda/Junta Nacional de la
V4vienda (BEV/JNV)
Amount:       uS$60.0 million equivalent
Terms:        Repayable over 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
On-Lending
Terms:        The Borrower would onlend the entire proceeds of the Bank
loan in Sucres to BEV at a variable rate established from
time to time, equivalent to the rate paid by BEV on
savings deposits (currently 20X). The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
P-r2iect
Description:  The loan would finance a share of BEV's 1988-1993 investment
program which would be implemented throughout Ecuador through
BEV, JNV and private developers. It would also support
adoption of new financial policies and instruments to improve
resource mobilization and allocation and housing
affordability in the sector and promote institutional reforms
within BEV and JNV to make them more efficient. The loan
would finance (i) approximately 12,000 serviced lots with or
without dwelling units, (ii) about 15,000 home improvement
credits (iii) vehicles and equipment for project
implementation and (iv) technical assistance for project
agencies.
Benefits:     Apart from the construction of shelter, a maJ.r benefit would
be the introduction bv BEV of a long-term mortgage instrument
bearing market-related variable interest rates and featuring
partial capitalization of interest. This would promote
mobilization of domestic resources for shelter while
improving resource allocation and shelter affordability. As
a result of the institutional restructuring of BEV and JNV,
and the adoption of the above-mentioned mortgage instrurent,
by the end of the project BEV would function more effectively
as a financial institution, JNV would function more
effectively as a developer, and BEV would mobilize a larger
share of its rer-urces fror the market.  The project would
also encourage private developers to build low-income
housing.



- iv -
Risks:  There is little risk regarding physical works; JNV has an adequate
land acquisition program underway and ample experience with
developing necessary services. Rome-improvement lending faces no
particular physical risk. The main risk is that the new Government
entering office in August 1988 may not sustain the financial and
institutional policy reforms which underpin the project. The risk
that this might occur is tempered by the fact that: (i) the
proposed institutional reforms are extensions of ones which have
already been accepted and are underway under previous
Bank-supported projects in the sector; and (ii) the austere
economic climate that will likely prevail during the life of the
project will continue to require that the thrust of the proposed
reforms be maintained.

ECUADOR
SECOND NATIONAL LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT
I. THE SECTOR
General
1.01      About half of Ecuador's nine million residents currently live in
urban areas. Over the past decade, urban population growth averaged 4.5
percent (compared to just under 2 percent in rural areas) and Indications
are that this pace will continue, reflecting both high migration and
natural growth. Apart from two large cities, Guayaquil and Quito, with
populations of 1.5 and 1 million respectively, about eighteen smaller
cities have populations between 20,000 and 150,000. Although Qulco and
Guayaquil together account for about 28 percent of the national, and about
55 percent of the total urban population, these cities produce about 80
percent of the national output. Continued national development is thus
very dependent upon socio-economic activities in these cities,
1.02      Petroleum revenues greatly increased overall income levels and
standards of living over the past two decades. Nevertheless, significant
poverty remains in the country; in the large urban centers about 23 percent
of the families have incomes below the Bank's relative poverty level of
US$155/month in household income. For the smaller cities and rural areas,
this figure is estimated at about 35 percent. Decline in petroleum
revenues and high inflation since the early 1980's have worsened income
distribution and living conditions in the country. Recent earthquake
damage to petroleum and gas pipelines, roads, bridges and houses in the
northern and eastern provinces, and flood damage in coastal provinces have
also negatively affected the economy and the welfare of residents of these
areas.
Housing
1.03      Of the approximately 1.5 million housing units in the country,
about 40 percent have some type of deficiency, such as lack of water,
severage services and electricity, overcrowding, and poor state of
construction. Each year, about 45,000 new families are formed; recent
estimates of the Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV), put the overall
urban housing deficit at about 430,000 units. BEV estimates that about 50%
of urban families would be willing and able to pay for some type of
(largely unsubsidized) housing solution. Many of them currently live in
unserviced and poorly constructed units for which they pay monthly rentals
averaging US$30-55 equivalent. Most of these families would fall within
the primary target income group of the proposed project, paying for their
units on a fully cost-recoverable basis.



- 2 -
1.04      Housing production of the formal sector has recently averaged
about 15,000 units per year. However, the bulk of housing solutions still
comes from the informal sector through frequent land invasions and illegal
squatter settlements which mushroom on public and unoccupied private
lands, BEV has limited knowledge of the process of financing and
constructing marginal and unauthorized settlements, primarily because
residents are reluctant to provide information and also because they often
lack accurate information on quantities, dates, rates, etc. Current
indications are that, apart from politically organized invasiona, most of
the present unauthorized and marginal settlements are spontaneous.
Typically, owners of vacant unserviced lots subdivide and sell them to
buyers who erect basic dwelling units which they expand and improve mostly
with their own resources, but also with loans from relatives or
moneylenders. Usually, such loans bear interest rates which are much
higher than commercial mortgage rates but not as high as rates on
short-term working capital loans. These are much smaller and may have
rates as high as 100% over the day or two for which they are made. Annex 1
provides further details on housing sector deficits and needs.
Sector Institutions
1.05      Institutions involved with shelter development include the Banco
Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV), the Junta Nacional de la Vivienda (JNV),
the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguro Social (IESS), the Banco Ecuatoriano de
Desarrollo (BEDE), "mutualistas" (Savings & Loans Associations, S&Ls), 31
private banks and about 100 credit unions. Over the years, private
promoters and developers have also produced housing for middle and upper
income groups. BEV/JNV and the IESS are the principal sources of housing
finance, having between them constructed or financed almost 90 percent of
the formal middle- and low-income housing projects in Ecuador over the last
five years.
1.06      BEV is an autonomous public housing finance institution which was
established in 1961 with the primary responsibility of providing housing
finance and regulating the nation's savings and loan system (which was
created in 1963). JNV was established as a Government agency in 1973 and
was empowered to set national shelter policies, coordinate activities of
public and private sector agencies and promote and implement low-income
housing projects. Although BEV and JNV have separate and clearly- defined
roles, they share the same President, and JNV has functioned more as the
project implementing division of BEV for housing development with BEV
lending to beneficiaries for home improvement loans and long-term
mortgages. Investment funds for these agencies come from equity
contributions from the Government, local and international loans,
beneficiary savings, bond sales, and income from operations.
1.07      IESS is an autonomous entity established through a 1970
presidential decree. It is funded by social security contributions from
the Government, employers, and workers. An independent Board invests its
resources in a variety of instruments, including co*nsumer and mortgage
loans, equity in private firms, and Government bonds. Its lending is
confined so members meeting eligibility criteria such as length of service,.

amount of contribution, etc., and is provided on very concessionary terms.
IESS lending in the housing sector has traditionaally been more than that of
BEV/JN! (US$300 million Vs. US$75 million annualiy), and msainly for the
middle and upper income groups. Recently, however, IESS has experienced
resource constraints on account of its generous subsidA.es and weak
actuarial planning, and its Lousing finance role has been drastically
curtailed. IESS, therefore, is not expected to reassume its lead role In
housing finance in the foreseeable future.
1.08      BEDE funds public sector agencies implementing Government's
Investment program. Its funds come from a variety of sources such as
petroleum revenues, external loans to the Government, and surpluses from
its operations. It provides loans to municipalities for financing of works
and it is also a source of funding for social housing projects implemented
by BEV/JNV and the S&Ls. However, its recent liquidity problems arising
from declining oil revenues will likely diminish its capacity to continue
funding the housing sector.
1.09      The Central Bank intervenes in a variety of direct and indirect
ways to influence shelter policies according to Government plans. Under
the direction of the Monetary Board, it establishes interest rate limits
and lending conditions for various grou,s of borrowers and also provides
direct lines of uredit to other institutions for specific types of shelter
lending. Responding to a decapitalization threat to the savings and loan
system (para 1.10) the Central Bank agreed to buy the low-yield portfolio
of the savings and loan system in crder to restore the system's liquidity.
These purchases began in 1986 but had to be suspended because of Government
fiscal constraints.
1.10      The S&Ls and credit unions provide about 10-15 percent of housing
financing. They were very active initially in the sector, but inflation
and high deposit interest rates caused substantial losses on their
long-term portfolio which carried fixed, relatively low interest rates.
The Government therefore intervened and bought some of their low-yield
portfolio (para. 1.09) in an effort to keep them solvent.
1.11      Private developers and contractors have invested their own
resources supported by financing from some of the above-mentioned
institutions to provide homes to upper-income groups. However, recent
economic conditions-characterized by recession, high interest rates and
the absence, for legal reasons, of long term financial instruments
permitting capitalization of interest-have generally curtailed demand for
their products. Commercial banks have also recently curtailed their
mortgage lending, primarily because of the existence of more attractive
alternatives which have fewer risks and constraints than housing loans.
1.12      Problems and Constraints in the Sector.  The main sector problems
are: (i) inadequate mobilization and allocation of domestic savings for
shelter development; (ii) insufficient production of housing employing
norms and standards affordable by lower income groups; and (iii) lack of
financial instruments adequate to promote housing affordability under
prevailing conditions of inflation and interest rates in the 20-30 percent
range.

Government PolieJes
1.13      The Government is aware of the nature and extent of Ecuador's
shelter problems and has given very high priority to dealing with them.
Upon entering office in 1984, the current Administration began to implement
its "Plan Techo", aimed at producing 254,000 new or rehabilitated housing
units between 1984-88 at a cost of US$830 million (1984 prices). BEV/JNV
was the primary vehicle for this program, although financing was made
available to other qualified participants able to produce shelter solutions
for low-income groups. Under "Plan Techo", BEV/JNV was allotted the task
of financing 63 percent of the program, averaging 40,000 units per year,
with IESS and other agencies financing the remainder. BEV/JNV was expected
to fund its program primarily from BEV's operations, bond sales, 'ocal and
international loans, and earmarked oil revenues. BEV/JNV completed only
about 11,000 units for 1985, mainly because of funding and implementation
capacity constraints. Nonetheless, this was a substantial increase
compared to its pre-1980 annual production level of about 4,000 units.
BEV/JNV's output for 1986 was approximately 20,000 new and rehabilitated
units; consequently the Government's Plan targets are unlikely to be met by
the end of 1988.
1.14      When the Administration came to office in 1984, the cost of the
average housing solution developed by BEV/JNV was affordable primarily to
beneficiaries above the median household income level (US$262 per month).
Since that time, BEV/JNV has moved aggressively to improve housing
affordability by developing a variety of housiag types, ranging from core
units to 45 square meter houses, as well as developing a program for home
improvement loans. As a result, (assuming comparable financing terms) the
majority of BEV's housing solutions are now affordable to beneficiaries in
the 30-50 percentile household income groups. Consistent with the Bank's
advice, the Government has also recognized the need to reform financial
policies, including those in the housing sector, to promote domestic
resource mobilization and to develop new long-term lending instruments
which would improve housing affordability while improving cost recovery.
The drop in petroleum prices and recent loss of revenues from earthquake
and flood damage has also caused the Government to begin to examine the
fiecal dimensions of municipal management, to strive to increase efficiency
within public agencies, and encourage greater private sector participation
in the delivery of shelter for low-income groups.
International Lending in the Sector
1.15      The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided
three loans totalling US$61 million to BEV and the S&Ls and is currently
preparing a fourth loan for US$30 million, to be shared equally between a
Central Bank line of credit for S&Ls and BEV/JNV, In 1962, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) made a US$10.6 million loan to
BEV/JNV to finance infrastructure, and in February 1987, it approved a
US$57 million loan for similar works. The Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany has recently provided loans for US$1.9 million to
finance upgrading works in one small town, and about US$2 million to assist
victims of the March 1987 earthquakes. The projects which these loans
support have generally focussed upon beneficiaries above the median income



- 5 -
level and few special attempts have been made to deal with sectoral or
institational issues (e.g., high norms and standards, subsidies, cost
recovery, and low productivity).
1.16      Bank urban assistance to the country began with the Guayaquil
Urban Development Project (Loan 1776-EC) which became effective in 1980.
This US$31 million loan was designed to demonstrate alternative low-cost
approaches to providing services to poor beneficiaries with a minimum of
subsidy. The pro4ect included sites and services, urban upgrading, loans
to artisans, and some technical assistance to the Municipality of
Guayaquil, BEV and the other agencies involved in project implementation.
On account of the institutional complexity of the project, delays in
implementation were experienced inltially. However, following project
reformulation in 1984, project targets were met substantially. Loan
savings of about US$5.0 million arising from devaluations of the sucre
would be cancelled upon loan closing at the end of 1987. Another loan for
the National Low Income Housing Project (Loan 2135-EC) for US$35.7 million,
was made in 1982. It was designed to support Government's policies for
providing affordable housing to the urban poor, strengthen the
institutional, technical, and financial capacity of BEV/JNV, and
demonstrate the feasibility of providing low-cost shelter solutions in
Quito and selected secondary cities. Project targets were met
satisfactorily within the initial Closing Date; however, loan savings of
about US$9.0 million materialized owing to devaluations of the sucre. In
1987, approximately US$5.0 million from such savings were reallocated for
an earthquake shelter and municipal building reconstruction program. The
remaining US$4.0 million would be used until June 1988 to continue
fis.ancing works in the project area similar to those initially included
under the project.
1.17      Concurrent with implementation of Loan 2135-EC, GTZ developed a
technical assistance program for BEV!JNV. That program has been
instrumental in promoting reforms within BEV/JNV which are consistent with
the institutional objectives of Loan 2135-EC. Specifically, the GTZ
program has (i) prepared required manuals, procedures and job descriptions
and assessed computing needs to underpin the institutional separation of
JNV from BEV; (ii) financed technical staff to improve low cost housing
designs and promulgate ideas for improved financial management within BEV
and JNV; and (iii) carried out the first market survey to assess the demand
for BEV/JNV's various products. GTZ has agreed to maintain its technical'
assistance program in force until 1990; it would therefore overlap with and
reinforce the technical assistance to be provided under the proposed loan
(para. 2.06). Under its extended program, GTZ would help BEV and JNV
implement their reorganization, implement their computerization program,
and improve administrative systems inter alia for financial management and
collections.
1.18      The Guayaquil project successfully sensitized the Government to
alternatives for addressing low-income shelter issues (e.g. lower norms and
standards, urban upgrading, and home improvement credit); the second Bank
project continued the process by financing more affordable housing for the
urban poor in selected geographic zones involving a share of BEV/JNV's



- 6 -
investment program. The second project also helped implement institutional
reforms within BEV/JNV, and preliminary steps were taken to separate the
functions and operations of both institutions. These pro4ects demonstrated
the feasibility and benefits of: (i) providing a variety of low-cost
shelter units satisiying beneficiary needs and ability to pay;
(ii) reducing construction and titling time and allowing beneficiaries
earlier access to unizs; and (iii) encouraging greater participation of
private developers in activities financed by BEV/JNV.
1.19      Bank Sector Strategy.  The Bank's strategy in the sector is to
help the Government develop policies and institutions to increase the
supply of affordable housing for lower income groups while minimizing
public subsidies. Consistent with this strategy, the proposed project
would incorporate agreements affecting BEV/JNV's entire investment program,
including those portions being financed by other external agencies such as
IDB, USAID, and GTZ. Moreover, it is expected that the new mortgage
instrument and financial policies (paras. 2.27 and 2.35) to be adopted by
BEV in the context of the proposed project would serve as a model for
adoption by other housing finance institutions (e.g. IESS and the S&Ls).
In the near future, the Bank expects to intensify its dialogue on municipal
management issues.
II, THE PROJECT
2.01      Project Origin.  The proposed project was identified in late
1985, and was prepared by BEV/JNV with the assistance of GTZ and Bank
staff. It was appraised in February 1987. Negotiations for the proposed
project took place in Washington from November 16 to 20, 1987.  The
Ecuadorian delegation was led by Ing. Francisco Albornoz, President of
BEV/JNV. During preparation and appraisal of the proposed project, close
coordination was maintained with the team preparing and appraising the
proposed Financial Sector Loan, which would support important reforas of
the financial system consistent with the financ'al policy reforms being
introduced under the proposed housing loan. Moreover, the proposed housing
project takes into account the findings of the Bank's 1985 review of the
Public Investment Program.
2.02      Project Rationale.  The Guayaquil Urban Development Project (Loan
1776-EC) began a process aimed at providing low-cost shelter alternatives
and re-orienting the Government's approach to shelter investment. Norms
and standards have been reduced significantly, urban upgrading and
partially built (core) units have become widely accepted, and the principle
of cost recovery is better understood. The second project (Loan 2135-EC)
focussed more directly upon the operations of BEV/JNV and was designed to
achieve greater institutional and operational reforms in these agencies,
while at the same time, implementing principles of af'ordability and cost
recovery within a share of their investment program. Although achievements
under these projetts have so far been generally satisfactory, there is
still need for Bank assistance to continue to promote reduction of norms
and standards and greater operational efficiency within BEV/JNV, and
provide lower-cost shelter units to a larger group of beneficiaries on a



cost recoverable basis. There is reed to work with BEV/JNV to improve
their product mix, beneficiary selection, costing policies, resource
mobilization, interest rate structure, etc., and make BEV more autonomous
in its finances. Private sector participation in providing low-cost
shelter needs to be fostered. Many of the results of the GTZ and
Bank-financed studies and technical assistance work under Loan 2135-EC
(paras. 1.16 and 1.17) are expected to come to fruition during this
project. ',onsequently, the proposed project would help consolidate and
expand acli,evements under the previous projects and extend the principles
of affordability and cost recovery to BEV/JNV's entire programs. It would
also extend the financial sector reforms being undertaken by the
Government, with the support of the Bank, to the housing sector.
Additionally, increased employment in construction and related sectors
would result from this project.
2.03      Project Objectives and Relation to the Sector.  Specific project
objectives include: (i) increasing the production of low-income housing;
(ii) adoption by BEV of interest rate policies and a new mortgage
instrument (paras 2.27 and 2.35) designed to improve resource mobilization
and allocation in the housing sector; (iii) further streamlining and
strengthening of the financial, administrative and productive efficiency of
BEV/JNV within a continued process of rationalization of the Government's
public housing investment program; (iv) better targetting of BEV/JNV
production to make it more responsive to the needs of low-income
beneficiaries; and (v) fostering greater participation of private
contractors/developers in the production of low-income housing.
2.04      Achievement of these ob4ectives would call for coordination with
other lending agencies and consequent reduction or elimination of
conflicting or multiple requirements regarding operational criteria, norms
and standards, procedures, onlending terms, etc. Such coordination has
already been initiated, for example, with USAID and with the IPB sites and
services project which was approved in February, 1987, where there is
congruenw_e with the Bank's contracting requirements and use of demand
surveys to determine BEV/JNV's investment program. The Bank has also
established a close working relationship with GTZ in implementation of its
technical assistance program (para 1.17).
2.05      Project Description.  The proposed project would be a share of
BEV's 1988-1993 investment program. This program, which would 1e
implemented through BEV, JNV and private developers and contractors
(para 2.13), would cost an estimated US$312 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$80.7 million (26%). It would be financed by USAID
(US$23 million); IDB (US$57 million); GTZ (US$3 million); BEV/JNV
(US$138 million); beneficiaries (US$31 million) and the proposed Bank loan
(US$60 million). Based upon results of a demand analysis conducted by BEV
along with implementation rates achieved in recent years, the total
investment program will comprise: (a) construction of urban infrastructure
(water distribution, access roa( ., drainage, etc.) necessary to develop
about 45,000 serviced lots; (b) about 35,000 housing units of various
sizes; (c) credit for about 55,000 home improvement loans; and
(d) investments in equipment, vehicles and technical assistance to improve
BEV/JNV's operations. The proposed project would include about 12,000



-8 -
serviced lots with and without dwelling units of various sizes, and about
15,000 home improvement loans throughout the country over the next six
years. Technical assistance and vehicles and equipment for BEV and JNV
would also be included under the project. There would be strict advance
identification and separation of works to be financed by various agencies
to facilitate procurement and supervision. During negotiations it was
agreed that investment decisioas on quantity and types of shelter units
would be based upon demand analyses which BEV would conduct annually and
which would be acceptable to the Bank. BEV's 1987 investment program was
prepared after such an analysis.
2.06      The proposed project would focus on BEV as the financing entity,
and JNV, along with a special unit in BEV (for the home improvement
program), and private developers as implementing agents. The technical
assistance component would be important for BEV since one of the goals is
to continue with the achievements of Loan 2135-EC (para. 2.02) and the GTZ
technical assistance program for institutional strengthening (para.1.17)
to provide BEV with a firmer financial footing and institutional base to
respond to sector needs. The project would also strengthen the staffing
aud administrative and implementing capacity of BEV and JNV, and
establish norms and standards, and operating systems regarding site
selection, land acquisition, design, contracting, supervision, reporting,
beneficiary selection, titling and shelter allocation. The appraisal
mission reviewed the 1987-1990 technical assistance program which GTZ
prepared in conjunction with BEV and JNV and found the program to be
acceptable. A copy of the workplan is in the Project Files with a summary
of the consultant needs in Annex 5. Since GTZ would continue its
coordinating role for technical assistance activities during the project
period, signing of an appropriate agreement between BEV/JNV and GTZ,
acceptable to the Bank is a condition of loan effectiveness.
2.07      Project Costs.  The estimated total cost for the share of BEV's
1988-93 investment program which the Bank would help finance would be
US$85.7 million equivalent, including US$21.7 million (26%) in foreign
costs. The base cost, expressed in November 1987 prices, would be US$79.0
million, net of taxes. Construction costs and average values for home
improvement loans are based on BEV/JNV's past experience, appropriately
modified to reflect the lower norms and standards agreed under the project
(Annex 3 ). Physical contingencies averaging 5% anl price contingencies
averaging 4% have been assumed, respectively reflecting (i) the fact that
designs and standards have already been agreed for model units, and (ii)
the projected levels of international inflation during the project period.
Annex 2, contains the detailed project costs (by components) which are
summarized below.

2.08      Financing Plan.  The project financing plan is shown below:

The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million would include US$21.7 million
toward the estimated foreign exchange component and US$38.3 million towards
local costs. BEV would finance US$17.1 million from interual cash



- 10 -
generation, and beneficiaries would provide US$8.6 million. Financing of
some local costs by the Bank is justified on account of the Government's
sound economic policies maintained in the face of high externa1 debt
service payments and harsh exogenous shocks caused by declining oil prices
and loss of export flows due to earthquake damage to the country's main oil
pipeline in 1987.
Status of Design Works
2.09      All of the shelter prototype models to be used in the proposed
project were reviewed at appraisal and their final designs and costing
found acceptable (Annex 2, table 2). About 60% of the plans for the sites
to be developed during the first year of construction have completed final
drawings. The remaining 40% have completed preliminary designs, with final
drawings expected to be completed before December 31, 1987.
2.10      All of the infrastructure works for site development to be
financed under the proposed loan would be constructed in accordance with
des4gn guidelines and engineering criteria reviewed by the Bank and agreed
with JNV. Similarly, all shelter prototype models (para. 2.09) to be
financed under the proposed loan would be constructed according to norms
and standards agreed with the Bank (Annex 3).
2.11      Land Acquisition.  BEV has already acquired land for the iirst
three years of project implementation. These sites have been reviewed and
found suitable. During negotiations It was agreed that suitable sites for
the remaining two and one half years of project works would be acquired in
accordance with a schedule (acceptable to the Sank) to be completed by June
1989. A list of the acquired sites and BEV's land acquisition procedures
are in the Project Files.
2.12      Institutional and Legal Arrangements.  BEV would be responsible
for overall project coordination. Project implementation would be carried
out by JNV, the home improvement lending unit within BEV, and private
developers. While JNV would implement all works through private
contractors (instead of by force account), private contractors would also
be encouraged to act as individual developers with financing from BEV,
provided they meet project criteria for the units to be built. With
respect to project monitoring, reporting and liaison with the Bank, BEV
would assign responsibilities to specific individuals in its relevant
departments.
2.13      Responsibility for implementing various project components would
be as follows: serviced lots with and without superstructure - JNV
(through private contractors) and private developers; home improvement
loans - BEV's home improvement division; technical assistance -
GTZ/BEV/JNV and consultants. BEV would provide construction financing to
JNV and to private developers in accordance with legal agreements with
them; such agreements would specify inter alia, a description of the works
to be financed (in accordance with demand surveys), the duration of the
construction period, and onlending terms and conditions from BEV to JNV and
private developers.

2.14      The Borrower under the proposed Bank loan would he the Republic
of Ecuador. It would on-lend the entire proceeds of the loan in Sucres to
BEV at a variable interest rate established from time to time, equivalent
to the rate paid by BEV for its savings deposits. BEV would provide
construction financing to JNV and private developers at the same interest
rate as that charged by the Government to BEV. The interest rate charged
to final beneficiaries would be sueh rate plus a spread initially set at
1.5 percent p.a. and increasing to BEV's full administrattve costs after
two years. The revenues from the difference between the Bank's lending
rate and 'he rate charged to BEV would be used by the Government towards
coverage of the foreign exchange risk which it would bear on the Bank
loan. The adequacy of BEV's spread would be reviewed annually with the
Bank. The mortgage instrument used by final beneficiaries would provide
for annual adjustment of loan amortization payments to reflect the
affordability and interest rate criteria presented in Annex 9. Signing of
Subsidiary Agreements acceptable to the Bank between the Government and BEV
and BEV and JNV would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Approval by the Bank of a model contract between JNV and private developers
and between BEV and private developers would be conditions of disbursement
for relevant components of the project.
2.15      BEV has agreed to formulate its overall investment program (i.e.,
for all funds it receives, whether from IBRD, other lenders or its own
resources), on the basis of a demand analysis which would be conducted
annually in low-income areas using the methodology and procedures which
have been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank and agreed with USAID
and IDB. The results of such study and the proposed investment program
resulting therefrom would be submitted for Bank comments. (The first such
analysis was carried out in 1986 for BEV's 1987 investment program.)
Additionally, BEV/JNV would prepare and submit to the Bank for review and
approval an annual detailed investment program including the location and
mix of proposed shelter solutions, and estimated costs for low-income
shelter beneficiaries. Projects which are not consistent with agreed
design standards or with the aforementioned demand analysis survey would
not be eligible for Bank financing. These conditions would apply equally
to JNV and to private contractors. It is therefore expected that there
would be strong incentive for compliance with these norms and standards in
order to obtain Bank financing.
2.16      Using the results of demand analysis, BEV would plan its annual
national investment program in light of resource availability. Since the
demand analysis is likely to indicate greater effective demand than
available resources, there may be need to pro-rate the number and types of
shelter solutions in line with the survey results. The investment program
would be publicized, and JNV and private developers would compete for
available BEV funds by offering proposals for BEV financing. Given the
present lack of experience by private developers acting independently to
develop low income housing, it is expected that their role would initially
be rather small. However, since JNV would subcontract its works to private
contractors, the private sector would play a prominent role in
subcontracting. It is thus expected that JNV would provide the platform
from which private developers would be launched into independent businesses



as developers of low-income housing. For both JNV and developers, part of
their obligation would be to locate and pre-screen potential buyers for the
units before construction begins. While construction is underway, the list
of pre-screened beneficiaries would be further screened by BEV officials
using a set of criteria acceptable to the Bank. When the units are ready,
BEV would offer mortgage financing to the pte-selected beneficiaries, with
JNV and the developers receiving the'r value added from BEV, which would
include this in the sale price of the unit, in accordance with a pricing
system acceptable to the Benk. JNV and private developers would not be
relieved of their financial and legal obligations to BEV until they had a
beneficiary selected for the completed unit and the beneficiary was found
acceptable to BEV.
2.17      For home improvement loans, a special division within BEV
experienced with such lending would administer this component. Home
improvement loans would be administered in a similar fashion as BEV loans
to JNV and private developers. After the home improvement loan is
disbursed, BEV would administer and recover the funds from beneficiaries
through its collection division.
2.18      Project Execution.  BEV and JNV are generally adequately staffed
to execute the project; however, should demand analysis reveal the need to
adjust their implementation capacity during project execution, they would
recruit staff as necessary. In terms of staffing and implementation
capacity, BEV's home improvement unit is well equipped to handle its tasks,
but it will require some additional computing equipment and vehicles which
would be financed under the project. For new housing construction, JNV
would be hiring contractors to do the work and it has the land available.
Based on JNV's performance under Loan 2135-EC, a five and a half-year
implementation period with a disbursement period of twelve semesters is
estimated. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1993.
Annex 4 provides further details on project implementation.
2.19      Procurement.  Procurement under the proposed project would be in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Approximately US$45.2
million of civil works, US$0.5 million of vehicles and equipment, and about
US$1.5 million in technical assistance would be procured under the proposed
project. On the basis of prior experience under Loan 2135-EC, packages for
civil works totalling US$1.2 million or more would be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) while other civil works would be
procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) using procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. Given the nature of the works and the local
expertise available in this type of construction work, it is not expected
that foreign firms would be interested in bidding for contracts smaller
than this amount. About 200 contracts are expected to be let for civil
works for the urbanization of sites and construction of shelter units. The
phasing and dispersion of works over the entire country is not conducive to
packaging of contracts for different sites. Nevertheless, within given
sites and for similar phases of works, bids would be invited for packages.
To allow participation of smaller companies, firms would be permitted to
bid on all or parts of the packages. Vehicles and equipment would be
procured through LCB because the associated contracts are not expected to
exceed US$150,000 and are therefore not suitable for ICB. The project



- 13 -
would4also finance about US$26.7 million in home improvement loans which
would be granted directly to beneficiaries who would make material
purchases from local suppliers. Consultants f-.nanced under the technical
assistance component of the project would be selected in accordance with
Bank Guidelines, and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Outline terms of reference are attached at Annex 5. The limits for prior
Bank review of bidding documents (the first five contracts, regardless of
their value, as well as all subsequent contracts in excess of US$1.2
million) would result in a coverage of about 63% of the estimated value of
civil works contracts. This would result in review of about 34% of the
approximately 200 contracts which are expected to be let. Further details
on procurement (with proposed Bank disbursements in brackets) are provided

2.20      The Bank has recently conducted a detailed review to determine
the consistency of Ecuadorian procurement procedures with Bank Guidelines.
During the review, the following specific points of conflict between
Ecuador's Procurement Law and Bank Procurement Guidelines were identified.
Local law (i) permits, without further review, contract changes of up to
35% in quantities of goods or services, vs. 15% to 20% permitted by the



- 14 -
Bank; (ti) requires that foreign bidders have a local representative;
(iii) specifies a two-envelope bid submission system, whereas the Bank
requires a single envelope; (iv) requires that bid and performance
guarantees be supplied by a bank established in Ecuador, whereas the Bank
accepts banks established anywhere; (v) does not allow for price
adjustments; (vi) does 'ot permit the submission of bids by mail;
(vil) does not specify clear evaluation criteria for selecting a bid;
(viii) requires that the financial solvency of a foreign bidder, when
certified by a foreign bank, must be recertified by a local bank;
(ix) requires that letters of credit or other advances to cover purchases
of goods or services be secured by a 100% Bank guarantee by the seller or
service provider; (x) requires that consultants be registered in Ecuador to
be eligible for hiring; and (xi) requires that consultants be associated
with Ecuadorian etonsultants having at least a 30% participation in the
assignments under consideration. However, Ecuador's Procurement Law
(Article 45) also provides that the procurement procedures of international
financial institutions supersede local law, so long as such procedures are
expressly stated in the relevant contracts. Accordingly, the Loan
Agreement contains express provisions to resolve in the Bank's favor the
specific conflicts between the Bank's Guidelines and local law. These
provisions were confirmed during negotiations.
Disbursements
2.21      Consistent with procurement prior review limits (para 2.19) and
Bank practice in Ecuador, for contracts valued at less than US$1.2 million,
disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs).
Documentation for these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank,
but would be retained by BEV for periodic inspection by Bank staff. To
expedite project execution, a Special Account would be opened in the
Central Bank (para 2.33) with a deposit of up to US$4 million, representing
four months' peak disbursements. The Closing Date for the proposed loan
would be December 31, 1993. The disbursement period is estimated at 6
years, consistent with experience under prior Bank loans in the sector in
Ecuador.  Annex 2, Table 3 provides an estimated schedule of disbursements.
2.22      The Bank loan would be disbursed against;
(a) 81% of expenditures on civil works for urban infrastructure,
construction of shelter solutions, and subloans made to
beneficiaries for construction, expansion or renovation of
dwellings;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles and equipment and 81%
of expenditures for imported goods procured locally; and
(c) 100% of expenditures for consulting services.
There would be no Bank disbursements for the cost of design, supervision,
and project administration costs. Retroactive financing of US$2 million is
provided for urbanization and new home construction works which began after
November 20, 1987, and are in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines
and norms and standards agreed to during appraisal. Such financing is
needed to allow BEV to proceed with identified project works while the
proposed loan is being processed.

Financial Analysis
2.23      General.   Up to 1986, BEV and JNV had one set of financial
accounts, with all transactions of JNV recorded as part of BEV's
operations. In 1986, BEV/JNV received about 31% of their financing from
the Government, 13% from savings deposits, 15% from suppliers, 18% from
international agencies, 9% from bond sales, 6% from local lenders, and 8%
from reserves and accumulated earnings. In 1986, assets amounted to about
US$254 million equivalent. As part of the technical assistance program
supported by Loan 2135-EC and GTZ (para 1.17), it was decided that,
consistent with plans to make each institution more efficient with greater
independence and accountability, BEV and JNV should have separate budgets
and accounts. For JNV, one of the basic financial implications would be
that it would borrow funds from BEV for construction financing with costs
based on the contract delivery price determined at the time of proposal
submission, or determined on a cost-plus basis. BEV's financial records
would be considerably simplified as it would only show loans to JNV
(instead of works in progress) thereby building BEV's identity as a
financial institution. Also, for both institutions, their assets, payroll,
overheads, etc., would be separated under the new system. The Boards of
both institutions have agreed to such a proposal and the new procedures
governing relations between BEV and JNV have been approved. These new
procedures were reviewed by the Bank and found to be consistent with
project goals. They are included in the Project Files.
2.24      BEV's operations have expanded significantly throughout the
country since 1984. As Annex 6 shows, between 1984 and 1986 BEV's staff in
its 27 field offices increased from 1,037 to 1,556; during the same period,
its staff outside Quito increased from 375 to 642. With the greater
geographical dispersion of activities, preparation of accounting records
manually and their storage in the regional offices impeded smooth and
timely management information flows. The current system, while adequate
for statutory Central Bank deposit requirements, does not provide enough
detail on a timely basis for improved management actions. This shortcoming
is being addressed through computerization of the national system along
with a staff strengthening program of technical assistance which is to be
coordinated with GTZ (para 2.06).
2.25      Operating Results.  Results of operations for the years ending
December 31, 1984 to-1986 with projections for 1987 to 1993 are detailed in
Annex 7, and summarized below. Between 1984 and 1986, net earnings rose
from a loss of about 16 million sucres (US$0.2 million) to a profit of
about 28 million sucres (US$0.3 million) after reaching just over 151
million sucres (US$1.5 million) in 1985.

2.26      Three key factors explain much of the relatively poor operating
results over the last three years, viz., the low rate of interest charged
to borrowers compared to inflation and cost of funds; the long period
between construction and final sale of units to beneficiaries; and a
personnel build-up in BEV/JNV. These are discussed below along with the
corrective measures being proposed to improve performance.
Interest Rates
2.27      BEV's current interest rate on new loans averages 19%.  Inflation
for the year endlng June 1987 averaged 31%, owing partly to the effects of
the March 1987 earthquake. As Annex 8, indicates, the current average rate
of interest on BEV's overall portfolio is just over 13% and most of its
loans have from 5 to 10 years remaining maturity. Nevertheless, BEV
currently has to pay around 20% on savings accounts. The negative margin
on savings accounts is somewhat compensated by non-market sources of funds
(loans from international institutions, loans from BEDE, and compulsory
purchases of its bonds by commercial banks) on which it pays around 13% on
average or, on Government contributions to its equity, nothing at all.
Like other institutions, BEV cannot charge more than the "Maximum
Conventional Rate," currently 28% p.a., on its long term loans. Under the
new mortgage loan contract that BEV has developed (Annex 9) BEV will begin
to charge a variable interest rate equal to the rate which it pays on
savings deposits (now 20% p.a.) plus a spread of 1.5% initially, so the
rate to final beneficiaries is expected to remain below the present Maximum
Conventional Rate. The Bank has received assurances that the Government
will allow BEV to charge the interest rate resulting from the agreed
formula, which is acceptable so long as BEV's savings deposit rate is
market related. The formula proposed to determine interest rates under the
project would be consistent with similar formulae applied under other Bank
projects affecting the financial sector and would yield a markedly improved
interest rate structure for BEV. Should BEV's savings deposit rates become
inadequate relative to savings deposit rates in the wider banking system,
BEV and the Bank would have to agree on a modified method of determining
interest rates on its loans. During negotiations, it was agreed that BEV
would complete a study before June 30, 1988, to determine its
administrative costs and that it would implement a phased program to
include the full amount of such costs in its onlending rate by November 30,
1990. Moreover, it was agreed that the adequacy of the level of BEV's
deposit rate would be reviewed annually with the Bank.
2.28      The new mortgage system (para 2.35) will also permit BEV to
mobilize an increasing proportion of its resources from the market. As BEV
shifts from non-market to market sources of funds, its average cost of
funds will rise, but not by enough to jeopardize an improvement in its
financial performance arising from the application of market-determined
interest rates to a larger proportion of its portfolio. It was agreed
during negotiations that BEV would begin using the newly developed mortgage
contract for all BEV loans starting in November 1988. The new system
cannot be implemented earlier than this date because lt involves extensive
changes throughout BEV.
2.29      Construction Period.  While about 70% of the works financed under
Loan 2135-EC were completed and sold within twelve months of start of



- 18 -
construction, for JNV's other works the figure was only about 40%. These
long construction and sales periods are due to many reasons, the primary
ones being delays in: (1) completion of urbanization works; (ii) carrying
out completion supervision, and ascertaining final project and unit costs
(for legal agreement with beneficiaries); and (iii), finding and selecting
beneficiaries. Also, problems In obtaining municipal permits have
occasionally led to construction delays in the past. Most of these
problems should be eliminated in the future, since JNV and private
developers would obtain municipal permits In advance and superstructure
construction would begin only after all urbanization works are complete.
The new computerization and staff strengthening system which GTZ would
promote (para 2.06), should accelerate determination of closing costs.
Regarding beneficiary selection, the proposed annual demand analysis (paras
2.04 and 2.16) would help assure that units are constructed In accordance
with target beneficiaries' demand and willingness to pay. Additionally,
the process of beneficiary selection would begin on or before construction
works commence so that units could be immediately sold upon completion.
The new graduated mortgage system (Annex 9) would also assist in making
units more marketable to beneficiaries as it would help reduce the initial
income level needed to qualify for a unit,
2.30      Personnel Expenses.  BEV's senior management does not envisage
any further need for significant expansion of Its staff as it plans to
retrain and redeploy existing staff to other areas as needed to meet BEV's
expanded and modified work program. However, there would still be need for
some Incremental staff since additional skilled key personnel are likely to
be identified through the technical assistance program (para 2.06).
Overall, over the project period, staff expenses are not expected to
increase by more than about 2% in real terms.
2.31      Details of expected financial improvements in BEV's operations
are provided in Annex 7. By 1993, BBV's financing beae is expected to be
re-oriented to more market borrowing and internally gent -ated funds (e.g.,
savings as a share of total cash source would increase ..om about 16% in
1987 to about 27% in 1993). These overall changes noted above would be
primarily due to: (i) the proposed new mortgage system under which BEV's
lending rate would be pegged to the rate it pays on savings deposit;
(ii) considerable reduction in duration of construction time and in the
volume of unsold units; and (iii), slow increases in its staff and overhead
expenses.
2.32      JNV's financial system is expected to be substantially
simplified. It would essentially borrow working capital from BEV and
build shelter units through contractors, after which it would repay BEV
based on the sale price or cost-plus amount of completed units (para 2.10).
JNV's proposed accounting system Is designed to comply with statutory
regulations and is adequate for such purpose; however, in its present form,
it does not provide several key outputs such as monthly investment in each
project and sub-project, relation of physical progress with financial
transactions, and an updated system to project funding needs. During
appraisal, these and other shortcomings of the system were discussed with
JNV, and assurances were received during negotiations that they would be
taken into consideration under the technical assistance program
(para 2.06). In terms of Immediate requirements, JNV needs to appoint a
National Finance Division Chief, a Department Head of Cost Accounting, a



- 19 -
Section Chief of Control and Planning, a National Director of Information
Systems, and a National Director of Promotion of BEV's housing program.
Assurances were received that such appointments would be iade before loan
effectiveness. An Action Plan establishing performance indicators for BEV
was agreed to during negotiations. It would be reviewed annually
throughout the life of the project (Annex 10).
2.33      Accounts and Audits.  The Government would estabJish and maintain
a Special Account in the Central Bank to finance project works.
Withdrawals and replenishments would be made in accordance with established
Bank guidelines. The Government has agreed to have independent external
audits of this account as well as of the SOE's (para 2.21) and all
accounts of BEV and JNV. These audited reports, including related
management letters, would be sent to the Bank no later than four months
after the end of the fiscal year of these entities. Under Loan 2135-EC,
BEV/JNV's accounts were audited by independent external auditors for the
first time in 1984. The audit for both its 1984 and 1985 accounts had
several qualifications with respect to such areas as incomplete accounts,
mispostings and some control deiiciencies. BEV/JNV's 1986 audit continues
to reflect some of the problems identified previously since these problems
could not be rectified fully during the intervening period. Nevertheless,
BEV/JNV have already initiated various corrective actions. The internal
audit system has been strengthened with qualified staff and there are
currently 31 full-time employees who regularly visit each of the field
offices. The auditors use uniform audit programs, and have made
substantial progress in such areas as standardizing procedures and systems
and conducting internal seminars. The mission selectively reviewed the
internal audit program and found it to be satisfactory. While the existing
accounting and control systems within BEV/JNV are adequate to meet project
requirements, there is still need for the audit system in BEV to be
improved, and the separate audit system for JNV to be established and made
functional. The technical assistance package (para 2.06) will address
these issues which would be included within the Action Plan (Annex 10)
which was agreed to during negotiations and would be reviewed annually
during project implementation. Agreement between BEV/JNV and the Bank on
Terms of Reference and implementation schedule for a program to rectify
deficiencies in BEV/JNV's accounting systems would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
2.34      Cost Recovery.  Under the previous Bank projects, the principles
of cost recovery and affordability were introduced, and in general, have
been widely accepted. Inflation and increased production costs have been
among the distortionary elements under Loans 1776-EC and 2135-EC which have
led to some concern regarding affordability and full cost recovery. The
proposed project would continue to refine and improve cost recovery
procedures (e.g. in beneficiary screening, mortgage instruments, collection
and follow-up systems), and so promote affordability and replicability
goals (e.g., in the number and variety of shelter solutions offered and in
lowered norms and standards). Expected reforms in BEV's interest rate
policies (para 2.27) would also increase levels of cost recovery under the
project.
2.35      In the context of the proposed project, a new mortgage system
would be adopted by BEV for use in all its operations (Annex 9). This
system would use adjustable rates which would vary annually with the



- 20 -
rate which BEV pays on savings deposits. An administrative charge,
initially set at 1.5% but lncreasing to full costs after two years, would
be added to this rate, and to maintain affordability, there would be a cap
on monthly payments which could not exceed 25% of household income. Any
payment amount in excess of this share would be automatically capitalized
for later payment. Should there be a need, the loan could be extended to
accommodate a longer repayment period. Expectations are that this feature
would only be necessary under unlikely circumstances in which historically
high real deposi. rates prevailed and real wages lagged. In the unlikely
event that a beneficiary is required to exceed his or her initial loan
repayment period by more than 30% and such beneficiary is up to date with
his or her monthly payment, BEV would forgive the rest of the loan. This
feature is provided to assure beneficiaries that they would not be tied to
an indefinite repayment schedule if they are without overdue payments.
2.36      Full and direct cost recovery would be achieved frorn
beneficiaries for the urbanized lots with and without various units, and
also for home improvement loans. These components comprise approximately
99% of total project costs. As is customary, technical assistance costs
(about 1% of total project costs) would be borne by the Government. BEV
would compute the costs of the units as the total of: the price of land,
all preparation and off and on-site (pro-rated, if needed) urbanization
costs (including design and supervision), superstructure cost (where
applicable), and the cost of capital during construction. The interest
rate charged to final beneficiaries for both the sites and service and
credit programs would be the rate BEV pays on its savings deposits plus an
administrative fee set at 1.5% annually (para 2.27). The rate would be
adjusted annually with appropriate adjustments made to beneficiary
repayment schedules. Household connection and user charges will be the
same as those which the utilities normally levy against similar users.
2.37      Benefits.  The proposed project is not expected to have any
adverse environmental impact. All of the envisaged work would be in
established cities where the beneficiaries already reside and therefore
displacement and relocation of residents would not occur. Construction
works would be on land zoned for such development and these lands would be
purchased by BEV, JNV, and developers and titles would be transferred to
the beneficiaries as they meet their obligations. In the context of
developing an earthquake reconstruction program for financing under Loan
2135-EC (para 1.16), the Bank and BEV agreed on constructicn standards
capable of sustaining normal earthquake risks. These standards would be
applied under the proposed project. The proposed project would have
beneficial environmental impacts in (i) its contribution to orderly
regulated development of the project sites and reduction of erosion
resulting from squatter settlements along hillsides, and (ii) elimination
of unhealthy living conditions for those beneficiaries who would receive
new units or renovate their homes and upgrade sanitary facilities.
Approximately 12,000 families would receive urbanized lots with and without
some type of unit, while about 15,000 families would receive home
improvement credits. As a result of the application of reduced
construction norms and standards to BEV/JNV's total investment program, the
weighted average cost of the housing units funded by BEV would be reduced
by about 20%, concomitantly improving housing affordability. By the end of
this project, the restructuring of BEV and JNV is expected to be complete
and they would be re-oriented toward working in a concerted manner to



- 21 -
address shelter needs on a national basis. Adoption by BEV of the new
mortgage instrument would promote mobilization of domestic resources for
shelter while improving resource allocation and shelter affordability. By
the end of the project, it is expected that BEV would function with greater
'ependence upon market sources of financing. It is also expected that JNV
would be considerably strengthened in its role as a developer. Along with
new and renovated homes, there is expected to be greater savings and
investments in durable goods as beneficiaries try to consolidate their
homes and furnish them. This, and the continued expansion of housing
production, is expected to have ultimately a beneficial impact upon
employment and other national economic activities.
2.38      Economic Analysis.  Annex 11 contains greater details on
computation of the internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the project.
For the new shelter component, project costs include the price of land, all
infrastructure and superstructure works which are done both before and
after the plots are sold to beneficiaries (including all cost of labor,
muterials, etc. for consolidation) and an annual maintenance charge
amounting to 3% of the non-land cost of the investment (i.e. 60% of
investments). For the non-land investments, a residual value was computed
based upon a twenty-five year useful life with a straight-line depreciation
schedule. Land cost was then added to this figure. Benefits of the new
shelter component were based upon imputed rental figures which were
estimated from surveys of current rental values for similar units with
similar amenities, locations, service levels, etc. For the home
improvement loans, since there would be a wide variety of works which would
be financed under this component, it was assumed that expenditures for
about US$1,321 would result in improvements which were the same as having
an addtional room in the housing unit being renovated. This conversion was
done for the convenience of having a common measuring factor. However,
field surveys indicate that most of the works are for room additions and,
even for the other works, the benefits accruing from them are similar to
those of a room addition, in terms of their cost/benefit ratios.
2.39      No assumptions were miade regarding the "without project' case
since this involves a great number of subjective elements (e.g. regarding
settlement patterns, Government reactions, etc.). Nevertheless, given
historical evidence on the way such settlements originate and develop, it
is reasonable to assume that in economic terms, the costs of such an
alternative would be much higher, and its benefits, much less than those
arising from this project. The figures in Annex 11 indicate that the
overall economic rate of return (IERR) for the project is about 13% with
the new housing component having a rate of about 11% and the home
improvement component, 18%. If there were to be a one-year delay in
project lmplementation, the overall IERR would fall to 11%, and if all
costs were to rise by 10% with no compensatory increase in benefits, the
resulting overall IERR would be 12%. Further details on the assumptions
and analysis are presented in Annex 11 and in the Project Files.
2.40      Urban Poverty Impact.  The table below indicates the range of
beneficiaries to whom the project is expected to be affordable. The home
improvement loans would be affordable to about 85% of urban families while
the largest unit (the 54 m2 unit) would be accessible to the top 40% of
families in terms of household income. The urbanized lots would be
affordable to about 80% eL the population.  The project would promote



- 22 -
improved accessibility under bEV's entire program since affordability
targets would be established for ail of BEV's wor'-s (rather than just a
subset as under Loan 2135-EC). Additionall,, the new mortgage system would
allow greater flexibility for beneficiary inclusion since lower initial
payments could he made to the extent that they do not result in repayment
schedules longer than twenty-five years. In arriving at the above
estimates, it is assumed that approximately 25% of the initial payments due
by beneficiaries would be capitalized by BEV. With the above distribution
of beneficiaries, about 50% of the project works would be affordable to
urban families at or below the poverty level (approx. US$155 per month in
household income).

2.41      Employment.  Assuming that labor comprises approximately 20
percent of the total cost of the project and the average wage level is
US$150 per month, the project is expected to generate directly
approximately 114,000 person months of employment with an additional 50% in
indirect employment. All of these jobs would of course not be net to the
economy sinice there would be some degree of displacement of existing lower
paying ones.
Risks
2.42      There are risks of nonachievement of project goals.  Most of
these are related to the change of Government which would take place in
late 1988. If a new management of BEV/JNV were to decide that it cannot
accept demand surveys as the basis for its investment decisP'ns, this could
affect marketability of BEV/JNV's products and their affordability, and
result in stocks of unsold houses. Also, if the management decided not to
continue with Bank/GTZ supported reforms in BEV/JNV, this would
substantially reduce project achievements, since the proposed
administrative, technical and financial changes are necessary to increase
productivity and efficiency and reduce subsidies. The proposal for full
cost recovery in the context of market-based interest rates and adjustment
of payments in line with inflation are other important aspects of this
project which would curtail its achievements, if not fully sustained.
Continued Government acceptance of a growing role for private developers
would be important to stimulate the supply of low-income housing, as is
beneficiary willingness to repay their loans. In this regard, should there
be a sustained decline in the real income level of beneficiaries, erosion
of BEV's financial base would result since beneficiaries would not be able
to meet their debt-service obligations.



- 23 -
2.43      All of these risks have certain probabilities of occurring;
however they are not great, mainly because this is not the first
Bank-financed project in the sector, and BEV/JNV and the beneficiaries have
all accepted and institutionalized the basic Bank-supported principles of
cost recovery and affordability. In each step of project preparation,
there were extensive discussions with the responsible officials, and apart
from agreeing to the solutions proposed, there have been important actions
taken to achieve the identified goals. For example, the Boards of BEV and
JNV have already approved plans to separate the institutions' activities
and functions, and the Government has already adopted monetary reform
policies which are consistent with the functioning of the new mortage
instrument to be introduced under the project. Regarding the possibility
of wage levels declining in real terms for sustained periods, the record
(Annex 12, pages 1 and 2) indicates that there has been a consistent
tendency to maintain real wages over the past eight years. This is a very
sensitiv, issue in Ecuador and it is not likely that the historical trend
would be easily reversed, at least over the short term. Regarding
questions of beneficiary acceptance and the role of private developers, the
second project (Loan 2135-EC) has already indicated beneficiary
satisfaction with the solutions offered and the participation of private
developers in project works is allowed under the Government's ongoing "Plan
Techo".
2.44      Reversal of these trends by any new Government would involve
policy reversals at various levels (e.g. in monetary policy and economic
philosophy), and more importantly, it would requlre the new Government to
provide greater public subsiO!es (to the extent that beneficiaries do not
bear project costs and current projected output levels are maintained).
This is a step which would be difficult, given the likely climate of
economic austerity in Ecuador over the next few years. It is therefore not
expected that policies would be adopted which would negatively affect the
proposed project.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01      The following agreements were reached during negotiations:

Land utilization coefficient
The land utilization coefficient will have to be calculated based on
the usable land area. Except in cases of land allocated for special purposes
(fov example transmission towers, railways, etc.) or where road widths are
predetermined by an urban master plan, or where the designs involve more than
2,600 houses, the minimum acceptable land utilization coefficient will be 60S.

Page 4 of 9
Where land has been allocated for special purposes or road width is
predetermined by an urban master plan, the above land use coefficient
requirement must still be met, but the calculation -- depending on the case
will be based on the total useful area less the area specially allocated or
the excess road width resulting from the width predetermined in the urban
master plan.
The above will not apply in those cases where the area allocated is
used as a green area, for parking or vehiculer traffic.
In the latter case, the area allocated for this purpose in excess of
10% of the total area can be deducted.
In cases where the design covers more than 2,600 units, the minimum
acceptable land utilization coefficient will be 552.

SECOND NATIONAL LOW-INCOME H'USING PROJECT
Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda
New Lending System
The introduction of a new mortgage loan contract by Banco
Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda (BEV) is an important innovation in the
Ecuadorian financial system. The new contract has been designed to
reconcile the need of BEV's borrowers for more affordable housing with
BEV's need to become financially stronger and less reliant on public
funds. Although designed for BEV, the new loan contract is expected to
become a model for the private savings and loan associations and, with some
further adaptation, for other long-term lenders. The purpose of this note
is to explain the operation of the new contract.
BEV's reliance on the market for the resources to finance its
ambitious housing program will grow in coming years. With the inflationary
conditions expected to prevail in Ecuador, the key to reconciling the
affordability of housing loan payments with the need for BEV to earn enough
Income to pay adequate returns to its depositors lies in using loans with
variable interest rates combined with partial capitalization of interest.
Without variable rate lending, BEV cannot ensure that its income from loans
will be sufficient to compensate depositors, cover its costs, and earn a
reasonable return on equity. Without interest capitalization the real
pattern of loan repayments would fall sharply. This sharp fall wculd not
be congruent with the real income of borrowers which, in the worst of
cases, would only decline moderately and should be expected to rise in the
long run. The specific type of adjustment proposed by BEV is discussed
below.
The interest rate on BEV's loans will be set annually by formula
initially adding 1.5 percentage points above the current interedt rate paid
on savings deposits by BEV. Because interest on deposits is paid quarterly
whereas loan payments are made monthly, and BEV charges two points for loan
origination fee along with a requirement for beneficiaries to maintain two
percent of the loan in a non-interest bearing account, the effective spread
would be approximately 3 percentage points. BEV will conduct a study to
determine its true administrative costs and the margin to be included in
its onlending interest rate would be adjusted to fully reflect such costs
within two years. Loan payments will be adjusted each year by 75% of the
amount by which the official minimum wage has changed. The initial loan
payment will be set to amortize the loan at an interest rate (the "payment
rate") considerably below the nominal rate resulting from the formula. The
payment rate will be set to cover the real rate BEV expects to pay on its
deposits, plus its administrative costs. As annual payments are divorced

A'NNEX 9
Page Z of 3
from the amounts owed year by year, there is no guarantee that the loan
will be paid off in exactly the initial repayment period selected. Under
all but the most unfavorable environments, however, simulations indicate
that the loan will be paid off in less than the selected period (5-25
years). If necessary, BEV would extend the amortization period by 30% of
the initial period in order to accommodate the need for deferred payments.
Any amount not paid after the extended period will be forgiven, provided
that the beneficiary is up to date with his or her payments. Given the
payment rate, the loan amount will be set so that borrowers' initial
payments do not exceed 25% of household income. Assuming incomes rise at
the same rate as minimum wages, the percentage of household income devoted
to housing loan payments would fall over time.
In order to illustrate how the model would work, the accompanying
table shows the amortization of a BEV loan using the new loan contract
under the following conditions:
1.  The real interest rate on deposits is +1% p.a.
2.   The real interest rate on loans is +5% p.a.
3.  Real wages fall by 30% over the life of the loan.
4.   The payment rate is +12%.
5.   Inflation varies, but averages 40%.
Under these assumptions the loan is amortized in 15 years.
Additional calculations, (not shown) indicate that the loan would still be
amortized within 25 years even if the real rate on deposits rose to 4% p.a.
