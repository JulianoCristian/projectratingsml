broad-based economic and social reform\n            program, which aims to accelerate Gross Domestic Product and\n            employment growth, and to increase access to basic services\n            and reduce poverty. The Government will pursue sound\n            macroeconomic management, initiate public sector reform,\n            encourage private sector development, and address the\n            country's social development agenda. The benefits of\n            the reform will enhance Morocco's competitiveness and\n            achieve strong, sustainable growth, while advancing the\n            country's important social development agenda.\n            Moreover, the preparation of the loan has served to promote\n            a dialogue and develop a partnership with the alternance\n            Government, and act as a catalyst in setting out a\n            medium-term framework for reform in Morocco. The project\n            risks include: potential disruption of the authorities'\n            medium-term growth forecasts, potential political opposition\n            to reforms; technical implementation difficulties; and\n            potential social problems. These risks will be mitigated by\n            the government's effort to pursue budgetary adjustment\n            and improve business environment as well as climate for\n            private investment; a close policy dialogue with the\n            Government and stakeholders; and a technical dialogue with\n            all government agencies concerned."}, "docdt": "1999-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
