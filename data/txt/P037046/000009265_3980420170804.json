The objective of the\n            operation was to assist the Government in (i) implementing\n            debt and debt service reduction; (ii) normalizing relations\n            with external creditors; (iii) improving the economic\n            environment for attracting foreign investments; and (iv)\n            enhancing the continuity and the sustainability of\n            macroeconomic policies, particularly fiscal balance. The\n            Bank's performance in coordinating support, evaluating\n            the project, and processing of the DDSR Loan and the\n            set-asides was praiseworthy. The only new lesson that can be\n            extracted from the DDSR Loan for Ecuador was the usefulness\n            of the decision by the Bank's Executive Board to\n            eliminate the segmentation in the use of funds from\n            set-asides and DDSR operations."}, "docdt": "1996-12-18T09:38:01Z"}
