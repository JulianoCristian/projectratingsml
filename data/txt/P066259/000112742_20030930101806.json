substantial\n            institutional development impact  The Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory while the borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory, with the Government and the\n            implementing agencies highly committed to the overall\n            Program.  The final outcome of the Program is dependent on\n            additional policy actions contained in the overall program\n            matrix, which could contribute to a potential future loan,\n            and are expected to materially affect the achievement of the\n            overall Program objectives.  Thus the outcome attributed to\n            some of the components has not yet fully materialized but is\n            expected to do so.  In addition to the lessons from the\n            first PFSECAL, it was learned that the success of one loan\n            in a programmatic series enhances the probability of success\n            of a subsequent loan, with the continuity of key\n            representatives of the Government and the Bank as\n            instrumental in the quality of the outcome.  With respect to\n            the design of programmatic lending, the flexibility in\n            postponing policy actions to subsequent operations in the\n            series, particularly when the timing of the reforms is\n            difficult to predict, does not detract from the substance of\n            reforms, but rather increases the likelihood of a successful\n            eventual outcome when they are finally implemented.\n            Finally, programmatic lending can be a valuable vehicle for\n            sustaining dialogue across administrations and maintaining\n            the overall momentum of reform."}, "docdt": "2003-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
