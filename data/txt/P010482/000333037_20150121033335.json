Soils are mostly thin,\n            low in organic matter and prone to erosion. Yet agriculture\n            is the mainstay of Balochistan\u0092s economy, employing 67\n            percent of the labor force, and the lack of water is\n            severely constraining agricultural development. In this\n            challenging environment, the Pakistani government is\n            responding through the Balochistan Community Irrigation and\n            Agriculture Project. Funded primarily by the World Bank and\n            the government of the Netherlands, the project is designed\n            to benefit about 7,000 mostly poor families, who farm\n            roughly 4,800 acres of land in the rugged terrain of\n            southwestern Pakistan. Typical of the project\u0092s success is\n            the experience in Pandran, an isolated village in a hilly,\n            barren region, 200 kilometers from Quetta, the capital of\n            Balochistan. Before the project began, farmers had to dig\n            channels along and across a dry riverbed to bring spring\n            water to their fields. Today, much water was lost along the\n            way, and flash floods often washed away the channels. The\n            villagers still get water from the same spring, but now it\n            is conveyed to the fields through masonry-lined channels and\n            across the riverbed by three aqueducts. A siphon and a\n            raised channel provide water to new areas, and diversion\n            boxes have been installed to allocate water equitably among\n            users. In addition,<BR>a pipeline with 46 standpipes\n            has been laid to provide clean drinking water to the\n            village. There is now an assured water supply to about 200\n            acres and 79 families benefit."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
