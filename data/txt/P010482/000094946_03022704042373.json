Lessons\n            learned from this project include the following: 1) Social\n            mobilization needs to start early because its late start\n            during the project period is less fruitful. 2) Scheme\n            selection, entailing careful screening of schemes based on\n            social, economic, and technical criteria and longer time\n            required in reaching agreements with communities on payment\n            of Farmer Organization (FO) contributions, resulted in a\n            delayed start of the construction works. 3) Weirs are high\n            cost structures and should not be routinely constructed\n            while greater emphasis should be laid on more cost effective\n            Command Area Development (CAD) works. 4) The performance of\n            pilot flood irrigation schemes has shown that the existing\n            technical criteria need redefining; the perceived economic\n            benefits should be enlarged to include possible recharge to\n            the ground water and cattle productivity in the command\n            areas as functions of flood frequency. 5) Inflexible FO\n            contracts do not accrue maximum benefits to communities; in\n            order to be fair to farmers, FO contracts should be awarded\n            at market rates. 6) Institutional benefits do not get\n            mainstreamed by entrusting implementation to PMU."}, "docdt": "2002-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
