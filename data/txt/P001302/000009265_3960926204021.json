objectives: (a) to promote the growing demand for\n            family planning services and (b) to increase the supply of\n            such services. It will accomplish this goal by mobilizing\n            and coordinating the resources of both Government ministries\n            and Non-Government Organizations. Specifically, the project\n            will : (a) strengthen the capacity of the NCPD (National\n            Council for Population and Development) to plan, program,\n            finance, coordinate and monitor population program\n            activities. It will further create acceptance of, and demand\n            for family planning services through the implementation of a\n            strategically planned and coordinated IEC (Communication,\n            Education and Communication) program; and increase the\n            availability, accessibility, and quality of family planning\n            services provided by the Government and NGO's."}, "docdt": "1988-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
