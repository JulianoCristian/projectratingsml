The project will finance\n            technical assistance, training, personnel service contracts,\n            workshops, seminars, study tours vehicles and office\n            equipment in support of the following components: (a)\n            rationalization and strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA) functions by supporting:  (i) activities\n            of MOA task forces, task groups and consultants engaged in\n            phasing out at least 48 MOA functions, developing cost\n            sharing mechanisms for at least 20 other MOA functions and\n            restructuring or preparing for privatization approximately\n            80 agricultural parastatals; (ii) strengthening management\n            systems and capacity related to planning and budgeting,\n            management training, personnel management, management\n            information system, accounting and procurement; (b)\n            strengthening of institutional capacity to formulate and\n            implement policies by supporting two sets of activities:\n            (i) policy analyses; and (ii) longer term institutional\n            strengthening.  The work program in the area of policy\n            analyses will include: preparation of sector policies and\n            programs; improved policy coordination and feedback through\n            support to strengthen the Policy Analysis and Advisory\n            Committee; improved regulations, incentives and an enabling\n            environment for private sector development; and food\n            security policy and strategic grain reserve. Support for\n            longer term institutional strengthening will include a\n            comprehensive training program, and improved work\n            environment and facilities. The project also supports the\n            following component:  (c) improving agricultural information\n            systems and services by supporting the strengthening,\n            rationalization and expansion of the agricultural\n            information base which is presently very weak.  Priority\n            will be given to supporting the country's capacity to\n            generate reliable information on crop and livestock\n            production and productivity, and marketing and trade, at the\n            national, regional and district levels by:  (i) carrying out\n            an agricultural census; (ii) expanding the subsequent\n            surveys to provide adequate data for planning and policy\n            evaluation on an annual basis; (iii) carrying out a pilot\n            survey to establish less expensive sources of data\n            collection; (iv) improving the data collection capacity of\n            the Crop Monitoring Early Warning System; and (v) improving\n            communication facilities for better collection and\n            dissemination of marketing and trade information."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
