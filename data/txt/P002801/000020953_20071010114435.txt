About this Report
      The Independent EvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities ofthe World Bank for two purposes:first, to
ensure the integrity ofthe Bank'sselfevaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank`swork is producingthe expected
results, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthroughthe disseminationof lessons
drawn from experience. As part of thiswork, IEGWBannuallyassesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lendingoperations
through field work. In selecting operationsfor assessment,preference is given to those that are innovative, large,or
complex;those that are relevantto upcoming studiesor country evaluations;those for which Executive Directorsor Bank
management have requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate important lessons.
      To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examineprojectfiles and other
documents,interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowing country to discussthe operationwith the government, and other
in-country stakeholders,and interviewBank staff and otherdonor agency staff both at headquartersand in localoffices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review,and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'commentsare attached to the documentthat is
sent to the Bank`sBoardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessmentreport has been sent to the Board,it is disclosedto the
public.
                                                                                                              0

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigorand a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to lending
instrument, projectdesign,or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basicmethodto arriveat their project
ratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion (additionalinformationis available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.orgiieg).
     Outcome: The extent to whichthe operation'smajor relevant objectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto be
achieved,efficiently. The ratinghasthree dimensions:relevance,efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includesrelevanceof
objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project`sobjectives are consistentwith
the country'scurrent developmentprioritiesand with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goaV(expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,CountryAssistance Strategies,Sector StrategyPapers,
OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extentto which the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project'sobjectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into account
their relativeimportance.Efficiencyis the extent to whichthe projectachieved,or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunitycost ofcapital and benefitsat leastcost comparedto alternatives. The efficiencydimensiongenerally is
not applied to adjustmentoperations.Possibleratingsfor Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     RlsktoDevelopmentOutcome: The risk,atthe time of evaluation, that developmentoutcomes(or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possibleratingsfor Risk to DevelopmentOutcome:HighSignificant,
Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Petfomance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensuredquality at entry ofthe operationand
supported effective implementationthroughappropriatesupervision (includingensuringadequatetransition arrangements
for regularoperationof supportedactivities after loan/credit closing,toward the achievementof development outcomes.The
ratinghas two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.Possible ratingsfor Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerfomance: The extent to which the borrower(includingthe government and implementingagency or
agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements,toward the
achievement of developmentoutcomes.The ratinghastwo dimensions:government performanceand implementing

Preface
        This report includes the ProjectPerformanceAssessmentReports (PPARs) for three
closedTanzaniaagriculture sector projects: the Agricultural Sector Management Project (ASMP)
(Credit-2537) approved20 July, 1993 and closed30 June, 2001; the Second Agricultural
ResearchProject (TARP 11) (Credit-3036) approved 29 January, 1998 and closed 30 June 2004;
andthe National Agricultural ExtensionProject I1(NAEP 11)(Credit-2899) approved 11July,
1996and closed31December 2003. The report also adds a broaderreview o f Banksupport for
the agriculture sector inTanzania since FY 1991basedlargely on a desk review o f documents,
although some o fthe fieldwork for the project assessments was able to cover limitedaspectsof
the fieldperformanceof other interventions. Boththeproject assessmentsandthe sector review
were undertakenas buildingblocks for anongoingevaluation of Banksupport to agriculture in
Africa.

        The report was preparedby the IndependentEvaluationGroup (IEG). It was basedon the
project completionandappraisal reports, the Development Credit Agreements, a reviewo f Bank
files, and discussionswith beneficiaries, Bank staff, government officials, non-governmental
organizations, institutions including universities, donors, andprivate sector managers. The
cooperationandassistance of all stakeholdersand governmentofficials is gratefully
acknowledgedas is the support ofthe World Bank Country Office inTanzania.

        The report format covers eachproject separately, covering implementation andIEG
ratipgs andthen it reviews the sector as awhole. However, it aggregatesthe lessons fiom the
projects andthe broader sector assessmentinto a single section. Following standardIEG
procedure, copies ofthe draft PPAR were sent to the government for their review and comments.
Borrower commentson TARP I1andNAEP I1are includedinAnnex C. No comments were
receivedon ASMP.

 Summary
          This report assesses the performanceofthree closedTanzania agriculturesector projects, the
 Agricultural SectorManagementProject(ASMP) (Credit-2537) closed 30 June, 2001, the Second
 Agricultural ResearchProject(TARP 11)(Credit-3036) closed30 June 2004, andtheNational
 Agricultural ExtensionProject11(NAEP 11)(Credit-2899) closed31 December 2003. The report also
 includesa review ofBank support for the agriculture sector inTanzania since FY 1991drawing
 predominantlyon adesk reviewof other projectsand sector work.

          With respectto the three projects, the assessmentrevealsmixedperformanceoverall. The
 outcome oftheAgricultural Sector ManagementProject (ASMP) is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory.
 While the support for divestitureand the reform of the ministry were potentially very important for
 sector efficiency, there was limited focus on developmentends as opposedto means interms ofthe
 impactofchanged services onruralhouseholds. The reformswere treated too much inproject design
 as ends inthemselves. Riskto development outcomes is ratedmodestand both BankandBorrower
 performanceis ratedsatisfactory.

          The outcomeof the SecondAgricultural Research Project (TARP II)is ratedmoderately
 unsatisfactorymainly onthe grounds that the evidence suggests only modest efficiency ina project in
 which efficiency was a key objective.Furthermore,there are concerns about the achievementof
 institutionalobjectivessince a numberofthe promisingprocessesput inplace by this researchproject
 are now largelyabandoneddue to the lack of budget resources. Itis difficult to define such fragile
 reform as lastinginstitutionaldevelopment. Riskto developmentoutcomes is ratedhigh, Bank
 performance is ratedmoderatelysatisfactoryandBorrower performanceis ratedmoderately
 unsatisfactory.

          The outcome oftheNationalAgricultural Extension Project I.(NAEP II)is rated
unsatisfactorydue to modest relevance, efficacy andefficiency. The projectdesign was unprepared
for the decentralizationshift andthe Bankreactedslowly even after it happened. The impact evidence
from M&Eis ofvery questionable quality, has limitedcomparisonwith controlsandtherefore offers
little evidence of attribution. Most observers reportedto the missionthat public extensionhas
deterioratedover the last decade with only a few localizedprivateor publidprivate activities to fill
the gap insome locations.The additionalprojectobjective, addedat mid-term butnot formally
approvedby the Board, of strengtheninginstitutional capacityat the local government level, shows
only modestachievementat this point. Some training was achievedat the time and some pilot
systems were tested, and insome districts the ParticipatoryAgricultural Developmentand
EmpowermentProject(PADEP) project is sustainingsome activities for a little longer. However,
most extensionstaff have negligibleoperatingfunds, andthere are few incentivesto perform.
Decentralizationis only partlyachieved, with extensionfunds coming entirely from the center but
responsibilitylocatedwith the district. Morale is low andthere is confusionabout how promotions
areto be determined. Riskto developmentoutcomes isratedhigh, and bothBankand Borrower
performanceare ratedunsatisfactory.

          With respect to the sector as awhole, over the review period from FY 1991to the present, the
Bankhasmadeanimportantcontribution inthe sector to bothpolicy andinvestment.However, there
have beenbothpositive and less positive aspects inthe Bank's performance. Some lack of analytical
rigor inthe translation ofCAS strategies into actual lendingprogramshas been an issue butthe Bank
playedagenerally positiverole insupportingpolicy and institutional reform relatedto agriculture.
This appearsto have beenachievedwith quite strongborrower ownership. However, as noted above,
the divestitureof parastatalswas seentoo much as an end initselfratherthan as arouteto improved
services for rural households. Itis probablethat somewhat less ofa "Big Bang" approachwould have

    given betterresults atthe farm level, with moreattentionto privatesector capacityanalysis and
    capacitybuildingandpublic/privatepartnership.Inthe areaoftechnology developmentand
    disseminationthere were two mainweaknesses. First, as noted, partly as a resultof incomplete
    decentralization, extensionremains ina poor state outsidesome useful localizedpilots. Second, while
    agricultural researchis inbettershapethan extension, the donor pushtowards client-oriented adaptive
    researchand immediateimpacthas left insufficient focus on sustainingthe essential baseof longer-
    term applied or strategic researchthat also shoulddraw on strongsupport from a regional approach.
    Unlesscorrected, this will gradually starve the adaptive research program.An example of an area
    warrantingmore, and more sustained, researchsupport is nitrogenefficiency and soil healthgiven the
    high cost ofinorganicfertilizer andthe recent reversionto subsidies.

             More recently, the Bank's effortsto work moreclosely with the governmentandother donors
    inthe sector is seen favorably by these stakeholders. Sustainability remainsthe biggestconcernin
    sector interventions.There has been insufficientattentionto matchingthe scale ofpublic sector
    activity to realistically projectedresources. The evidenceofthe last decade would suggest that both
    the research andextensionservices are beyondthe government's capacity to fund at their current
    scale. It is very doubtful that privatizationand costrecovery inextension serviceswill provide
    sufficient supplementationfor realpoverty alleviation impact exceptina few localizedsituations.
    Finally, the new approachto basketfunding, while offering anumber ofpotentialadvantages interms
    of efficiency of Bankand donor managementcosts, carries significant implementationrisks. The
    appraisaldocuments offer limited analysis of government institutional capacity at different levels to
    handlethis muchmore demandingapproach. Moreover, it is not entirely clear hqwthis approach
    would address the long-standingand fundamental problemof financial sustainability beyondperhaps
e   reducingthe gaps indonor support.

             Five main lessons are drawn from boththe projectassessments andthe sector review.

             There needsto be an explicit logical link betweenthe strategic and sectoral goals ofthe
             CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS) andthe proposedlendingprogram.

 1. Background

 1.1     Tanzaniacurrently has a per capitaincome o fabout $280. In2002 the overall GDP
 growthrate ofthe Tanzanianeconomy was estimatedat about 6 percent. Agriculture
 accounts for about 45 percent ofGDP with industry providing 16percent andservices39
 percent.Since 1990, agriculture growthhasbeenreasonably steady at about 3.5 percent
 although it has beenhigher inthe last few years, risingto over 5 percent over the more recent
 five year movingaverages. Tanzania is self-sufficient infood grains during anaverageyear
 and even ina year with unevenor lessthannormal rainfall.Inbetter years Tanzaniaexports
 maize, beans andother food cropsto neighbors (mainly Kenya and Zambia), notwithstanding
 laws intendedto keep food grains inthe country. Dueto variable rains andother factorsthere
may beas many as amillion families who barely meet basic food requirements.However,
recent data suggestthat the incidence ofwasting is down to 6 percent across bothrural and
urban areas, but stuntingis still widespreadwithno downward trend inrural areas
 1.2    Total land area is about 95 millionhectareswith about 44 million classified as arable
and 50 million as rangeland.Cropped land area is about 9.5 millionhectares, about 22
percentofthe arable land. Inaggregate, therefore, there are large areas o f spare land.
However, accessibility is oftenpoor. The area o f landutilizedper household has increased
substantially from about 0.7 haper householdin 1993/94 to about 2.0 hectaresin2002/03 but
the rate o f increasehas leveledoff since 1998/99. This suggeststhat there remainssubstantial
surplus landbut that this frontier is now beingapproachedprobably due to accessibility. The
averageyields of all three major cerealcrops (maize, paddy andsorghum) havedeclined
since 1986by over 40 percent (taking4 year period averages). The reasonsappearto be
partly dueto recent droughts, partlyloss offertilizer subsidies, partlyextension ofareato
lessfavorable land, andprobably also the shortage o flabor to cultivate the largerlandarea.
The decline does not appear to provide strong evidence of significant yield impact from new
technologiesincereals evenallowing for adecline insoil healthfrom reducedfallow and
loss o finputs.The percentageo fhouseholdsusinginorganic fertilizer declined from about 23
percent in 1994to about 9 percent in2003. Most o f this reduction was from 1994to 1998.
About 77 percent o f annual crops are plantedwithout fertilizer, but, rainfalli s still abigger
factor inmaize yields thanfertilizer.
1.3      However, while landproductivity overall has stagnatedor risen slightly, basedon
dataprovided by regional staff labor productivity appearsto have grown quite well, probably
partly due to shifts towards higher value commodities (Table 1) andpartly dueto a
significant extension inlandareainto more marginalareas but also into somebetter areas o f
in-migration such as Ruvumahelpedby increasedoxen use.

  1.4      Credit is not widely availableor used. Dataoncredit useis limited. About 1 percent
 offarmimplements arepurchasedwithbankcredit. Inone survey(NAEP I1Impact Survey
 undertaken by government underthe project withtechnical assistance) about 18 percent of
 respondentswere membersofsome form o fcredit group and, ofthose, about 10percent had
 received a loanmore thanonce which wouldimply less than2 percentreceiving credit
 nationally from an institution or group. However, even this may be a sample that is biased
 upwards. Market access i s limited.Apart fromthe very largepercentageofhouseholds (87
 percent) who do not marketbecause they haveno surplus, the mainmarketingproblems are
 reported by farmers to be (inorder): markettoo far; transporttoo costly; no transport; no
 buyer; no market information; andproblems withmarket union, associationor commodity
 board.
 1.5       Populationgrowthrate is currently running at about 2.6 percent. Notwithstandingan
 improvedeconomic growth rate over recent years, Tanzaniahas struggled to makeinroads on
 poverty. Growthhas tendedto beinsectors to which the poor have few links. The literature
 even refers to a "Tanzania Factor" since the growth elasticity for headcountpoverty seems to
 belowerthaninseveral otherAfrican countries (Danielson 2004). Maizeprices inTanzania
 are affected by demand inneighboring countries, particularly Kenya. After maize the most
 important contributors to GDP are paddy, bananas, beans, sorghdmillet, andcassava.
 About 168,000ha are under irrigation, only 1.8 percento fthe total cropped area. The cash
 crops representimportant exports for Tanzania butremainrelatively small percentagesof
 total agriculture GDP with tobacco and cotton at about 2 percenteach, cashew nutsand
 coffee at a little over 1 percent, andtea at about 0.5 percent. While there are manyproblems
 with Tanzanianagricultural statistics, food crop production appearsto have grown so far at
 about the rate ofpopulation growth andaccounts for about 65 percento f agricultural GDP.
 However with less scope for expansiono fcultivable landinthe future and declining or
 stagnant yields for major food crops, food crop production may struggle to keeppace with
 population growth inthe future unlessyields can be raised (Table 2) or cultivated areacanbe
 further andefficiently extendedwithout negative impact on landresources.

 1.6      LandTenure. The landtenurelaws inTanzania arebasedonthe LandOrdinance of
 1923 which has three elements(Dejene et a1 1997): (i) landispublic land; (ii) of
                                                                all                    power

                                                       3


 administration i s vested inthe President; (iii) of occupancy, whether granted or deemed,
                                                       right
 i s the primary mode ofaccess and use of land. The majority o f subsistence farmers hold land
 underthe "deemed" rightofoccupancyandoperate withina customary tenure system. While
 at one time this was criticized for giving insufficient landsecurity, a number o f more recent
 studies have suggestedthat this systemi s secure enoughas an incentive for investment and
 can beheldinperpetuity. However, it does not bestowtitle whichcan beused as security for
 borrowing. With intensification andcommercializationthis may becomean increasing
 constraint unlessgroup forms of security canbe established.

 1.7      Therehavebeenshocks inthe pastwhich impactedonlandowner expectations.
 During the ujamaavillagization programofthe mid 1970smany farmers were forced to use
 alternativeassignedplots on village block farmareas and also to follow party-dictated
 rotations. Investmentandproductivity fell. The majority of farmers are nowreportedto be
 back to their original landholdings. Surveyssuggestthat, evennow, there are some farmers
who do not feel secure about their tenure. But generally these are farmers inareaswith
 surplus landand an influx o f land-grabbingnew settlers who seize spare land without the
knowledge ofthe village andlocal authorities. However, the mainlandconflict is between
agriculturalists and pastoralistsover grazing rights andthe destruction of crops by livestock.
The 1995National LandPolicy was largely aimedat reducing such conflicts. The expansion
of agricultural land has beenestimatedat 2.5 percentper annum, close to the estimatedrural
population growth rate. The expansionof agricultural land often threatens traditional pastoral
areas, particularly dry seasongrazing locations. Recently, a numbero f government dictates
have haltedpastoralgrazing inareas traditionally usedfor livestock which has caused
problems andresentment. Community solutions under such circumstances are oftendifficult
becausethe agriculturalists andpastoralistscome from different tribalorigins andthe latter
may betranshumant, bringing livestock ontraditional migration routes from distant
locations. Briefly, therefore, while insecurity o ftenure for agriculturalists was not generally
seen as a major issueinthe past, landtenure issuesrelatedto the needfor credit collateral
andconflicts betweenagriculturalists andpastoralistscanbe expectedto increaseunless
participatory approachesto conflict resolutioncanbemore widely developed andprograms
to support agriculture better understandpastoralgrazing needs. Holdinga title is likelyto
become more important with intensification. Landtenure issues are noted inthe
government's Letter o f Sector Policy associatedwith the new Agricultural Sector
DevelopmentProject (FY06) andthe project may provide some support for the strategy in
this area.

1.8      Reform Phases and Donor Relations. The reform program andrelations with
donors have beena somewhat rocky road since 1990.Briefly, fkom about 1986 to 1992there
was aninitialspurt o freforms andanaidboom (the earlier aidboom being inthe 1970s)
(Bigstenet a12000). Fromabout 1993to 1995reforms ranofftrack, fiscal policywent out of
control andmany observers found tax evasion andconuption to berampant.Government


1. The exchangeissuesare oftencomplex. Onthe one hand, the feedvalue ofpost-harvest crop residue is
generally better thanthe naturalforage it replacedso that visitingpastoralists with grazingarrangementswith
agriculturalistscan benefit. On the other hand, there may often be a permanent lossto the pastoralistofa
valuable prior grazingright, fiequently ina dry season grazinglocation, with no long-term compensation
arrangement.

 revenue fell. Donors expressedmajor concerns. From about 1996to 1999the reform
 movement was back on track after a number of opposition parties hadtakenpart inthe first
 multi-party elections. The newPrime Minister gavehighpriority to fightingcorruption. In
 April 2000Tanzania was includedinthe HIPCinitiative. Since 2001the forward movement
 onpolicyandinstitutional reforms hascontinuedbutpoverty levels stillremainstubbornly
high.Increasingly, civil societyis contributingto policy debates, muchwithinthe framework
 ofthe Poverty Reduction Strategy Programpreparations. Duringthis period, decentralization
was taken further butfunding stillremainspredominantlyfromthe center. There remain
concerns within the private sector about the low efficiency o f government andincentives for
good civil servant performanceare still very limited.

 1.9      The Three Projects Assessed. Briefly,the three projects under review supportedthe
reformofthe central ministryservingagriculture and the associatedactivities of researchand
extension. The reform direction was towards: a focus oncore services andthe divestiture of
manyparastatals, includinggovernmentowned firms; the improvement ofthe efficacy and
efficiency o fthe agricultural researchsystem and anincreaseinthe accommodation o f client
feedback; andthe improvement o fthe agricultural extension systemincluding atrendaway
fromthe earlier rigidTraining andVisit (T&V) systemtowards a morepluralistic andclient
responsivetechnology interaction service with a focus onpoverty. Over the period o fthese
projects there were two major institutional changes which hadsubstantial impacts on these
projects. First, the provisionofpublic extensionwas decentralizedso that administrative
responsibility for extensioncame under the districts, although fundingcontinued to come
Eromthe central ministries. Second, the Ministry o fAgriculture (MOA) was split into
essentially a crop andfood security ministryand a livestock andwater ministry, an
arrangementthat hadexistedbefore the three projects buthadbeenabandoned. Part ofthe
reasonfor the split was long-standing differences, found widely inAfrica, between
veterinarians andcrop specialists.

2.      Agricultural Sector Management Project

0bjectives

2.1     The StaffAppraisal Report (SAR) statedthe objectives as follows: "The overall
objective ofthe proposedproject is to strengthen institutional capacity to formulate and
implement the government's agricultural development policies, strategies andprograms.
Specific objectives would include fostering institutional capacity to support: (i) the
rationalization andstrengtheningo f government functions inthe agricultural sector; (ii)   the
formulation and implementation o fagricultural policies; and(iii)  the improvement ofthe
agricultural information systems and services required to facilitate an effective functioning o f
the government andthe private sector inamarket-oriented economy."

2.2     The key elementsofthe government policy at the time included: phasing out the
provision o f services better done by the private sector; supporting the restructuring and
privatization o f agricultural parastatals spearheadedby the Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC); revising laws andregulations to provide an enabling environment for
private sector investment inthe agricultural sector; developing management systems and
capacityrequiredto improve the allocation andutilizationofbudgetary andmanpower

 resources,managingthe functional rationalizationand restructuringo f MOA; improvingthe
 managerial skills ofthe decisionmakers inthe Ministry;andstrengthening the agricultural
 information systemsand services that are important to supporting amarket-oriented
 economy.

 Project Design

 2.3     The ASMP credit for US$24.5 millionwith a total project cost at appraisal estimated
 at US$27.2 millionhadthree maincomponents.

     (a) Rationalizationofthe FunctionsandStrengtheningthe ManagementSystemsof
         MOA (US$7.8 millionplanned, US$2.7 millionactual).2 To support the phasing out
         ofabout 48 already identifiedMOA functions relatedto servicespotentially better
         doneby the private sector, thejoint operationby MOA inpartnership withthe private
         sector o f about 20 other functions; the privatization of about 80 agricultural
         parastatals; andstrengtheningMOA'Scapacity to managethe transition andbetter
         performthe remaining functions. ASMP was not expectedto carry out these activities
         alone. Much ofthe divestiture was inthe handsof the PSRC. ASMP was designedto
         supportthe process with studies, task forces, workshops, management, andtraining.
     (b)PolicyFormulationandImplementation(US$7.1 millionplanned,US$14.5
         millionactual). To support policyanalysis andlonger-term institutional
         strengthening.The policy analysis was to include preparationo f sector policies for
         short andmediumterm policies andprograms, improvement o fpolicy coordination
.a       through support to strengthen the Policy Analysis andAdvisory Committee,
         improvedregulation andincentives andfood security policy. There was to be support
         for a comprehensive stafftrainingprogram backedby improved work environment
         andfacilities.
     (a) AgriculturalInformationServices (US$10.8 millionplanned, US%3.8million
         actual). Focuson strengthening, rationalizing andexpanding the agricultural sector
        informationbase. Priority was to be given to supportingthe country's capacity to
        producereliable information at the national, regional anddistrict levels. Emphasis
        was to be on strengtheninginstitutional capacity for training analysis and
        disseminationof information. The component includeda national sample census,
        subsequentsurveys to provide datafor planning onanannualbasis, a pilot survey in
        one ofthe cashcrops to explore alternative methodologies, providingthe Crop
        Monitoring Early Warning System with equipment, improvingdata collection at the
        district level, and improvingcommunications equipment for better marketing and
        trade information.

2.4     Extension.The project closed 2 years later thanplannedmainly due to the initial
delay inthe approval ofthe organizational structure o fMOA but also, partly, the slower than
expectedachievementwiththe reforms. The projections were clearly unrealistic giventhe
series ofapprovals and actions knownto be needed.


2. The mainreasonsfor differencesbetweenplannedandactualexpenditure (whichwere largelyproductive
shifts)were: (1) overestimatesofthe costs ofministryreformneedsand(2) the costs for the intendedactivities
beingallocatedto differentcomponentsdue to component overlap.

 Appraisal and Quality at Entry

 2.5     Project designwas not assessedby the Bank's Quality Assurance Group. The
 completion reportratesthe quality at entry as Satisfactory. However, this assessmentfinds
 weaknessesindesignat entry since it focusedexcessively onthe inputsandoutputs as
 opposedto the outcomes andimpacts o fthe reforms. The Bank andborrower strategy was
 not simply to privatize for the sake o f it. Itwas to privatize in order to achieve improved
 support system efficiencies. There was excessive focus on identifyingwhat were "core" and
 "non-core" activities. While classifying activities inthis way was not without value, the more
 important issue was to identifywhat were suitable "core" activities for the public sectorgiven
 the capacitiesof the non-public sector.

 Implementation

 2.6     Inthis section, the discussionofimplementationisdisaggregatedby component.
 With respectto the component for rationalization of the ministry, a new ministry
 organizational structure was developed. A staffinventory and staffing planwas completed
 and 7,800 staff were retrenchedwith 7,900 beingredeployedto the regional and local
governments. About 85 percent of the original non-core functions were either privatized or
shifted intojoint ventures. Guidelineswere developedfor the formation ofjoint ventures.
The project assistedthe PSRC indeterminingsuitable divestiture strategies and contributed
to the preparation o f 177profiles for agricultural parastatalsslated for divestiture which was
above the target. Cost-sharing arrangementswith the commodity boards for the mainexport
crops were agreed. As a part o fanon-going process, some researchactivities for export crops
(e.g. tea andtobacco) were privatized. The design andimplementation o f improvedinternal
operating systems andMISwas completed andelectronic connectivity through local
networks establishedwithinthe MOA.

2.7      While these changeswere potentially far-reaching, there is little evidencethat they
ledto the hopedfor more effective ministry. The appraisalreport anticipated that the savings
from the rationalizationwould finance incremental recurrent costs, butthe agriculture
ministries appearjust as short o f operating funds now as they were prior to the project.
Particularly inAfiica, there has beenlong experience inBank-supported reformof Treasuries
takingback savings from down-sized ministries. Fundingtends to be closely relatedto staff
numbers?

2.8      About 80 percent o fthe ICRAnnex list of 101enterprises(including f m s , estates,
andranches, processingfactories includingginneries, storagefacilities, millingfacilities,
engineeringfacilities, blenders andpackers) have nowbeenprivatized, although anumbero f
these occurred after the project closed. The majority i s reported to be functioning reasonably
efficiently but the impact at farm level is unclear. There remain a numbero fproblems
including: farms taken over byprivate buyers who do not have the capacity to investand

staffhadexpectedthe savings to go at least partly towards an increase inoperatingfunds. It neverhappened.

 2.9      Withrespectto the componentfor strengthening institutional capacity, the evidence
 suggestsa substantialand generallyworthwhile training inputbythe project. Against a total
 appraisaltarget of 70,23 staffreceivedlong-term overseastraining and 53 received short
 term overseas training, fully meeting the appraisal target. A total o f 155 staffparticipated in
 various workshopson to,pics suchas researchmethodology, report writing, commodity
 policy review, policy planning, andmacro policies. There was also aprogram o f on-the-job
 training (OJT) andpersonalservice contractshpecial service assignments inwhich staffwere
 providedwith mentors, usually from auniversity. The project supported 18 major policy
 studies. While there were some lossesoftrained staff to retirement, the private sector, and
 NGOs supportingagriculture, ministry staff report that the majority ofthose trained are still
 withthe ministry.The project also assistedinthe establishmentofaTanzaniaChamber of
 Agriculture andLivestock as an apex organization for industry-basedagricultural
 associationssuchas the cotton, cashew, tobacco, sisal andcoffee growers associations.

 2.10     With respectto the agriculture information systems and services component, there
was a useful pooling o f staffandresourcesbetweenthe Agricultural Statistical Unit ofMOA
 andtheNationalBureauofStatistics. This collaborative arrangementhascontinued although,
 since the project closed, fbnding has againbecomea major constraint. The Statistical Unit
developedan agricultural databasesystemandalso strengthenedmarket informationand
monitoring activities. Inaddition, the Early Warning Systemrelatedto food security was
strengthened.However, again, this is struggling due to lack ofresources.

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.1 1     With respectto monitoring, at this distance, more than five years after the project
closed, it is very difficult to assessthe quality. There is some evidencethat itwas satisfactory
since there is reasonablyadequateinformation on the stage o fprivatizationofthe various
entities beingdivestedandthe records onthe training componentappear satisfactory. The
files offer some evidence inprogressreports that suggestthe maincomponent indicators
were beingmonitored at the time. There is anadequaterecord ofthe large numbers of studies

                 ~~     ~      ~~    ~~




4. The lackofbusinessskills and financialcapacity inmany privatizedentities and businessescould have been
less ofa problemifthere hadbeena more measuredphasingofthe divestiture, as is beingdone inVietnam (see
later sector discussion).
5. For example, the government-owned livestockranchnear Mwanza, visitedby the mission, is over 9,000
hectares,a huge area for that fairly highpopulationdensity area, yet it only produces300 heifersper year to sell
at what is claimedto be, but may not be, a subsidized cost to farmers. While operating costs at this ranch are
carriedby sales revenue, salariesandall capital equipment andvehicles are paid for by the governmentbudget.
While the missiondidnot havethe time to do any financial analysis onthis, as it stands, it is clearly a hugely
inefficientdrainonthe government budget, It was reportedby the staff inpostthat it is plannedto use it for
trainingandthat the livestock researchstaffwill movethere as the split between crop and livestock researchis
consolidated. This appears to be more a supply-driven responseto a spare resourcethan a component ina
demand-drivenrationalizationprogram.

                                                a

 that were completed. Inaddition, the record o f staff numbersover the period ofretrenchment
 provides evidenceby grade and location. However, withrespect to evaluation, there was
 little evidence available o fthe impacto fthe divestiture andministryreorganization on clients
 andthis is given highweighting inthis M&Eassessment.Itis bothadesignand
 implementationproblem, althoughpredominantly the former, and reflects on quality at entry.
 Overall therefore, it is concludedthat M&Edesign was unsatisfactory,that M&E
 implementation was unsatisfactory, but that M&E utilization (of what limitedevidence did
 become available) was generally satisfactory.

 PerformanceRatings

 OUTCOME
 2.12    Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory on the grounds ofsubstantial relevance,
 modest efficacy andsubstantial efficiency. The project didcontribute to a hugely important
 shift inpublic sector strategy towards a reduction inthe very costly government role in
 servicing agriculture through often highly inefficientpmastatalenterprises.Nevertheless,
there were significant weaknesses.

RELEVANCE
2.13     Overall relevanceis ratedsubstantial, although there were several weaknesses. The
relevanceofthe objectives andthe relevance o fthe design are considered. The relevance o f
theobjectives, whichwere essentiallyto strengtheninstitutional capacityto formulate
policies insupport ofthe overall divestiture program, is rated, on balance, substantial. The
divestiture strategy was a highpriority to reducethe burdeno fparastatalson the economy
andto improve serviceperformance, particularly inmarketing. Thisaspect is given high
weight inthe rating. Nevertheless, the aimto focus the ministry andretainonly core
activities inMOA andto supportthe divestiture was not the whole ofthe relevance story.
The issue was not merelywhat activities could be best carried out by the central ministry@),
itwas alsowhat activities couldbebest carriedout bythe private sector, bypartnerships, or
bymore independentcommodity organizations, given the capacity ofthese alternative
service mechanisms at the time. Nevertheless, the overwhelming importance ofaddressing
the problems o f inefficient, loss-making public entities i s the mainrating determinant o f a
substantialrating inthis case. The design also didnot adequately addressthe importance o f
ensuringimpact of servicesat the fanner level, particularly onthe poor. It should have
focusedmore on the development ends. This contributed to the limitedattention to providing
support for privatized enterprisesand servicesthe need for whichwas eventually appreciated
at the mid-term, buttoo late for much impact.

EFFICACY
2.14     On balance, efficacy inachieving the objectives is ratedonly modest. With respectto
the rationalization and strengthening of governmentfunctions, while the support for
divestitureinterms o f studies and guidelines was largely achieved, albeit more slowly than
planned, there remainquestions about the extent to whichgovernment core functions were
really strengthenedina sustainablemannerbecause, following the downsizing, resources
were also downsized accordingly, makingit very difficult for the leaner ministry to perform
any better inthe core businessthat itretained. While this is difficult to assess quantitatively,
                 e

                                                 9


 few stakeholdersspokento by the mission, either withinthe public sector or outside it, had
 observedmuchchange inthe capacity ofthe ministryto servicethe sector andaddressthe
 priority issues. Furthermore, the creationofa separate livestock ministryhas almost certainly
 undone a lot ofany efficacy and efficiency gainby doubling management overheads andby
 splitting crop and livestock researchinstitutes when the opposite, rationalization, was needed.
 Ithasalso ledto lossoffarm systemsintervention coordination. The Bank's Africa Region
 has arguedthat the rationalizationelement ofthe objective should be givenmore weight.
 However, the fact that the overarching statementinthe objectives was "to strengthen
 institutional capacity to formulate and implement the government'sagricultural development
 policies, strategies andprograms" suggests that the predominant weight should be on the
 institutional performance. Moreover, the rationalization was subsequentlysubstantially
 negatedbythe split into the two ministries. Itis also difficult to assess at this project
 evaluation levelthe benefits o f any releasedfunds elsewhereinthe economy. Itis concluded
 that this elementofthe objectives warrantsamodest rating.

 2.15     With respect to developinggovernmentpolicies, some significant output is evident
 over the project period. There were 18 major studies completed under the project (see ICR
Annex 7B for list). These included, among others, the medium-term sector development
 strategy, the agricultural andlivestock policy, an agricultural input supply strategy, two
papers on taxation inthe agriculture sector, a review o fthe legal framework for the sector, a
study on food security inTanzania, andapublic expenditure review. While the impact of
these studies ongovernment decision-making is not easy to assess giventhe wide array of
factors supportingpolicy change, the majority of these studies were clearly relevant and,
basedon discussionswith stakeholdersinthe sector, appearto have made contributions to a
number ofthe reform decisions. This element ofthe objectives warrants asubstantiazrating.

2.16     Withrespectto improving information systems (to which we attribute a somewhat
lower weighting thanthe other two objectives) the issue of sustainability cannot be
discounted when an objective calls for animproved "system". While over the period ofthe
project, there is evidence o f some quite significant information achievements, such as the
agricultural census reportedon earlier, but, as with so many investments, the capacity to
sustainthese systems has since declined. The information systems appear somewhat better
than beforetheproject butgiven the sustainability concern it is difficult tojustify ratingit
more thanmodest interms ofsystem improvement.

EFFICIENCY
2.17     Though efficiency is difficult to assess insuch aproject it is ratedsubstantial largely
on the basis of aqualitativejudgment.No economic analysis was done anditwould be
unreasonableto expect such ananalysis with sucha diverse array of activities and, by design,
only a contributory attribution. Notwithstanding the concerns expressedearlier about the
excessive focus on means rather thanends, it is clear that the divestiture process itselfoffered
substantial cost savingsto govenunent andthat the roleo fthe ministry inthis was catalytic
for the overall programo fthe PRSC.

2.18    Withrespectto the subsequentefficiency ofthe entities divested, many government
owned farms, processingfactories, andmarketing agencies were highly inefficient before the
reforms. However, the efficiency estimation o fthese activities cannot be assessedsimply as

                                                   10


 savings of lossesto the government exchequer. The efficiency question for the economy of
 Tanzania is howthe national cost andbenefit streamsacross the economy shifted withthe
 project-induced institutional changes. While there is insufficient evidence to assess this
 across all the individual divested entities, itis possible to use some particular cases and
 broader anecdotalevidenceto piece together a partial picture.

 2.19    With respectto marketing divestiture, overall, efficiency appearsto haveimproved.
 The mission focused particularly on cotton, coffee, and maize. The majorityof farmers and
 stakeholders who were interviewed believedthat there havebeenimprovementsin
performance. Positive responsesby farmers are significant because, for a number o f export
crops, global prices have declined considerably over the period o f assessment.6The few
studies available, some by the World Bank, generally confirm the positive change in
marketing. For example, Baffes (2005) found that during the six seasons prior to the reforms
the averagegrower's share was 41 percentofthe cottonexport pricewhereas inthe six
seasons after the reformthe share was 51percent. Moreover, payments were made more
promptly. Prior to the reforms growers often hadto wait as long as two years for payments
over a period when inflationwas runningat over 20 percent. Inthe broader institutional
development sense, the "Rules ofthe Game" inTanzania have changed substantially ina
positive direction over the last decade andthis project can claimto have partially contributed.
Farmers cannow sell to a reasonably competitive range of buyers. Ingeneral, undesirable
market manipulation by commanding newplayers, as has sometimeshappenedinother
countries such as Malawi, has not beenwidespread. Clearly, Tanzania could not continue
carrying largenumbers ofmostly inefficient loss-making parastatalswith weak public goods
rationale. Rationalizationwas necessaryandwas achieved, albeit perhapstoo hastily insome
cases. Also on the positive side, the project inquestion enhancedskills. The reforms also
meantthat the government was no longer subsidizing inputs.This ledto arise ininputcosts
which was bad for the farmer but good for the government budget. Fertilizer use declined. In
the post reform periodthere was only a moderate increase incotton production andsome
decline inquality probably due to the reduced fertilizer application.

2.20     With respectto government-owned farms, the picture is less clear sinceit appearsthat
anumber of farms that were privatized havenot beenefficiently operated. Onthe other hand,
many o fthose retainedare inefficiently used also, one visited by the mission grossly so. With
respectto particular types o fprocessing, there have been someproblems becauseprocessing
technologies at the time of sale were out o f date, for example incashew factories. With
respectto privatized estatessuchas tea and sisal, the story is so far mixed, butthere is some
reasonto believe that the private owners will performmore efficiently over the longterm.

2.21     The efficiency o fthe training activities appearsto have been satisfactory, targets were
largely met withinthe budget andthe majority o fthose trained remainedintheir service.

2.22     Withrespectto the efficiency ofthe ministries, inparticular agriculture andlivestock,
as notedearlier, the majority ofpeople interviewed who hadexperienced some interaction


6.For example,the world cottonprice in2002 was about halfthe price it was in 1996. Arabica coffee in2002
was about one third the price of 1996.Cashews in2002 were about 60 percent ofthe price in 1996. Tobacco,
sisal andpyrethrumprices were also downover that period.

 withthe MOA beforeand since the reforms havenot noticed any obvious efficiency
 improvements inthe quality ofthe servicesprovided. Itis difficult to makethe same
 comparisonwithlivestock which was a smaller share ofthe previous unifiedministry. A
 further aspect ofefficiency is relatedto the splittingofthe ministries. The mission came
 acrossevidence ofthe inefficiencies ofthis change. For example, livestock researchat
 Ukiriguruandat Selianzonalresearchstations, which hadbeenquite well integratedwith
 crop researchfor some years, is now inthe processof splittingoffnotwithstanding earlier
 commitments duringthe time o f the project that crop andlivestock research would remain
 integrated.Livestock researchersare about to move out of the researchstations to develop
 newlivestock centersnearby. This is plainlyinefficient bothonthe cost andbenefit side,
 particularly since the evidence suggeststhat eventhe current stock o fresearch institutions i s
 well beyondgovernment's capacity to sustain.

 2.23     Weighing allthe above aspects, on balance, but giving substantial weight to the very
 far-reaching efficiency impact ofthe institutional reforms inmarketingsupported by the
 relatively modest investments under this project, there is a case for a substantial rating for
 efficiency on overall cost-effectivenessgrounds.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT              OUTCOME
2.24      Riskto developmentoutcome isratedmodest.' The downsizingofthe ministry and
the divestiture ofthe non-core activities would be almost impossible to reverse. This leaves
the question ofthe development risk inthe divested institutions andthe ability o ftheseto
service the poor. With respectto the marketing activities, which for scale o feconomic impact
shouldbe giventhe greatestweight, while one should expect acontinuing evolution with
greater competitionwithinthe private sector, most ofthe industries appear to be relatively
well establishedandcapable of further enhancing servicesto farmers. However, in
commodities suchas coffee, weak long-term price prospectswill call for continued gains in
industry efficiency ifit is to compete with countries like BrazilandVietnam. Withrespectto
divestedfarms andsome processing suchas cashew, the picture is less clear. Some f m s
appear to be strugglingandtherefore are likely to change handsand shift products before
stability andprofitability is attained. The risk to the continued provisionof services to the
poor is more difficultto assess. There is not yet much impact evidence.

BANKPERFORMANCE
2.25      BankPerformanceis, onbalance, ratedsatisfactory, basedonanoverallsatisfactory
rating for entry andsupervision, although on quality at entry there was a significant issue.
The lack of focus inproject design on the impact ofthe reforms at the beneficiary level was a
significant weakness. However, this is outweighed by other positive design performance

7. The Regionhasarguedthatthere is a disconnectbetweenthe ratingoutcomeofmoderatelysatisfactoryandrisk
to developmentofonly modestandalso that the appropriateindicator for the performance ofthe privatizations
shouldnotbethe performanceofformer SOEsbutthe overallmarket efficiency createdbythe reforms. While
there is some validity inthese points, IEG argues that the outcome ratingis an aggregationofthe relevance,
efficacy andefficiency ratingsandthat, partly for the reasonsgivenbythe Region, efficiencywas indeedrated
substantial withrelevancesubstantialbutthat efficacy,basedonthe weightedachievementofthe objectives,
remainsmodest. IEGalso arguesthat relevanceactuallystillhadsignificantweaknessessince, as noted, there was

 aspects in this very important anddifficult area ofparastatalreform. Borrower staff felt that
 the Bankhadbrought wide global experienceonthe issues facing Tanzania andhadnot
 imposed its views. Quality o f supervisionwas generally satisfactory andwas favorably
 commented on bythe borrower. Documentationwas generally satisfactory. The ICRpraises
 the Bank supervision missions for beingproactive inraising the disbursementpercentageo f
 IDA funds andthus reducingthe problemwithcounterpartfunds, however itisnot entirely
 clear that this was positive for the longer term. Essentially, ittemporarily bought (as opposed
 to brought) the project out of a financial sustainability problem which neededto be facedand
 addressedat a deeper level.

 BORROWER      PERFORMANCE
 2.26    Borrower performance, on balance, is also ratedsatisfactory althoughthere were
 some performance issues. The MOA itselfappearsto have performed well under quite
difficult and uncertain circumstanceswith many staffposts injeopardy. There was a strong
project preparation team from the government sideanda series ofimportant preparationand
opening workshops. Moreover, as noted inthe ICR, financial managementandprocurement
for the project were bothratedhighby Bank specialists. The borrower's programof
divestitureis partly attributable to the project although supported over time by anumber o f
interventions. However, there were some counterpart fundingproblems and again, the
decisionto split the ministries negatedsome ofthe positive aspectso fborrower performance.

3.       SecondAgriculturalResearchProject

Objectives

3.1      The project objective at appraisalwas stated as follows: "to support the generationof
technology to increase efficiency andproductivity ofcrop and livestock production systems
withsustainableuseofnaturalresources, focusing onthe needsofthe smallholder sector."
Also statedinthe objectives sectionwas the following list o f subsidiary elements: that the
project would continue to supportthe institutional development o fthe national agricultural
researchsystem, assist indecentralizing financial resourcemanagement, support
privatization o fresearch as appropriate, emphasizeclient-oriented adaptive research,
strengthenextensionhesearch linkages, emphasizeafarmingsystemsresearchapproach,
improve researchplanning, andassistinhumanresourcedevelopment.

3.2     At mid-term, the objective was somewhatexpandedto reflect anincreased
institutional development emphasis.At this point, the objective became: "to increasethe
efficiency andproductivity o fcrops and livestock production systems focusing onthe
smallholder sector andinstitutional strengthening." While this didnot significantly change
the aim it added a signal about the means. Interestingly, the additional languagewas simply
tackedon the endwhich seems to have allowed it to be treated as an insufficiently substantial
changeto require seeking further Board approval. Sincethere was no formal restructuring,
the project is assessedagainst the original objectives. However, institutional strengthening
clearly was a means to these higher level objectives. This adjustment of objectives,
appropriately, ledto greater focus onthe financial andmanagement devolution to the Zonal
ResearchCoordinators, the pursuitofgreater private funding for agricultural research, and

                                                 13


 the strengtheningo f the capacityof the central Department ofResearch and Development to
 improve researchplanning, M&E andhumanresource development. But,particularly for
 M&E,itwastoo late.

 ProjectDesign

 3.3      Total project cost was US$22.98 millionwith anIDA funding o f US$21.75 million.
 A numberofbilaterals committedparallel support totalingUS$23.10million. The bilaterals
 were: Netherlands, UK (DFID), Germany (GTZ), Sweden(SIDA), EuropeanUnion, Ireland
 (Irish Aid), Norway (NORAD), andDenmark(DANIDA). There were three project
 components.

     (a) InstitutionalDevelopment(US$2.9 millionplanned, US$3.1 millionactual) was
         focused on decentralizationandgreatermanagementandfinancial empowerment to
         zonal stations, redefinitiono fthe roles ofthe central department, the National
         Agricultural ResearchCouncil, andthe Zonal ResearchStations, establishment of a
         zonal executive committee, a phaseddownsizing o f the researchestablishment,
         privatization of research, improvedresearch/extension/fmer linkages, consultant
         costs, improved financial managementsystems, operational costs andproject
         monitoring and evaluation.
     (b) ResearchPrograms. (US$8.5 millionplanned, US$8.1 millionactual) were focused
         on supporting researchprograms, mainstreaming o fthe Sokoine University of
         Agriculture (SUA) into national agricultural research, the establishment o f zonal
         researchfunds, continued support to the ongoing national Agricultural Research
         Fund, operating costs for researchprograms, some strengtheningofresearch
         infrastructure at SUA, guidelines for operating the agricultural researchfunds, and
         irrigation facilities for researchfarms.
     (c) ResourceDevelopmentand Management. (US$11.5 millionplanned, US$11.6
         millionactual) was focused onthe development o fhumanresources, research
         infrastructure, improving support services, assistanceto SUA for training programs,
         consultantandtechnical assistanceservices, selective rehabilitation o f research
         stations, equipment and infrastructure, strengthening financial management,
         information and communications services, documentation andlibrary services, and
        M&E. The project also supportedtrainingandstrengtheningofthe central
        DepartmentofResearchandTraining inMOA.

3.4     Extension.The project closed one year later thanplanneddueto substantialdelays in
the first two years partly due to insuficient counterpart funds, but also due to slower than
expectedestablishment ofthe institutional reforms, and slower disbursementanddelayed and
poor construction:But inthe end disbursement was close to 100percent o f what was
planned.

Appraisaland Quality at Entry

3.5     The project was not assessed for performance by the Quality Assurance Group. The
quality at entry o fthe project is assessed by this report as only moderately satisfactory in
accordancewith the ICRassessment. The mainweakness at appraisalwas the limitedfocus

                                                 14


 onthe assessment o fthe impact of researchandreflectedinweak definitiono findicators.
 This weakness later affected the evaluationofperformance, althoughthe MidtermReview
 (MTR) belatedly redirectedattentionto addressthis.

 Implementation

 3.6     Over the project period, the institutional framework for researchwas strengthened
 anda numbero fnewtechnologies were generatedwith some dissemination, inparticular in
the areaof improvedvarieties. There was a substantialincreaseinprivate sector funding for
 cashcrop researchparticularly coffee andtea. This hadbecome largely industry-financed
 although this now seems to be about to change with a recent government decision to banthe
 cesses for researchandto make upthe funding from the budget.(The reasonfor this decision
 appearsto havebeento avoid any possible constraints to exporting which the collection of a
 cess canimpose). The extent to which the project researchcanclaimto have contributed to
the generally satisfactory, although not spectacular, agricultural GDP growth ratesis difficult
to assess but it is probable that the long-term Bank-hded support for agriculture researchin
Tanzania has beenone factor inthis achievement.

3.7      Looking at the individualcomponents, withrespect to the institutional development
component,over the period of the project, greater devolution of financial andmanagement
authority inthe development of the zonal researchstrategywas achieved for the Zonal
ResearchCoordinators. Zonal Executive Committeeswere establishedwithsubstantial
representationfrom researchusers. Inaddition, the Zonal Technical Committees andInternal
Program Reviewcommittees were established.The aim o fall these institutional changes was
to strengthenthe interaction betweenresearchersand stakeholders, make researchmore
demanddriven, andenhancestrategic planning.MOUswere signed withthe Zonal Research
Centers andthe Local Government Authorities (LGA) inan attempt to pullinadditional
funding. This appearsto be optimistic, andarguably adesignweakness at this stage of
decentralization transition, since first, research, with its returnsto scale andpublic good
aspects, is not as well-suited to suchlocalfunding as many other investments; second, inany
case, districts are currently collecting a very lowpercentageo ftotal funds neededandthere
are many needs more suited to funding fiom local revenue; andthird, extension hasmuch
greaterjustification for local funding support yet is getting almost zero from the districts at
present.

3.8      There were a number o fweaknesses. First, it is questionable whether these new
institutional processes can really be defined as being "established" because, since the closing
o fthe project, mucho fthe coordination activity that hadbeenestablished has ground to a
halt due to lack of funds. Second, the MOUs withthe LGAs, even ifjustified, havebeen of
little practicalvalue since the LGAshave had very few funds to pass on to researchand, in
any case, one would anticipate increased"free-riding" infbture once LGAs realize how few
other LGAs nationally have contributed. Resourcesare very limited, only about 10percent of
LGA budgetis locally raisedanda number of"nuisance taxes" andadevelopment tax have
beenhaltedby national legislation which will reducethis. Third, farmer representation still
tends to be dominated too muchby progressive farmers. Fourth, there are concerns because
o f questions about sustainability. The evidence suggests that, yet again, researchactivities

                                                15


buildupanddeveloplinkageswith clients during the peak funding periodof aproject only to
sink back downto a power-conserving, almost hibernation mode once the project closes.

3.9      Withrespectto impact evidknce fiom clients, there was animpact studycarried out
for TARP 11.However, unfortunately, it hasmanymethodologicalweaknesses which make it
ofvery limitedvalue inoutcome evaluation(See Box 1).


Box 1. Weaknesses inthe Impact Study

Some ofthe mainproblemswith the study (Tanzania AgriculturalResearchProjectPhaseTwo
(TARP 11) Survey ReportofFarmers' ParticipatinginOn-FarmResearch, May 2004) arethe
           -
following: (i)The survey didnotcoverthe full rangeofTanzaniafarmers, only those who hadactively
collaboratedor comparator non-collaboratorsinthe same villages. (ii) Samplingwas notrandomand
allowedsubstantialfreedom of selectionto get a "theme mix". Drop-outswere treateddifferently in
differentplaces. (iii) was little comparisonwith the baselinesample. The originalintentionwas
                     There
to compare the 2003 findings with earlier 1998baselinespartlyutilizingthe same sample. It is still not
entirely clearto the missionwhy this was notdone. (iv) There are a number of substantialanomalies
betweentext andtables which raise questions about the validity ofthe data. (v) All the enumerators
were researchersor were from the researchdepartment inthe ministry andthereforehada stake inthe
outcome. (vi) The very limitedanalysisofthe comparisonbetweenthe collaboratorandnon-
collaboratorsample seems selective.

3.10    Giventhe problems enumeratedinBox 1, there are questions about.the validity o fthe
findings. Notwithstandingthese questions, some ofthe mainfindings were:

        85 percent o frespondentswere "visited by extension workers". However, the highest
        percentagebyRegionwas 17percent (for the Southern Highlands) which suggests
        that the 85 percent is an error;

        The maize yieldofcollaborators averaged 1,636 kgper ha and o fnon-collaborators
        1,290 kgper ha. (significant at the 5% level);

        22 percent o fcollaborators and22 percent ofnon-collaborators gave lack of
        knowledge as the mainreasonfor not usingimproved seed (which suggests
        collaborators are not gettingmore information onvarieties than non-collaborators);

       22 percent of collaborators use oxenploughmg compared to 16percent ofnon-
       collaborators (perhaps dueto a collaborator selection bias since researchis not
       involved widely with ox cultivation);

        19percento fcollaborators usedtop dressingfertilizer (mostly urea) compared4th
       21percent o fnon-collaborators (the report explains the negligible difference as
       possibly the result of parallel interventions targeting non-collaborators);

       55 percent use improved maize varieties;

       Time spent by collaborators on on-farm trials averagedabout 4 man-days.

                                                        16


 3.11      Withrespectto the Research Component, over the projectperiod, 37 improved
 varieties and 10 livestock innovations were disseminated, with at least some of the research
 for those technologies arisingfrom project support. O fparticular value have beenthe six new
 maizevarieties including Quality ProteinMaize andnewrice andbeanvarieties. Some of the
 most importantbreedindadaptationachievements were resistanceto Grey LeafSpot and
 CassavaMosaic. There was also animportant contribution inthe production and
 dissemination o f athermostable (Le. not requiringrefrigeration) NewcastleDiseasevaccine
 which was important for income and nutritionofpoor householdswho oftenkeep small
 numbers ofhighlyvulnerable poultry. h e approachfollowedwas the Client Oriented
 ManagementApproach (CORMA) which evolved from the earlier Farm Systems Approach
 (FSA). C O W aimedat buildingontwo mainfactors: that researchshouldbeclient
 oriented, andthat managementcapacity should stay current andadapt to a rapidly changing
 competitive environment.

 3.12     The IEGmission focusedparticularly on the Conservation Agriculture technology
 adaptive researchsince it appearedto behighly relevant andalso a good case for the farm
 systems approachadopted. The achievements ofthis programhave beenimpressive,
although modest inscale. The work out o fthe SelianResearchCenter inKaratu District
tested andadaptedtechniqueswith lablab (a legume Dolichos lablab, Mucuna hasalso been
used) inmaizeinconjunction with zero tillage. The results appear very promising and
possibly replicable throughout largepartsof Tanzania. Some ofthis work came out o fthe
Sasakawa-Global2000 program butthe project took it further andthe work has since
advanced. This technology is promising for the breadtho fwhat it offerse8However, what
seems to be missinginthis adaptiveprogram is the background of strategic or applied
research that lies behind this technology withpotential to enhance it. Inthis case, a number
ofaspectsappear to need morework including: legume nodulationandoptimization of
nitrogen fixation, inoculation options, interactions with inorganic fertilizer, lime seed
treatment, andthe complex linksto broadersoil healthwork. (see Box 2):                      This i s a
particular case of a more general finding. The swing towards adaptive client-driven research
appearsto havebeen excessive. All donors seemto havemto the same side o fthe ship at
the same time. Ifthe Bankhas any dominant comparative advantage inthis sector it is to


8. It offers nitrogenfixation, weed suppression, soil protection from rainfall impact and surface w o f f ,
increased surface organic matter, phasednutrientrelease i.e. elements of integratednutrient management,
minimal soil disturbanceat sowing andthereforereducedweed germination, maintenance of soil structure, and
enhanced overall soil health, reducedcultivation labor, some shifting of labor into the slack period (e.g. post
maize harvest lablabharvesting), supplementaryfodder production, andriskmitigationthrough an intercropped
two product system.
9One ofthe borrowercomments (Annex C) is that the borrower fails to understandwhy the report says there
has beenlittle focus on legumesconsideringtheir role as fertilizers andon humannutrition. A total of 13
legumevariety releases are cited. We acknowledgethat a numberofuseful new legumevarieties have, indeed,
beenreleased, but, as discussedabove andinBox 2, the mission's concernwas that there hadbeeninsufficient
focus on the strutegv of nitrogen capture for farming systemsandthe associatedtechnologiesof inoculation,
husbandryandassociated farm system andsoil health issues. Inother words, we are suggestingthat, giventhe
highNcosts, aresearchprogramplacing nitrogencaptureandbroadersoilhealthas the centralobjective would
achievemore for Tanzania agriculture as a whole than simply a program oflegume variety breeding.(The
ConservationAgriculture program is still quite small). Such a strategyas proposedwould still yieldimproved
varietiesbut with somewhat differentselectioncriteria andsupportneeds. The opportunity for improved N
capturemay now be enhancedover the opportunitiesa decade ago with recentbiotechnology options.

 maintainsupport balanceandto ensurethe maintenanceofthe core strategic research.
 Interestingly, the same finding emerges inthe Kenya SecondNational Agriculture Research
Project ICR(June 2004) coming from anexternalprogramreview. A donor consultant
 spokento inTanzaniahelda similar view ofthe Tanzaniaprogram.

3.13     Inrelationto coordination, the PADhadcorrectly notedthat, as amember oftwo
sub-regionalresearchorganizations, the SouthernAfrican Center for Cooperation in
Agricultural Research(SACCAR) andthe Association for the Strengthening of Agricultural
ResearchinCentral and SouthernAfrica (ASARECA), Tanzaniawas well positionedto
access technologies and adapt them, although it didnot go any m e r into howthat
collaboration might be supported. Over the project period, however, collaboration with the
CGIAR system and other outside researchbodies andassociationshas beengenerally
effective and increasingly wide-ranging. Over the last 15 years, there has beenaburgeoning
of networks andsub-networks. The constraint now for Tanzanianresearchersi s more inthe
financial resourcesfor scientists to travel andto play their part inthe collaboration than inthe
lack of organizational associationsthemselves.

3-14    Underthe long-standing SpecialProgramfor AfricanAgricultural Research
(SPAAR) andunderthe later establishedbasicprinciples withinthe Frameworks for Action
(FFA), there hasbeenimportant knowledgesupportfor systemsofaccountability, staff
deployment andprogramming. The project under review gave further management support,
although the FFA master-planning itselfwas initiatedsome time prior to this project. More
recently, FARA, the Forum for Agricultural ResearchinAfrica has beenestablishedunder
SPAAR to complement national, international, and sub-regionalwork. Itsubsumed, with
ISNAR's help, the SPAAR work inthe transition to FARA (the FARA secretariat is hosted
by FA0 inAccra)." There are also a number of smaller, more targetedcollaborations suchas
the African Conservation Tillage Network (ACT). The benefits ofregional research
collaboration are nowbetter understoodandexchangeo f information between countries is
improvedand, ofcourse, facilitated bythe increasing use o fthe internet, the latter again
constrainedbyfunding. It i s very difficult to separatewhat was contributed by Bankprojects
andwhat camefromthe numerous collaborations, butthe difficulty inattribution herewould
seem to be a good thing, implyingadoption ofprocesseswidely agreedand supported by all
players. There have beensome weaknessesidentifiedinthese collaborations, for example,
one study found weaknesses inaddressingpolicy researchunderthe FFA due to skills
shortage inthis area. However, by andlargethey havesubstantially enhancedthe exchange
ofknowledge andTanzania has been well at the forefront, hostinga number of key
collaborative meetings. Links withthe CGIAR systemhaveremained strong.

3.15    At the researchprogram level, one example ofrecentcollaborative researchis inthe
beangenetic improvement program withprincipal investigators at Bunda, Malawi; Sokoine
University, Tanzania; USDA andOregon State Universityandwith Tanzaniancollaborators

 at Misangu, Uyole, and Selianresearchcenters. The program collaborateswith CIAT,
 ECABRN, and SABRN (the latter beingthe EasternandCentral andthe SouthernAfrica
 BeanResearchNetworks). While somecollaborations do bring insome funding, the funding
 is small relative to the government andmajor donor funding. The mainpurposeis enhancing
 efficacy, leveragingknowledge andimprovingefficiency, andreducingduplication of
 research.There are collaborations inmanyother areas including Conservation Agriculture
 (CA), for example, with support fkom ICRAF. There are also anumber oftraining
 opportunities and information services and exchanges offindings offered bythe collaborative
 organizationsand information services.

 3.16     Underthe researchcomponentofTARP 11, Zonal Agricultural ResearchFundswith
 managementcommittees were establishedwith a few contributions from district councils and
 from developmentpartners and other sourcesand matchinggrants by the project. The
 funding responsewas variable by zone. Again, unfortunately, these funding"jars" are
 currently largely empty due to lack of contributions since the closure o fthe project.

 3.17     With respectto the humanresources development and management component,
 achievementswere generally satisfactory. Targets for training at post-graduatelevel were
 either met or surpassed. The component also provided assistanceto SUA for training,
 particularly on client-oriented anddemand-driven research. Itstrengthened
 researcWextensiodfarmer linkages throughtraininginparticipatory researchmethodology. It
 also supportedthe exchange ofexperiencesanddevelopeda built-inM&Eactivity.

 3.18     With respectto the selective rehabilitation of research stations, equipment and
 inJlastructure, there were serious problems withthe quality of construction due mainly to
poor consulting engineer supervision. The mission looked at the quality of construction at
both Selian andUkiriguruResearchCenters. Inbothcases, construction was highly
unsatisfactory.Itwas not clear to the mission that allpossibleremedies for redress fiom the
supervisingengineers hadbeenexhausted.

Box 2. A Case of InsufficientAppliedResearchFoundationfor an Adaptive Program?

Inthe mission's view, the work combining legumes(e.g. Dulichuslublub)andmaizewithzerotillage ishighly
promising. Some useful work with farmer collaboratorswas seen inKaratu District. Dueto the highcost o f
nitrogen, acentralquestion for Tanzania is how to maximizenitrogen fixation. Key questions include:
nodulation, andthe possibleneedfor inoculation, lime seedtreatment, nodulationconstraintsindifferent soil
types, soil acidity problems, interactionwith Nfertilizer, and other questions, such as the potential for GM
varietiesaimed at enhancedNefficiency. Suchapplied work to back upadaptivework is not goingto emerge
simply fiom client feedback andthe associatedadaptivetrials. Itwill emerge fiom strategicthinkingby skilled

Monitoring and Evaluation

3.19    M&Ewas poorly designedandimplementedandboththeseaspectsarerated
unsatisfactory. Giventhoseweaknesses itwas therefore difficult to use, although the findings
didcontributesomewhat to the designofthe follow-on ParticipatoryAgricultural
Development and EmpowermentProject (PADEP). Giventhe weak design and
implementation it is difficult not to also rate utilization as unsatisfactory, although whatever
evidencebecameavailable was madeuse of. As notedearlier, there was a baseline survey
covering "collaborating farmers" (those who were participating inadaptive research) in2000.
This was followed upin2003. Unfortunately, the 2003 survey, although intended to cover
manyofthe 2000 sample, didnot, infact, do so.

3.20    However, the support for the University program (SUA), along withNORAD and
other funding, resultedinsome useful M&E work well-focused onperformance indicators.
This has left auseful set o f skills inM&Ebasedon logframe baselinesthat couldbe more
widely usedinlater programs. Itis understood that some ofthis has infact spilled over into
morerecentMinistry ofAgriculture M&E.

Performance Ratings

OUTCOME
3.21    Outcomeis ratedas moderately unsatisfactory basedonsubstantial relevance, but
modest efficacy andefficiency. However, as will be notedlater, the mainconcern is the Risk
to Development Outcome which has some impact on efficacy since system efficiency, which
was a key statedproject objective, cannot bedivorced from risk andthe sustainability o f
budgetary support.

RELEVANCE
3.22    Overall Relevanceis ratedas substantial, but is not without issues. The objectives
were clearly highly relevantto the needs ofTanzania. However, the relevance o fthe design
to those objectives is somewhatquestionable andis ratedmodest. Looking back at the
performance of past interventions, the mainproblem inresearchinTanzania has not been so
muchthat the managementskills andprocesses and systemso fresearchprioritization have
beenweak, althoughthat has certainly beena factor, butthat researchonthe scale needed
simply couldnot be sustainedwithout substantial donor funding. While there was a valiant
andrather optimistic attemptto partiallyget at this issue indesignthrough privatization of
export crop researchand seekingnon-public contributions into zonal funds, this was only
partially successful. Moreover, the recent government decisionsto halt crop cesses andthe
current lack ofresourcesto sustainzonal programs, suggeststhat this may be ending up as
another largely failed attempt to address the persistent issue o f financial sustainability.

 EFFICACY
 3.23     Onbalance, efficacy isratedmodest, althoughthe project was not without some
 important achievements." The original project objective, against which performance is
 assessed since there was no formal restructuring, was to increasethe efficiency and
 productivity of crops and livestock production systems focusing onthe smallholder sector.
 This objective calls for answersto two mainquestions: To what extent was the efficiency and
 productivity ofthe production systems enhanced; and, to what extent was there a focus onthe
 smallholder sector? Itis also useful to assessthe meansto the achievement o fthe objectives
 above, the institutional strengthening, which at mid-termwas addedto the objectives butwas
 not formally taken to the Board. This is not usedinthis assessment inthe aggregate rating
 other thanas anintermediate output on the route towards assessingthe other objectives.

 3.24     Withrespectto the objective ofe8ciency andproductivity, at the aggregate level, on
 balancethere was only modest performance. Interms ofproductivity, agricultural growth in
 Tanzania has improved as shown inTable 1.However, it is difficult to find gains that can be
reasonablyattributed to TARP 11,particularly inrelation to yield increaseswhich havebeen
byfar the predominant focus ofresearch, for three mainreasons. First, o fthe four maincrop
commodities listedinthe PAD designsummary as project indicators, three show inthe
agricultural census since the late 1980s significant yield declines (the cereals) andone
(beans) shows no increase. Outside those four, cassavaand groundnut yield trends appearto
be flat notwithstanding some more disease-resistantvarieties. Improvedbeefcattle numbers
seem to bedown, broilers down, layers upand improveddairy cattle upthrough the late
 1990sbutthen down again since then. Milkyield changes over time are not giveninthe
census. Butthe PAD focus was predominantly on food crops andPAD projections were for


 11. The Regionhas questionedthe downgrading ofthe outcome rating. They argue that the rightquestion
shouldbe whether TAW I1hadmuch to do with the improvedsector performancethat accompaniedand
followed its implementation,inwhich area expansionandcommodity shifts were the mainsourcesof growth.
They notethat arestrictivemeasure ofthis would focus on the generationoftechnology anda more expansive
measurewould focus on sectoralproductivity. They notethe data andattributionproblems inansweringeither
question. However, they notethe evidence for increased availability ofrelevanttechnologiesas outlined inthe
ICR. IEGhasreviewedthis ratingagainwhich is dependent onboththe efficacy andthe efficiency rating, with
respect to efficacy, focusing somewhereinbetweenthe above extremes at evidence for technologiesthat were
adopted. The Regionalso argues that TAW I1did increasethe availability o frelevanttechnologies. The data is
limited but it is difficult to argue substantialattribution to areaexpansion andcommodity shifts since the main
direct focus ofthe particular supportedresearchprogramswas on food crop yield increases, ratherthancash
crops or mechanizationalthoughthe overarching institutional reformsand farm system linkagescannot be so
compartmentalized.Definingand measuringan "increase inthe availability oftechnologies" has alwaysbeen
difficult.IEGis not suggestingthat no usefultechnologies came out. Whether the array ofwhat emerged
representssome sort ofan "increase" is less certain. Obviously it was an increase over what would have
happenedwith no research. But IEGcan only turntowardsthe (questionable) economic analysisto assess
whether this was efficient and, again, inthe absenceofbetter data, the very weak extensionandstill quite weak
seed multiplication (e.g. at the extreme, the extraordinary 15 year delay ingettingthe new cdtton variety out)
argues for modest impactfrom whatever increasesintechnology emerged. IEGstill finds the weight ofthe
evidence giventhe apparent yielddeclines againstthe substantialprojectedyield increasesinthe PAD, andthe
weak extensionserviceto suggestonly a modest levelof efficacy. IEGalso finds the broaderinstitutional
impacts, which would commandlonger-term benefitsoutsidethe immediateresearchfunded, to bepartly
underminedbythe financial sustainability issuewhich seems especiallyproblematic following the recent losses
of funding sourcesnotedinthe report. The rest ofthe argument for the rating is within the text ofthis section
which hasbeenaddedto following the Region's well-considered comments on the draft.

                                                  21


 these yields to rise bybetween25 percent and40 percent.Not only havethey not risento
 these levels, they havedeclined. Use o f fertilizer, more generally usedon cashcrops, as
 notedearlier hasfallen a lot, although some o fthis for soundefficiency reasons. Second, all
 the evidence points to a largecontribution to agricultural growthinTanzania still coming
 from area expansion. ClearlymanyTanzania farmers are still operatingat the extensive
 margin. Itis hardto see muchattribution here from anexaminationofthe researchprograms,
 although there has beensome work on mechanization and itwould bereasonableto attribute
 some ofthe highervalue crop incentive directly to cashcrop researchandsome less directly
 through more complex farm system shifts. Third, the extensionservicehas beenextremely
 weak andprobably deteriorating yet strong extension was stated inthe TARP I1PAD to be
 very important andcomplementaryto TAW I1for overall technology delivery performance.
 Itseems clear fromthe impact studythat, due to weak extension, manyo fthe beneficiaries
 from the TARP I1work were simply the farmer researchcollaborators who were a very small
 proportion ofthe national farmer population, although clearly some innovations, especially
 newvarieties, havespreadmorewidely withor without extensionhelp.

 3.25    There are also questions about efficiency which, giventhe objectives of improving
 efficiency and institutional development, cannot only be relegatedto the efficiency rating.
 The economic analysis inthe ICRrelied on the TARP I1survey comparison ofcollaborators
andnon-collaborators andwas basedlargely ona minor adjustmentofthe PADeconomic
analysis which usedthe projectedyield increasesnotedabove. There are problems with this
expost analysis. First, as notedearlier, the survey is questionableparticularly due to the lack
of comparison withthe baseline. Second, for want o fbetter data, the expost analysis
continued to use the appraisalassumption o f25 percent adoption over 5 years o fthe fourteen
assessedmodel crop and livestock technologies. This is quite optimistic and lack of actual
data inthis analysis is a major weakness since the adoption rate is one ofthe key coefficients
inassessingtechnology benefit streams. As notedabove, itappearsfiom the censusthat
averageyields nationally actually fell althoughthere is evidence that they rose for some
crops for the limitednumbersof surveyedresearch collaborators, although, for maize, even
here, by only about halfthe increment projected inthe PAD.

3.26     Inadditionto the above, anumber ofperformanceweaknessesrelatedto productivity
were observedbythe missionor were notedby observers interviewed. Fourparticularly
standout. First, the impact ofnewvarieties insome cases was extremely slow. For example,
the predominant cotton variety, UK91, as the variety code suffrx indicates, was releasedby
Ukirigururesearchstationin1991. Itonlybecamewidely adoptednearly 15years later, in
2005! This was due to lack of seedmultiplicationcapacity12andother constraints. The
economic losses for Tanzaniainhaving afifteen year Zag inthe adoption o fthe best available
improved variety ofone ofthe five major export crops, which would give about a 150to 200
kgperhectareincteaseinyield over the earlier variety, musthavebeenenormous. Sucha
delay is a serious indictment of a researchandseedmultiplication system supportedby
substantial donor funds over manyyears. While the researchonthis variety predatesthis
particular project, the Banksupport for bothresearch andextension over the intervening

 period appears to have failed to addressthis serious hemorrhaging ofpotential benefits.
 Second, as notedby one o fthe NGOs,there hasbeentoo little work with legumes for a
 country with very high-cost nitrogenfertilizer andwithnutrition concerns. Third, while
 financialanalysis oftechnical findings hasprobably somewhatimprovedover the last 10
 years, it remains weak. Thereis still anacknowledgedshortage of experienced agricultural
 economists. As anexample, relative commodity and inputprices haveshifted substantially
 over the last ten years yet original extensionrecommendationsbasedon outdated priceratios
 seem to remain onthe books unchangedfor de~ades.'~Most financial analyses seen were old
 andnot basedoncurrent prices. Thus what maybepromisingtechnical findings are oftennot
 beingtranslated correctly, andthenmaintainedthroughprice shifts, as demonstrably
 profitable recommendations.

 3.27     Butthere are also afew brighter spots inthe economiclfarm systems efficiency area.
 For example, there appearsto have been greater researchfocus inrecent years on
 technologies relevant to poorer farmers withlow casha~ai1ability.l~                 Inthis respect, anumber
 ofmaize varieties have beentested andreleasedwhich do well under a low nitrogen regime.
For poverty impact this is an important areafor further work. The promising work on
conservation agriculture hasbeennoted earlier.

3.28      With respectto the objective o ffocusing on the smallholder sector, this was generally
achieved inthe sense that, ofthose householdsreceiving technical support emanating from
researchinvestments, the majority were clearly smallholders, many with apredominant
reliance on food crops (although inTanzaniamanypoor are also export crop producers).
However, again, the proportion ofpoor farmers nationally receiving strong technical support
that could be attributedto the researchprogram inrecent years is likely to be fairly small
given the limitedcoverageofthe more intensive Farmer FieldSchooltypes o f support, the
necessarilyvery modest scaleo fthe direct researchstation outreachprograms, andthe poor
quality of the remainder ofthe largely immobile public extension service, animmobilitythat
appears to bias extension support to the better farmers inareas close to district
headquarters.lS

3.29     With respectto the objective o f institutional strengthening, as a "means" objective
that was added later, this was partially achieved. But institutional strengthening cannot be
divorced from the sustainability o f fhding. While a numbero fpotentially important
institutional changeswere introduced, including greater client feedback andmore local
autonomy inresearchplanning, the lack ofpost-project fimdingto sustain many o fthese new
processesraisesthe question ofwhether such achievementscanreally be defined yet as
"institutional strengthening."



13. Financialprofitabilityofinnovationsis a dynamic variable that needsto be revisitedregularlyas
input/output priceschange.
14. Often, the most importantquestiona VEW needs to be able to answer, and fiequently never can, is the
question:``I only Tz50,OOO that Ican affordto invest inmy farm this year, what are the best investment
             have
options Ishouldconsider for this farming system giveninputsupply andmarketingconstraints?
15. Probably partlyfor this reason, inone districtthe mission, on its field visit, was immediatelytakento a
small cattle feedlot onthe edge ofthe town.

 EFFIcIENcY
 3.30       Efficiency is ratedmodest. As noted above, there are questions about the validityo f
 the assumptionsinthe economic analysis which are not repeatedhere. At the institutional
 level, observableinthe fieldwere anumbero f enhancedprocessesthat haveprobably
 improved operatingefficiency ofthe managementsystem, including greater management
 control inthe hands of the Zonal Coordinators, the introduction of the Zonal
 ResearcWExtensionCoordinatorsandthe various research/ extensioncoordination
 mechanisms. However, there were anumbero fefficiency problems evident including: (i)                         the
 problem with operating costs evenduring the project perioddueto difficulties with
 expenditureverification andthereforedisbursementwhich madethe planningof sustained
 programsby researchersdifficult; (ii)           the extraordinarily poor quality ofconstruction; (iii)
 the weakeningof the performance of extension due to the decentralization which seems to be
 pulling more researchresourcestowards makingupfor this weakness;16 (iv) what appearto
 have beeninefficiencies inprocurementanddisbursement                   ''and  the long delays in
 disbursementto researchstations andto the University, saidto befar slower thanallother
 donors; and (v) again, the splittingofcrop and livestock researchdue to the ministry split
 whichhappenedduringthe period ofthe project andwhich will clearly raiseoverhead costs
 substantially with a doubling up o fmany researchfacilities while reducingresearch
 coordination and effectiveness.

 3.3 1 Attempts to find researchthrough district contributions are inefficient. While there is
a good rationale indecentralizing extension services so that they are more accountableto the
end-users, agricultural researchis characterizedby muchlarger economies of scale. It makes
no sensefor districtsto be expected to transfer their scarce resources to agricultural
research,particularly whenthey cannot makeany contribution to extension services for
whichthey are directly responsible.

3.32      Finally, staff performance efficiency has generally beenfound to be impacted by
incentives. Inthe public researchservice inTanzaniathere is still a serious incentives
problem. Salaries are very low           '*andrewardsfor    superior performance are almost non-
existent beyonda few small annualprize supplements. There i s aperformance review system
onpaper but ithas no impact on salary increments. At the time ofthe mission there was apay
rise for all researchersthat was welcome but this was merely a catching up with past inflation
erosion and slippagesbehindroutine promotions. This increase incorporatedno performance
criteria.

RISKTODEVELOPMENT                 OUTCOME
3.33      Riskto DevelopmentOutcome is ratedhigh. The problemisthat manyofthe
improvedprocessescannot be sustained. For manyyears, researchhas gone through an

 inefficient cycle of h d i n fluctuations withdonor funds giving temporary support that
 cannot later be sustained.      8 Currently, thehope      appears to bethat the new donor basket
 funding arrangement will help,makingthe application o ffunds to operating costs easier and
 allowing donorsto continue with supportinarollingprogramwithout interruption. This
 seems likely to give the borrower more freedom to allocatefunds to immediate priorities.
 Whether this modality of donor funding representsprogressonthe issue o f sustainability is
 debatable. The evidence over recentyears suggeststhat either the public researchsystem i s
 far too largeto besustainedbygovernmentor that governmenthasbeenunwillingto give
 researchinparticular, andagriculture more generally, sufficient priority. The promise of
 funding cashcrop researchthrough the commodity export industries that, inturn,would
 releasemorefunds for food crop research, at onetime offered aray of hope. Butthat hope
 now seems to befading with the banningof cesses andpromisesby the center that the
 agriculture budgetwould nowreimbursethat loss. Moreover, at the same moment comes
 news offresh demands onthe agriculture budget withthe return o ffertilizer subsidies that
 surely threatens overall agriculture budgetsevenfhrther.

 3.34     The loss of cesses is a serious blow?' The logic of cesses was not only to provide
 funding support for researchonthe particular commodity, but also to enhance the industry
 participationinthe use o fthat funding andinsetting researchpriorities. Industryinvolvement
 hadimproved considerably with growers andprocessorshaving positions on boards and
 contributing to researchprioritization inall the mainexport commodities eventhough the
cesses, inmost cases, were not yet near a levelto support all research. The logic o fthe
removalo f cesses appearsto bethat the collection itselfrequires a marketing "gate" which
curtails freedom to export. At the present stage ofbudgetary support for agricultural research
inTanzaniaandwiththe shadowoffertilizer subsidies, the costso fthis abandonmentof
cesses appear likelyto be higher thanthe benefits.



 19. The Regionhas commentedthat it is hardto see what would constituteabetter alternative to address the
acknowledgedfinancial sustainability issue andwould welcome guidance. While IEG is not inthe business of
making specific country level recommendations, this is a fair question. While there is clearly no magic solution,
such apersistent problem over a series ofprojectswould seemto call at least for the following: (i) front full
                                                                                                   up

above suggestedactionsalone or togethercan guarantee improvedfinancial sustainability but at a minimum
more attentionalongthese lines could enhance transparency aboutthe situation andpromptmore rigorous

3.35      What are the overall public funding prospects?The evidence suggeststhat over time
there hasbeenlittle increaseinthe shareo fthe budgetto agriculture. Government
expenditurefor agriculture andagricultural researchover the period 2000 to 2005 increased
for awhile but thenfell back againas indicatedinTable 3.

3.37     Actual expenditure onresearchis not givenhere due to differences indata sources,
butnationally, the actual expenditureacrossall government departmentshasgenerally been
around 60 percent of the amount budgeted. Actual expenditures onAgriculture and Food
Security as a percentageofthe total budget is giveninTable 4. There are some questions
about the accuracy o fthis data since some inconsistencies were found, and, as earlier reports
havenoted, Tanzania statisticshave often beenquestioned, butit appearsthat, after falling in
1999,expenditure rose againin2003 butnot to the same level itwas in 1998/1999.For a
sector so dominant inGDP andso important to potential poverty alleviation and
employment, about 2 percentappears to be a very low level o fexpenditure.

BANKPERFORMANCE
3.38    BankPerformanceisrated, onbalance, as moderately satisfactory, anaggregateofa
moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry anda satisfactory rating for supervision but
also influencedbythe moderately unsatisfactory overall outcome rating. As noted inthe ICR,
Bankperformance at appraisalwas consideredonly marginally satisfactory mainlydueto

                                                 26


 weakness inthe designofmonitoring andevaluation which was notedinthe ICR as a serious
 deficiency for a researchproject. IEGwould addthat this was particularly serious inthe
 secondof aproject seriesbywhichtime such issuesshouldhavebeentaken care of. As
 experienceindicates, this weaknesshas indeedmanifesteditselfexpost inthe lack o f data for
 assessment o fincremental benefits. While project supervisionwas generally satisfactory,
 there were several weaknesses. First, the reformulation ofthe project objectives by simply
 tacking onthe additional languageonthe end o fthe original objectives and not going back to
 the Board with the reformulated project was casual andinsufficient although, inthe end,
 most o f the subsequentredirections of fhding were appropriate. Second, while there is some
 evidencethat the missions didurgethe borrower to address the construction quality issue on
 anumber of occasions, quality inthis case was so egregiouslybadacross a number o f sites
 constructedat different times that it is difficult to concludethat enoughwas done soon
 enough. The project was handicappedby havingthree Task TeamLeadersover the lifeofthe
 project butthere was good continuity inactual missionmembership.The missionheard
 generally positive commentsabout Bankperformance from the borrower at a numberof
 levels, except for the widespreadview that the Bankprocurement and disbursement
procedureshadbeenfar more onerous thanthose o fother donors andthat this had
 contributed considerably to slow implementation. There was concern about the
 incompatibility o f the size ofthe Special Account withthe expenditure verification
proceduresexpressedby zonal stations and about the needfor longer-term andearlier
commitment for, anddisbursementof, research funding. Frequently funds arrived too late for
the seasonalresearchneedsmakingplanningdifficult, making commitments with client
groups risky, andnegatively impacting the efficiency o f funds application. However,
suppbrtingtheoverall satisfactory supervisionrating, aBankQuality Assurance Group
assessmentin2002 ratedproject supervision satisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
3.39     Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Inthe ICR it was rated
satisfactory butmarginally so. While there were important reforms introduced bythe project
inthe directions ofclient feedback andinprocessesto linkresearchandextension, and
researchcoordination, there were anumber o fproblems. First, a numbero f these reforms
failed to become fully grounded. Second, there were seriousproblems with insufkient
counterpart fundingduring the first two years. Third, the splittingofthe ministry handling
crops and livestock into two has set back the core focus on a farm systems approach. Fourth,
while not the direct responsibility ofthe researchproject itself, the continuing weaknessesin
the extension servicehas devaluedthe incremental gains inresearch. Itremains to be seen
whether decentralization canbe completed infuture andsupportedwith capacity buildingto
the point at which the extension service can functionsufficiently to be an important
complement to researchandwhether pluralismof bothapproachand funding canplugthe
gaps sufficiently. Fifth, due to the confusion about decentralization andthe Memoranda o f
Understandingwithdistrict councils, implementation ofthe proposedfundingarrangements
for researchfunding bythe districts never really took off. The ICR arguesthat
decentralization has maturedso that the roles at the local levelare more clearly understood
andthe situationhas improved. This was not really evidentduringthe mission's visits at

 4.      NationalAgriculturalExtensionProject I1

 Objectives

4.1      The,mainobjective ofthe project, somewhat clumsily stated inthe SAR, was "to
continueto improve the delivery of extensionserviceto smallholder farmers for increasing
their incomesandproductivity, while improvingits relevance, sustainability andcost-
effectiveness." It was intended to continue the essential elements o fthe training andvisit
(T&V) systemo f agricultural extensionbut was to "work using a participatory approach,
giving an effective role andvoice to farmers." Itwas also intendedthat it would initiate the
processofprivate sector/NGO/fmer participation inextension with cost sharing, including
selective privatization, where feasible.

4.2     A year after project approval, implementationresponsibility for the extensionservice
was passedfrom the central ministry to the local authorities, establishing 119autonomous
district extension services and leavinga muchreducedrole for the central ministry. After a
lag ofnearlytwo anda halfyearsthe development objectives were revised, butwithout
formal restructuring and Board approval, to the following: "to continue to improve the
delivery of extension servicesto smallholder farmers inthe borrower's territories by focusing
on the enhancement ofthe technical andadministrative capacity o fthe LGAsto provide such
extension services." As with the researchproject, this left the overall aimofthe project the
same but added greater focus on institutional capacity, areaction to the shift to
decentralization since appraisal. This assessment uses the original objectives for ratings since
the project was not formally restructured. However, as with the researchproject assessment,
thecapacity buildingis also assessedhere as apotentially important intermediate output on
the routeto the statedobjectives. This lag o f over two years inrefocusing the project seems
an extraordinarily longtime. Furthermore, there appears to beno case for not going back to
the Board giventhe fundamental institutional shift to decentralization.

ProjectDesign

        The project had four original components.

        InstitutionalStrengthening(US$13.7 millionplanned, US$17.1 actual) for
        reorganizing and strengtheningthe extension services at the ministry headquarters
        andthe field servicesto improve farmer linkages including increasingthe number of
        Subject Matter Specialists, the establishment ofDistrictExtension Steering
        Committees, retrenchingunsuitable Village Extension Officers (VEWs), and
        establishingM&E.

        ExtensionEducationandTraining(US$ 10.6 millionplanned, US$9.4 million
       actual) for enhancing the effectivenesso ftechnology transfer through stafftraining,
       both localandoverseas courses; farmer training and study tours; extensionmaterials;
       andtraining support, including establishment ofa TrainingCoordinationCommittee.

                                                                  28


       (c) CommunicationsSupport (US$2.6 millionplanned, US$2.3 million actual) to
             support the strategyto decentralizeinformation managementto enable effective
             responseto area-specific local farming community needs for information. It
             establishedZonal Communication Centers, reorganizedthe ministry's Extensionand
             PublicityUnit,carriedout aneeds assessment for communications development,
            provided training for selectedstaff, andtechnical assistance andequipment for
             communications.

       (d) PilotInitiatives(US$1.5 millionplanned, US$l.8 million actual) involvingpilot
            initiatives to improve: extensionmanagement, technology transfer,
             farmer/extension/researchlinkages, participation o f other providers, inputsupply,
            farmer empowerment, andgender impact.

  4.4       The restructuredprojectretainedthe four original componentsbutreallocated the
  budget among componentsto emphasizecapacity buildingo f extension services inthe
  LGAs.Inaddition, some smallcomponents inZanzibar were added.

 4.5        Extension.The project closed 2 years later thanplanneddueto the redesignneeded
 to accommodatethe decentralization, slower than expected achievementwith the support for
 the new LGAs, the 1991splitting o fthe ministry, the intent to shift extensionto the
 President's Office andthenthe decision not to, andthe extension to new areasandZanzibar.
 Evenwithout some elements ofthesechangesthat could be consideredexogenous, the
 projections were clearly very optimistic.

 Appraisal and Quality at Entry

 4.6        Quality at Entrywas weak. The Bankwas clearly not sufficiently nimbleat appraisal,
 nor was itnimblelater even after the decentralizationhadbeenfinally implemented.After
 this itstilltook two andahalfyearsfor the project to beredirected. As notedinthe ICR, the
 Bankshouldhavebeenmore proactive inpreparingfor this. Ifithadbeen, some ofthe
 problems that arose could havebeenpre-empted.

 Box 3. CouldFarmerFieldSchools Go the Route of T&V?                                                                               I
 Interestingly,the main organizationalelements of the Farmer FieldSchool (FFS) approach are notvery differentfrom the
 abandonedT&V. Thereforethere is some risk that, if taken to scale, FFS may succumbto the same problems. BothT&V and
 FFS call for the use of contact-type groups. Bothcallfor regular visits by staff to these groups although this cannot currently be
 sustainedwidely in the Tanzania publicextensionsystem due to lack of operatingfunds. Bothfocus on a limitedarray of key
Itechnologieswhich was criticizedin the case of T&V but more recently is being often broadened in FFS. Both rely on
 subsequentfarmer to fanner dissemination which was a weakness inT&V and, drawing from globalevidence to date, seems to
 be an emergingweakness in FFS in.somecountries. Both lie at the intensive end of the extensionoptionsand are therefore
 relativelycostly on a per household basis. Bothcall for substantialstaff training which again, at any scale, callsfor larger
 resourcecommitmentsthan Tanzania appears able to muster at present. The main difference betweenTBV and FFS isthat
 FFS, in practice,has generally followed a more farm systemstype of approachwith greater focus on farmer feedback and self-
 discoverylearning approachesand FFS is moreflexible. But overall, the differences betweenthe two approaches, particularlyin
 terms of institutionalstructure as opposed to communicationcontent,are not as substantial as they might at first appear. There
 would appear to be three lessons here. First, there is a need for early comparative M&Eto assessthe cost effectivenessof
 alternative extension approaches(within a pluralisticpattern)to ensure that FFS is not simplythe latest unsustainableand
 ultimatelyineffectivefad. Second,there is a need for a measure of caution in scaling up before donors and borrowershastily
 climb on yet anotherpossiblyshaky bandwagon.Third, perhapsthose countriesthat have been adjusting T&V, rather than
 abandoning all elements of it and starting from scratch, are following a sensible strategy.

                                                      29


 4.7      As also noted bythe ICR, there was atension inthe design betweenthe commitment
 to the T&V approachandthe shifttowards greaterdemandresponsiveness.This tension
 partly reflected astrong commitment inthe borrower ministrytowards the T&V approach
 butanincreasingquestioning ofitwithinthe Bankandthe Bankteam. The timing of
 appraisalcame at a significant point inthe evolution ofBankthinking on T&V. Unlike many
 other countries nowtestingalternative extension approaches, there is still inTanzania a
 surprisingly widespreadcommitment among officials to arelatively traditional T&V
 approach, particularly amongmiddle level staff. The elementsofthe latest fashion, the
 FarmerFieldSchool (FFS) approach, are, infact, notvery differentto T&V (see Box 3).

 Implementation

 4.8      Implementation performance was influenced by the failure to sufficiently preparefor
 the decentralization shift during appraisal andby the delay inadjusting for it afterwards.
 While, ingeneral, decentralization hadbeenconsidereda positive shift bythe Bank,
notwithstandingsome misgivings among agriculture/rural staff due to the expected
researcWextensionlinkage problems, the splitting ofthe ministries                  *'was  viewed by the
Bankas apotentially very serious andretrogradestep. Indeed, the Bankdiscusseditsconcern
about this at the highest levels but was unable to influence the outcome.

4.9      Taking the project components inturn, with respectto institutionalstrengthening
there was significant achievement instaffing rationalization. About 900 o fthe 4,725 under-
qualifiedvillage extensionofficers (VEOs) were retrenchedandmany Subject Matter
Specialists were redeployed to the regions anddistricts. There was substantial delay in
establishing a functioning institutional framework for extension services due to the
weaknesses ofthe district administration compoundedbytheir overwhelming new
responsibilities. Byproject completion, about 5,800 extension workers hadbeendeployed at
district andvillage level to approximately 10,500 villages. This gave a ratio of about one half
o f what was intendedinthe strategy, to have one VEW per village. The project was able to
establish Zonal ResearchandExtension Liaison Offices to improve communication linkages
betweenresearchandextension. Extension staffparticipated inthe zonal technical
committees, workshops, agriculhkal shows, andthe formation offarmer groups. There was
joint participation o fresearchers, extension agents, andfarmers inFarmer FieldSchools, in
certain other groups, infielddays andinthe various pilots.

4.10     With respectto extension education and training, 650 VEWs were upgraded with one
year courses. Inaddition, 405 diploma levelstaffwere trained at the ministryinstitutes,
including those covering livestock. There was a substantial amount of shorter term training
through study tours andon-the-job training. However, due to shortage o f funds, the regular
technical trainingprograms throughworkshops andmonthly training sessionshaltedpart
way through the project, a sign of sustainability problems to come. An extension newsletter
started underthe project was later discontinued due to lack o f funds. About 4,300 farmers
benefitedfrom residential training andapproximately 37,000 from on-site training. About


21. This resultedinthree separate ministries with responsibility for agriculture: the Ministry ofAgriculture and
FoodSecurity (MAFS), the Ministry ofWater and Livestock Development (MWLD), andthe Ministry of
Cooperatives and Marketing (MCM).

                                                       30


 1,400 farmers attendedstudy tours outside their areas. A number o ftraininginstitutions
 including the University, twelve ministry traininginstitutes anda numbero f farmer training
 schools receivedassistance.22

 4.11 With respectto communications support, the centralpublicity unit andtwo regional
 centers were strengthened. Some ofthe planned communications capacity was shifted under
 the zonal stationsto be funded under TAW 11. A substantialnumber o fbooklets, newsletters,
 brochures, andradio or video programs were produced.The qualityo fthose which were seen
 by the missionwas quite good but the quantity inrelation to numbers o f farmhouseholdswas
 small. However, given the rapid changes globally ininformation technology, much o fthe
 equipment is already close to obsolete. Itis very unlikelythat there will be sufficient funds to
 upgrade unless donors fundthis again.

 4.12     Withrespectto thepilot initiatives, thirty-five extension-relatedpilots were initiated
 including: extensionmanagementsystems, farmer/extension/research linkages, the role o fthe
 private sector, farmer empowerment andthe empowerment ofwomen, andthe piIotingo f
 alternative extensionmanagementmethods. Under this programthe FFS approach was tested
 in 16Districtsunderthe project andsincethenmanymore districts havebeenincluded.
 Underthe project, farmer groupswere supportedfor multiplication offoundation seedfor
 sale to other farmers. A number o finitiatives tested combinations o f input supply with
 extension. However, there was no comparative analysis of the costsand benejts of the range
 of alternative extension approaches tested although there is some cost evidence for some o f
the individualpiloted approaches. This hasbeenaglobal weakness ofBankprojects testing a
rangeof extensionactivities. The lack o feconomic analysisandimpact data makes it
impossibleto determine whichwas the most cost-effective.

4.13      While, over the project period, there were a number o fuseful extension pilots, most
initiatives havedependedon a donor project. Meanwhile, the basic extension service inmany
districts languishes due to lack of operating funds, lack ofperformance incentives or
promotions, andfrequentlylate salary payments. The picture is o f islands o fpromise with
intensive outside assistancefloating ina morass of operational paralysis. Currently, outside
specialprograms, district level extension stafftake a considerablerisk inplanningwork
programs withfarmer grou s due to highlyuncertain transport. There is a significant risk o f
leavingthem disillusioned.P3

4.14      This scenario of acute resource limitations raises a number o f questions that needto
beansweredsoon: (i)sthe scale ofthe public extensionservice still simply far too bigfor
                          I
government at any level (center or districts) to maintain? (ii)       Are the higher cost extension
activities suchas FFSspullingaway so manyresourcesthat there is a sub-optimal balance


"  The borrower argues (see Annex C) that the reportunderplaysthe extentoftraining notingthat morethan 75
percent ofextensionstaffwere trainedby the two projectsNALERP(earlier) andNAEPII. However, the
borrowerdoes support the concern about sustainabilityof funding(see Riskto Development Outcome) noting
that sincethe project closed"training for extension workershasbeena nightmare."
23. VEWs, who, with a Tanzania average family size, are earning belowthe global poverty level of$1 per
capitaper day, rarelyget gas allowances or travel allowancesor maintenancefor their motorbikesifthey are
still lucky enoughto haveone, andare thereforeeither unableto travel or are spendingtheir own money to do
so. The surveys show that a significantpercentage of VEWs, when they can afford it, have donejust that.

 betweenthe "have" groups ofclients andthe largemass of"have-nots"? (iii) the lack               Given
 ofresources, are farmers being given the opportunity to see the true potential ofextension
 staffthat might leadto pressure on district council membersto increaseresourcesfor
 extension?Or will weak extensionbecomea self-fulfillingprophesybecausejudgments on
 future effectiveness are madeon disappointing past e~perience?~~Will the resource   (iv)
 constraint change once decentralizationhasbeentaken                               Unfortunately, the districts'
 capacity to raise funds has actually beengreatly curtailed recently by the move to banlocal
 "nuisance taxes" andtake away the development tax.

 4.15     To expand onthe decentralization issue, the current situation is that closeto zero
 funds for extension come from district revenues. Generally, ininstitutional reforms, the
purpose of decentralization has beento alignthe provision o fpublic services more closely
withthe principle ofsubsidiarityconcerning the mostappropriatelevelofgovernmentat
which particular public services should be delivered for efficiency andto beresponsive to
beneficiaries. However, the economieso f scale inrevenuecollection generally exceed
economiesof scale inservice delivery so it is to be expectedthat the central government
would collect larger revenuesthan it needs andtransfer some to lower levels to enable them
to deliver services. However, inthe case ofTanzania so far, with well under 10percent o f
revenues for the district collected locally andwith virtually all hding for extensioncoming
from the center andunder quite controlled terms o f use, the concept ofbeneficiary influence
on extension through local representativesandthe "power o fthe purse" seems unlikelyto
work untildistrict shares rise considerably. As noted earlier, itmakeslittle senseto seek
district contributions to agricultural researchwhere there are muchlarger economies o f scale
inresearchandwhere districts cannotevenfund anyextensionservices.

4.16      The mission's view i s that the pervasive lack o fresourcescurrently evenat the
intensity o ftwo villages per VEO is so overwhelming that debatesto determine how bestto
structurepublic extension are almost superfluous. Inagriculture, when staffcannottravel
except, ina few locations, on foot, it really makes very little difference what particular
permutation o f systemsofknowledge transfer andfeedback relationship withclients is
proposedto be used. Although new communications technologies canplay arole in
stretching resources, by its nature, servicing agriculture requires some degree ofmobility.




24. One group o f farmers spokento bythe mission listed a number o f investments as priorities for their
community but none mentionedmore or better extension. When finally promptedabout whether being given an
extension officer would be considered usefulby the community the response was largely shrugs untilone
volunteered that it would be o f little use becausethe extensionofficer would not come to see themanyway.
(Some members hadnot seen anextension officer ever, some had seen one in2001 inconnection with paddy
cultivation, andanother recalledseeingone in 1996 inconnectionwith cotton spraying. For this group,
extension staff were not seen as relevant.) Butthe questionhere is whether this attitude is due to past and
current poor extension commitment and skills or simply the almost universal lack o ftravel resourcesfor VEWs.
25. At present, the districts, while nominally responsible for extension, still get the extension budget fiom the
center and cannot shift funds. It is not even clear that they can support andget promotions, so agriculture staff
currently see themselves as ina limbo, with nobody really concerned about their future. The word "orphans"
hasbeen used.

Monitoringand Evaluation

4.17     M&Ewas weak. The appraisalreport didnot includeperformance indicators although
there was anincomplete set o f indicators inthe Memorandum o fthe President. Design is
therefore ratedunsatisfactory. As a result, the baseline andfollow-up surveys didnothave
clear indicators to guide datacollection. This was surprisingsince one ofthe main lessons o f
the forerunner project, the National Agriculture and Livestock ExtensionRehabilitation
Project (NALERP), was the needfor clear indicators andmonitoring ofthose indicators. It
appearsthe Bank andborrower hadnot learned. This weakness has seriously affected the
potential project benefits to the Bank andborrower because the most important learning
would have beento better understandthe cost effectivenessof alternative extension systems
ranging from extensive to intensive, from highto low cost recovery, andfrom highto low
beneficiary participation time. As with TARP 11,the September2003 FinalBeneficiary
Survey o fNAEP I1exhibiteda number of quite serious weaknesses 26 and implementation of
M&E istherefore ratedunsatisfactory.As withthe researchproject, while results were used
to some extent where relevant, the weak M&E madeutilization difficult andtherefore
utilizationis also ratedunsatisfactory. As noted above, with extension now beingtested ina
numberofways, poor comparative M&E hasbeenparticularly costly for the learning
process.

Performance Ratings

OUTCOME
4.18     Outcome is ratedunsatisfactory basedon modestrelevance, efficacy andefficiency.
Moreover, as with the researchproject, it is difficult to separatedevelopment risk or
sustainability from efficacy for aproject that is aimed at enhancing a system. The impact
evidence i s insufficiently convincingto attribute significant benefits to the project. The
project undoubtedly contributed to anumber o fuseful extension experiments. But, as noted,
these have not beensufficiently well evaluated for comparative cost-effectiveness. The
project also contributedto some significant training and strengthening oftraining capacity.
At leastduringthe periodofthe project, there was someimprovement inresearchextension
liaisonarisingfrom the investments inbothNAEP I1and TARP 11.



26. The main weaknesses were the following: (i)    enumeration was done by extension staff who had a stake in
the outcome. (ii) was a lack o fcomparison with the 1999baseline except for a few selected coeficients.
                 There
(iii)Whatwastermed"accessibility toextensionservices", foundtobe90percent,wassimplythe
interpretationo fthe percentageo f farmers aware that extension services were available inthe village. Yet
experience suggeststhat it is rarely lack o fawareness o fextension staff existence that is the problem, it is that
extension staff do not visit or do not have usefbl messages. (iv) The questionnaire was extremely longand
tedious. (v) There are substantial discrepancies with the National Sample Census ofAgriculture done at about
the same time. (For example, the NAEP IIassessment found that 83 percent o frespondents reportedreceiving
extension advice duringthe year whereas the Census found it to be only 34 percent o fcrop growinghouseholds
and 16percent oflivestockhouseholds). (vi) With respect to sometechnologies, suchas IntegratedPest
Management and post-harvest technology, the assessmentfoundhugeincreases inadoptionrates, e.g. from 7%
to 26%, over one year between 2002 and2003 which are difficult to explain. (There were problems with the
Census findings also, for example, respondents claims o ftechnology adoption involving inputs were noted to be
far above the reported inputpurchaselevels.)

                                                        33


 4.19      However, it is clear that, evenafter a series o fprojects supporting extension, the
 overall public extension service remainsextremely weak andunder-funded. Indeed, some
 observers say that extensionhas "collapsed". Often the reasongiven is decentralization.
NGOs and input suppliers working inagriculture andspokento bythe mission found the
 extension service largely absent or lackingincommitment due to poor incentives and lack of
 funds to travel. As a result, insome areas, NGOspick upthe operating funds for extension
 services. While this couldbe defined as "pluralism" inextension, and may now be pragmatic
and even desirable, it is also indicative ofa largely ineffectual public service?'

RELEVANCE
4.20      Overall, relevanceis ratedas modest. Relevanceof objectives andrelevance of design
are considered. The objectives, particularly the revised objectives, were relevant. However,
project design didnot sufficiently accommodatethe emerging decentralization either directly
or eventhrough preparedness.Also, the designtension between the older T&V strategy and
the more client-oriented group approachwas never properly resolved. Finally, while some
attemptswere made withinthe designto address the chronic financial sustainability problem
throughprivate, NGO, andfarmer group support anddistrict contributions, these were
optimistic and inthe event suchsources havebeensmall andvery localized.

EFFICACY
4.21      Efficacy is ratedmodest. With respectto the objective of improving the delivery of
extensionservices, the evidence i s insufficient to demonstratesignificant incremental gains
attributable to the project. While there has beencontinued moderately satisfactory growthin
the sector, albeit with limitedpoverty impact, it i s difficult to find evidence from the surveys
that any gains have arisen from project interventions. Based on discussion and field
observation, what appearsto havehappenedis that there have beena number ofquite useful
localized initiatives, supportedby what are probably well above national average extension
expenditures per household, that are showing sometechnically promising impacts. Butthe
wider generaldistrict level extensionservice outside those areas is almost moribund due to
lack of fbndsm2*    It ispossible that, as decentralization isconsolidated, andas morefhdingis
passed directly to the districts, the situation will impr~ve.~' recently districts lost about
                                                                          But

27. The author's personalobservation,from a knowledgeofagricultureinTanzaniainthe past, is that public
extension is currentlyweaker than it was inthe mid 1970sto early 1 9 8 0 ~ ~which was a periodofserious
economicproblems.
28. As an example, inone ofthe better-offdistricts, the extensionbudgetfor the quarterfor all activitiesother
than salariesand coveringoperationsfor all extensionofficersat village level andthose at the districtHQon
agriculture, landuse, cropproduction, pestcontrol, etc. was about $23 per working dayfor the whole disaict.
This was to cover hel, vehicle repairs,travel allowances, training workshop costs, supplies such as paper,
computer`service, printer ink,publicitymaterial,etc. It shouldbe noted also that other districtofficials usedthe
vehicle (when it was not out of order) for non-agriculture activities. Livestock services inthis district, now
under a different ministry, hadreceivedzero budget so were flee-riding on the cropsbudget. This was ina
district with vehicles or motor bikes (3 of 8 working) that were mostly about nineyears old. Any major vehicle
repaircould easilyeat up a third to ahalfofthe quarterlybudgetinone billhencethere were severalold
unrepairedvehicles.
29. Unfortunately,there is a longhistoryofinstitutionaldisruptioninextensionand itmustbeexpectedthat the
success ofany new approaches, includingeven pluralism,will needto overcomecynicismanddamagedstaff
expectations.By 1997, the extension service hadbeenreorganizedaboutthirteentimes since independence

                                                         34


 90 percent o f their own income sourceswhen a number of localtaxes were abolished inthe
 name of reducing what were termed"nuisance taxes." Untilmore funds are found, the basic
 Tanzanianextensionserviceacrossmuch ofthe country is not inthe shape itshould be after
 a series o f Bank and donor-fhded projects over several decades, although the PADEP
 project was foundby the missionto be temporarily filling useful gapsinsome districts.

 4.22     Withrespectto the objective of strengthening the local government capacityto
 undertake extension, it is too early to assess achievement.The maininstitutional change over
 theproject periodwas towardsdecentralization to the districts. But, as indicatedinthe earlier
 discussion, this project hadnothingto do with that shift; indeed, it seems to have been largely
 taken by surprise by it. However, subsequentlythe project did support capacity buildingat
 district level. Substantialnumbersof extension staff and farmers were trained andnew
 planningprocessesandapproachesto client feedbackwere introduced. However, training
 budgetsare now very tight againand it appearsthat this level of training cannot be sustained.
 Partly inassociationwiththe earlier ASMP,which has beenreported on separately, there
 were also changes inextensionsupport fiomthe center aimed at improvingefficiency. Over
a short period the project also testedsome alternative extension approacheson a pilot basis.
Unfortunately, as noted, there was limitedcomparative evaluation. Meanwhile, extension is
 still left with a major institutional issue, the partialnatureofthe decentralization andthe
disconnect between fundingand responsibility. This current arrangement gives insufficient
managementfreedom or incentiveto either party.

4.23      There are anumber of relatedissues o fconcern inassessingoverall extension
efficacy. First, surprisingly, there has beenlittle training support under projects to enhance
the skills ofinput suppliersor localstockists although some o fthe largersuppliers spokento
by the missionmaintain direct relationships withresearchstations. Suppliers seemto be an
untappedpotential extension force inapluralistic system. Inmany developedcountries a
substantialshare oftechnical agriculture knowledge ispassedthroughinputsuppliers
notwithstanding somerisk o fbiastowards their ownproducts. Second, seed supply is still
poor, resultinginextension staff still getting involved ininputsupply.3o$31 Third is the
question o f whether, infact, there really are available technologies sittingonthe shelf
waiting to betaken down, as is often claimed. While there is no blanketanswer to this,
overall there seems still too little appreciationwithinthe researcldextensionsystemo fthe
labor andrisk constraintsto adoption by the poor. The old, well-tested, rule ofthumb that, for
strong adoption, farmers needto see a 2:1 benefitlcost ratio, seemsto havebeenlost. Many
recommendationsthat are not being adopted do not appearto meet this criterion nor the
criterion o fhighreturns to incremental labor where landis not a constraint. Fourth, extension
efficiency is still constrainedby the lack o f marketing andinput supply and credit services.

 For example, there is still no premium paidto farmers for higher quality clean cotton or for
 quality cashew. Quality seedremains inlimitedsupply, althoughthere has beensome
 improvement inmaize seedsupplythrough private breeders. Credit is constrainedby lack of
 landtitles andthe still limited, althoughincreasing, numbersoffunctioning savingsand
 credit groups andlimitedmicrofinance managementskills. As other observers havenoted,
 extension shouldnot alone carry the blame for modest adoption rates.

 EFFICIENCY
 4.24    Efliciencyis rated as modest. The ICR attempted a simplifiedERRanalysis usingthe
 appraisal report (SAR) "break-even" type o fanalysis but with only partialprice adjustments.
 Itusednational yield datainsteadofthe (inadequate) beneficiary assessmentdata. However,
 it alsousedthe farmbudgetsfrom the SAR withthe original SARborder prices, adjustedto
 2003 prices, andwithsome labor andvariable cost price adjustments.The conclusion was
 that the project would have givena 23 percent ERRif 100percentofthe observed yield
 increaseswere attributable to the project and6 percent ifonly 50 percent were attributable.
 Evenanassumptiono f 50 percent seems very optimistic giventhe observed poor state ofthe
 generalextension service (outsidethe limitednumberof localized intensive FFS, research
collaborator or Savings andCredit groups) and given the many other contributing
investmentssuchas researchandimprovedprocessingandmarketing. Also, the border price
assumptionsseem to ignore the decline incommodity prices andthe rise infertilizer prices
since the SAR, although the ICRargues that the latter may havebeencompensatedfor by
greater use ofmanure. Inaddition, dueto lack o f data, the ICRsimply usedthe SAR
livestock dataas given, updatedto 2003 prices. Evenwithout questioning the production
data, this very simplifiedERRanalysis suggestsa rather modest ERR. Giventhe generally
weak state ofextension, itwould be very surprising ifas muchas 50 percent o fyield gains
were really attributable to the project. Moreover, commodity priceshave slipped since the
S A R andtherefore benefit streams would needadjusting downwards. This IEGassessment
didnot havethe resourcesnor the datato reworkthe ERRsince itwould havecalled for
rebuildingthe datafrom ground up.Butonthe basisofthe aboveeventhe 6percentERR
seems optimistic.

4.25    Turning to more qualitative efficiency aspects, the retrenchment o f staffhas resulted
inaleaner extensionservicewhichmayhavehadthe otentialto bemore positive for
intervention efficiency, although over a smaller scale!       Moreover, the substantial central
ministryoverheadsfor extensionmanagementhavebeenreducedinthe reforms. However,
againstthis, as notedabove, there is a now a serious lack o f ability to operate anda lack of
incentives. For example, inone district visited there hadbeenno promotions among the
extensionstafffor 8 ye,ars! Finally, the splitting ofthe ministries has also almost certainly
reducedefficiency by raisingthe costs of coordination.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT         OUTCOME
4.26    Riskto development outcome is ratedhigh.Lookingto the future what is likelyto
happen?There have been some useful extension experiments to explore the various options
for apluralistic approach. However, these have beenlargely fundedby donors. Inaddition,

32. ERR analysisis unsuitablefor comparinginterventionsofdifferent scale.

                                                        36


 some private companies suchas Cargillhave their own extensionstaff. Infuture, it hadbeen
 hopedthat resourcespasseddirectly to the districts for their control would be larger and with
 fewer strings. But when that happens, itremainsto be seenwhat share will be channeled
 towards agriculture. Indiscussions, the mission found quite supportive rhetoric on agriculture
 inthedistricts, butthe fear of some observersisthat agriculture may suffer oncefunds
 become more fungible. One view is that local district politicians canmore readily attachtheir
 namesto structures such as schools or clinics thanto some ill-defined gradual shift inthe
 growthrateofdistrict agricultural prod~ctivity.~~ the newbasketfunding Agricultural
                                                             While
 Sector Development Projectwill channelfunds to extension at district level, after so many
projects, yet another injection of donor funding cannot alone be a maindeterminant ofthe
riskto development rating, there needsto beamorefundamentalandlastingfinancial
 sustainability solution.

4.27      To explore this further, what ifextension does not rely onpublic funding? At present,
the strategy of "pluralism" appearsto have anunspokensubscript that suggeststhat the
approach will pushprivate andNGOsupportedextension andfarmer funded extension as far
as it can go. Ifthe public extension systemcan gain funding andturnitself around so much
the better but otherwise it will be allowed to wither anddie. The problemwith suchan
outcome is twofold. First, private andNGO-based extension, as well as anumberof donor
programs, relyon buyingaway and supplementingpublic extension through paying salary
supplementsandtravel, so that, ifpublic extensionunder the districts did slowly die, NGOs
andthe private sector wouldneedalternative more costly approachesto access the skills.
They are currently free-riding on the underutilizedskills, training and salaries ofthe public
extension service. Although efficient inthe short term under the present budgetary
circumstances, this may not be sustainable longer term. Second, ifpublic extension does
wither and die, it seems likely that the poorer farmers andthose predominantly producing
food crops will suffer disproportionately. There is some global evidencethat non-public
extension, as might be expected, tends to target the higher income farmers andthe cash
crops. Whether, inTanzania, such anapproachcould relieve sufficient budgetary burdenat
the top end to enablethe poor at the bottom endto be adequately covered is doubtful.

BANKPERFORMANCE
4.28      BankPerformance isratedunsatisfactory, as inthe ICR, although the ICRqualifiedit
as marginally unsatisfactory. Quality at Entrywas unsatisfactory due mainly to the lack o f


33. A particularlytroublingaspect relatedto sustainabilityofextension inTanzania is the apparentfailure of
politicians,both central and local, andsome ministryandextension staff, to move on from oldtop/down
approachesto extension. Over a periodo fonly three weeks inOctober while the missionwas inthe field, there
were a number ofreports inthe Tanzanianpress offarmers actually beingtakento court for crophusbandry
violations such as failure to weed cashew trees or not adheringto recent sudden and draconianlivestockgrazing
bans (which, underthe labelof destockingprograms go back to colonialtimes and are no doubtstill resented
greatly). The missionasked one farmer what was discussed the lasttime he saw an extension officer. The
farmer said he hadbeentold notto intercrophismaize with his cotton andhe added, somewhat shamefaced,
that he was "not aware it was not permitted". Notwithstandinglack ofclear researchevidence fiom Ukiriguru
on this oldcottodmaizepesttransfer issue, the law notto mix maizewith cotton is still on the booksnationally
and, it appears,is still beingwaved at farmers, ifnot very strictly applied. Such attitudesto farmers are
obviously inimicalto the purportedstrategy to make extensionclient-oriented. It is difficult to predictwhether
decentralizationwill make this still quite persistent"development by fiat" attitude stronger or weaker.

 readiness for the decentralized system. Moreover, as notedabove, during supervision, the
 Bankwas insufficiently nimbleevenduringimplementationonce the changedinstitutional
 decentralization was put inplace.

 BORF~OWER      PERFORMANCE
 4.29     Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Again, the ICRratedborrower
 performanceas marginally unsatisfactory. The mainborrower performance problems
 included: the flawed quality at entry; problems with counterpartfunding (there was no
 counterpart fundingprovided for over a year in 1999to 2000); the highly inefficient
 restructuringofthe agricultural ministries going againstthe clear need for a systems
 approachto agricultural services support; the problemwiththe decentralization getting stuck
 at aproblematic halfway point; the failure to address promotion andincentivesproblems for
 district level extension staff, andthe government imposedconstraints onfarmprofitabilityin
 the form ofexport bans.34

 Government Sector Strategy
 5.4      The current Tanzaniaagricultural sector strategy i s contained inthe October 2001
 Agricultural Sector Development Strategy. It lies within the larger MKUKUTA (Swahilifor
 the PRSP) framework. Prior to this strategythere was the Agricultural andLivestockPolicy
 andthe Cooperative DevelopmentPolicy of 1997which hadas its major objectives: food
 security; improved rural living standards; increasedforeign exchange earnings; sustainable
 use ofnatural resources; developmentofhumanresources; andaccess ofwomen to land,
 credit andeducation. Prior to that, the main strategic statement appearsto be the letter o f
 DevelopmentPolicy associatedwith the FY 1990TanzaniaAgricultural Adjustment Credit
 (TANAA), the mainelementofwhichwas a commitment to liberalize marketingandpricing
 for export crops. Inthe 1980sthe government's Agricultural Policy (of 1983) providedthe
 strategic framework with its four mainobjectives: (i)           to provide sufficient food for the
 growing population; (ii) generate foreign exchange; (iii) supply domestic industries with
                                to                                     to
 raw materials; and, (iv) to raiserural incomes and alleviate poverty.

 5.5      The primary objective o f the latest 2001 agriculture strategy is stated as being: "to
 create anenabling and conducive environment for improvingthe productivity and
 profitabilityofthe sector. This will serve.@ the basisfor improved farm incomes andrural
 poverty reductioninthe longterm, while contributing to the medium-term andlong-term
 goals o fthe Poverty Reduction Strategy                         The mainelements o fthe diagnosis are:
the lowproductivity oflandandlabor; poor coordinationonpolicy andimplementation;
weak marketing, processingandproductionchains; the highcost oftransportation; the
 erosion o fthe natural resourcebase; andthe reduction inhumancapital causedby
HIVIAIDS. The strategy is built on the overarching government objective o fpoverty
reduction. It acknowledgesthat the needto achieve macroeconomic stabilityrules out the
possibility o fprofligate expenditure or subsidies. Italso notes that the strategic options are
influenced bythe on-going Local Government Reform Programthat gives a substantially
larger roleto the Local Government Authorities.

5.6      The strategy notes anumber of strengths inTanzanian agriculture including:
comparative advantageinanumber o f major export and food commodities; a substantial
humancapital base; underusednaturalresources; political commitment to agriculture; and
membership ofregional andinternational trade groupings. Itnotes that Tanzania is, for the
most part, a food self-sufficient country butthat there remains potential to increase
production ofwheat andrice to replace imports andto expandlivestock exports. Somewhat
lowering the targets set for the PRSP, the strategy has a target o f achieving a 5 percent


35. Interestingly,while it refers to the Agricultural andLivestockPolicy of 1997 andnotes the first elementof
that policy as beingto "assure food securityfor the nation", the 2001strategy does not focus onfood security, it
focusesmoreonproductivityandthe means to achieve it.

                                                39


 growth rateover the three-year period2005 to 2007. It emphasizesthree innovative features.
 First, a focus onagricultural productivity andprofitability. Second, the promotion ofprivate
 sector/public sector andprocessor/contractgrower partnerships.Third, the implementation of
 the strategythroughDistrictAgricultural Development Plans. This last presentsthe dilemma
 that, oncethe majority o fresourcesare shifted into district handsandplans become district-
 driven, there is limitedleverageremaining withthe center to cause districts to adhere to any
 centrally formulated agriculture strategy.

 5.7     The strategy for researchandextensioni s ofparticular relevanceto this review. The
 strategy for research is to acceleratethe process oftransferring responsibility for funding
 export cropsto the private sector, the sharingof agricultural researchfunding between the
 central government, local governments, commodity boardsandprivate sector, andthe
 strengtheningo fthe national researchpolicy committee whichmanagesthe National
 Agricultural ResearchFund.Itproposesareturnto the "focus andconcentrate" strategythat
 itnotesresulted inbreakthroughs inthe 1960sand 1970s.Itproposes, rather optimistically,
 significant funding from localgovernmentsinto the Zonal ResearchFunds.

 5.8     The strategy on extension is to give primary responsibility to the LGAswith the
 majority of financing comingfrom the center andthe LGA. LGAsare to coordinate both
public andprivate providers o fextension"to ensure all stakeholders are served". A
proportion ofthe central government funds areto be allocated to the NationalExtension
Fundwhich LGAswould compete for. LGAs were expectedto enter intopartnership and
cost-sharingmangements with outgrower andcontract schemes which might involve the
secondmentofextension staff. Inrangelandmanagementthere was to be demarcationand
allocation of landto be usedby pastoralists.

Bankand Agriculture in Tanzania
5.9      Strategic Work. Three CASs set the elementso f a broad rural strategy for the period
underreview. Thesewere backedupbya limitedamount o fagriculture-related economic and
sector work. While necessarily somewhat limitedindetail, the CASs were generally
consistentwiththe borrower's statedpriorities, although there is some evidencethat,
particularly earlier inthe periodunder review, government was more focused on food self-
sufficiency andthe Bank more focused simply on sector efficiency.

5.10    The 1994 CAS focused on four issues, the unstable fiscal environment, the scope o f
the developmentprogram, inefficient use of funds and constraints to the private sector, and
weaknesses inimplementation. ByMay 1996action hadbeeninitiatedto reduce restrictions
on agriculture includingmainly marketing, processingandtrade restrictions.

5.11    The 1997 CAS notedthat increasedagricultural output hadcome mainly from
acreage expansionwith yields remaining generally belowthe levels obtained inthe 1970s.At
the time the government's Medium Term Development Strategy called for expansionof
agricultural production at 5 percent through yield enhancing inputs with some increasein
cultivated area, andfrom the developmentofnon-farm activities, andimproved social
services. The Bank strategy was inbroadagreementwiththis, emphasizing raising
agricultural productivity, promotingoff-farm activities, and improvingthe environment for
private sector growth. There is some evidence inthis CAS o flearningrelated to agriculture

                                                      40


fromthe performance sincethe previous CAS.The CAS listedresearchandextension, rural
access roads, water resourcedevelopment, andthe links betweensocial andeconomic
services, as the most important elements.There was also a focus on environmental quality
which appears strongerthan inthe government strategy. However, this CAS still hadmany
weaknesses. It was criticized by IEGinits 1998 sector assessment for not giving sufficient
attention to export crops giventhe highgrowth target which could only be achievedwith
highexport growth. IEGnotedthat the growtho fexport crop productioninTanzaniacould
havea significant impact onpoverty.

5.12      The CAS was more strongly criticized inthe IEG 1999report RuralDevelopment.
From Vision toAction?inwhich Tanzaniais ratedlast withthree other countries out o f20
countries reviewedfor anoverall ratingonthe quality o fBank's rural development strategy.
The report stated (Annex D)that the 1997 Tanzania CAS "contains no rural strategy worthy
ofthe name..      .Itseems clear that the knowledge base for developing a ruralstrategy for
Tanzaniais quite inadequate. What really are the prospectsfor technological improvement
andprofitablemarketing inthe agricultural export sector? .. The ideao f"farmer-driven-
                                                                      ..
research" has appeal ifthe alternative is irrelevant research, but even well informed farmers
needguidance o fexperts onresearchwhich departs from existingways o fdoingthingsbut
may, for that very reason, behighly prod~ctive."~~

5.13     The CAS noteda number oflessonsincludingthat the sustaineddialogue onthe
divertiture o fparastatalshad contributed to performance andthat the past program hadnot
given enoughattention to reformingpublic sector institutions andhelping to buildthe skills
requiredfor a market-oriented economy, The CAS alsonotedthat the Bankhadnotbeen
sufficientlyactive ininvolvingNGOsandbuildinginstitutionsthat would stimulate
decentralizeddevelopment. Performanceo fprojects hadbeena serious problem with the
share of "problem projects" increasingsteadily, but this was partly attributedto recent greater
realism inratings. Two ruralandagriculture projects were proposedinthe lending program
out ofa total o ften projects over the periodFY 98 to FY 00. (The NALRP, the ASMP, and
the NAEP I1were already inthe lendingprogram andunder implementation, or nearly so).
The proposedprojects were focused onruralwater andagriculture butlittledetailis offered
so it is not easy to linkthem to the subsequentprojects that emerged. The case for the priority
ofthese particular projects inthis CAS inrelation to the strategy is not self-evident. We
concur, therefore, that this CAS didnot offer a rural strategy.

5.14     The June 2000 CAS is a document o fmore substancebut it is still not very clear how
theagriculture projects were chosen. Itnotesthe deterioration ofsocial indicators andthe
lack of income opportunities for the poor inruralareas. The government strategy at this point
rested on three pillars: first, creating higher growth andeconomic opportunities for the poor;
second, buildingcapacity; and, third, increasingempowerment and accountability. The CAS
called for the development o f anenvironmentally sustainablerural strategy withthree
objectives: (i)   conservingthe naturalresourceson whichthe poor depend;
(ii)commercializing agriculture; (iii)        increasinglinkages withurbanareasto create income
opportunities. While these are not unimportant for rural development, they appear somewhat
out offocus against the priority objective o fpoverty alleviation. First, the conservation of

36. This reflects a point madeearlier inthis reportonthe researchproject.

                                                          41


 naturalresourceshas usually offeredonly longer-termbenefitsfor the poor. Second, the
 commercializationofagriculturewould berelatively morefocusedonthe less poor farmers.
 Third, the support for urbanareas, while bynomeans irrelevantto the ruralpoor, was
 probably likely to have lower immediateimpactthandirectruralinterventions.

 5.15     At the time ofthis CAS, IEGinits 2000 country assistanceevaluation (CAE) noted
 that there was a needto intensify focus inthe rural strategy on constraintsto agricultural
 production.The CAE characterizedthese as beingpredominantlyinthe areaofthose services
 that now faced, or would soonface, ahiatus following the reforms, inparticular, filling the
 marketing, inputand credit supply void left by the dismantlingofparastatalswhichthe
 privatesector was so far largely failing to achieve. Sucha focus was not reallystrongly
 evident inthe language ofthe CAS. The lendingprogramfor FYOl to FY03 didinclude a
 RuralWater LIL,aSoil Fertility Project(which latermutatedinto the Participatory
 Agricultural andEmpowermentProject(PADEP)), a Forest ConservationProject, anda
 secondLake Victoria Projectfocusedon environmentalissues. Itis not entirely clear how
this lendingprogramwould focus on constraintsto production. Soil fertility certainly
 qualifiesbut, inthe end, this proposedproject did not eventuate. Forest conservation, while
 important, appears somewhatperipheralto the centralproductivity strategy. Ruralwater
certainlycontributesto productivity but may beless cost effectivethan alternativeoptions.
Improvingthe environmentof Lake Victoria is also not strongly relatedto enhancing
agriculturalproductionalthoughofdefiniterelevanceto sustainability. Inthe event, the
PADEPemergedwithan ob'ective to raiseproductivity offood andincomesthrough
communityempowerment.3               d


5.16      Surprisingly, sincethe time ofthe 2000 CAS, there hasbeen no overall Bankstrategic
document. Inaccordancewith the newBank Tanzaniaapproachto enhancedonor
coordinationandto consolidateBankandborrowerstrategies, the intention is to preparea
joint strategic document with donors andthe borrower. This is not expectedto be finalized
untilearly2007. Thiswouldmeanagap offour years fiomthe statedvalidity periodofthe
2000 CAS which was given as 2003. This seems an excessive gap instrategic guidanceover
aperiodofrapidchange inpolicies. Withrespectto more recentprojects, the Agricultural
SectorDevelopmentProject (ASDP) was developed. This is aloosely definedbasket-funding
approachon a largescale. The appraisalreport does notpresent much evidence that
institutional capacity inTanzaniamatchesthe challenge ofmaking soundandtimely
decisions. This is discussedagainlater.

37. The PADEPsupports capacity buildingat the district level andmatchinggrants at the communitygroup
leveldevelopedthroughparticipatoryplanningprocessesto support sub-projects such as watershed
managementandsoil fertility restorationusingrock phosphate, no tillagetechniques, integratedplantnutrient
managementandintegratedpest management, livestockimprovement andmarketing. Subproject approval is by
the DistrictManagement Team. While PADEP provides some funding for the operationofthe extensionservice
at the district level, it does not appear to resolvethe outstandingissueofpost-project sustainability. The original
proposalfrom the CAS to support a soil fertility projectwas rejectedonthe groundsthat it focused too muchon
one input(inorganic fertilizer) rather than offering support for an openmenu oftechnologies at the community
leveland it was insufficientlyfocused onparticipationby communities. (It is not entirely clear why it should
have beenso narrow.) The extent to which PADEP will now achieve resultsonthe issueofsoil fertility remains
to be seen, Since the matching grant proposalcoversthe full menu, it seems probablethat investments with
longer-termbenefitssuch as rockphosphate for soil fertility will not featurehighonthe priority listofthe
poorerhouseholds.

                                                    42


5.17     Overall, the review of CASs andthe agriculture lendingprograms suggests some
weaknesses incarrying the strategic logic ofthe CAS through into the lending program.
There needs to be an explicit theory-basedlogic between, onthe one handthe strategic and
sector goals o fthe CAS,and, on the other hand, the proposedproject lending list. The
absence o f such links reducesthe value o fthe CAS as botha sighting mechanismanda filter
for the structuring of sector lendingprograms. Itleavesthe impression that the strategy and
the list o fprojects are developedlargelyindependentlyand forced together afterwards. There
i s rarely evidence inthe CAS of selectivity, ofwhat was rejected.

5.18     Sector Work. There were severalmajor sector studies anda number o f smaller
contributions to strategicthinkingby the Bank over the period ofreview.                  L


5.19     In1992therewas a missionfor a Tanzania:Agricultural Sector Review which
provided input intothe ASMP designandwas finally published in 1994 as a GOT/Bank
study entitled TanzaniaAgriculture. The diagnosis ofthis rather wide-rangingandunfocused
report was, briefly, the following: that expansionof landarea was still possible ifguided and
assisted; that a focus on export crops, since world markets could absorb increased
production, would be important; that roadswere important to reduce costs but innewareas
should be carefully located; that the information base was poor; that the decline in
commodity prices had implications for taxation ofexport crops andefficiency more
generally; that the ineffectiveness, disorganization and insufficient expenditure inpublic
researchand extension hadreducedthe generationo ftechnologies; that sustainableuse of
soils, water, forests andwildlife was important; that restrictive legislation for private sector
entry should be repealed;38that policy formulation capacity inthe ministryneededto be
strengthened; that there was a needfor agreedandpublic rules for government intervention
through the Strategic Grain Reserve; and, that all input markets should beliberalized.

5.20     Some o fthe mainstrategic recommendationswere:

     0   Expenditure on agricultural researchandextension should be approximately doubled.
         (It was not).
     0   Salariesinresearchandextension shouldbe raisedandadequate operating costs
         provided. (They were not).
     0   The liberalization o fthe traditional export crop marketsand divestiture ofparastatal
         crop processing agencies should becompleted. (This was done but at a slower pace
         thanthe very optimistic paceplanned).
     0   Improvingmanagementofthe StrategicGrainReserve, includinga procedure for
         grain releaseandpricing, andliberalization o fagricultural inputs (This was partially
         done but now the fertilizer subsidyhasre-emerged).
     0   Outside agriculture, continued rehabilitation o f the rural roads network was
         recommendedincluding the opening up ofstrategic areasthrough newroads to foster
         agricultural development. (This does not seemto have beena significant focus since).




38. In 1993 an amendment to the Crop Marketing BoardsAct permittedprivate entry into marketingand
processingofcoffee, cotton, tobacco and cashew nuts.

                                                     43


 5.21     Proposedprojects under this study included(inwhat was saidto be atentative order
 ofpriority): agricultural researchandextension, water resourcesmanagement, wildlife, rural
 financial markets, export diversification, and livestock sectorproject and monitoringand
 regulationofaprivate sector fishing industry. As inthe CASs, there does not appearto be
 any formal procedure, opento peer or managementexamination, for prioritizingandfiltering
 even a modestarray ofpotential project alternativesunderthis study. Itis concluded,
 therefore, that the problemdiscussedearlier about the limitedlogic inthe leap from the
 strategy to the lendingprogram inthe CASs stems at leastpartlyfrom the same weakness
 further back inthe sector work.
 5.22     In2000, there was asignificant agriculture sector study donejointly bythe Bank,
 GOT andthe InternationalPolicy ResearchInstitute entitled "Agriculture in Tanzaniasince
 1986:Follower or Leader of Growth?" The Prefaceofthis study notesthat there were
 contrasting views about the performanceo fTanzania's agriculture summarized inOED's
 1998 sector assessment (discussed below). Itwas pointedout that there were serious
 discrepanciesbetween variousnational andinternational sources ofproduction estimates and
that national accounts, prior to revisions, indicated ahigh-growth performance averaging
nearly five percentannually while production datashowedperformanceto be stagnant. Itwas
becauseo fthe contrastingviews about performance that an independentandreputable
institutionsuchas IFPRIwas engagedto contribute to the sector study. This study didfind
significant datainconsistencies, albeit with some improvement inrecent years. Estimated
agricultural GDP growth was 3.3 percent since 1985. The report noteda fairly respectable
growth rate ofmaizeproductionof2.4 percent giventhe decline inrealproducer prices and
increasing fertilizer prices?' The study found (usingdomestic resourcecost ratios DRCs)            -
that Tanzania has a strongcomparative advantageinmaize, paddy, andall the traditional
export crops. Itwas also found that livestock products may offer one ofthe best long-run
potentials o fwidespreadapplicability. Major growth linkages were found with the non-farm
sector, mostly consumptionlinkages. Surprisingly, lightmanufacturing hada smaller effect
on urbanincomesthandid export cashcropping partlydue to labor intensity. The report
expressedconcernabout the renewedsharp appreciation o fthe exchangerate since 1993
which hada greaterimpact thanworld prices or liberalizationonreal producer prices.
Agriculturalresearchandextensionwere foundto generate higher returns oninvestment. It
was concludedthat relyingentirely onprivate sector researchwas not anoption.40

5.23      This was avery strong piece o f sector work and although it is difficult to trace the
attribution, it almost certainly played a useful role inchanneling strategic thinkingwithin

                ~~




39. It alsonotedthat,while export cropproduction hadexpandedonly 1.8percentperyear overthe late 1980s,
this hadincreasedto 7.7 percentgrowth inthe 1990s.Fertilizeruse hadfallenby about halfas a resultof
subsidy removaland lower cropprices. However,the impact onnationalmaizeproductionwas foundto be
modest (less than5 percent)partlydue to the low initial use offertilizer on food crops. The study foundthatjust
five percent ofTanzanianfarmers obtain credit fiom long-termresources. It found that farmers who grew cash
crops have higher incomesthanthose who do not, even after holdingfarm size, education, and other factors
constant. It foundthat income increases goingto export crop farmers are associatedwith increasedfood
consumptionamongthis group.
40. Inthe case ofnon-tradablefood crops productivity, increasingresearchwas most likely to lower market
prices with benefitssharedbetweenproducersand consumers.Transportation costs inrural marketingwere
found to be very highand ifloweredwould raise producerpricesand lowerthe cost ofinputs.

government at this critical time. A number ofshort-term measuresto stimulate agriculture
were proposed inthis study:

     0  First, excessivetaxation ofagricultural production andmarketingbylocal authorities
        should be reduced. Tax burdens of30 to 60percent on the major traditional export
        crops were found. (These were later reduced).

     0  There should be apermanent liftingofthe banon food exports. (This was not done
        andthe banis still inplacetoday withsome modification). The effect ofexport
        liberalization on poor consumers indeficit areas was estimated to beminor and
        therefore could be offset by direct assistance.

     0  The facilitation o fcredit provision was consideredimportant. Itwas proposedthat it
        should be provided by crop buyers, banks, andcooperatives rather than government.
        The interest rates should not besubsidized.Itshould target commercial crops for
        which inputs were profitable. The government role would be inthe creation o f
        groups, the facilitation ofa credit system, and informationprovision. (There hasbeen
        limitedprogresswith microfinance institutions but the creation o f savings and credit
        groups is now, some years later, moving quite strongly). Well-designed subsidies to
        lending institutions catering to small farmers were consideredjustified. There was
        concernthat food aidmay not be serving the interests o fequity by making food
        markets lesspredictable andlowering returnsto poor farmers.

        Better datawas called for on horticulture, minor crops, small-scale animal agriculture,
        fertilizer use, food consumption patterns, the distributiono fpoverty, interregional
        markets, andtrends innutrition. (Data has somewhat improvedbut remainsquite
        weak andpublic availability is limited).4'

        Finally, the report called for greaterbudgetfor agriculture. There hadbeena decline
        inbudgetary support for theMinistryofAgriculture andCooperatives. The
        1999/2000estimate was almost one third lower inrealterms thanthe average o fthe
        first three years of the period under review by that report Le. from 1986. The report
        noted that savings from eliminating fertilizer subsidies and divestiture of loss-making
        parastatalactivities hadnot beenreallocatedto agricultural research, extension and
        marketing. Over the period 1991 to 1999M A C spending, includingdevelopment
        spending, averagedjust 3.5 percentoftotal central government expenditures.This
        was consideredminimalwhen comparedto agriculture's contributionto export
        revenue (at least 45 percent), to gross domestic product (minimum of47 percent) and
        to employment (84 percent).

5.24    In2005, therewas avery usefulDiagnosticTradeIntegration Studypreparedunder
the IntegratedFramework for Trade-RelatedTechnical Assistance to Least Developed
Countriesprogram (a multi-donor program establishedby WTO trade ministers in 1996).


41. The GOT PublicationsOffice is the poorestthe missionhas encountered. Most materialrelevantto rural
development seems to be out of print includingthe current rural strategy. Two Tanzanianvisitors spokento who

 This was led by the WorldBankAfrica region. The study called into questionthe poverty
 impact of trade since therehad beenasignificant decreaseintraditional exports yet
 agriculture generatesover 80 percentofemployment and 80 percent o fthe poor live inrural
 areas. There were complications due to Tanzania's membership ofmorethanone regional
trade arrangementandissueswiththeir trading negotiations with the EU.The maininternal
points to be addressedincluded: reducingtransport costs, rationalizing and reducing
agricultural export taxes, reforming crop boardstowards only handlingregulation, data, and
public services suchas extension, enhancingskills, buildingcapacity onphyto-sanitary
standards, reformingcustoms, andgreaterprivate sector involvement ingivingfeedback on
policy dialogue impacting their commodity.

others.

5.26     Withrespectto other mainrelevantstudies, in 1998,IEGcarried out a review
entitled, "Tanzania, Agriculture andthe WorldBank.The mainfindings were: (i) the   that
1997CAS didnot showhow the proposedagricultural growthof five percent a year couldbe
achieved andIEGconcludedthat this couldonly be achieved with rapidexport expansion;
and(ii) theBankwas lagginginawareness ofhowthe government andother donors
         that

The mainrecommendationswere: (a) the Bankneededto use meaningful agricultural
statistics andto rebuild the agricultural analysis; (b) M&E should be enhanced (a
recommendationthat has been repeated continuallyfor many years --our comment added);
(c) divestiture targets shouldbe set accordingto expectedpay-offs ingrowthandthe

cost-sharing andparticipation by farmers andNGOs.

5.27     Tanzania Comparedwith Vietnam. Beyondthe Banksector work, there have been
some useful outside contributions relevant to the strategy debate. Inparticular, inan
Economic and Social ResearchFoundationworking paper by VanArkadie andDinh, (2004),
the better performanceofVietnam comparedwithTanzaniawas examined. Vietnam went
from beingonthe edge offamine to beingone o fthe three leadingrice exporters and a
leading coffee exporter. Inparticular, the paper examined why poverty levels were seemingly
more stubborn inTanzania. Vietnam hadachievedmuchgreater success inincreasing
agricultural productivity. Ithadinvested substantiallyinrural infrastructure andservicesto
facilitate productivity. The combination ofpublic andprivate support inVietnam appearedto
have beenbetter balancedandphasedthanthe almost exclusively private ownership
approach inTanzanianreform. The Vietnam strategy hadthe advantageo fmaintaining
continuity, preservingproductive capacity andmanagementcapabilities while attracting
additional resourcesthroughjoint ventures andnew investment. The paper arguedthat, when
a private sector is weak, it is wrong to virtually abandona state sector. Althoughthe
Vietnamese State Ownedenterprisesstill face many problems, the fact that only 30 percent
o fthem continue to makelossesindicatesthe potential for state owned enterprisesto

 contribute to development:2         Vietnamhadadoptedamore nuanced, pragmatic approachthan
 Tanzania. It was arguedalso that the social servicesdominated strategy inTanzaniarequired
 that government, first, was ableto collect taxes, whichhad beena long-standing weakness in
 Tan~ania.4~

 5.28     BankLendingandPerformance.Inadditionto thethree projects coveredbythe
 PPARs inthis report, there are six other closedprojects inthe agriculture category as noted
inAnnex A which alsoprovides abriefsummary ontheprojectobjectives andperformance.
The Annex also provides information onthe five ongoing projects. The last, the large basket
funding sectorproject, hasonly recently become effective.

5.29      Reviewingthe five ongoingprojects, the mainchanges over the earlier series o f
closed projectsare: (i)      the shift in2006 to basketfunding; (ii) increase inparticipatory
                                                                           an
approaches (Forest Conservation, Participatory Agricultural Development andEmpowerment
Project (PADEP), The TanzaniaMarine and Coastal Environment Management Project, and
some elements o fthe Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP) which canarguably
bepartly associatedwith anincreaseinexplicitpoverty focus; (iii) increaseinfocus on
                                                                                 an

allocation to anon-land activity, i.e. the marineintervention; (vi) arguably somewhat less
institutionalpolicy reformfocus nowthat some o fthe maininstitutional issueshavebeen
addressede.g. parastatals; and, (vii) greater expectationso f the private sector role. Beyond
these five projects, another, the 2005 Rural andFinancialServicesProject should be
mentioned. Itis not classified as agriculture butis clearly highlyrelevant. The realistically-
formulated objective is to develop a common policy framework, based on internationalbest
practice, that will establishan enabling environment for rural microfinance andincrease the
quality andreturns o fthe manyfollow-on investments plannedby government anddonors. It
seeksinparticularto develop skills andinstitute tracking o fthe various initiatives against
common criteriaeM

5.30      Table 5 shows total Bank lendingandlendingto agriculture and, four year average
agriculture percentages. Total lendingdirectly to agriculture over the 16year period under
review totals US$437million. However, US$206 million o fthat is the latest ASDP. Upuntil
thenthe annualaveragefor agriculture was only US$15 million. BetweenFY93 andFY02, a
low period, agriculture lending averaged only aboutUS$6millionper year. These seemlow
lending volumes for apotentially productive sector with suchrelevance to poverty. Note that
the agriculture figures are basedon the percentageofagriculture lending withinprojects with


42. One exampleis VBARD, the nationalruralbank, which, notwithstandingperiodsof lossesandhelp with
subsidies, hasreachedhugenumbersofpoor farmersquite efficiently andremainsa saleable business given
some M h e r policy changes.
43. Another paperby Danielsonentitled"Growth Without PovertyReduction?" (2004 Lund, Sweden)
concludedthat the TanzaniaPRSP andthe GOT strategy neglectedagricultureand rural roads infavor ofthe
social sectors, with these two rural sectors receiving only around 10 percentofallpriority expenditures.
44. This is an importantobjective ina learningproject. As notedearlier, assessingagainstcommoncriteria is
somethingthat is notbeingdone adequately inTanzania with the pluralisticextensionactivities.

anagriculture component. The total project costs o fprojects with agriculture components
were higher. With respectto percentages, agriculture lendingfluctuated around 5 percento f
total Banklending through the 1990sbutthenjumped to close to 20 percent over the last
four-year period. Again, the earlier level ofaround 5 percent appears low for a country in
which agriculture accounts for nearly halfofGDP, witha need to enhancetechnology, and
for a sector supporting the majority o fthe poor. While other investment inrural infrastructure
andsocial services also contributes to the welfare ofpoor ruralhouseholds, the key to the
targetedhighlevelo fgrowth that will sustain suchinvestment lies substantially inincreases
inagriculturalproductivity, includingparticularly smallholder export crops. Strikingalso is
the low share o fexpenditure on agriculture inprojects classedas having agriculture elements
(30 percent now, but upto FY05 only 24 percent). The three reviewed projects inthe PPAR
sectiono fthe report representa little under 20 percent ofthe agriculture lendingover the full
period o f review.

5.3 1 The Shift to BasketLending.Very recently, there has been a change inthe approach
to sector support inTanzania. Withthe new FY06ASDP, the Bankhasplayed a central role
inmovingtowards "basket funding" inwhichthe Bankandother donors who buyintothe
approach agree with the borrower on the overall strategy andthe broad elements o fthe
investment program andthenplace their funds into a commonbasket with agreed

                                                      48


 government processesto allocatefunding. Underthis new approach, the Bankanddonors
 wouldremainlargely outsidedetailedinterventiondesign. The intent isto standback more
thaninthepastandleavemanagementofthe sectorinTanzanianhands. This isseenas a
pilot before a further shift towards full generalbudgetarysupport for the sector.

 5.32     There are some questions whether the pastperformance inTanzania inthis sector
warrants suchahands-off approach. Inthe appraisaldocument, the argument infavor o fthis
approach is only lightly covered. Giventhe importance o f sectoral managementcapacity and,
arguably, the weakening ofthat capacity until district planningskills can build, the limited
exploration ofthe sectoral capacity to manage abasket funding approachis ofsome
~oncern.~'Clearly there are some aspectsofimplementation where no further institutional
responsibility options remain open. For example, ifresourcesare to bepassedto the field
level then local government structures, however weak, must play the central role, and
detailed planningfor implementation at that level by some higher levelor donor i s no longer
feasible. Nevertheless, basket funding managementdoes place additional burdens on sectoral
managementat several levels. To some extent inthe ASDP the designedprocessesare self-
correcting since, ifdistricts cannot perform, they will receive lessmoney under ASDP.
Nevertheless, the shift from carehlly designedinterventions to this looser basket funding
modality appears risky against current capacities. While donors involvedhave gone along
withthe approach, this is not without some misgivings. A key factor inthese decisions
appearsto bethe needto reduce donor administrative costs. For example, DFIDinDar es
Salaamno longer has anyone who handlesagriculture andrural sectors specifically.

The Main Lessonsof LendingReported In ICRs

5.33     The lessons learnedfrom the sample o fcompleted projects selectedcan be grouped
loosely into nine categoriesrelated to the following: sustainability, stakeholders, sequencing,
project design, Bank management, incentives, decentralization, M&E, anddonor
coordination.

5.34     Onsustainability, the Poverty Reduction Support Credit I(PRSCI) findings suggest
that, for sustainability, it is important to strengthen government processesrather thanto
circumvent them. The Forest ResourcesManagementProject found that special
arrangements, such as PCUs andstaff allowances, may have helpedtemporarily but didnot
contribute to sustainability, and, looking outsidethe immediate agriculture-based sample, in
theTanzaniaRural andMicrofinancial ServicesProject, itwas found that mainstreaming
project activities into the core work program o fthe leadinginstitutionhadhelped.

5.35     Onstakeholders, the ProgrammaticStructural Adjustment Credit (PSAC1) findings
suggestedthe needfor an effective strategy to address stakeholder concerns, the River Basin
ManagementProject found that there was a needto be sensitive to local differences in

45. Annex 16 ofthe PAD notesthe needto: operate within governmentsystemsto avoid setting up parallel
processes; reducetransaction costs betweengovernment and developmentpartners; andshift accountability
more towardsthe relationshipbetweengovernmentand citizens. These appearto be commendableobjectives.
However,the Annex thenjumps to the prerequisitesfor takingbasketfunding furthertowardsgeneralbudget
support. There appears to be limited supportinganalysisinthe PAD ofGOT capacityat different levels and
how that has influencedthe project design.

 practices, preferencesand customsinwater issues, andthe ForestResourcesManagement
 Projectfound that all the differentinstitutional stakeholdersneededto be committed to
 reform for itto succeed.

 5.36    On reform sequencing,the PSACl findings indicatedthat there was aneedfor the
 Bankandthe borrowerto betterunderstandthe individualsteps andsequences inthe
 privatizationprocess.The ASMP finding was that overarching national reforms may be
 neededaheado f sector reforms. The Financial Sector AdjustmentProject finding was that
 liberalization could cometoo early, beforean effective legal andregulatory framework was
 inplaceandalsothat directedcredit maybehardto abandonwhile alargestate-owned Bank
 remaineddominant.

 5.37    Onproject design,the River Basinand Smallholder IrrigationProject findings were
 that there was a needfor a comprehensive approachto agricultural productivity which
 included agriculture, water, andinfrastructure. The NAEP I1project findings concluded that,
 inprojectdesign, public funding should bedistinguishedfrompublicprovision ofservices.
 The ASMP findings concludedthat there was aneed for simple project design and clear
 definition o fthe roles of eachparty. The Forest ResourcesManagement Project fmdings
 concludedthat intensiveproject preparation and appraisal and substantial supporting studies
hadpaidoff but that weaknesses inproject performance were linkedto inadequate
institutional mechanismswith decentralized responsibility without oversight or capacity.
Again, going outsidethe immediate agriculture sample, the RuralandMicrofinancial
 Services Project found that itwas important to have carehlly designedcomplementarity
among components andthat simplification ofprocurement procedures, or alignment with
national procurementprocedures, would have helped (echoing findings ina number o f
projects about procurement).

5.38     OnBank management,the NAEPIIfindings were that Bankmanagementshould
allow for moreopen debate betweenmanagementand staff on leadingdisputed strategic
issues (this was inreferenceto the feeling that senior managementhadimposed the T&V
extension approachon staffwho were startingto question its viability).

5.39     Onincentives, itwas concluded from the ASMF project that, indesigning the reform
ofa government agency, itwas important that the agency as a whole andindividual staff
should see incentives for participation inthe reform. InTARP I1there was also found to be a
needfor incentives to retainacritical mass o fexperiencedresearchersinthe public research
service.

5.40    Ondecentralization, inTARP 11, the lessons suggestedthat, beyondthe immediate
decentralization oftechnical programcontrol, it was important to complement this with
parallel decentralization o fmanagement, finances, andprocurement.

5.41    OnM&E, it was found, inrelation to TARP I1andsome other projects, that itwas
important to define the key indicators early inorder to be able to incorporate the approaches
to measuringthe evidenceintothe project design.

5.42    Finally,ondonor coordination, the PSAC1concludedthat there was aparticular need
for donor coordination when complementary Technical Assistancewas beingprovided, anda

                                                       50


lesson from the Rural andMicrofinancial ServicesProjectwas that havingsignificant donor
financing itselfhadgreatly helpedwith donor coordination inthe sub-sector.

 5.43    There is some evidence fiom the project assessments inthis report that lessonshave
beenrecordedbut not entirely actedon. As evidenceofthis, there have beena numberof
very persistentissues includingthose relatedto financial sustainability, M&E, capacity
development, seed supply, andtrade inwhich progresshasbeen modest over the years
despite frequent earlier lessonsonthe needfor action. Some lack o fappreciationo f global
lessonsrelevantto Tanzania is also evident, for example inthe over-optimism ofretaining
releasedfunds fiom ministrydownsizing for operationalcosts, and, more generally, the lack
ofrealismaboutthe rate o freformswhichwe arguecouldhavebeenbetter forecast even
withexistingknowledge.

The Bank's Role inAgricultural PolicyReform

5.44     Over the periodunder review, there i s evidencethat the Bankplayed a significant role
inTanzaniainbothdialogue on, andsupportfor, agricultural policyreform. Moreofthis
appears to havecome fiom the preparationphases ofprojects inthe lending programthan
from economic and sector work butbothplayed arole. More specifically, the Bankhas
played significant roles inthe following areas:

         Divestitureo fparastatals and government owned farms, although it should be said
        that this processhas beenvery drawn out andwith sequencing problems andspanned
        the periodof several projects. (The complexity and steps neededwere never
        adequately understood andplanned for by either the Bankor the b~rrower).~~

        Decentralization, including inthe case of agriculture early attempts at District

 5.45     PolicyRoleinthe ThreeProjectsAssessed. Referringnowmorespecifically to the
three projects reported on earlier, the areas o fthe Bank's role examined inthese three cases
 includeoverallstrategy, policy reform, public andprivate investment,research,extension,
donor coordination, andpoverty.

5.46      Onthe role ofthe Bank inoverall strategy andpolicy reform associatedwith these
three projects, the mainstrengths havebeenthat there was strong dialogue with government
and other donors throughmost ofthe period under review. There was some important
analytical work by the Bankover the period. There is evidence inthe files of continuing
dialogue, muchof it emanatingfrom the Dar es SalaamOffice. There is evidencethat the
Bank brought global policy experienceinsome areas, for example, inrelationto research,
extension, marketing, community-driven development andmicrofinance. However, there are
some questions about whether sucha "big bang" approachto divestiture was appropriate. For
example, Dejene, Sishara, Yanda, andJohnsen (1997) notethat fertilizer use indeveloping
countries has fallen substantially incountries that followed the "big bang" approach(Ghana,
Zambia, Poland, Russia) whereas inBangladesh, where retailing was privatized first,
followed by wholesaling, followed by fertilizer importation over 13 years, there was an 8
percent fertilizer increaseannually over the period. This compareswith the rapiddismantling
ofthe Tanzania FertilizerCorporationto makeroom for a smallprivate sector with limited
transport, storage andmarketingcapacity and skills. Insimilar vein, the case ofVietnam was
outlined earlier.

5.47     Onthe role ofthe Bank inpublic andprivate investmentinagriculture, the main
strengths have beenthe support for the development of an enabling environment andthe
dialogue as a whole, andresearchprivatization and divestiture ofparastatals. The main
weaknesses have been similar to those noted inthe preceding paragraphincluding
insufficient attention to capacity inthe private sector andthe long-standing issueo f
sustainability  .
5.48     Onthe role ofthe Bankinresearch policy, the mainstrengths havebeeninoffering
experienceinprivatization, management, researcWextensioncoordination mechanisms,
prioritization mechanisms, andclient feedback mechanisms. The mainweaknesses have been
that, after so many years of sustainability problems, the Bank still didnot makemuch

 progresson financial sustainability interms ofmatchingthe scale o fresearchserviceswith
 the scale of funding. While the Bank did support a strategy for privatization of export
 commodity researchto pullinadditional funding, this shift didnot releaseresources for a
 significant increase infood crop research. Also, limitedprogresswas made insupporting
 regionalization of researchto reduceindividualcountry burdens, an approachthat had
 considerablepay-offprior to independence.

 5.49    Onthe role of the Bankinextension, the mainstrengths are difficult to assess. Onthe
 one hand, more recently, the Bank contributed global experienceon pluralistic approaches.
 Butonthe other hand, the Banksupported, andstrongly pushed, T&V. This left a legacy o f
 budgetarysustainability problems, client-feedback weaknesses, and excessive system
rigidities.

 5.50    Onthe role ofthe Bank indonor coordination,the Bankhasworkedquite closely
with donors andthey havegenerally beenhappy with the Bank's readinessto consult and
 share, although a few havedecided for now to stay outside the basket funding perimeter. The
mainweakness has beenthat the Bank is seen almost universally as beingless flexible than
other donors inadaptingprocurementproceduresto common approaches.

5.5 1    On the role ofthe Bankinfocusing onpoverty, the mainstrengths havebeenthe
support for the PRSPprocess, the focus on food crop research, the support for client
feedback (although there remainweaknessesingettingfeedback from the poorer clients) the
support for participatory forest managementapproachesandprivate tree plantingunder the
ForestResourcesManagement Project, andthe support under projects such as PADEP for
community approaches.The mainweaknesseshave beenthe limitedfocus on agriculture in
the PRSP, the limited attention to the impact ofreforms at the farm household level, andthe
continued weakness inpublic extension which is the only technology source option for the
most poor.

FINDINGS

5.52     Inthis sectionthe report attemptsto summarizethe answers, as far asthe evidence
permits, to the ten questionsposedfor the sectorreview.

5.53     How did the Bankprogram,boththe policy support and investment,evolve over
the assessmenttime period?The programevolved along several axes. First, quite early on
inthe periodunderreview, itevolved from moretraditional investment projectsto greater
attention to sectoralpolicy reform. Second, it evolved from institutional reform at the center
to institutional reform at decentralizedlevels, for agriculture an inevitable shift following
government's decentralization decision which was supported by the Bank. Third, it evolved
towards increasedclient participation and feedback at field levele.g. throughthe PADEP, an
empowerment-focusedproject. Fourth, it evolved from traditional project lending inthe
direction ofbasket fundinge.g. the newASDP. Fifth, it evolved towards somewhat greater
attention to rural poverty throughthe PRSPprocess. For example, TARP I1andPADEPgave
considerable attentionto food crops.

5.54    Didthe Bankfollow an effectivesector programstrategy, inother words did it
do the right things?(Relevance)Overall, the Bankdidfollow aneffective strategy butwith

                                                      53


 anumbero fweaknesses. Itdidmanythings that were important, inparticular, the reformof
 the ministry, the reform ofgovernment parastatals, support for researchand extension, and
 support for participatory approaches.However, there were anumbero fweaknesses: (i)
 poverty alleviation objectives(the ends) were stated instrategic documents but at least earlier
 inthe reviewperiodappear to havebeensubsidiary tothe drivefor privatization (the means);
 (ii) questionofthebalancebetweensupportingdevelopment,includingrural
      the
 infrastructure, at the intensiveor extensive marginandthe associatedissuesofmigrationand
 environmental costsand benefitswas never adequately explored analytically insector work
 nor carriedthroughinto lendingdecisions; (iii) for extensionhas beeninconsistent
                                                         support
 withthe early Bank-drivenpushonT&V andthenthe abrupt abandonment; (iv) land
 managementandsoil fertility, at one time strongly supported by Bank agriculture staff as key
 agriculture concernsfor bothTanzaniaandAfrica as a whole, were issues moveduptowards
 the project starting gate and then dropped infavor of amore socially oriented andclient
 demand-orientedapproach. Giventhe comparative advantagesofthe various donors vis-bvis
 the Bank,itisquestionablewhetherthis was asounddecision.54Finally, anoverarching
 concernabout program relevance is that inthe CASs there has beenlimitedexplicit
 application o fstrategy statementsandfilters to select out andprioritize potential projects.
 There has beenlittle attemptto offer evidence to reviewers or the Bank's Board on what
 investmentoptions were consideredinCASs, what were rejectedandwhy, andwhat was
 finally selectedandwhy. Presentingsuch information inthe alternatives considered section
 o f PADSis too late for a strategic shift. The lack of such analysis inCASs makes the
 assessment ofrelevanceat this distance more difficult

 5.55    Did the Bankplanand implementthe chosen projectswell, in otherwords did it
 do things right?(Efficacy andEfficiency)With a series ofonly nine closedprojects it is
dificult to say muchthat would be statistically valid about project performance trends.
However, with respectto closedprojects there is no strong evidenceo f atrend ineither
direction towards better or worse performance over that time fiame. The PPARso fthree
projects inthis report lower the ratings from what was found inthe IC&, partlydue to
concernsabout developmentrisk andthe linksbetween sustainability andthe reform of
institutions andprocesseswhich have animplicit element of sustainability (Le. the argument
made earlier that anewprocesscanhardly be saidto havebeenestablishedifit cannot be
sustained). These three projects were spreadover muchofthe period under review so the
findings do not changeany conclusion about trendalthough they do lower the percentage of
satisfactoryprojects. Certainly, project performance has beenbetter than the poor
performanceo fthe 1970sand 1980s,but, given the policy environment at that time, it should
be. Also, there is some hope insupervision ratings that more recentprojects may perform
better but it is too early to make suchjudgments.

5.56     However, there are anumber o f questions about project design which are discussed
below underthe questiono fhow well the Bank learned. Ofparticular concern i s the issue of
sustainability.



54. Few farminghouseholdsare likely to place soil fertility research,development and trainingabove more
visible anddefinableimmediatevillage investmentsbut it may well be the bestnationalchoice for a ten to
twenty-year time horizon, and indeedfor the sustainabilityofthe more immediateinvestments,.

                                                54


 5.57     What were the borrower's prioritiesover the period of review? The borrower's
 priorities largelycoincided with the Bank's global sectoraland country strategy. At least in
 the documentation, the borrower strategy shifted somewhat from a strong earlier focus on
 food security and, infact, evenself-sufficiency, towards more focus on creating the means to
 overall productive efficiency. Interestingly, food security was playeddown inthe GOT 2001
 strategy althoughthat strategyexplicitly refersback to the earlier 1997policy. Whereasthe
 first statement inthe 1997policy i s relatedto food security, the 2001document focuses on
 institutions, private investmentclimate, agriculture support services, marketing and input
 supply, and coordination ofplanning with other sectors. However, indiscussions with some
 senior officials inthe ministries, food security, andeven self-sufficiency, are still seen as
 highonthe list ofpriority directions.

 5.58     What was the Bank's role in policy reform?The Bank has clearly played a leading
 role inpolicy reform. The mission explored the attitudes of government officials and
 concluded that, by andlarge, the Bankhadnot imposedits views onthe borrower. Itbrought
 substantialglobal experience to the table although, partly as a reactionto the failed policies
 ofthe 1970sandearly 198Os, the borrower was inany case committed to quite sweeping
 reforms, albeit with someperiods ofweaker commitment inthe mid          -1990s.As  mightbe
 expected, there was muchless commitment withincentral ministries to decentralizationand
 these doubts go outside agriculture to other sectors also. Some o fthe concerns, such as
 whether local-level decisions will give sufficient attention to agriculture competing with
 more visible items such as schools, roadsandclinics, may bevalid.

 5.59    However, there are several areas where the Bankmight have performedbetter. First,
itcouldhavepreparedgovernment better for the complexity ofreformprocessesandthe
needto planand project the complex intermediate steps. The use o f computerized project
managementplanningtechniquescould have set out the array o f steps and forced much
greaterrealism at the outset on boththe borrower andthe Bank. The stages neededin
reachingreform implementation are more widely knownthan is often impliedby ex post
claims o funcertainties.Individualsteps ina complex reformchain may be uncertainin
themselves but government andparliamentary proceduresare quite well knownandthe time
to completea series of steps should be lessuncertainthan individual component steps.'
Second, the Bankcould have laidout the experienceabout the small likelihoodthat resources
saved ina sectorministry reform program would find their way back to the same institution.
Third, the Bankcouldhave betterpreparedthe borrower to understandthe needsofprivate
sector capacity building, a needthat, even at that time, hadalready been seeninother reform
programs. As notedearlier, the questionwas not simply what were the appropriate core
activities for a central ministry, itwas what were the relative capacities inthe government
andthe private sectorandwhat didthis implyfor the evolution ofthe roles ofbothunderthe
circumstances.

5.60     To what extent did the Bankinterventionsimpact the sector? (Attribution) The
Bank's interventions impactedthe sectorpositively inboththe policy andinstitutionalreform
area including, parastatalreform, ministry rationalization, technology development, and
some aspects ofdecentralization. However, as found inthe project assessmentsfor the three
projects reviewed, this was not without weaknesses. These weaknesses included: failure to
look beyondthe institutional reforms to focus on impact on beneficiaries; failure to ensure

                                                       55


 adequate M&Eso that attribution could beunderstood and, for example, so that pluralismin
 extension could beevaluated; failure to realistically project reform time scales; and some
 issues o f reform sequencing.

 5.61     Didthe Bankensurecountrybuy-in?Or did it unduly force itsparticular
 reformvision?As notedabove, the missionfound from discussionswithgovernment staff
 that the Bankhadnot unduly imposedits views. It hadbroughtto the tablewide global
 experience, albeit with some gapsnotedabove. There was also some anecdotal evidence that
 interactionbetweenthe Bankandgovernment had improvedover the time period. However,
 inextension, the shift intotheT&V systemandthe abrupt shiftoutbythe Bank,alongside
 the government's generally less unstableposition on T&V, speaksof some degree o f Bank
 pressureonthis issue.

 5.62     Didthe Bankcoordinateeffectivelywith other donors?The view of donors was
that coordination was betternowthaninthepast. There is evidenceofvarious coordination
mechanismsthat didnot exist inthe past. The shift towards abasket fundingapproach, while
risky, is certainly evidence ofacommitment to coordination. At the individualproject level,
there are recent examples of wide coordination, such as inthe areaofmarinefisheries where
many co-financiers are involved. One ofthe more difficult areas ofcoordination hasbeen
over procurement procedures.

5.63     Didthe Banklearnsufficiently from earlier programor projectlessons?The
lessons from projects havebeensummarizedearlier. All PADs havethe required sections
showing how lessonshavebeenincorporated. But this review finds some weaknesseshere.
The recurring issue o f sustainability hasreally never beenadequately resolved. Itis, o f
course, one ofthe central issues for Afiica as a whole andquite intractable. However,
progress has beenvery slow. Sustainability problems have beennoted for several decades in
Tanzania yet, for example, inagricultural researchthe rationalization ofthe number andsize
o f researchstationshas still not reallybeentackled except at the margin^.^' Moreover, after
many decades, sustainability inextensionremains the central issue andlocal govenunent
revenue collectionnow appears likely to decline further. The problem for several decades has
been simply that the borrower hasnot come anywhere near havingthe resourcesto sustain
either the public researchor the public extension service. The T&V systemfoundered largely
on this issue. While solutions are not easy, deeper analysis o f options to reachsustainability
is needed.56At a minimum,sustainability analysis inPADs would seemto call for: (i)                    an
attempt at the tabulation ofthe trendo fpre-project budgetary actuals for operating costs
across the relevant set o f activities andsources; (ii)      the same trend for the project period;


55. As a number ofcommercialcompanies have shown, it is possibleto do adaptive agricultural research
without a researchstationat all.
56. More recently,the lessonstaken up for the designofthe ASDP seem weak on financialsustainability. The
section inthe ASDP PAD mainreporton sustainability (two briefparagraphs)argues infavor ofsustainability
on essentiallytwo grounds;(i)that government is now more committed; (ii)that the developmentpartnership
and pooledresources finding will help; and (iii)that resultsdeliveredwill feed backto greater sustainability.
There is no analysisofthe trends ofpastbudgetary allocations, the needsover the project periodandthereafter,
and the escalatingoperatingcost issuesdue to lossesoftaxes and cesses faced by agricultural researchand
extension, althoughsome ofthe latter changes occurred a little after the projectwas approved.

                                                         56


 (iii) projection o fthe operating cost requirements and sourcesinthe post-project period;
 (iv) discussionofhowthe aboveneedscouldbereconciledwiththe probablebudget."

 5.64     Another weaknessnotedhas beenthat the quality of M&E has beenvery weak andit
 is not clear that the Bankprogram haslearnedmuch inthis area or that the somewhat limited
 M&Etreatment inthe ASDP PADwilltrigger astep forward. Finally, there remain some
 significant gaps inknowledge that have not beenfilledeither throughproject analysis or
 ESW, inparticular the key question ofhow muchsupport should be givento intensification
 versus extensification andthe issue ofinternal migration. Migrationis happening, for
 example from Shinyangadown to R u k ~ a . 'In           ~ theory, this makeseconomic sense. The
 possibility ofsupport for this was mentioned inearlier Bank sector work. But it does not
 seem to have featured inany interventions andwas rejected as an option for PADEP support.

 5.65     What lessons for Bankmanagementdo the findings offer? While anumber o fthe
 findings have generalimplications for the way managementat various levels could adjustthe
 focus onthe agricultural sector, there are a few specific lessonshighlighted here. First, as
 notedby the ICRfor the NAEP I1project, Bank managementneedsto listen to operational
 Task Managersandstaffparticularly when there is a strong institutionally marketed strategy,
 such as T&V, being pushedBank-wide. Second, it is not clear withinthe projects that
 poverty targeting is gettingenough focus and, giventhe lack ofnationally embedded M&E
 capacity, andthe introduction ofbasket funding anddecentralization, there is some riskthat
 itcould evenweakenm e r . Third, asnotedearlier, the linkbetweenthe CAS strategiesand
 the lendingprogram is rarelyself-evidentandthe limitedbudgetfor sector work meansthat
the analysisof alternative options that might fit the strategymaynot emergeoutside the
 CAS.


6.       Lessons Learned
6.1      To summarize the above findings, notwithstanding some lack o f analytical rigor in
the translation of CAS strategiesinto actual lendingprograms, the Bank played a generally
positive role insupportingpolicy andinstitutional reformrelatedto agriculture. However,
there was excessivefocus on means rather than ends. Divestiture o fparastatalswas seentoo
much as an endinitselfrather than as a route to improved service for the rural poor. Itis
probablethat somewhat less o fa "Big Bang" approachwould have givenbetter results at the
f mlevelandmoreattentionto privatesectorcapacity building.Partlyasaresultofthis
approach, there was limitedandpoor quality impact monitoring throughM&Ewhich leaves


57. The PAD ofthe on-goingMarine and Coastal EnvironmentManagementProjectofferssome ofwhat is
neededwith a quite usefulsectionon the proposedMarine LegacyFund and, again, qualitative evidence of
commitment at various levels of government.However, even hereit is not entirely clear what the operatingcost
needs are nor what might be a realistic expectation of government financialcontributionalongsidethe legacy
fund.
58. It shouldbe expectedthat migrationto exploit new unexhaustedsoils would speedup when fertilizer
subsidies are removedand slow downagainwhen they are reinstated(as appears to be happeningnow). The
ratiooffinancialfertilizer nutrient cost to labor cost haschangedgreatly over the last three decades(with no
apparentchanges infertilizer recommendations).

                                                57


alegacy of ignorance about effectivenessand efficiency of alternative approaches,
particularly inagricultural extension. Inthe areaoftechnology development and
dissemination there were a number of weaknesses. First, partlyas a result o fdecentralization,
extension isnow inconsiderable disarray withthe majority o f staff having grossly inadequate
operating funds. Under suchdebilitating resourceconstraints, the question ofwhich
particular permutations o f extensionsystemare bestbecomeslargely irrelevant. Second,
while agricultural researchis inbetter shapethanextension, the donor rushtowards client-
oriented adaptive researchseekingimmediate impact has left insufficient focus on sustaining
the essentialcore oflonger-termappliedandstrategicresearch. Unless corrected, thiswill
gradually starve the adaptive researchprogram. The Bankcan be a balancing influence here.
Inthe areaof coordination, the Bank'sparticipatory approachofworkingwiththe
government andother donors is regardedpositively by stakeholders. Sustainability,
especially intechnology developmentanddissemination still remains the biggest concern in
sector interventions. There hasbeeninsufficient attention to addressingthe core issue o f
matching scale o fpublic sector activity to projected resources. The evidence ofthe last
decadewould suggest that boththe researchservice andextension service are beyond
government's capacity to sustain at current scale. Itis very doubtful that privatization and
cost recovery inthese serviceswill provide sufficient supplementation and at the sametime
supportpoverty alleviation sufficiently except ina few localized situations. Finally, the new
approachto basket funding, while offering a numbero f advantages interns of efficiency of
Bankand donor management,appearsto behighriskandbuiltonrather limitedanalysisof
government institutional capacity.

6.2     The following are the five mainlessons drawn from boththe project assessments and
the sector overview.

        Thereneeds to be an explicitlogical link between thestrategic and sectoralgoals of
       the CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS) and theproposed lendingprogram. The
       obscurity o f such links reducesthe value ofthe CAS as botha sighting mechanism
       anda filter for the structuring ofsectoral lendingprograms. The problem is notthat
       the selectedprojects are incompatible withthe strategy, it is that they are not
       demonstrably inthe upper ranks o fcompatibility. There is rarely evidenceinthe CAS
       ofselectivity under decisionrules.

   0   Institutional capacity analysis could be strengthenedand broadened and chronic
       problems thatpersist in a sector over longperiods of timeshould result in more
       analytical work by theBank Inthe ASMP, identifLing the "core" activities o fpublic
       institutions was only halfthe story. The other halfwas the identification o fthe "non-
       core" activities that the private sector was likely to have the capacity to handle at the
       time andthe reconciliation ofthese findings. The Bank should focus not only on
       institutional reform as a meansbut also onthe development ends. Inthe recent ASDP,
       public sector capacity to managebasket fbndingis the bigquestion, yet there is
       limitedanalysis o fthat capacity. Inthe NAEP 11, poor anticipation ofthe institutional
       decentralization stages andthe associatedcapacity needs was a designhandicap from
       which the project never fully recovered. Also, there are four areas ofweakness over
       the last 15 to 20 years that show insufficient Bank andborrower analytical response.
       First, financial sustainability ofresearchandextension, after manyprojects, remains

                                       58


largely unresolved. Second, M&E hasbeenchronically weak for manyyears. It
should have beentreated longago as anational M&Ecapacity problemnot aproject
byproject problem. Third, extensionitself(for the poor) is no further forwardnow
than itwas 20 years ago. The appropriateabandonmentofT&V has not beenreplaced
withanefficient alternative public system, even apluralistic one. Fourth, whether it is
optimal inTanzaniato raise Total Factor Productivity by focusing on the intensive
marginor the extensivemargin, hasneverbeenadequatelyexplored even after many
decades,of debate.

I n policy research,there needs to be a balance between shorter-term client-oriented
adaptive research and longer-term core applied research and this needs to be
embedded in a regional approach. Recently, all donors haverunto the same side of
the ship. Client demandcannot alone determine optimallong-term researchstrategy,
fanners have insufficient information andthe associateddonor support is too short-
term.

TheBank needs to be more realisticinprojecting timescalesfor agricultural
reforms. Incomplex sequences ofreforms such as parastataldivestiture, the planning
andtracking ofmultiple stages ofreforms fiom initial planning, to consultation, to
political interactions, to government processes, to legislation andto cabinet
clearances, is always time-consuming andthis seems always to come as a surprise.
Delay is usually put down to uncertainty or exogenous factors. But, infact, most of
the steps required andthe degrees o f uncertainty are usuallyquite well understoodby
borrower decision-makers. Moreover, the political positions ofplayers are often quite
well-known. Realistic projections o fthe time frame andefficient management o fthe
processcould almost certainly be improved by the use of computerized project
managementtechniquesa$is commonly usedfor any complex anduncertain
processesinindustry. There is also policy makingsoftware that can help pinpoint
critical players andassesstheir place inthe politicallandscape.

TheBank and theborrowersshould be more realistic aboutthe likelihood of funds
savedfrom the down-sizing of apublic institution being applied tofuture operating
costs. Outside the context ofeconomy-wide civil service reform, such redirection o f
funding hasrarely beenobserved.

 Annex A. BankAgriculture ProjectsBetweenFY1991-2006

 Inadditiontothe threeprojectscoveredbythe PPARsinthisreport, there are six other
 closed projects inthe agriculture category. There are also five ongoing projects. The
 following are the main characteristicsofthese projects and, very briefly, the mainissuesthat
 arose:

 ClosedProjects

 The Forest Resource ManagementProject FY 92 (US$20.9m) was designed to support
 implementation ofthe TanzaniaTopical Forestry Action Planmainlythrough strengthening
 the capacity ofinstitutions andincreasingparticipation ofthe private sector and local
 populations. Project outcomewas rated satisfactory by the ICR. The project was ableto show
 the benefits ofworking withlocal communities and also the benefits o f working withlocal
 community's simple technologies. The forestry advisory services still needed strengthening
 (notethe parallelwithagricultural extension).

The Financial Sector ManagementProject FY 92 (US$211.3 m) The mainobjectives o fthis
program were to makethe macroeconomic framework more favorable to financial sector
performance,to improve competition by facilitating the entry ofnewbanks, to strengthen
Central Bank supervision capacity, andto restructure individual public banksincludingthe
National Bankof Commerce. An OED PPAR rated outcomeunsatisfactory. Itprovedtoo
difficult to support competition while maintaining a national bankas a dominant financial
institution. There was a sequencingissue with liberalization coming too early before an
ineffective legal andregulatory framework was inplace. Also, delayed restructuring of
parastatals, some ofthem inagriculture, hamperedefforts to create competition.

The River BasinManagementandSmallholderIrrigation Project FY 97 (US$26.3 m) This
project was intendedto strengthenthe government's capacity to managewater resourcesand
address environmental concerns andto improve irrigationefficiency inselectedirrigation
schemes intwo basins. The project outcome was rated satisfactory and sustainability likely.
The Basin approachwas found to be valuable inbringingto the fore basinlevel issues such
as abstractionsupstreamandstartingto resolve water allocation conflicts.

The ProgrammaticStructuralAdjustment Credit (PSAC 1) 1 FY 00 (US$190.0 m) The
primaryobjective was to supportgovernment's strategyofreducingpoverty through
structural reforms andprivate sector development andreducing the cost o f doingbusiness. It
includedthe divestiture ofkeypublic enterprisesandwas expectedto improvethe
effectivenessindeliveryo fpublic services. Itincluded improvement inthe budgeting
procedures for agriculture researchandextension andsupportedthe divestiture ofthe
remaining cashewnut processingplantsandstate farms. The project was rated satisfactory by
the ICR. There were substantialdelays inthe reformsteps partlybecausethe borrower and
Bankhadnot worked closely enough so that allplayers hlly understoodandagreedthe steps
neededto achievethe objectives. (See the later argument made about the general weakness in
detailedplanningofsteps andphasing.)

                                               60                                Annex A


 The two Poverty ReductionSupport Credits 1 and 2 (PRSC) FY 03 andFY 05 (US$132.0
 andUS$150.0 m)These were two o f a series ofthree PRSCswith the first two being
 subjectedto only the simplified ICR. The objective was to support the poverty reduction
 strategy andparticularly to improve private sector developmentandpublic sector
 management.The projects supported the preparationofthe Agriculture Sector Development
 Program. A mainfocus inagriculture was onthe removal o fthe remaining institutional
 constraints and improvement o f quality andproductivity andreduction ofmarketingcosts.
 IEGconsiders ittoo early to draw lessonsfrom this unfinishedseries. However, IEG
 expressedsome concerninits ICRReview aboutthe suitability o f outcome indicators for the
 final assessment. There was only limitedevidence so far on achievement o f indicators
 including some evidence of greater success inschoolexaminations andsome on decreased
 food insecurity.

 OngoingProjects

 TheForest Conservationand Management Project (US$3 1.1 m) was expectedto initiate an
 integratedbiodiversity conservation strategy for the EasternArc Mountains and strengthen
Tanzania's capacityto coordinate forest biodiversity conservation. It supports institutional
change andimproved service delivery including strengtheningthe capacity ofthe Tanzania
Forest Service. Itis partly funded by GEF. A framework will be developedto involvethe
private sector inthe management o f existingplantations. Additionally, the project will
finance mappingfor inventories o f state-ownedplantations. Alternative management systems
for selectedindustrialplantations will be piloted, emphasizing M&E. Institutional reforms
for biodiversity conservation will be supported, including pilot community-based
conservation, andthe development o f sustainable financing for highforest conservation.

TheLower Kihansi Environmental Management Project (US$6.3 m) aims at ensuring long-
term conservation ofthe Kihansi Gorge ecosystem. At the national level, the project supports
the development ofa legaland institutional framework for environmental, andwater
resourcesmanagement.There are four components: habitat and species conservation, and
management; establishmento f final water rights; implementationof anupdated
environmental managementplan; and, institutional strengthening. A major risk is the .
increasedpower demandsinTanzania, which may limit the Tanzania Electric Supply
Company's ability to provide sufficient bypasswater flows to conservethe gorge ecosystem.

TheParticipatory Agricultural Development and EmpowermentProject (US$56.6 m) seeks
to raise the production o ffood, incomes, andassets inabout 840 villages ina sustainable
mannerthroughthe implementation o fsmall agricultural development subprojects planned
andmanagedby community members. The objective will beachieved by: (i)        empowering
self-selectedrural communities and farmer groups to select sustainableandprofitable
technologies; (ii)sharingofcosts bythe public sector andparticipants andthus sharingrisks;
(iii)enhancingdemandfor products and services provided by the private sector inrural areas
by encouragingsavings; (iv) promotingimproved landandcrop husbandrypractices; (v)
supporting the ongoing decentralization process; and(vi) partiallyfinancing maintenance
and/or construction ofroads, bridges, andother subprojectsto improve access to markets.

 The Tanzania Marine and Coastal Environment Management Project (US$5 1.O m) aimsto
 strengthenthe sustainablemanagementanduseof the borrower's Exclusive Economic Zone
 andcoastal resourcesresulting inenhancedrevenue, reducedthreatsto the environment,
 better livelihoods for coastalcommunities and improved institutional arrangements. The
 project consists ofthe following components: (i)  support for a common governance regime
 for the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); (ii)   support for a comprehensivesystemof
 managedmarineareas building on IntegratedCoastal Management(ICM) strategiesthat
 empower communities; (iii)   supportto coastalcommunities for sub-projectsthat contribute
to improved livelihoods andsustainableecosystemmanagement; and, (iv) provision o f
 efficient project implementation services. There is a GEF component.

 TheAgricultural Sector Development Project (US$90.0 m) i s a large basket funding project
withsupport from anumberofdonors. Someaspectswere discussedearlier. The two
objectives are: (a) to enable farmers to havebetteraccess to agricultural knowledge,
technologies, marketing systemsandinfrastructure as a meansto higher productivity,
profitability, and farm incomes; and (b) to promote agricultural private investment basedon
animprovedregulatory andpolicy environment. There are two components: (i) Level  Local
Support to improve agricultural service delivery; the quality ofagricultural investments; and
the localpolicy andregulatory environment for private investment inagriculture; and(ii)
National Level Supportto improve the responsivenessand quality o f agricultural research
andpolicy, to carry out preparatorywork andinvestment innational levelirrigationthrough
public-private partnerships, to improve food security andsector coordination, andto
stimulate agricultural markets andprivate sector development.

Table 6 givesthe ICRReviewratings ofclosedprojects. Briefly, these indicate a generally
above average level ofperformance except for the Financial Sector Project. However, with
the findings ofthe PPARs inthis report, the ratings for threeprojects inthe table change. In
two o fthose projects there isparticular concernabout Risk to Development Outcome, a
rating that replacedthe Sustainability rating quoted inthe table.

Table 7 shows the current ratings for the five on-going agriculture projects. The last, the
large basket funding sector project, has only recently becomeeffective. Obviously, with such
a small sample atrend assessment would not be valid. Briefly, the following are the main
characteristics of eachproject.

Borrower comments or) Second AgriculturalResearch Project(Credit 3036) IEG
Report, prepared by Dr. J.M. Haki, Director of ResearchDepartment

We wish to acknowledgereceiptof the reportby your group on the aboveproject. Ihave gone through it
quite thoroughly and havejust a few comments to make on your findings. Firstlet me start by
commendingthe team for managingto come out with very valuable observations in a very short time.
GenerallyIam in agreementwith most of your observationson the performanceof the Projectand
particularlyon the fact that with the existing weak extension service in the country it would not have been
possible for the benefitsof the researchprojectto reach a wider numberof resource-poorfarmers and
that research resources were in most cases stretchedto performthe extensionfunction. However I
somehowfail to understandwhy you say there has been littlefocus on legumesin the projectconsidering
their role as fertilizers and on human nutrition. Forthe record, more than 5 varietiesof beans, 4 of pigeon
peas, 3 cowpea and one soybeanvarieties were released and disseminatedacrossthe country.

Ialso concur with the observationthat the apparent Institutionalstrengtheningthat occurredduring
implementationwould have neededsustainablefunding after projectcompletionto sustain the positive
linkageswith all partners.This is now beingaddressed. Furthermore,the negative impact of the Bank
procurementand disbursementproceduresduring implementationplayeda significantrole in the
inadequateperformanceof the project, as you correctly noted.

The issue of crop cess abolition, is of grave concern to all of us. However,as may know, this decision
was forced on the Governmentby the DPs, specifically the Bank and the EU as a conditionalityfor GBS
access. We are all very muchaware of the positive impact this cess contributionwas havingon the cash
crodresearch and developmentwhich has now been negatively impacted. Incidentallyit was the same
Bank which aggressively advocatedfor the establishmentof private stakeholderowned and managed
research institutes.These same institutes are now competing for the same resourcesfrom the Ministry's
ceiling with the other food crop commodities.!!!

We look forward to receivingyour final report.

Ithink theconsultantsdid a goodjob as pertermsof reference.

However,as a generalcommentthey evaluatedthe projectagainstthe indicatorsthatwere notplannedfor.
That is the projectwas notwell designedto deliverthe main projectbenefits. The projectsustainability was
not inbuiltintheprojectmethodology and approach. For it iswell knownthat inAfrica mostprojectthat are
based on Participatory Approaches have been found to be sustainable and significantly help project
participants meet their objectives (Refer to: Sicilima, Nicodemus P., (1996). Factors Associated with
Farmers' Participation in Agricultural Extension Programs in Tanzania. Ph.D. dissertation, The
Universityof Wisconsin    -Madison.  U.S.A.)




For those areas that were well designed the project did deliver very well. Unfortunately,the assessment
doesn't clearly show that. For examplethe project did very well in capacity buildingwith regard to training.
Morethan 75%of extensionistswere trainingthroughfunding by NALERPand NAEP II(diploma level, BSc

and MSc). After NAEPII,trainingfor extensionworkers hasbeena nightmare. Additionally, mor6than 80%
of the vehicles usedbyextensionworkers particularlyat districtand regionallevelwere purchasedthrough
NAEPIIfunding. NAEPIIalsohada strongcomponent fortrainingfarmer/farmersgroupsthroughfieldvisits,
residentialtraining,field days and study tours.

On the other hand, the projectdid very poorly on empowering farmers analyse their problems, designand
implementinterventionsto improvetheirsituation. That ishappeningunder PADEPwith significantimpacton
increasingproductivity, productionandfamily incomes.

At farm levelone canobserve NAEP II impactas now manyfarmersare awareof the basiccrop husbandry
practices. Many farmers have adopted recommendationsthat do not require any cash outlay or external
inputseg. planting in lines.
