Several lessons of both a\n            substantive and procedural nature have emerged from this\n            review: (1) There needs to be an explicit logical link\n            between the strategic and sectoral goals of the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the proposed lending program;\n            (2) Institutional capacity analysis could be strengthened\n            and broadened and chronic problems that persist in a sector\n            over long periods of time should result in more analytical\n            work by the Bank; (3) In policy research, there needs to be\n            a balance between shorter-term client-oriented adaptive\n            research and longer-term core applied research and this\n            needs to be embedded in a regional approach; (4) The Bank\n            needs to be more realistic in projecting timescales for\n            agricultural reforms; and (5) The Bank and the borrowers\n            should be more realistic about the likelihood of funds saved\n            from the down-sizing of a public institution being applied\n            to future operating costs."}, "docdt": "2007-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
