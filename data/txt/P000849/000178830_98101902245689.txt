REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR A SECOND COCOA PROJECT
1.           I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Ghana for the equivalent of US$14 million to help
finance a second cocoa project. The loan would have a term of 30 years,
including 8 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. About
US$6   million of the proceeds of the loan would be relent to cocoa farmers
for 18 years, including 6 years of grace at not less than 8 percent per
annum. The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (ABEDIA) is con-
sidering a loan of US$5 million equivalent to help finance additional cocoa
replanting and rehabilitation in the same area.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.           An economic report entitled "Fiscal and Balance of Payments
Aspects of Ghana's Development" (638a-GH) dated May 19, 1975, was distributed
to the Executive Directors in June 1975. A report on Ghana's industrial
sector (465a-GH) dated October 25, 1974, has also been distributed to the
Executive Directors. A summary of basic data on the economy is presented
in Annex I.
General Background
3.           Ghana enjoys a high standard of living compared with most other
West African nations, as its annual per capita GNP was about US$300 in 1973.
Government policy is aimed at attaining the growth potential of the country's
major resources, including cocoa--it is the world's largest producer--timber,
manganese, gold, and electric power. However, over the past decade and a
half GDP growth averaged about 2.5 percent per annum and failed to keep pace
with the growth of population. Export growth was slow (2.3 percent per annum)
and depended almost entirely on a few traditional export commodities--cocoa,
gold and timber. In addition to contributing 60 percent of the country's
export earnings, cocoa provided around 30 percent of government revenue and
employed upwards of 20 percent of the labor force. The 1960s witnessed a
declining trend for cocoa production and rapidly growing imports of food
and raw materials for industry. Although the industrial development strategy
of the early 1960s broadened the industrial base, industry depended heavily
on imported inputs and generally had low domestic value added content. This
strategy of the sixties resulted in recurrent balance of payments crises and
an accumulation of external debt.
4.           The economic and social policy of the early 1960s rested on
extensive involvement of the Government in the provision of a wide range
of social services, in the setting up of a large number of state enterprises



- 2 -
and in allocating resources through an extensive system of physical and
financial controls. Since the mid-1960s, there has been a growing imbalance
in public finances due to rapid growth of budget current expenditure, slow
growth in budget revenue and uneconomic operations of several government
enterprises. The imbalance depressed government development expenditure to
an inadequate level and was also a persistent source of inflationary pressure.
5.           After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports
are gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of most of these
minerals is stagnating or declining, mainly because of depletion of the ore
reserves. With regard to bauxite, however, a proposal for the opening of a
new mine to produce bauxite for local reduction to alumina to supply the
existing aluminum smelter i$ un,der study. Ghana imports its entire oil
requirements, most of it in the form of crude oil which is refined domestically.
Oil is used chiefly as a source of fuel for the transport sector. Oil explora-
tion is being carried out offshore and in the Volta Basin, but commercially
exploitable reserves have not yet been discovered. Hydroelectric power meets
most of Ghana's energy requirements.
6.           Despite poor performance of the economy during most of the 1960s,
Ghana's development is well advanced in some respects. The education system
is well established, elementary education has been free and universal since
1962, and public health facilities are fairly widespread and further expansion
favors rural areas. It is the declared policy of the Government to achieve a
more equitable income distribution by increasing productive investments in the
rural areas, by expanding low cost rural housing and water supply and by improv-
ing feeder roads.
Recent Developments
7.           Overall GDP growth in 1974 was 6.5 percent, up from 0.5 percent
in 1972 and 2.6 percent in 1973.   General guidelines have been issued for a
five-year Development Plan covering the-period 1975-1980 while a more detailed
plan for that period is being prepared. The Plan's target GDP growth rate is
an average of 5.5 percent per annum. Since 1972 a reorientation of economic
policy has taken place. A three-phase "Operation Feed Yourself" program was
started by the new Government in 1972; Phase I aims to achieve self-sufficiency
in basic foods such as rice, maize, cassava and plantain; Phase II is to bring
about self-sufficiency in agricultural raw materials for industry; and Phase III
will focus on expanding agricultural exports. Production by small-holders is
being encouraged alongside large scale mechanized farming. In food production
considerable progress had been made by 1974, particularly in rice and maize,
but the crucial cocoa sector has failed to show similar progress. In industry,
the Goverment's policy is to discourage the excessive use of capital through
the levying of duties on imported capital goods and the granting of an employ-
ment tax credit.
8.           Public Finance.   Although in recent budgets the Government has
successfully expanded non-cocoa revenue, thus gradually reducing its reliance
on fluctuating income from cocoa, current expenditure has risen more rapidly
than total revenue. With a limited inflow of external capital the Government



-3-
has had to borrow extensively from the Bank of Ghana to finance development
expenditure,and this, along with general world inflation, has been a major
factor contributing to the high rate of domestic inflation. The national
cost of living index rose by 18 percent in 1973 and 1974, a rate of increase
almost double that of 1971 and 1972, and comparing unfavorably with the rate
of 2.4 percent a year in the late 1960s. In its 1975/76 budget the Government
introduced a number of bold and far-reaching measures to expand revenues and
to limit reliance on inflationary borrowings. The revenue measures include
increases in import and excise duties on a wide range of commodities, and of
personal income tax; charges of public utilities (water rates and telecom-
munications tariffs) have also been increased. Also, the Government announced
stringent measures to restrict the growth of current expenditure to 10 percent
in nominal terms. In July 1975 minimum bank deposit rates were increased from
5 to 7.5 percent and maximum lending rates increased by 2.5 percentage points
(to 8.5 percent for agriculture with flexibility for higher rates when financial
cost of funds dictates, and 12.5 percent for other sectors). The budget also
reflects the Government's determination to maintain a high level of develop-
ment expenditure, but a substantial part of this public investment program
will still have to be financed by credit creation.
9.           Balance of Payments.   Strict control of imports, coupled with
favorable price developments for cocoa, gold and timber, led to a strong
improvement in the balance of payments and the reserve position during 1972
and 1973. This recovery ended abruptly in 1974 when a serious breakdown in
the import licensing system together with the impact of higher oil prices
sharply pushed up imports and caused an acute balance of payments crisis,
reducing Ghana's net external reserves to only a few weeks import cover by
the end of the year. Since September 1974, the Government has introduced
a series of measures to restrict imports which are producing considerable
improvement. Reserves increased considerably, to a gross amount of US$192
million by the end of September 1975, partly as a result of a drawing on the
IMF oil facility, but given the trend in world cocoa prices it appears unlikely
that the current account of the balance of payments will show a surplus in 1975.
10.          External Debt.   An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of
Ghana's medium-term external debt was concluded in March 1974. Under this
agreement, all payments due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966
debt obligations will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace
period of 10 years, with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. This
agreement was the result of more than two years of negotiations between Ghana
and the creditor countries in which the good offices of the Bank were provided.
Following Ghana's review of the validity of the contracts underlying the debts
in question, a final settlement has now been reached with all the creditor
countries that signed the March 1974 agreement.
11.          To achieve the goal of eliminating all pre-1972 trade credit
arrears by 1977, Ghana paid US$54.0 million in 1973 and a further US$21.3
million in 1974, mainly in the first half of the year. With the sharp fall
in reserves, payments slowed down and new arrears totaling US$26.3 million
were accumulated, but were eliminated by mid-April 1975. By the end of
September 1975, total outstanding trade credit arrears amounted to US$90.9
million. The authorities intend to resume payments as soon as external



- 4 -
reserves permit and to adhere as much as possible to the 1977 target.
Other potential obligations include outstanding applications for remittance
of profits and dividends estimated at US$111 million. In addition, the
Government has undertaken to pay compensation for the increased equity it
has acquired in several foreign private investments. The amounts are still
inder negotiation.
Prospects
12.          The recent measures on the balance of payments and the budget
reflect improved economic management and illustrate a willingness on the
part of the Government to adopt unpopular measures. Medium-term projections
indicate that the external resource constraint, which hampered Ghana's develop-
ment in the past, will remain severe. Reliance on cocoa will continue for a
considerable time as diversification can proceed only gradully, but with
cocoa production expanding slowly at best, there is a need for a substantial
net inflow of external aid, roughly in the order of US$160 million annually
over the next several years, if the overall growth target of 5 to 6 percent
is to be met. The current external debt service ratio is under 5 percent
and is expected to rise to around 8 percent towards the end of the decade.
The Bank Group's share of Ghana's total external debt is currently about
13 percent and is expected to rise to about 15 percent over the next several
years. The Bank Group's proportion of Ghana's external debt service payments
in 1974 was abnormally high at 25 percent because of the suspension of pay-
ments on most suppliers' credits pending the negotiation of bilateral agree-
ments. By the end of the decade it is expected to be around 10 percent.
Ghana should be considered creditworthy for additional Bank lending in
these circumstances. Where appropriate from the point of view of the
project, and particularly in the agricultural sector where direct foreign
exchange costs tend to be low, some financing of local costs is considered
reasonable in view of the country's difficult financial position and the
measures recently taken by the Government to improve the fiscal situation
(see paragraph 8).
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
13.          Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation
in Ghana, the Bank has made three loans amounting to US$76 million for the
Volta dam and associated infrastructure works for electricity generation
and for a telecommunications project; IDA has extended 11 credits totaling
US$86 million -- 5 for agriculture (including livestock and fisheries), 2
for water supply and sewerage, 2 for power distribution and 2 for highways.
Annex II contains a summary statement of loans and credits as of October 31,
1975 with notes on the execution of ongoing projects. There are no IFC
investments.
14.          Ghana is currently engaged in restructuring its economy, with
the principal objective of reducin- dependence on imports generally, achieving
greater self-sufficiency in agricultural products, particularly food, expanding
cocoa production for export and improving its infrastructure support for an
expanding economy. The main thrust of the Bank Croup's operations in Ghana
is to assist the Government in achieving these objectives, with emphasis on
institution-building and training of Ghanaian nationals for project preparation



- 5 -
and improved implementation. Thus, in addition to the proposed project to
assist replanting of cocoa in the Ashanti region and support Government's
measures to revitalize the industry, a development finance company project
and a second highway project have been negotiated; all these projects are
scheduled to be considered by Executive Directors in December.
15.           The Bank Group is also assisting the Government to strengthen
the power sector which is based on the development of Ghana's hydroelectric
potential. A power distribution project is under appraisal and this may be
followed by further investments in the Volta River generation system for
which Canadian consultants recently completed a feasibility study. The
Government has expressed a strong commitment to attain self-sufficiency in
food and to assist the small farmers increase productivity, and a rural
development project directly affecting about 500,000 people in the Upper
Region is under appraisal. Following the recent Annual Meeting of Governors
of the Bank, the Government has requested assistance in designing and implement-
ing projects to help the urban poor. With UNDP assistance a small-industries
project is being prepared for possible Bank Group assistance, and a Bank
mission will review with Government in early December its urban development
program.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN GHANA
16.          Agriculture accounts for about 50 percent of Ghana's GDP and
more than 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings; it employs close to
60 percent of the labor force. About 80 percent of the land is held under
a "communal" or tribal system, and production is characterized primarily
by a large number of individual smallholders; most farmers participate in
the cash economy. There has been a significant net rural-urban migration
in recent years.
17.          Of the total land area of 56 million acres, an estimated 6
million acres are used for crop and another 6 million acres are under
forest and woodlands; a further 20 million acres could be brought under
economic production. The climate is suitable for a variety of crops. The
natural pasture of the savannah area, covering nearly 70 percent of the
country and particularly suitable for cattle grazing, could support a much
larger number of animals than at present. Ghana, with the cooperation of
Australia, Canada and the Bank, is engaged in pilot programs to exploit this
potential source of protein.
18.          Agricultural productivity is low;    value added in agriculture
is estimated at 0420 per worker, compared with an average of 0855 elsewhere
in the economy. Production m'thods are mostly traditional using primitive
implements. Except for perennial crops, shifting cultivation is practiced.
Land is cultivated extensively except in the densely populated parts of the
country where continuous cropping is applied.



19.          The establishment of large-scale mechanized farms in the
1960s, neglect of small traditional farms and unfavorable prices for
agricultural products caused output to lag behind demand, resulting in
large and growing foods imports. Realizing this, the Government launched
the "Operation Feed Yourself" program in February 1972 (details in paragraph
7). The Government is encouraging agricultural production by subsidizing
credit and farm inputs, guaranteeing minimum producer prices and granting a
five-year tax holiday to farmers and agricultural enterprises. These
incentives have attracted considerable new investments in farms.
Cocoa Sub-Sector
Early Years
20.          The production of cocoa in Ghana was initiated in the late
1890s by indigenous Eastern Region farmers whose primary occupation was
production and trade in palm products and rubber. As cocoa became increas-
ingly profitable, investment in its production by local entrepreneurs
expanded in Ashanti, Western and Volta Regions. Cocoa accounted for nearly
50 percent of Ghana's export earnings in 1911 and average annual exports
increased from about 100,000 tons during 1916-1920 to about 260,000 tons
during 1936-40. About 10 percent of the total population earned its income
from direct employment in the production and marketing of cocoa.
21.          The rising prosperity of cocoa farmers helped to stimulate
domestic production of food and consumer goods such as clothing, drinks
and tobacco. The opening up of land for cocoa led initially to increased
food production since the plantains and cocoyams planted as nurse crops
provided additional supplies of these major staple foods.
Present State
22.          Cocoa presently covers some 3.0-4.5 million acres and accounts
for one-third of the total cultivated land area in Ghana. About one quarter
of the total population or 2.5 million people are directly involved in cocoa
farming. Cocoa accounted for 62 percent of foreign exchange earnings on
average between 1971 and 1973 and provided about 33 percent of Government
current revenues as compared to about 16 percent in the mid-sixties.
23.          Over the past decade cocoa production in Ghana has declined,
while that of other African countries has increased. Ghana's share of world
production, which rose from 29 percent during the 1950s to 36 percent during
the first half of the 1960s, slipped to an estimated 25 percent in 1974. In
volume terms, Ghana's average annual production declined from about 450,000
tons during 1960/61-1964/65 to about 400,000 tons during 1965/66-1972/73 and
was about 350,000 tons in the 1973/74 crop year. This decline appears to
have been due to five principal factors: (1) low producer prices that
inhibit maximization of production from existing trees and discourage new
investments, particularly for replanting of areas having low yielding overaged
trees; (2) lack of effective technical assistance to farmers; (3) inadequacy
of the farm inpurt delivery system and of imported inputs; (4) unfavorable



- 7 -
age profile of cocoa trees due to an excessive component of overaged trees;
and (5) lack of an overall development plan for the cocoa sector.
24.          Of the above factors the most pressing is the one relating to
adequate incentives and return to cocoa farmers. In real terms return per
acre has been declining in Ghana and this affects the farmers' capacity to
hire labor (which accounts for 90 percent of the cost of production at
maturity) to work on the cocoa farms. Even though a major part of the
cocoa is grown by small holders--there are absentee farmers in the Eastern
Region--the family labor has to be supplemented during periods of peak
farming activities. Extensive discussions have been held with the Government
to resolve the dilemma between granting adequate incentives to farmers through
higher producer prices and the revenue effect of such price increase, at least
in the short run, on the already precarious fiscal situation. Unless the
Ghanaian economy is diversified and a broader tax base developed, cocoa tax
will remain a major source of Government revenue; at the same time, unless
the declining trend in production is reversed, the Government will face an
even greater problem in the long run. The producer prices were doubled
between 1971 and 1975, rising to ¢ 596 per ton in May 1975. However, costs
have also risen rapidly in recent years and present producer prices still
do not offer sufficient incentives to farmers. The problem of the Government in
raising the prices further immediately has been acc_ntuated by the recent
sharp downward trend in world price for cocoa (New York prices declined from
107 cents per lb. in July 1974 to 74 cents per lb. in July 1975). However,
the Government will review producer prices annually for the next few years
with a view to providing farmers with adequate incentives to raise production.
25.          The Government is aware of the critical importance of cocoa
in the Ghanaian economy, and some of the other measures it has initiated
to arrest the decline are summarized below:
(a)   In an attempt partially to compensate farmers for low
producer prices, the Government is subsidizing key
inputs--fertilizer, insecticides and sprayers. Farmers
who have access to fertilizer pay only about 55 percent
of its import costs, while the corresponding subsidies
for insecticides and sprayers amount to about 90 and 80
percent, respectively. Under the project, the Government
will provide credit to producers at about 8 percent per
annum, absorbing the differential between this and the
Bank's lending rate and also the cost of administering
the credit operations (details in paragraph 42).
(b)   The Government established a National Cocoa Production
Committee in May 1974. Its main objective is to examine
ways of arresting the declining trend in production and
of retrieving some of Ghana's lost share in the world
market. Specifically, the committee has been charged
with the responsibility of looking into such problems as
old and low-yielding cocoa trees, pest and disease



- 8 -
infestation, lack of investment: in cocoa farms and
smuggling to neighboring countries. In addition, a new
Ministry of Cocoa Affairs was created in February 1975
with primary responsibility for production, including
rehabilitation, replanting and provision of extension
services.
(c)   The Government, with the assistance of external aid
agencies, is financing rehabilitation and replanting of
existing cocoa areas.
26.          As a part of the proposed project the Government will conduct
an overall survey of the cocoa sector with a view to establishing a compre-
hensive development plan for the sector (Section 3.01 (d) and Schedule 6
of the Loan Agreement). The Government has also agreed that,by the end of
1976, it will submit to the Bank; (i) a proposed statement on its producer
pricing policy; and (ii) a study of the financial arrangements for, and
availability and distribution of inputs. In the meantime the Government has
undertaken to give high priority to cocoa sector inputs in allocating import
licenses and foreign exchange to ensure that, as far as possible, such inputs
are made available when required by the farmers (see supplemental letter).
27.          The proposed project was included in the list of projects in
the pipeline in the Bank report "The World Cocoa Market--Review and Outlook
for Bank Lending" (R74-36 of February 22, 1974). The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) was consulted on the prospects of the future world cocoa
market and on the probable impact of the anticipated Bank Group projects;
FAO considered the long-term market outlook for cocoa to be favorable for
t:he expansion of production. The International Cocoa Organization has also
been consulted and has supported the proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.          About 50 percent of Ghanaian cocoa is produced in the two
neighboring regions of Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo, most of it by small holders.
Ashanti has been growing cocoa since 1900; its climate and soils are well
suited for cocoa production; cocoa growing has traditionally been a way of
life there and a process of capital formation in a land surplus economy.
However, presently considerable parts of the plantations are over age and
extensive replantation is necessary to maintain production in the region.
1.4 m'illion acres in three zones--Mampong, Konongo and Bekwai (see map)--
will comprise the project area, in which 30,000 acres will be replanted in
the next three years with the assistance under the project. The population
density is 400 per square mile in Konongo, 300 in Mampong and 200 in Bekwai,
and availability of labor for implementating the project should not be a
problem; women outnumber men both in the labor force and as farm owners.



- 9 -
29.          The Bank Group first assisted Ghana's cocoa industry in 1970
through a US$8.5 million Development Credit (205-GH) to help finance the
rehabilitation of 51,000 acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa in
the Eastern Region. Progress on project execution has been slow due, among
other reasons, to damage to seedlings caused by draught in 1973, poor farmer
response and limited availability of labor. Consequently, by the end of the
1973/74 cocoa season only 14,000 acres of cocoa were replanted and 15,000
acres rehabilitated against targets of 27,900 and 51,000 acres respectively.
Because of cost overruns, modifications to the original project targets are
currently being worked out.
30.          The proposed project was prepared by the Cocoa Marketing Board
with the assistance of the Bank. The report entitled "Appraisal of Ashanti
Region Cocoa Project: Ghana" (No. 827a-GH), dated November 18, 1975 which is
being distributed separately, is based on the findings of a Bank pre-appraisal
mission which visited Ghana in October/November 1974, supplemented by a sub-
sequent updating mission. Negotiations were held in Washington from October
20 to 31, 1975, with a Ghanaian delegation led by Ghana's Ambassador to the
United States. A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III.
Project Description
31.          The project would be the first phase of a program to revitalize
the cocoa industry in the Ashanti Region; it should be seen as part of a
long-term cocoa development program. In view of its sector characteristics,
some of the loan conditions include the study and implementation by the
Government of macro-level policy changes which should have a widespread
impact on the cocoa sector as a whole (see paragraphs 25 and 26). The main
components of the project would include:
(a)   provision of credit to small holder cocoa farmers for
hiring labor and provision of farm inputs in kind for
replanting and maintaining their farms during the project
period;
(b)   training farmers and project staff in modern cocoa
production techniques and practices;
(c)   provision of equipment for maintenance of feeder roads
and the planning of future feeder road improvements;
(d)   provision of funds for project evaluation, and
(e)   establishment of a project unit within the Ministry of
Cocoa Affairs to plan and manage the project.
32.          The aforementioned project replanting would be spread over three
years and the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed during this period. As
cocoa takes about four years to come into bearing, an additional four years
would be needed to maintain all 30,000 acres to maturity, extending the



- 10 -
project development period to seven years, as the following schedule
illustrates:
Additional time required to
Bank Loan                  bring all plantings
disbursement period                 to maturity
Project Year (PY)         1        2         3        4        5        6        7
Replanting (acres)      4,000   10,000   16,000       -        -        -        -
Maintenance (acres)              4,000    14,000   30,000   30,000   26,000    16,000
The rationale for confining the proposed loan to the first 3 years' dis-
bursements lies in the fact that inflation in Ghana currently is running
close to 20 percent per annum; this makes estimating costs over a seven
year period subject to much error, would require the inclusion in project
costs of an inordinately high provision for price contingencies, and would
result, in the case of a seven year disbursement period, in the tying up
of a very large proportion of the Bank loan for a long period of time (the
commitment charges paid by Ghana would be correspondingly heavy). The
Government has assured the Bank that the additional cost required to main-
tain all project plantings till full maturity (that is in project years
4 to 7), estimated at about $28 million, will be fully met between the
farmers and the Government (see paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 o-f the Loan
Agreement).
Project Execution
33.          The proposed project would be executed by a Project Unit which
has been established within ghe Ministry of Cocoa Affairs, and is headed by
a competent project manager.   The Project Unit would be responsible for
locating and motivating farmers, assessing their creditworthiness, supplying
credit, marketing cocoa through cooperatives or the Produce Buying Agency
(a limited liability company wholly owned by the Cocoa Marketing Board and
licensed as a buying agent), and providing technical advice and supervision.
In addition to the project manager, the Project Unit would have the following
key managment personnel -- a deptuy project manager, a financial controller,
who has already been appointed, an administration officer, a project accountant,
a credit officer, an internal, auditor, a cooperative officer, and an engineering
superintendent -- all of whom would probably be Ghanaian.
34.          In order to allow maximum flexibility in the replanting program,
the selection of a specific area for project activities would depend on the
response of the farmers in that area. Initially project activities would
be confined to specified areas in the three zones of Bekwai, Konongo and
Mampong. Once the potential of these areas has been realized, project
activities would be expanded to other areas within the zones.



Participating Farmers
35.          In order to obviate the problem of absentee landlords which
has arisen under the ongoing Eastern Region Cocoa Project (Credit 205-GH),
and in keeping with the Government's policy to achieve a more equitable
distribution of income and project benefits, special care would be exercised
in selecting participating farmers. Thus, to qualify for credit and other
assistnace under the project, in addition to normal creditworthiness criteria,
a farmer should (a) reside on or near the farm and be prepared to actively
work there; (b) have the ability to obtain the guarantee of a cooperative
society or the Produce Buying Agency, and (c) establish his proprietary
interest in the land to be replanted to the satisfaction of the Project Unit.
Further, inorder to insure that as many farmers as possible particiapte in
the project, participants would be eligible for credit to replant up to a
maximum of 5 acres each during the project period. It is estimated that up
to 10,000 farmers would be assisted under the project. Seeds for the replant-
ing program would be obrained from seed gardens at Bunso, Apedwa, Fumso and
Kwadaso.
Credit Administration
36.          Each eligible farmer would enter into a credit agreement with
the project unit, with the farmer's cooperative union, or the Produce Buying
Agency (PBA), as the case may be, acting as guarantor. The agreement would
require that all cocoa produced under the replanting program .would be sold
to the farmer's cooperative or the PBA. This would ensure timely recovery
of credit out of the proceeds of the sale. The cooperatives and the PBA
would be provided with adequate funds to buy cocoa from participating
farmers. The project unit would be required to make payments to the Government
as it receives sub-loan repayments from farmers.
Training
37.          Ghana was in the forefront in initiating research into cocoa
cultivation and through the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana has developed
improved high yield varieties of cocoa and improved techniques for farm
operations. The two developments most widely used are improved varieties
and capsid pest control. The proposed loan would include funds for short-
term training courses for participating farmers in improved cultivation
practices for growing the high yield hybrid cocoa varieties to be introduced
under the project. Management training would also be provided either in
Ghana or outside the country for project unit staff.
Feeder Roads
38.          Funds would be provided under the proposed loan for the pro-
curement of equipment for maintaining and improving feeder roads in the
project area by the Ghana Highway Authority, a statutory body responsible for
all public roads in the country. To supplement feeder road studies already
under way under an ongoing Bank Group-financed roads project, the project
includes a detailed study of feeder road requirments in the project area,
taking into consideration projected levels of crop production.

Project Monitoring and Evaluation
39.          A special feature of the proposed project - an aspect in which
it differs from the ongoing Eastern Region Cocoa project - is the provision
for project monitoring and evaluation. This would be carried out by the
Institute for Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) of the
University of Ghana, Legon. Under an agreement with the Ministry of Cocoa
Affairs, the Institute would conduct base line surveys in the project area,
monitor the progress and impact of the project, including farmer response to
changes in producer price, and submit annual assessment reports to the project
unit, including recommendations for changes where necessary. Under the loan
agreement ISSER would also complete the evaluation of the Eastern Region
Cocoa project.
Project Costs and Financing
40.          Total project costs, spread over the replanting period of three
years, are estimated at US$21.9 million, including duties and taxes estimated
at US$0.1 million and a foreign exchange component of US$5.3 million, or about
24 percent of total costs. Costs include a 5 percent physical contingency on
all costs, and compounded pric:e contingencies ranging from 18 to 12 percent
between 1975 and 1978/79 on labor and salaries,and from 12 to 8 percent on
equipment and materials, etc., over the same period. Details of project
costs are presented in Annex III.
41.          The proposed Bank loan of US$14.0 million would finance 64
percent of total project costs, or 100 percent of the foreign exchange
component and 53 percent of local costs. The Government of Ghana would
finance the balance of the cost of the project, estimated at US$7.8 million,
or 36 percent of total costs. A financing plan is presented in Annex III.
The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (ABEDIA) is considering a
loan in the equivalent of US$5 million to the Government of Ghana to finance
additional cocoa replanting/rehabilitation in the same project area within
the project period. The ABEDIA loan, if approved, would help finance an
additional 10,000 to 12,000 acres of replanting/rehabilitation, and there
should be no serious difficulty in expanding the capacity of the Project Unit
to handle this.
Relending Terms
42.          About US$6 million out of the proceeds of the Bank loan and the
Government's contribution would be relent to farmers for 18 years, including
6 years of grace, at an annual interest rate of not less than 8 percent, for
hiring labor and for the provision of some farm inputs in kind. The adminis-
trative cost of relending to farmers and also the subsidy implicit in the
negative spread between the relending rate and the interest rate on the proposed
loan would be borne by the Government. This is considered reasona')te because
of the heavy tax burden borne by cocoa farmers and the low producer pricus
presently prevailing in the country.

Procurement Arrangements
43.          Procurement of vehicles and feeder road equipment ($1.3 million)
and spraying machines ($1.1 million) would be through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. A preference of 15 percent, or
the applicable level of tariff protection, whichever is lower, would be applied
to bids from Ghanaian manufacturers. Insecticides, estimated at $0.9 million,
would be procured by negotiated contract with suppliers. Contracts of less
than $20,000 which cannot be bulked for purposes of international competitive
bidding would be awarded on the basis of local competition in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts worth less than $5,000
would be let in accordance with appropriate local competitive bidding procedures.
Disbursements
44.          The proposed loan would be disbursed over three years (FY76-FY78)
and would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of sprayers,
feeder roads and Project Unit equipment and vehicles;    90 percent of the
total cost of seedlings, loans to farmers and project evaluation; 100
percent of the foreign exchange cost or 80 percent of the local cost of
insecticides; 100 percent of 'foreign expenditures or 90 percent of local
expenditures on technical assistance;   and 40 percent of total expenditures
on Project Unit staff salaries. A detailed disbursement schedule is presented
in Annex III.
Benefits and Justification
45.          The project is an important phase of the Government's program
to increase the production of cocoa, Ghana's leading export commodity and
foreign exchange earner and single most important source of Government revenue.
The project would increase cocoa production by 10,000 tons annually with a gross
foreign exchange value of US$10.8 million when the new trees reach full bearing.
At full maturity government revenues derived from the project would be 02.8
million (US$2.4 million) during the servicing of the Bank loan and ¢3.1 million
(US$2.7 million) thereafter. Further, the project would have a significant impact
on the level of economic activity in Ashanti through its multiplier effects.
46.          The project would benefit about 10,000 farm families involving
some 70,000 persons. It is estimated that on the basis of the present pro-
ducer price of 016 (US$13.9) per 60 lb. head load farmers would increase
their incomes by 057.9 (US$50.2) per acre during the debt repayment period
(i.e. up to year 18) and by 0127.9 (US$110.8) per acre thereafter. Not
least important, the project would assist the Government to focus on critical
policy issues, the resolution of which is essential for the resuscitation of
the cocoa sector.
47.          The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at
21 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.          The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ghana and
the Bank, the draft Supplemental Letter from the Republic of Ghana to the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.          The following would be a condition precedent to the effectiveness
of the loan, viz, approval by the Bank of the form of agreement adopted by the
Project Unit for sub-loans from the Project Unit to participating farmers.
50.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

B.       PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-1
Cr. No. 163 - Fisheries Project; US$1.3 million
Credit of September 25, 1969
Effective Date: January 21, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
1.        This project originally provided for: (a) the construction
of forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such
vessels; (c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies, and
(d) the improvement of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's
Boatyard Division. Following protracted problems over design and
price, the number of boats was reduced from the original 40 to 10, the
procurement of equipment is now concluded, and delivery of the boats
has been completed. Delays have Rlso been encountered In the execution
of the harbor studies. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972,
which was extended first to December 31, 1973 and then to June, 1975,
has been further extended to December 31, 1975 to allow for the pro-
curement of spare parts.
Cr. No. 205 - Cocoa Rehabilitation Project; US$8.5 million
Credit of June 26, 1970; Effective Date: March 12, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
2.        The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of
51,000 acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa is behind schedule
mainly because of drought damage in 1973, poor farmer response,
limited availability of labor, and past indecision on the part of
the Government concerning spraying cocoa against pests, in particular
capsids. The drought caused a high mortality rate amongst young
planted seedlings, creating a large demand for replacement seed
which could not be satisfied since production of seedlings was
hampered at the same time. The relatively low producer price for
cocoa has not encouraged farmers to participate in the project nor
to pay attractive wages to hired labor. Consequently little hired
labor has been forthcoming. The government spraying program caused
a delay of two years in the project's rehabilitation program. In-
creased costs, due to higher salaries and wages and higher than ex-
pected prices for construction material, equipment and vehicles,
might necessitate additional funding unless the replanting and re-
habilitation programs are reduced.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of proj cts in execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are being encountered, and the action
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and
with the understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 354 - Sugar Rehabilitation Project;    US$15.6 million
Credit of January 29, 1973:
Effective Date: May 31, 1973
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
3.           The project experienced difficulties in the 1973-74 milling
season and only 8,200 tons of sugar were produced compared with 10,800
tons estimated in the appraisal report. The main problems were factory
breakdowns, irregular cane supplies from outgrowers and a lower than
expected sugar recovery rate. Management is good and excellent progress
has been made with the rehabilitation of estates and factories. An
increase in producer and domestic sugar prices was recently approved
which will strengthen the project's financial viability.
Cr. No. 438 - First Highway Project; US$13 million
Credit of November 21, 1973;
Effective Date: January 22, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
4.           In spite of initial delays, project execution is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants have been appointed. Contracts for the first
road section to be rehabilitated have been awarded to a domestic construc-
tion firm following international competitive bidding; and bids for the
second road section have been prepared. Because of cost overruns, con-
sideration is being given to a reduction in the amount of road rehabilitation
to be carried out under the project. The Maintenance Task Force has prepared
a comprehensive road maintenance program; and the Government has taken steps
to strengthen the highways administration by creating the Ghana Highway
Authority to be responsible for all public roads.
Cr. No. 499 - Second Water Supply Project;
US$10.4 million Credit of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: January 7, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
5.           This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an earth
dam at Weija; extension of the distribution system in the Accra/Tema area;
extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and technical assistance and
training. The delay in Credit Effectiveness was due mainly to the delayed
conclusion of a loan agreement between the Government and CIDA which is co-
financing the project. (The other co-financier is the African Development
Bank). However, construction of the Weija dam is well under way.

the vicinity of the breeding/fattening ranches; (c) training of Ghanaian
