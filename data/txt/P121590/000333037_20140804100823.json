were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: one\n            of the main factors of the success of the Choque de Gestao\n            was the dedication of an incoming administration with a team\n            of highly trained, dedicated professionals and a mission to\n            implant results-based management. It is perhaps worth\n            looking more closely at this dynamic to understand the\n            importance of champions and how the Minas Gerais experience\n            might be replicated. Numerous countries, Brazilian states\n            and large domestic municipalities have visited the State to\n            learn about the Choque de Gestao, and to draw lessons on how\n            to implement similar reforms in other places. The challenge\n            for the Bank is how to disseminate the case of Minas Gerais\n            more broadly and on how to effectively replicate this\n            experience elsewhere. While evidence seems to suggest that\n            there is a particularly positive impact of results\n            agreements on service delivery outcomes6, the adoption of\n            the model has not been done in isolation. Fiscal reforms are\n            an important condition to the successful adoption of\n            Results-based Management, or RBM. In Minas Gerais, the\n            fiscal rationalization was a key objective of the first\n            phase of the reform. The combination of institutional\n            context and interventions, known as \u0091performance regime\u0092, is\n            what really drives performance for specific services."}, "docdt": "2014-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
