MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TriE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE
FOR A PUBLIC SECTOR REFYORM AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Cape Verde for SDR 5.7 million, the equivalent of US$ 8.1 million, on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a public sector reform and capacity building
project. The Government will contribute US$0.81 million equivalent. The Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) was discussed by the Board on March 4, 1993.
2.    Country and Economic Background: Despite serious economic constraints, Cape Verde is a
country where basically good government has contributed much to good social conditions and concern
for the well-being of the people. Cape Verde can show extraordinary achievements since life expectancy
at birth is 66 years; primary school enrollment is universal; the literacy rate is 52 percent; action on
nutrition is strong and sustained; and income per capita is US$750 (1991). Cape Verde consists of 10
small Islands located 650 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, with a land area of just over 4,000 square
kilometers. Nine of the ten islands are populated, and half of the resident population of about 400,000
live on th* island of Santiago, about half of them in the capital Praia. About 50 percent of the population
live in urban areas. During the 1980s, Cape Verde's natural population growth rate averaged 2.7
percent, but was only 1.5 percent adjusted for emigration. There are twice as many Cape Verdeans
abroad as there are resident in the country; successive generations tend to maintain very close ties with
the homeland. Remittances from emigres were equivalent to about 18 percent of GDP in 1991 and nearly
20 percent in 1992.
3.    Cape Verde's natural resource base is very poor, climatic conditions are unfavorable with
prolonged cycles of drought, domestic markets are small and internal communications are weak owing
to the scattered nature of the islands. Despite these limitations, the country has achieved a strong
economic performance, with an average real GDP growth of 6 percent per annum in the 1980s. This
performance, however, deteriorated in 1989-91, to 3.7 percent, with the emergence of internal and
external imbalances. The Government's policy of assigning to the public sector a key role in productive
activities, which could have been performed more efficiendy by the private sector, proved increasimgly
inappropriate in recent years and resulted in low efficiency, poor financial results, and high share by
public enterprises in the overall external debt.
4.    In 1988, the Government recognized these shortcomings and adopted an outward-looking
development strategy. It failed, however, to fully implement this strategy. The export-oriented strategy
in fact stood little chance of success given the failure to define clearly an appropriate government role
in the economy in light of a changing world. A new Government took office in April 1991, following
the first multi-party e'ections since independence, on a platform of reform and liberalization of the
economy. Cape Verde's quiet and remarkable political transition went largely unnoticed in the
international community in large measure because it coincided with the Gulf war. A first-order activity
has been the further definition of the outward-looking development strategy, aimed at promoting a market
economy, and the undertaking of a broad range of specific actions towards its implementation. A major
priority has been the reform, rationalization and modernization of the public sector.



S.    Cape Verde embarks on this strategy with quite some special attributes (para. 2) and problems
(para. 3) including a successful political transition and a shortage of skilled people. Success in the reform
program will require a combination of prudence and determination, which have been the country's
hallmarks in the past, as well as sustained support by Cape Verde's external partners. In the medium
term (1994.96), assuming the sustained application of the reforms, economic growth is projected to
average 5.5-6 percent a year in real terms with growth coming from an increase in services, private
investment in fisheries and light manufacturing, and public investments in infrastructure.
6.    Sector RaU=nd  Historically, the GOCV has had to play a dominant role in the economy
because the private sector Is small, and has taken few initiatives outside ts traditional trading and
constuction spheres of activity. Also, the private sector's growth has been affected by the regular
emigration of talented and entrepreneurial individuals, whilst remittances have yet to be be channeled to
much productive private investment. The public sector is large and includes: (a) the governments pub!ic
adminisration consisting of thirteen ministries, 15 local authorities and the Bank of Cape Verde, together
employing approximately 11,200 civil servants; and (b) thirty-six public enterprises, employing an
estimated 8,000 workers.
7.    Up to 1988, the performance of the public sector was quite good, with prudent economic
management, substantial promotion and investments in the social sector, and public enterprises providing
essential services in distribution, transportation and communications. To address the deterioration in
economic performance (para 3) Government's initial attention in early 1991 was on stabilization of public
finances. In parallel, actions designed to restructure the public enterprise sector and to promote the
pivate sector were set in motion, and efforts were initiatct to restructure the financial sector to
complement public enterprise rerfom and private sector promotion.
8.    The above actions notwithstanding, the public sector has come under pressure to speed up efforts
to improve policy analysis, bring about faster participation of the local levels in decision-making, attract
private investments and encourage the private sector to take a larger role in the economy. In 1992, the
GOCV decided to accelerate the wide-ranging reform program of the public administration and public
enterprises. It sought and obtained IDA and other donor assistance in the reform and privatization of the
public enterprises. IDA assistance is being provided through the Privaization and Technical Assistance
Project (Cr. 2377-CV). The proposed project would focus on modernizing public administration and the
legal and judicial system, supporting municipal development and decentralization, improving the
communication of economic policy, fostering transparency and accountability in public affairs, and
building policy analysis and management capacities.
9.    Sectoral Issues: The capacity of the civil service to undertake policy analysis and management
of fbnnce, social services and infrastructure needs to be improved and modernized. According to a
surwv   y the Ministry of Public Administration, only 2 percent of the civil service staff has management
experience and qualifications, and less than 8 percent have middle level technical or professional
qualifications. Support, auxiliary and temporary personnel with low skills comprise 45 percent of the
civil service. Because of the low skill levels, analytical, communications and technical capabilities are
poor. There has been little improvement in civil service capacity since recruitment policies and
procedures, staff training, personnel and career management are inadequate or outdated.
10.   Decentralization is an imperative in Cape Verde, given the scattered nature of the islands and
difficult communications. A highly centralized public administration has its origins from co!onial times.
Decentraization of public administration, one of the Government's objectives, is hampered because
the capacity of the municipalities Oocal authorities) is extremely weak in fiscal and financial affairs, in
planning and maintenance of basic infrastruzture, and in the provision of social services. In the past,
-2 -



public management has been almost exclusively the domain of central government, and municipalities are
even less well endowed than central government with qualified and experienced staff to take on the
administration of public affairs, provide social services, promote the development of local institutions and
constituencies and create an attractive environment for business. In addition, they lack modem office
equipment and administrative systems to take over their new responsibilities in an efficient and
accountable manner.
11.   In economic management, weakness in the national statistical system is an urgent problem.
Poor statistical information has emerged as a major impediment to further social and economic policy
analysis and reforms design. The information is dispersed, often gathered in a haphazard manner,
inadequately processed for lack of capacity and not systematically shared among potential users. GOCV
has tierefore assigned high priority to building up national statistical capacity. It is considering, among
other things, transforming the General Directorate of Statistics (GDS) into a National Institute of Statistics
(INE) giving it broader responsibilities and autonomy, formalizing interaction between the statistical staff
of various technical ministries and agencies and providing it with all necessary equipment and materials.
The INE would manage training for all statistical staff. Weaknesses are also present in economic
planning, aid coordination, debt management, and policy communications.
12.   Ihe Government recognizes that the legal and judicial framework is outmoded and not
sufficiently conducive to private sector development in Cape Verde. The commercial legislation dates
back to the colonial days and has never been revised or updated to meet the needs of modem-day business
activides. Labor laws are of relatively recent origin, but like the Commercial Code, they are considered
cumbersome and time-consuming and they are not always well understood. A number of other legislative
texts such as the Code of Civil Procedure, the legislation governing notarial acts, and the companies' and
property registers, all of which are considered as important tools of economic development, are unduly
complex and rigid. The court system needs to become more efficient and more adapted to deal with
business and commercial law cases. The institutions of the justice system responsible for law reforms,
revision and administration are weak and ill-equipped. The Government gives high priority to the reform
the legal and judicial system.
13.   The public procurement system requires some reform and modernization as some procurement
regulations date back to the turn of this century, staff skills are outdated and decision-making slow for
technical reasons. Accounting and information services are outdated and inefficient in many areas.
Accounting is being improved under an IDF Facility grant. More transparent and uniform accounting
systems based on internationally recognized standards will be implemented for Government operations
and training provided to accounting staff.
14.   Project Objectives: Effective economic management and the transformation of any society in
the direction proposed by Cape Verde not only requires good policy, but also strong institutions, an
appropriate legal and judicial framework, and skilled individuals to implement and communicate the
policies throughout the administration and the public at large. The objective of the program of actions
to be financed by the proposed IDA credit is to support GOCV's broader effort to transform and
nmodernize key institutions, the laws supporting them, and the personnel staffing them, thereby helping
sustain the economic and social refotm program which has been initiated. In very specific terms the
project would support improvements in economic policy analysis and management, and the legal and
administrative environment for investments and for business operations through a program of institutional
development and capacity building in public administration, both at the central and at the municipal
levels. It would complement the ongoing restructuring of the public enterprise sector (Cr. 2377-CV),
transport and infrastructure modernization (Cr. 2466-CV) and provide the underpinnings for the delivery
of basic services at the local level to be supported under the proposed Basic Social Services project.
-3 -



15.    hD          Des : The proposed credit will finance a five-year time slice consisting of selected
components of the Government's insttional development/modernization program. The proposed project
was prepared on the basis of extensive diagnostic assessments undertaken by GOCV, various donors, as
well as Bank missions. The ptoject would be a specific investment credit, operating within a framework
oudined in the Policy Letter. The project addresses actions which can be effectively conipleted withir
five years, and which will result in lasting improvements in key areas of civil service, administrative and
operational procedures and the ability of the grassroots to sustain development. To this end, the project
will help introduce greater effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency to public sector functions critical
to the long-term success of the overall economic and social reform program.
16.   The project comprises five components:
a) M9derjizing the civil service (US$0.80 millign). This component would suppor. dte reform
and modernization of the civil service by providing short-term advisory services and equipment to the
Ministry of Public Administration, training for staff from various parts of the civil service, and training.
and retraining for voluntary departees from the civil service. In particular, the component would consist
of: (i) the implementation of improved human resources planning and management systems (organization
planning, performance evaluation, career planning, employee development, etc.) to promote vertical and
horizontl mobility of personnel, in direct relation with short and long term requirements and with the
priorites of the various public services and organization units in response to their new role: (ii)
Implementing a comprehensive training program directed at managers, administrators and support staff
in public administration, sector policy and analysis, in response to the new role played by the State in
tne economy, and to the requirements of a truly public service-oriented administration; and (iii) the flnal
design of the civil service retrenchment implementation strategy, surveys and studies of the impact of the
retrenchment progrm including any needed changes in strategy, retraining schemes which would also
include job search assistance to facilitate redeployment of voluntary departees from the civil service;
b) building local capacity (decentralization and municipal strengthening) (US$2.26 milliong.
Through financing short-term advisory services and operational studies, equipment and training for all
15 municipalities and, where appropriate, the Ministry of Internal Administration, the credit will assist
the Government in building the capacity at the local level which is required to successfully implement its
decentralization policy, and to increase the involvement of the population in the development process.
This would ivolve, in particular:  (i) institution building: further detailing of guidelines for the
decentralization process; supporting establishment of inter-municipal technical support offices (TSOs) to
ensure a 'critical mass' through which scarce technical equipment and support can be shared; and
providing the means to facilitate closer contact between municipal authorities and the population of
various villages and/or citizens' groups and local community associations; (ii) developing sound
administration and management practices: planning, budgeting and inventory systems to ensure
transparency and accountability in fiscal and related matters; and local fiscal administration and revenue
mobilization capacity thereby ensuring sustainability of the decentralization process and improvements
in local services provision; (iii) actions in human resources development: helping municipalities attract
and retain qualified personnel; training within the framework of a comprehensive program for existing
staff; and procedures for personnel management and their adequate use; and (iv) strengthening internal
organization of the municipalities: rationalizing the organization of the various municipal services that
could eventually become autonomous services or be contracted out; and the provision of basic equipment
to implement the new system. and the provision of services by the municipalities;
c) strengthening economic management capacity (US$2.15 million). The credit will support
operational studies and public information campaigns, and provide advisory services, training, equipment
and library support to the Ministries of Economic Coordination, Finance, and Communications and their
major agencies (Statistics, Planning, Public Finance, Radio, etc.), as well as to the private media. The
-4-



component will specifically involve: (i) restructuring of the national accounts and statistics system
including the transformntion of the statistics department into an Institute of Statistics with the requisite
autonomy to be able to attract and retain qualified staff, and catching up on preparation of the backlog
of essential stati.tics; (ii) strengthening economic policy and impact analysis capacity of the Planning
Directorate General, establishing a multi-year rolling investment program (PIP), and a pre-investment
studies fund (PIF) to relieve the constraints on public investments caused by the present lack of properly
prepared projects, and reinforce institutional capacity for identifying public investment proposals and
processing these adequately. The PIF would also support the final preparation of the National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP); (iii) supporting improvements in external debt and public finance
management, aid coordination, and assessing the feasibility of and designing and implementing, if
appropriate, mechanisms for increased public resource mobilization through expansion of the offering of
Treasury Bills to the public at large; (iv) improving the communication of economic and social policies,
including the training of journalists; (v) testing pilot schemes designed to facilitate the provision of
assistance in various fields of economic and social development by non-resident Cape Verdeans; (vi)
improving intra-governmental communications through support the development and implementation of
an electronic communications system; and (vii) designing a shared data base system for government
operations;
d) lega and ludicial reform and modernization of the iustice system (US$1.98 million). Support
wvll include financing training, equipment and materials, textbooks and printing, and advisory services
for the Ministry of Justice and Labor and its major agencies including the Judiciary, the Registrar of
Companies, and the Registrar of Deeds as well as legal services for key ministries. The component will
include such actions as: (i) revision of commercial and labor legislation; (ii) specialized training in
business law for magistrates and, possibly, other members of the legal profession; (iii) strengthening the
capacity of the Ministry of Justice to draft, revise and update legislation on a routine basis; (iv)
establishment of a specialized jurisdiction(s) and, if need be, arbitration facilities, to dispose of
commercial law disputes; and (v) provision of modern computerized facilities for specialized legal
services dealing with company registry, notarial services and business activities; and
e) public procurement reform (US$0.38 million). Tbis component will provide training, short-
term advisory services and equipment to the Public Procurement and Assets Management Departnent
(PATRIMONIO) and selected administration departments in GOCV. The component will include in
particular: (i) selective revision of the existing legislation for procurement of goods and services; (Hi)
training for the technical staff of PATRIMONIO as well as the staff in charge of the purchase and
distribution of goods in the various administration departments of GOCV; and (iii) modernizing the
purchasing departments through the computerization of, and training for about 40 staff in, systems for
planning, purchasing and storing of information.
17.   The project is expected to be carried out over five years for a total cost estimated at US$8.91
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$6.95 million (78%). IDA would finance
100 percent of foreign exchange costs and about 59% (US$1.15 million) of local costs. A breakdown
of costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursemnent schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Cape Verde are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12422 -CV, dated January 7, 1994 is being circulated
separately.
18.   Project Implementation. The activities to be undertaken under the project have been designed
to be filly integrated within the overall and day-to-day work program of each ministry. Management and
implementation of each component would be the responsibility of the concerned ministries and entities,
as follows: the dvii service component would be managed by the Ministry of Public Adminisuton;
- 5-



the municipal strengthening component would be managed by the Ministry of Internal Administration
In close collaboration with the municipalities; the economic management component would largely be
under the Ministries of Economic Coordination, and Finance through die Departments of Planning,
Statistics, Research, and Public Finance, as appropriate; the legal and judicial component would be
under the Ministry of Justice and Labor; and the public procurement reform component would be
managed by the PATRIMONIO in the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Communications, in
consultation with the Association of Journal ists, would execute part of the improvement of economic and
social policy communicatiotns sub-component of the economic management component. Project
Component Managers (PCMs) have been appointed within each Ministry to manage the implementation
of each major component or sub-component. The Ministry of Economic Coordination would assume
overall coordinating responsibility for the project. A Project Coordinator (PC) has been appointed to
handle day-to-day coordination matters. A high-level advisory and monitoring group, comprising
repreentatives of the central and local governments, the private sector and selected civil groups such as
unions, would oversee implementation of the various project components. The Government has created
'l-is advisory group, the Reform Advisory and Implementation Monitoring Board (RAIMB) to, among
other things, provide policy guidance on the direction and pace of the public sector reform and
modernization program, and to provide advice on the conduct and pace of implementation of the program
with a view to ensuring effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and consistency in the process. The
RAIMB would be co-chaired by the Minister of State for Economic Coordination and the Minister of
Public Administration. The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), established within the Ministry of
Economic Coordination would serve as the secretariat for the RAIMB. The IDA Credit would be
disbursed over five and a half years.
19.   Project Sustainabilit. The GOCV has taken the initiative to reform public administration and
public enterprises, and has asked for IDA support to further the implementation of a genuinely home-
grown and sound program. The need for change and improvement in public management at the central
and municipal levels was discussed in Parliament, and the Ministries of Public and Internal
Administration, and Economic Coordination were charged with the planning of the reforms. The
Ministry of Justice itself has been at the forefront in identfying the needs for reform and modernization
of the legal and judicial systems and actually designing actions. It has done so with the active
participation of legal practitioners, the private sector and representatives of the workers. There is a
strong commitment in the Government to implement the reforms, and the civil service, locally elected
bodies and the voting public are closely watching the Government deliver on its promises. Ihere is thus
considerable political pressure to reform the public sector which is likely to last throughout the life of the
project. In particular, the municipalities are demanding greater independence and more resources for
local development. Their political and social power is increasing and will likely act as a continued
impetus to direction and pace the Government's reform of public administration and management. The
cental objective of the project, capacity building through training and specialized assistance, would
ensure that actions required would continue to be carried out after project completion.
20.   Lessons Leared  Implementation of the Industrial Finance and Promotion Project (Cr. 1579-
CV) encountered few problems. The project is closed and a completion report has been prepared.
Implementation of the Privatization TA Project (Cr. 2377-CV) is ahead of schedule in many areas. One
of the keys to Its success has been the active role played by an independent advisory board. A similar
board has been established under the proposed project (paras. 18 and 22). The proposed project is in
response to the commitnent displayed by the Government to undertake a major institutional
transformation in terms of the roles of and interactions within the State and the private sector which
ensures ownership. The overall climate in the country is conducive to reform. Finally, experience from
similar operations shows that advisory services are much more effective when provided in conjunction
with a reform program that has already been launched and to which Govermnent is fully commnitted.

21.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project would complement other ongoing or planned IDA-
supported projects in the Infrastructure, Public Enterprise, Financial, Professional Education sectors
which together constitute the pillars of our strategy for Cape Verde. All these projects aim at assisting
the Govetnment of Cape Verde implement its objective of creating the conditions for the private sector
to become the engine of sustainable economic growth. Capacity building in the public administration,
both at the central and local levels, has been identified in both the recent Country Economic
Memorandum (June 1993) and CAS as necessary to facilitate, accelerate and consolidate Government's
present reform efforts, and to move to a new phase of economic and social development. As a privileged
partner in Cape Verde's economic restructuring program, and one that recognizes that the sustainability
of reform depends on the capacity of implementation, IDA is well positioned to extend its dialogue to the
medium- and long-term process of modernizing the public sector's management of the economy through
institutional development and capacity building.
22.   Issges and Actions. A number of policy reforms have already been implemented or are under
implementation in such areas as civil service statutes, career plans, job expectations, revenue sharing,
labor laws and procurement regulations. The Government has spelled out its policy with regards to
decentralization, improved efficiency of the administration, and reform and modernization of the
judiciary. A policy statement in the form of a Letter of Public Sector Reform Policy covering the various
areas of focus of the project was presented by the Government prior to negotiations and discussed and
agreed during negotiations. The following actions were undertaken prior to negotiations: (i) a central
Project Coordinator (PC) at the Ministry of Economic Coordination was appointed; (ii) the appointments
of Project Component Managers (PCMs) within the respective agencies for each of the components, or
sub-components as follows: civil service; decentralization/municipal strengthening; national
accounts/statistics; planning; electronic communications and shared data base development; public finance;
social and economic policy communications; legal and judicial; and public procurement reform, were
formalized. These staff had played major roles in the preparation of the respective components and thus
have intimate familiarity with the project; and (iii) the draft performance indicators containing key project
activities were transmitted to IDA and agreed upon. Agreements were reached during negotiations on
the terms of reference for the PC and PCMs. The Reform Advisory and Implementation Monitoring
Board (RAIMB) was established prior to presentation of the project to IDA's Board of Directors.
Agreements were reached during negotiations on the terms of reference for the RAIMB. Details of the
civil service retrenchment program were also received by IDA, and a model consultancy contract,
acceptable to the Association, including a sample letter of invitation, for the recruitment of consultants
and advisors under the project were adopted prior to Board Presentation. Effectiveness of the credit
will be subject to: (i) Government establishing a small Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), to be headed
by the PC, appropriately staffed to handle such matters as overall project accounting, bulk central
procurement, disbursements and project monitoring, and to serve as the secretariat of the RAIMB; (ii)
selection of an independent auditor, on the basis of a three-year contract, to audit the Project Accounts;
(iii) the establishment of a financial management/accounting system for the project; (iv) agreement with
IDA on the detailed work program for the first year of the project; and (v) submission by Govermnent
of the outstanding audit report for the utilities corporation ELECTRA.
23.   Environmental Aspects. This is a category "C" project as far as the environment is concerned.
It basically involves the financing of consultant services, office and communications equipment and
training. GOCV intends to engage advisory services under the project to assist in finalizing its National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).
24.   Program Objectives. The project emphasis will be on the following objectives: (i) institutional
development and capacity building; (ii) improvement of public sector performance; (ii) better
governance; and (iv) private sector promotion.

25.   Benefits. The proposed project would assist Cape Verde at a critical time in the implementation
of its liberalization program, and in adapting the administration and the civil service as well as the judicial
system to a new vision of the role of Government in the economy. It would foster efficiency in the
public administration, through the implementation of modern human resource management systems and
procedures. It would also promote greater participation in planning and managing the development
process at the local level, and foster accountability. It would increase the availability, and reduce the
delays encountered in the preparation and execution, of public investment projects and increase efficiency
in public resource use. Improvement in public investment execution monitoring and in policy and impact
analysis would help the Government in efforts to reduce poverty.
26.   Risk. There is some risk that vested interests within the civil service will resist reform measures
as these impact on their entrenched ways of performing their tasks, and may involve physical relocation
of staff to municipal governments. Given the positive achievements of the Government to-date in these
fields, and strong grass-root support for decentralization, these risks are not considered higb. There is
a risk that the training of civil servants and the retraining of voluntary departees from the civil service
under GOCV's retrenchment program, which the Government intends to implement in parallel with the
proposed project as part of its civil service modernization efforts, could be slowed down by the limited
capacity of local training institutions. This risk is not considered insurmountable because the Government
is, in parallel with this project, embarking on a restructuring of vocational education for which it has
requested IDA support through the proposed Basic Education and Training Project. The implementation
of the reform program may also be slowed down by the limited capacity of the Government
administration to design the details of some of the necessary reforms and to monitor their implementation.
These risks are addressed through the strengthening of the project's execution agencies and the
appointment of a coordinator in the Ministry of Economic Coordination. The Government has also
shown a capacity to monitor complex reforms under its ongoing public enterprise restructuring program.
Finally, implementation of the civil service retrenchment program could lose momentum if the added
strain on the private sector's already limited capacity to absorb new labor force entrants results in higher
unemployment and a political backlash. This risk will be minimized by an attractive package, already
budgeted for by the Government and for which various donors have indicated support, that provides
monthly income payments for up to three years - just enough to meet subsistence needs of retrenchees
without discouraging them from looking for a job - in addition to a lump sum distribution at the time
of departure.
27.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

STATUS OF DISBURSEMENTS IN CAPE VERDE
NOTE ON PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.    Overall portfolio performance is very satisfactory and has improved comnpared to last year's.
The portfolio is problem-free. At the beginning of FY93, key issues which adversely affected overall
project implementation included: procurement delays (Primary Education project); unfamiliarity with
Bank procedures (Primary Education, Infrastructure Rehabilitation, and Privatization TA projects);
delays in communications and some rigidities by the Bank on disbursement issues (Privatization TA
project).
2.    Disbursements in FY93 amounted to US$1.21 million compared to US$2.3 million in FY92-
this was due to: (i) closing (during mid-year) of the Industrial Finance and Promotion project; (ii)
new project staff's unfamiliarity with Bank disbursement procedures which affected the Privatization
TA project; (iiI) delays in effecting Special Account transactions by the Bank of Cape Verde which
affected most projects in the portfolio, particularly the Primary Education project.
3.    Actions were taken to resolve the above-mentioned project implementation problems. On
procurement, the main problem was with the construction of the Pedagogic Institute under the
Erim= Eduain project; with sustained support from the then AFTOS (now AFTCB), the issues
were satisfactorily resolved and execution of the project accelerated. On the unfamiliarity with
Bank's procedures, which affected Primary Education, Infrastructure Rehabilitation and
Privatizatign TA projects, task managers devoted time, to review and clarify Bank procedures with
the staff of the Project Management Units (PMUs). Delays in communicating disbursement letters
have been removed; and standard bidding documents have been made available to all PMUs.
4.    At the end of FY93, overall status of projects in the portfolio was rated 1.4, an improvement
from 1.7 at the end of FY92. The Country Team and Government's efforts, to get to the root of the
problems encountered by the portfolio and their common objective of having a problem-free portfolio,
contributed to the improvement on the overall performance of projects. Transport Infrastructure
project was approved by the Board on March 4, 1993, and it became effective on July 22, 1993. The
PCR for the Industrial Finance and Promotion project has been completed.
5.    To maintain the improvement on disbursement issues, the Government has requested a
disbursement/procurement seminar for PMU staff to be held in Cape Verde in the Spring of 1994.
