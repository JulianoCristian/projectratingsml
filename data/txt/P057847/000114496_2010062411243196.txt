SCHEDULE
4
Special Account
1.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)
the term “GEF Eligible Categories” means categories (1) through (5); set forth in 
the table in paragraph
1
of Schedule
1
to this Agreement.
(b)
the term “GEF Eligible Expenditures” means the expenditures for goods, works, 
services, Sub-grants and operating costs referred to in Section 2.02 (a) of this Agreement; and
(c)
the term “GEF Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to $200,000 
to be withdrawn from the GEF Grant Account and deposited into the GEF Special Account 
pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Association shall 
otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to $100,000 
until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Grant Account plus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the 
General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR
1,000,000.
2.
Payments out of the GEF Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
Page  18
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.
After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that the GEF Special 
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent 
withdrawals to replenish the GEF Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish to the 
Association a request or requests for deposit into the GEF Special Account of an amount or 
amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of 
such request or requests, the Association shall, on behalf of the Recipient, withdraw from the 
Grant Account and deposit into the GEF Special Account such amount or amounts as the 
Recipient shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the GEF Special Account, the Recipient 
shall furnish to the Association requests for deposits into the GEF 
Special Account at such intervals as the Association shall specify.
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Recipient shall 
furnish to the Association the documents and other evidence required 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in 
respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such 
request, the Association shall, on behalf of the Recipient, withdraw from 
the Grant Account and deposit into the GEF Special Account such 
amount as the Recipient shall have requested and as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the GEF Special Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits 
shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Grant Account under the 
respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, 
as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.
For each payment made by the Recipient out of the GEF Special Account, the Recipient 
shall, at such time as the Association shall reasonably request, furnish to the Association such 
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
3
of
this Schedule, the Association shall not 
be required to make further deposits into the GEF Special Account:
(a)
if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that all further withdrawals 
should be made by the Recipient directly from the Grant Account in accordance with the 
provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement;
(b)
if the Recipient shall have failed to furnish to the Association, within the period 
of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be 
furnished to the Association pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and 
Page  19
accounts for the GEF Special Account;
(c)
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the Recipient of its intention 
to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Recipient to make withdrawals from the Grant 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section
6.02 of the General Conditions; or
(d)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant allocated to the eligible 
Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the 
Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall 
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the 
Grant allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Association shall 
specify by notice to the Recipient. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the 
extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit 
in the GEF Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for 
eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
GEF Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph
2
of
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Association, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B) deposit into the GEF Special Account 
(or, if the Association shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Association shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the GEF Special Account shall be 
made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case 
may be.
(b)
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the GEF Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the 
Association such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Recipient may, upon notice to the Association, refund to the Association all 
or any portion of the funds on deposit in the GEF Special Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Grant Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
