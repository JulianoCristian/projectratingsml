Management and Poverty Reduction Project for Armenia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project design should be based on a shared understanding of\n            objectives and outcomes as well as an accurate assessment of\n            local implementation capacity to achieve them. Project\n            design should take into consideration timing requirements if\n            project objectives rely on policy and legal changes, or\n            objectives should be aligned with the existing policies and\n            legal framework if the timeframe is tight. Sustainable\n            natural resource management requires strong beneficiary\n            commitment. Institutional and legal reforms in a sector such\n            as forestry, characterized by multiple conflicting\n            interests, require time and continual oversight. Parallel\n            grant financing from Swedish International Development\n            Cooperation Agency (Sida) was essential to project\n            achievements; however, its monitoring was complex. Donor\n            coordination and collaboration are essential to tackle\n            complex problems such as illegal logging that benefit from\n            harmonizing experiences and funding potential."}, "docdt": "2009-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
