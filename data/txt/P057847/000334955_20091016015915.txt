1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

Project context. The mountain ecosystems of Armenia produce a valuable flow of goods and services of
local and global significance. When the Project was prepared, the unsustainable exploitation of natural
resources in mountainous areas (largely within Tavoush and Gegharkunik Marzes) was eroding
productivity due to forest loss and soil and pasture degradation, likely perpetuating rural poverty.
Armenia's mountain, forest, meadow, aquatic and steppe ecosystems also host a large share of the
country's globally significant biodiversity resources, and biodiversity loss was a major concern. Two main
protected areas that are important biodiversity reserves in Tavoush and Gegharkunik Marzes are Lake
Sevan National Park (1,500 sq.km) and Dilijan State Reserve (280 km2). The area is also rich in cultural
heritage with good potential to develop ecotourism and natural heritage tourism.
At Appraisal, Project area natural landscapes were managed by the State Forest Corporation (Hayantar)
under the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP); the national network of protected areas was managed by
the Department of Bioresources and Land Protection of MNP; and Village Councils (Haymanks) had
legal responsibility for community pastures, and general oversight of management of private land within
village areas. Weak natural resources management posed an increasing threat to the livelihoods of poor
rural people who depend heavily on local soil, water, forest, and pasture, which were rapidly degrading.
The Project aimed to reduce rural poverty through improved natural resource management, while
protecting important natural habitats.
Development objective. The Project Development Objective is to support the adoption of sustainable
natural resource management practices and alleviation of rural poverty in the mountainous areas of
Armenia where degradation of natural resources was reaching a critical point.
Global environmental objective. The global environmental objective of the proposed Project is to preserve
the mountain, forest, and grassland ecosystems of the Southern Caucasus, through enhanced protected
area and mountain ecosystem conservation and sustainable management.

1.1     Context at Appraisal
Country Background: The Republic of Armenia is a mountainous landlocked country in the southern
Caucasus with limited land links to international ports; some three million people occupy a territory of
29,800 km²--1.1 million in Yerevan--and the adult literacy rate is over 99 percent.
In 1991, after independence, the economy fell into a severe recession; 1993 GDP was only 47 percent of
the 1990 level. In 1994, the economy began to recover, characterized by successful stabilization and
structural reforms, and accompanied by trade and price liberalization, small and medium enterprise
privatization, and the creation of a basic legal and administrative framework for a market economy. This
led to real GDP growth in 1998 of 7.2 percent per annum. Since 1994, Armenia has exhibited one of the
highest real GDP growth rates among the CIS countries, reaching 13.9 percent in 2005.
Sector Background: The dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies
and markets was a serious setback for Armenia's many rural communities, especially in remote mountain
and border areas; industries that had once provided employment disappeared and rural infrastructure
deteriorated. In 2002, some 55 percent of Armenians were classified as poor, and rural poverty was
pronounced among high altitude mountain residents; in Tavoush and Gegharkunik Marzes, about 70
percent of rural households engaged in subsistence agriculture and bartered their small surpluses in local
markets, while remittances, pensions, and day labor provided cash. During the crisis years, the rural
economy provided a safety net and absorbed a significant share of Armenia's excess labor.
As a result, many households had little cash and could not invest in productivity improvements, despite
being increasingly reliant on natural resources for survival. Thus, a vicious circle was established--local



                                                    1
people were forced to over exploit natural resources to the point of severe degradation of forests, fish
stocks, pastures, and soil, which threatened their own livelihoods and important biodiversity assets.
Armenia's biodiversity resources have been recognized as globally significant. The country is in the
Caucasus Eco-Region, a Global 200 Eco-Region, at the crossroads of European, Central Asian, and
Middle Eastern Zones, three bio-geographic zones that include unusually rich flora, fauna and natural
landscapes and ecosystems. Armenian habitats contain nearly every plant community found in the
southern Caucasus, and 50 percent of the region's flora diversity.
Natural resource degradation was considered critical in three key areas:
a) Declining soil fertility and pasture degradation. Intensive farming around villages and inappropriate
   farming techniques, especially on slopes, increased soil erosion. During Project preparation, it was
   estimated that more than 60 percent of Armenia's arable land was experiencing levels of degradation.
b) Forest degradation. Rising fossil fuel cost increased rural and urban reliance on wood for heating and
   cooking, as did restricted gas supplies that followed the war over Nagorno-Karabahk--within a few
   years, Armenia lost 10 to 20 percent of its forest cover and overgrazing curtailed regeneration of
   harvested forests. Forest management policy, legal, and institutional frameworks were largely
   ineffective, forest institutions were underfinanced, the forestry sector lacked management plans, and
   capacity to control illegal logging was limited.
c) Threats to critical natural habitats. During Appraisal, Armenia's network of critical natural habitat
   protected areas were barely managed and poorly protected. Park boundaries were ad hoc and poorly
   linked to rational designation as protected areas. Similarly, internal zones were badly defined, and
   overall, institutional and legal frameworks for nature protection were weak.
Rationale for Bank Involvement: The proposed Project was consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, July 31, 1997, No. 16899-AM) objectives of supporting social sustainability, poverty
alleviation, and mitigating environmental degradation. The CAS identified environmental degradation as
a key medium-term risk to economic growth sustainability; and emphasized environmental protection and
regenerating natural resources to sustain local economies and reduce rural poverty.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective is to support the adoption of sustainable natural resource
management practices and alleviation of rural poverty in the mountainous areas of Armenia where
degradation of natural resources was reaching a critical point. Key indicators described in the PAD were:
 increased incomes (or expenditures) in Project villages compared to non-Project villages;
 increased crop and livestock productivity in Project villages compared to non-Project villages;
 increased community participation in natural resources management decisions, as perceived by
    stakeholders in target communities;
 reduction in illegal activities destroying forest cover;
 reversal of degradation in pasture vegetation cover; and
 increased quality, quantity, and productivity of forest cover in the Project area.

1.3     Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Global Environmental Objective was to preserve the mountain, forest, and grassland ecosystems of
the Southern Caucasus, through enhanced protected area and mountain ecosystem conservation and
sustainable management. Key indicators outlined in the PAD were the following:
 development of protected areas management plans for Lake Sevan National Park and Dilijan Nature
    Reserve--supported by local communities, adopted by Government, implemented in year two, and
    made subject to annual review; and
 achieve stable or increasing numbers of key indicator species according to population censuses taken
    in two of the last four years of the Project.

1.4    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
No formal World Bank Board revision of objectives or indicators was carried out. During the October
2005 Mid-term Review and supervision mission, some Project activities were reassessed and refined, but
the Project Development Objective and indicators as stated in the PAD were unchanged.

1.5    Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project's Global Environment objective and indicators were not revised.

1.6     Main Beneficiaries
During Appraisal, the two marzes focused on by the Project were among the poorest regions in Armenia.
Project beneficiaries were expected to comprise residents of around 100 villages within these two marzes
and expected benefits included increased incomes from more productive cropland, pasture, and forests.
The PAD defined a broad range of Project beneficiaries including forest harvesters, agricultural product
marketing agents, local and national environmental NGOs, local units of implementing agencies,
academic institutions (National Academy of Sciences, universities), local marza and village governments,
the private sector, and natural resource users in protected areas.

1.7     Original Components (as approved)
Project Components: The approved Project comprised four components.
Component 1: Community-Based Watershed Management (Total US$6.4 m.; of which IDA US$4.9
m. and GEF US$0.9 m.)
The component aimed to support preparation and implementation of community based micro-catchment
rehabilitation plans in selected villages. Plans were to be generated by each participating community,
selecting from a menu of activities to improve soils, pastures, and forest management, and eligible for
small grants to support small-scale local initiatives related to biodiversity conservation. Communities
could choose from the following menu of options:
a) Community forest management. Prepare and implement community forest management plans to
    rehabilitate and enrich forests through reforestation and afforestation, thinning; rehabilitate forest area
    pastures, demonstrate silvo-pastoral agro-forestry systems, and biogas production installations.
b) Small-grants for biodiversity conservation. Participating communities were eligible for grants up to
    US$5,000 to support local biodiversity conservation and reduce pressure on protected areas and
    biological resources.
c) Community pasture management. Rehabilitate hay meadows through reseeding, rotational grazing,
    and restoring degraded pasturelands; construct livestock watering points and reintroduce forage
    legumes into crop rotations.
d) Sustainable agricultural practices. Demonstrate cultivation of improved varieties of rain-fed barley
    and wheat, fertilizer use to improve soil fertility, and improved animal husbandry and bee keeping.
e) Community infrastructure and income generation. Invest in small water collection systems for
    irrigation, restore field tracks and culverts, rehabilitate road networks for management and protection
    of community forests, and implement measures to control landslides and gully erosion.
f) Development of Community Institutions. Provide support for village councils, marz-level
    organizations and village resource user groups to implement and monitor watershed and community
    forest plans. The Project was expected to finance small works, equipment, materials, and technical
    assistance; communities were expected to contribute labor. The GEF funds would finance technical
    assistance for measures to conserve forest biodiversity and to co-finance recovery costs for alpine
    meadows and steppes, including reseeding with indigenous grass species, and native wild fruit trees.

Component 2: State Forest Management (Total US$6.0 m.; of which IDA US$2.8 m.; GEF US$0.17
m.; Sida US$1.0 m. in parallel financing and later US$1.3 m. in co-financing).
This component aimed to support rehabilitation, protection and sustainable management of state forests in
the Project area; improve forest sector institutional, legal and policy framework; and enhance institutional
capacity to monitor and control forest operations. Two major sets of activities included the following:
a) Demonstrate improved forest management practices. (IDA US$2.48 m.) This sub-component
    provided support for (i) preparation of modern multipurpose state forest management plans; (ii) pre-
    commercial thinning and thinning of pole stands in naturally regenerated forests; (iii) measures for
    regeneration of over-mature, partially disintegrating stands by applying group selection felling and
    low-impact harvesting methods; (iv) reforestation of over-logged stands and afforestation of blanks in
    forests; (v) protection of forests against fires and insects; (vi) rehabilitation of the forest road network
    to implement approved forest management plans and efficient forest protection; (vi) strengthening
    forest service operational capacity and local branches; rehabilitate offices and equipment.
b) Strengthen legal and institutional frameworks and increase human resources capacity for
    sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. (IDA US$0.35 m.; GEF US$0.17 m.;
    parallel financing from Sida, US$1.0 m.). This component was to be implemented largely with Sida-
    financed resources through the Forest Institution Support Project to increase national and local
    capacity to implement sustainable forest management programs. It was expected to support: (i)
    review and improvement of forest-related legislation; (ii) improved marketing and pricing of forest
    products, including initiatives to reduce illegal logging and to undertake forest certification; (iii)
    organizational reform of Hayantar; (iv) development and delivery of training programs for staff of
    Hayantar, protected areas, extension, and inspection services; (v) rehabilitation of a national forest
    and biodiversity training center in Zikatar. During the life of the Project, Sida provided an additional
    US$1.3 m. co-financing to support forest institutional capacity as a full part of the NRMPRP.
Component 3: Protected Areas Management and Biodiversity Conservation (GEF US$3.48 m.).
This component was to support measures to: (i) improve the management two key protected areas (Lake
Sevan National Park and Dilijan State Reserve) for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity;
and (ii) improve the capacity of the Department of Bioresources and Land Protection of the MNP to meet
its biodiversity conservation mandate, including mainstreaming biodiversity in government policies, laws,
and activities of line ministries and marza governments.
a) Improve the management of Dilijan State Reserve and Lake Sevan National Park. Project support
     helped to prepare and implement management plans for Lake Sevan National Park and Dilijan State
     Reserve, which were expected to rationalize protected area boundaries. Specific component activities
     included: prepare participatory protected area management plans; develop monitoring systems and
     undertake applied studies to support improved management; provide professional development and
     training for protected areas staff and local stakeholders; build local awareness of protected areas'
     multiple objectives, encourage local participation in management; and establish park infrastructure
     and logistical support at Dilijan State Reserve and Lake Sevan National Park.
b) Build MNP capacity to administer the system of protected areas and build public awareness of
     biodiversity conservation. Reform key nature conservation legislation and regulations; mainstream
     biodiversity conservation into central and sectoral ministries' planning and policy processes;
     strengthen information dissemination; undertake rapid assessment of landscape-level biodiversity
     conservation at selected sites; and strengthen transboundary cooperation in biodiversity monitoring
     and protected-area management.
Component 4: Project Management and Administration. (Total US$1.1 m.; of which IDA US$0.5
m.; GEF US$0.5 m.).
Support Project administration and management. The Project planned to finance incremental operational
costs of Project management team, essential technical assistance for Project management (e.g., financial
management and procurement training, Project audit, institutional coordination, implementation



                                                       4
assistance to communities and public sector for capacity building, basic equipment and facilities, and PIU
operating costs).

1.8 Revised Components
Project components were not revised. During implementation, some delivery mechanisms were refined
after Mid-Term Review discussions but all Project components were retained.

1.9 Other significant changes
There were no significant changes to Project design, scope, or implementation arrangements. Changes
occurred in the implementation schedule, expenditure category allocations, and scale of some activities
(especially forest road rehabilitation, which was reduced). Due to the reasons listed in Section 2.2 below,
the Bank granted a request from the Ministry of Finance and Economy to extend the Project closing date
from July 31, 2008, to January 31, 2009. During the Project, Sida provided additional trust fund co-
financing of US$1.3 m. equivalent, supporting continued financing for institutional development
activities launched under the second component.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The Project was prepared with a US$360,000 grant from the Policy and Human Resource Development
Trust Fund, a US$180,000 Project Development Facility (PDF)-B grant from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), as well as several grants totaling US$73,000 from Consultant Trust Funds. The Project
was the first of its kind to support natural resource management in Armenia and to introduce participatory
methods for Project preparation and implementation. Preparation was intensive and took more than three
years from identification to approval, which yielded an impressive number of useful reports and design
documents. Final Project design was complex and proposed numerous and multi-level activities,
institutions, and stakeholders; Project designers attempted to include as many potentially relevant
elements as possible, which limited their success at prioritizing and focusing Project activities, as well as
strained limited local implementation capacity. Although Project design drew on lessons learned from
other projects in the region, not all of these were relevant for local Armenian institutions, legal
frameworks, and low capacity.
Project design represented then-prevailing practice of the logical framework to describe project inputs,
outputs, and outcomes. However, this was too complex to be very useful during implementation. In
hindsight, some critical risks identified in the PAD were understated; local institutional capacity to
provide technical assistance appears to have been overstated, as was the potential for pilot projects to be
replicated countrywide: therefore, "High" risk ratings might have been more appropriate for these risks.
The PAD also fell short on identifying the critical risk of weak government capacity to support or to adopt
innovation. Given these drawbacks, the overall "Substantial" risk rating for the Project was appropriate.

2.2 Implementation
Despite the long preparation process, the complex Project design may have hampered Project readiness
for implementation after effectiveness due to the vast array of design documents, inconsistencies among
them, and significantly underestimated costs, which may have contributed to some uncertainty throughout
implementation. Weak implementation capacity appeared to affect the first half of Project implementation
in particular, creating significant delays, low efficiency, and sub-optimal sequencing, which compromised
Project emphasis on integrated and participatory natural resource management. In hindsight, an early-on
focus to improve PIU capacity in participatory processes would have been useful because Armenia has




                                                     5
little experience, and some capacity-building for Project team members would have allowed them to
progress more rapidly, even though the PIU was hampered by continuous staff turnover.
Early stages of Project implementation were affected by design complexities coupled with a lack of local
experience with and understanding of integrated natural resource management. Project activity
sequencing appeared to be prioritized based on ease of implementation, rather than optimal Project
progression. For example, the biodiversity small grants program, and community forest management
activities were delayed until late in the Project, minimizing opportunities to institutionalize, refine, or
improve these activities and approaches. Finally, the Project struggled to surmount inherent design
problems linked to lack of component integration. The lengthy and extensive consultation processes
during preparation of protected area management plans for Lake Sevan and Dilijan National Parks
delayed actual Project implementation, diminishing opportunities to assess the investment impacts.
During implementation, it became clear that costs had been significantly underestimated--road
rehabilitation by some 10-fold, and forest management, about half--which required a major funding shift
among planned activities at the mid-term. Weak PIU capacity hampered the Project until the final year.
Initially, the PIU misunderstood its role and limited direct interaction with Project beneficiaries and local
communities, opting instead to act merely as contract managers, which confused local people about
institutional responsibilities for implementation.
The Mid-Term Review (MTR) achieved a significant turn-around when many implementation issues were
resolved by detailed Bank task team guidance. The PIU began to adopt an active role in working with
communities; funds were reallocated to meet increased demands and costs for forest management
planning activities; the scale of targets for severely underfinanced activities, such as road rehabilitation,
were reduced; and community participation in Project implementation activities increased substantially,
which significantly raised local awareness, understanding, and ownership of Project activities.
The Sida contributions were instrumental in achieving clear supportive regulatory and institutional
backing for good forest management. Sida funds were phased: first, as parallel financing for the Forest
Institution Support Project; and second, as co-financing during the Project's second half. Sida support
helped establish the legal and policy framework as a foundation for many Project forestry activities,
including the Illegal Logging Action Plan, the National Forest Policy, and forest legislation and
regulation development. Sida also financed training and other capacity building that strengthened
institutional abilities, especially to detect and counteract illegal logging.
Throughout the Project, Government ownership and commitment was good. At Project midpoint,
institutional responsibilities for forestry shifted to the Ministry of Agriculture from the Ministry of Nature
Protection. Some coordination challenges were encountered, but overcome; solid Ministry-level
ownership was not always matched by implementing agencies. For example, Government made a
commitment to community forest management, but Hayantar did not, and implementation of community
forestry activities suffered from a weak enabling legal framework and lack of institutional will.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
The Project was designed with broad goals and ambitious indicators, with only a vague notion of
methodology for monitoring progress, outcomes, or impacts. Even though most indictors were
measurable, at Project closing it was unrealistic to expect that short-term changes in some indicators
could be measured over the Project life span given that: (i) some baselines were not available; (ii) short-
term changes were unlikely to be detected; and (iii) changes could not be attributed unequivocally to
Project interventions.1


1
 At that time, many Bank operations had Key Indicators that were less easy to monitor or track, whereas now, operations focus
on monitoring progress and a results orientation.


                                                             6
As a result, developing longer-term capacity to establish baselines and monitor biodiversity became an
important Project goal. Typically, monitoring biodiversity conservation impacts requires identifying key
indicator species, establishing baseline population levels, and long-term monitoring of changes in habitat
quality. In this Project, the proposed use of indicator species to track Project impacts was unrealistic as
were several indicators that had been proposed at Appraisal because they required systematic and costly
data collection that was not envisaged at the outset and for which no capacity existed.
During Project preparation, at Mid-term, and prior to ICR preparation, household surveys were carried
out to help assess Project impacts on household expenditures, to provide feedback to implementing
agencies on the status of Project components, particularly watershed rehabilitation, and for reference
during Project supervision visits.
The Project established other measures for monitoring protected area management effectiveness (Annex
6). The Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) was prepared with the
assistance of the World Bank/WWF Forest Alliance to provide an overarching framework for assessing
management effectiveness of protected areas and systems to guide decision-making and help harmonize
assessments worldwide. The METT is organized around the assessment framework identified by the
World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) and is a mandated reporting tool for GEF-financed
biodiversity conservation operations. It was translated into Armenian and was used by the park
management teams in Sevan and Dilijan to establish performance baselines and to monitor progress in
improving management effectiveness.
Project-supported forest management plans were derived from extensive inventories that also provided a
baseline. The Project improved capacity to monitor long-term forest and watershed changes, for example,
strengthening the Forest State Monitoring Center (FSMC) and the Bio-Resources Management Agency
(including with GIS capacity--a new tool for Armenia). Through these activities and the capacity created
by introducing innovative forest management planning and inventory tools, the Project made a major
contribution towards establishing scientific monitoring and evaluation systems and the basis of
sustainable forest management.
As greater emphasis began to be placed on developing clear Project results, the Bank team worked with
the implementing agencies to retrofit the original Log Frame into a `Results Framework,' providing
baselines where possible, defining intermediate outcome indicators, and defining progress reporting
requirements. Outcomes against this matrix are summarized in the Data Sheet. In some respects, the
Framework is qualitative, reflecting system-wide changes in thinking and institutional approaches that the
Project sought to catalyze.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards compliance. During preparation, it was determined that the Project would trigger Safeguard
Policies on Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) and the Project
was classified as a Category B investment; an Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in
accordance with the OP 4.01 and in compliance with environmental regulations in Armenia. An
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared to establish adequate mitigation measures. The
Bank monitored performance against the EMP throughout Project implementation. Overall, Project
safeguard and fiduciary compliance was satisfactory throughout the Project.
The EA raised concerns about illegal logging and poor forest management. To mitigate potential adverse
environmental impacts, the EMP outlined measures including policy, institutional, and legal reforms to
counteract illegal logging and pilot forest certification. At the time of Appraisal, the Safeguards Policy on
Forests (OP 4.36) was relevant only to tropical forests, but the OP was revised in 2003 to include all
forests. Therefore, measures were included in the EMP to ensure compliance with anticipated OP
revisions. During implementation, pre-commercial thinning and low-impact harvesting were dropped



                                                     7
from the Project since the Government was not ready to set a timetable to meet international standards for
forest certification. That said, it completed two pre-certification assessments.
The Project also included provisions for forest pest control, which would normally trigger the Safeguards
Policy on Pest Management (OP 4.09), but this appears to have been overlooked at Appraisal. During
implementation, the Bank team established measures to ensure that OP 4.09 was adhered to and sought
support from USDA Forest Department to prepare an institutional capacity assessment for forest pest
management. The assessment concluded that Armenian standards were inadequate to comply with the
Bank's pest management policies without substantial investments, and therefore planned investments for
pesticide procurement were dropped.
The Project triggered OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) because under the biodiversity conservation
component, internal zoning of protected areas to be carried out in conjunction with preparation of the
National Park Management Plans might restrict local people's access to natural resources within Park
boundaries. The Process Framework focused on how poor rural communities' needs would be addressed.
The participatory process for the Management Plan met key objectives outlined in the Process Framework.
At Appraisal, a longstanding Government decision had been in place to raise the level of Lake Sevan to
address some environmental problems. During the Soviet era, buildings had been constructed along the
lakeshore, but during Appraisal, these were derelict and abandoned State properties, destined to be
inundated by raised water levels in Lake Sevan. Nothing in the EA, EMP, or Lake Sevan Management
Plan suggested that any of these derelict state-owned properties was occupied, or that any scope existed
for their occupation. However, in or about 2004, some state-owned lake shore properties (in what is now
the Park's Recreation Zone) were leased to investors on long-term leases, and some of these half-built,
abandoned Soviet era buildings became the object of investments to expand and modernize them. These
leaseholder investments could be put at risk by the rising lake level but the question of disposition of
these properties is beyond the scope and capacity of the National Park Administration to address, and will
have to be resolved at the political level through sustained consultation and discussion.
Fiduciary compliance. Overall fiduciary compliance was satisfactory; Project financial management was
aligned with DCA provisions. In general, Project procurement complied with relevant World Bank
procedures, with minor exceptions. Initially, procurement operations were slow, which sometimes slowed
overall Project implementation, due primarily to procurement officers' lack of experience and high staff
turnover. Several cases of alleged misuse of Project funds that were identified during supervision were
referred to World Bank Integrity Vice Presidency for investigation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The Project was implemented by existing Armenian institutions. A local firm was contracted to perform
community-level services under the first component. The Project established a PIU as an operational unit
of the MNP and financed it until May 30, 2009, to ensure smooth closing arrangements. Government is
interested in maintaining the PIU to provide project management services for other Ministry projects.
Institutions that participated in the Project are well-placed to continue project activities. The Project-
supported national park management plans provide a roadmap to guide operations of Dilijan and Sevan
National Parks and the work of SNCOs charged with their management. Similarly, Project-supported
forest management plans describe interventions for five forest enterprises, and are aligned with their
financial and institutional capacity.
To remain relevant, national park and forest management plans require financing and monitoring; and the
Government expressed its intention to provide funding and monitor these plans during the ICR mission
discussions. Monitoring plans are specified in the management plans. Implementing agencies have
increased capacity, staff, and equipment, thanks to Project investments and Government commitment.
During the Project, Government substantially increased budgets and salaries, and Hayantar was



                                                    8
transformed through improved salaries, working conditions, and productivity, due to completion of
Project-supported forest management plans.
Some activities carried out under the watershed component could experience long-term sustainability
constraints if new village administrations are not continuously engaged and funded. A significant Project
strength was using local community institutions and engaging local administrations in natural resource
management activities; but Project-supported Resource User Groups, intended to empower local
stakeholders, were less effective than envisaged at Appraisal. In addition, activities such as the
fertilization program for pasture and hay meadows may be unsustainable due to high input costs.
Future Bank-supported NRMPRP-type activities may be aided by a new Country Partnership Strategy
that proposes a two-pillar approach for the next Bank lending cycle: to address problems of vulnerability,
and promote competitiveness and growth. Armenia will move from IDA to IDA/IBRD blend status;
availability of GEF resources through the Bank is likely to decline--factors that Government must
consider when seeking future Bank support for NRMPRP­type activities. Clearly, investments in forest
management and degraded land rehabilitation would benefit vulnerable populations and create jobs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Project contributed to substantial improvements in Armenia's natural resources management and
planning, raised public awareness, and improved institutional capacity, despite some Project design
challenges. Project global and development objectives, design components, and implementation activities
are not only fully consistent with, but also helped to shape, Armenian national and global environmental
management priorities. They reflect strategic objectives and activities identified in the Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) during Project preparation, and remain relevant to the current Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) priorities for environment and natural resource management, and increasing
quality and effectiveness of public services.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
When the Project was prepared and launched, rural communities had few livelihood alternatives to over
exploiting their natural resources and Armenia was facing rapid deforestation resulting from urgent
demand for firewood. Natural resources management institutions were new and had yet to develop
effective policies, legislation, or capacity. The Project was an ambitious, pioneering attempt to integrate
natural resource management through technical, social, and institutional channels, and as such, a few
envisioned activities were unrealistic and dropped, such as forest pest management and pre-commercial
thinning, or were reduced in scope, such as forest roads. Furthermore, several activities' sustainability
may be at risk. Nevertheless, the Project made important advances in natural resources management and
therefore is rated moderately satisfactory. Key achievements include the following:

a) Improved policy, institutional, and legal framework for natural resource management. The
   Project significantly improved Armenian policy, institutional, and legal frameworks for natural
   resource management, and piloted strategic investments in forest and protected areas, and in rural
   agricultural landscapes. The country has begun to address environmental and natural resource
   management in a more integrated manner because the Project successfully increased local, regional,
   and national awareness and understanding of the socio-economic implications among policymakers
   and citizens. Government is now focusing on the challenge of harmonizing socio-economic and
   environmental protection objectives, and will begin to use the Project-supported frameworks for
   further investments, and Project-supported capacity for achieving more effective outcomes.



                                                    9
b) Introduced best practices for natural resource management. The Project demonstrated successful
   sustainable natural resource management practices that have been adopted. Mountain communities in
   Tavush and Gegharkunik marzes have implemented watershed management plans, reduced
   destructive practices on pasture and forest resources, and protected some of the most fragile lands,
   creating some visible improvements in vegetative cover. The Project successfully demonstrated
   improved land management practices that have improved rural livelihoods. In forestry, the first
   management plans since the 1980s were completed for five key forest enterprises; forest certification
   was piloted through two pre-assessments; community forest management plans have been piloted,
   setting an important precedent for advancing this critical area. Sustainability of these good practices
   will hinge on adoption by local governing bodies and MNP.

c) Reduced illegal logging. The Project catalyzed the development of important mechanisms to
   counteract illegal logging. With Sida support, the Project contributed to developing and implementing
   an Illegal Logging Action Plan (ILAP). Technical assistance supported an independent Forest State
   Monitoring Center, and provided information on forest offenses and legal processes to the State
   Oversight Board for Illegal Logging. Project activities catalyzed support to counteract illegal logging
   through policy and financing mechanisms, such as the PRSC Series, and PHRD and IDF grants.
   These actions, plus increased rural gasification (recommended by ILAP), are helping to reduce illegal
   practices and stabilize forest and biodiversity resources. Recent surveys indicate that national levels
   of illegal logging may have dropped as much as 50 percent during the Project life.

d) Strengthened capacity for biodiversity conservation. GEF-funded activities mainstreamed
   biodiversity conservation activities into policies, regulations, and activities of line ministries and local
   governments. The Project triggered inter-sectoral discussions on land use in and around protected
   areas and succeeded in developing protected area management plans for Lake Sevan National Park
   and Dilijan National Park and launching activities to transform them from so-called `paper parks,' to
   alignment with modern international good practice. Zoning and management planning of the Dilijan
   and Lake Sevan National Parks drew on ecosystem studies, especially plant and animal species and
   their habitats, and detailed forest inventories.

e) Built institutional capacity. The Project has been instrumental in supporting institutional and
   regulatory framework reforms for forest management and nature protection, especially new forest
   legislation, new National Forest Policy and Strategy, and new legislation and regulations on
   biodiversity conservation and protected area management. Management plans are established and
   under implementation for two national parks and five forest enterprises. Experience gained through
   preparing management plans has created capacity to prepare and finalize management plans in other
   protected areas and forest enterprises. The Project helped clarify institutional structures, roles, and
   organizations among line agencies responsible for natural resource management; it strengthened the
   operational capacity of the State Forest Corporation (Hayantar), the Ministry of Nature Protection, the
   FSMC, the two SNCOs responsible for management of the Lake Sevan and Dilijan National Parks,
   and many associated units by providing training and facilities and by helping to clarify their roles and
   functions. When the Project closed, the forestry institutional restructuring proposals were incomplete
   but they had fostered healthy debate on options for checks and balances in forest management.
   Finally, these processes themselves have strengthened institutional capacity to tackle similar issues in
   the future, as has the extensive training that took place under the Project. Much work remains to sort
   out conflicting legislation and the duplication of institutional responsibilities, but the Project helped
   Armenia advance on the legal and institutional framework needed for natural resource management,
   and created a national platform for stakeholders to address issues of common concern.

3.3 Efficiency



                                                      10
A cost-benefit analysis on Project benefits and efficiency used some assumptions from the PAD, plus
actual outputs at Project closing to quantify economic and financial benefits. Efficiency was evaluated by
the extent to which non-GEF funds could be leveraged to achieve Project objectives. See Annex 3 for a
detailed ERR analysis, a summarized version appears below.
An IDA credit of US$8.3 million was invested in Project activities in all three components; little IDA
financing was used in the Protected Areas component; Government contributed some US$1.5 million.
The benefits can be derived by examining the values of the watershed component activities (improved
environmental conditions and reduced poverty), the regeneration and rehabilitation of forest areas, and
benefits of reduced illegal logging.
Component 1 activities generated total benefits of US$29,269,738--some US$28,257,600 in improved
local incomes and US$1,012,038 in environmental benefits (reduced sediment flows and improved water
retention). IDA allocation for this Component was US$4,953,900 and adding Government contributions
provided an allocation of US$5,473,800; therefore, the ERR is estimated at 14.5 percent. Component 2
activities generated an overall benefit of US$24,534,518 in reforestation/afforestation, and the ERR is
estimated to be 13.3 percent. IDA allocation for Component 2 was US$2,833,900, and with Government
contribution allocations equaled US$3,514,900; hence, the ERR is estimated at 13.3 percent. The total
Project ERR (IDA plus Government contribution to Component 4) is estimated at 13.0 percent.
Component 3 was financed by a GEF Grant (US$3,489,000) plus modest Government funding
(US$179,500). Financial and economic efficiency were evaluated by the degree to which non-GEF funds
could be leveraged to achieve Project objectives, a basic assumption of GEF Incremental Cost Analysis.
An estimated US$5.1 million in non-GEF contributions anticipated at appraisal was exceeded by more
than US$1000,000 after accounting for second Sida contribution. The GEF funds were leveraged by the
IDA credit, Sida contribution, and Government commitments (see Tables in Annex 3). In total, GEF
contributed an additional US$935,200 to Component 1; US$175,500 to Component 2; and US$515,400 to
Component 3. Overall, GEF funds were leveraged in the co-financing ratio of more than 1 to 2.3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project is significant for Armenia and the results have been inspiring. Despite a slow start due to
design complexity and limited local implementation capacity, considerable improvements boosted the
pace of implementation as well as project progress following the Mid-Term Review, and momentum also
intensified during the final year of project implementation when PIU management improved. As a result,
improvements took place in national- and local-level implementation performance and meeting Project
objectives. Nevertheless, at project completion, all of the anticipated PAD outcomes were not attained
(particularly in community forestry), and late implementation of some activities left little time to
consolidate or replicate. Therefore, overall project performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The Project was designed to focus on poverty alleviation in two of Armenia's poorest marzes, and during
2002-08, income increased 22 percent. Some livelihood activities such as bee keeping and legume fodder
planting have significantly raised rural incomes. Vulnerable groups identified at Appraisal received
special attention through training--refugees, households with migrant workers, users of products from
protected areas--which raised their acceptance of protective resource management practices.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project made remarkable advances in achieving clear and supportive legislative and institutional
backing for good forest management, especially given the backdrop of the weak and often conflicting



                                                   11
regulatory and institutional environment in place at Appraisal. Sida parallel financing in the first three
years, followed by Sida co-financing, was crucial to support forest sector institutional reforms. The
Project, supported by associated PRSC-DPL reforms, was instrumental in supporting: (i) the
development, using a highly participatory process, of a National Forest Policy and Strategy (approved
September 2004); (ii) the preparation and approval of a 2004 Illegal Logging Action Plan; (iii) the
development of a National Forest Program (2005); (iv) the adoption of a new Forest Code with principles
of modern sustainable forest management (ratified November 2005); (v) the drafting of Community
Forest Management Regulations; and (vi) substantial institutional capacity building. The Project also
supported proposals to restructure the forestry institutional framework, which is now undergoing
incremental reforms. Similar, less extensive reforms were also supported for nature protection.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
During the Project, an unintended outcome was the dramatic increase in budgetary allocations to forest
institutions, which significantly improved the performance and effectiveness of these institutions towards
the end of the Project. Originally, the institutional framework for natural resource management was
extremely weak but the Project helped build awareness of the forest sector through extensive multi-
stakeholder discussions about Armenia's national forest policy and legal framework; through this process,
the Project also helped highlight the benefits of better forest management and the difficult financial
position of Hayantar.
Project design did not anticipate the important synergies required in tackling illegal logging. This was
addressed during implementation through the following measures: Sida provided additional funds to
develop a strategic approach to counteract illegal logging through FISP, which complemented FSMC
establishment (a measure included in the PRSC series), technical assistance provided to the Ministry of
Finance's under a PHRD grant, a second round of Sida assistance, and support for the FSMC from the
Institutional Development Fund--therefore, the Project was able to take advantage of multiple
opportunities to tackle this problem.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
During the Project, many workshops took place ranging from discussions on national legislation to zoning
of conservation areas that included stakeholders from national and local government agencies,
universities, NGOs, and local communities. No specific workshops were held for the preparation of ICR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The Project helped establish a solid foundation for improved watershed, biodiversity, and protected area
management. Sustainability will depend on national-level institutional ownership and support. Indications
are that project-supported activities will be sustainable:
  Some villages succeeded in using the Project to change practices for using agricultural land, pastures,
     and forest resources.
  Government provided funding for state forest area management planning for all remaining forest
     areas in Armenia--all 19 forest enterprises aim to have management plans by 2010.
  Since 2004, Government funding of the forestry sector has increased 10-fold. Forest officers
     continue to receive low wages and to be poorly equipped, but their situation has improved and
     Hayantar is better equipped to implement its new forest management plans.
  Hayantar is now voluntarily rehabilitating up to 9,000 ha per year with public funding; in 2002,
     during Project Appraisal, no ongoing forest rehabilitation operations existed.
  Illegal logging appears to have dropped by almost 50 percent since Project inception, according to
     Hayantar (annual survey of individual trees cut) and by the FSMC.

    The Zikatar Forest Training Center, through FREC, is now fully operational and implementing
    business and marketing plans prepared with Project support, to ensure self-financing and
    sustainability. After its 2007 opening, the Center hosted the International Union of Forest Research
    Organization's (IUFRO) regional meeting on forest legislation, in 2008, it hosted seven training
    events, and the Center has potential for regional use due to its proximity (70km) to Tbilisi. It has
    been selected as a regional training center by the UN Desertification Convention.
    The relatively independent FSMC, which reports to the State Oversight Board for Monitoring Illegal
    Logging, is compiling essential general data on Armenian forests and inappropriate forest practices.
    This center continues to receive significant support from the budget and other sources and carry out a
    priority function specified in the Illegal Logging Action Plan.
    Government adoption of the new law on protected areas provided an essential framework for
    improved management. Fundamental conditions for sustaining operation of these protected areas
    includes legal designation of the two National Parks, mapping and registering their boundaries with
    land cadastre, improved capacity, and providing basic infrastructure to these Park administrations.
    Two high-quality Project-supported products were the management plans for the two National Parks
    and a computerized biodiversity monitoring system. Systematic and meaningful application of these
    useful tools for protected areas management will depend on National Parks administrations, and
    guidance and leadership on behalf of the MNP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project was designed to introduce strategic innovations in natural resource management to Armenia,
and targeted some of the most challenging environmental degradation using a multi-sectoral and
community-based approach. Significant efforts in Project preparation meant that project components were
well developed, albeit overly complex. Initial Project preparation was carried out by three consulting
firms--one for each component, with little coordination among them, and financed by separate sources: a
PDF-B GEF grant and TACIS grants. This resulted in three separate designs that did not factor how,
during implementation, the Project's components could be integrated. Implementation was also hindered
by overestimating government institutional management capacity, as well as underestimating the
manageability of many critical issues and associated project activity costs.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank staff conducted regular and frequent supervision missions during Project implementation. After the
MTR, frequent videoconferences complemented these visits and allowed the Bank team to maintain a
continuous dialogue with the client and also to provide continued technical support. Over the Project
lifetime and particularly after the MTR, supervision focused on ways to address implementation
constraints. The Project had a slow start, but even before the MTR and during earlier supervision
missions the Bank provided significant technical oversight and worked with the government so that
needed adjustments were made to address implementation bottlenecks. Supervision frequency was
appropriate and helped keep the Project on track. During the Project lifetime, the Bank and Project teams
worked to refine the M&E framework to include measurable targets; the Bank team also provided close
oversight to ensure compliance with OP 4.09 and OP 4.36.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory, due to noted shortcomings in Project design; at the
MTR, the Bank and Government worked to identify achievable targets and outcomes to measure



                                                   13
achievement of Project objectives. Project Task Team Leaders (TTLs) established a strong and highly
supportive relationship with the PIU, which strengthened Project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Performance of two key partners, the Ministries of Nature Protection, and Agriculture, is rated
Satisfactory based on Government commitment to Project objectives, and support for sector reform
consistent with Project objectives. Government honored all of its commitments in a timely fashion,
increased by multiple increments the budget and salaries of personnel in natural resource management
institutions, resolved project issues in a timely manner, and met all fiduciary responsibilities.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project experienced delays in the first two to three years after project effectiveness due to an overly
complex project design and innovations that made implementation difficult. The PIU had to overcome a
steep learning curve and had high staff turnover. During the first phase of the project, the PIU did not
have a full understanding of its responsibilities and its limited interaction with project beneficiaries and
local communities fell far short of creating the necessary project identity in participating villages. The
MTR recommended strong continuous interaction between the PIU and villages during all phases of
Project introduction, awareness building, planning and implementation; this improved understanding and
ownership among local communities, but only in the Project's final year, under a newly appointed
director, was the PIU exceptionally proactive in furthering project objectives.
Implementation delays lead to the revision and scaling-down of several project activities; progress
reporting was weak throughout the Project prompting the Task Team to introduce regular video/audio
conferences with the PIU after MTR, which helped resolve urgent implementation issues. Action plan
agreements developed during periodic supervision missions between the PIU and the Bank task team
were usually implemented, though not always in a timely manner.
Project financial management was notably strong throughout implementation, as reflected in audit reports.
Because Bank procurement procedures were new to the country and PIU, initial misunderstandings and
delays resulted; however, with the support of Bank procurement specialists, procurement planning and
management improved substantially.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on commitment to and attainment of
Project objectives. Much progress was made and most Project activities were completed satisfactorily;
some Project activities remained incomplete despite the momentum gained in the final year under the
improved management of the new project director, who succeeded in achieving many project targets.
Concerns remain about what needs be done to fully integrate lessons learned and new practices into
regular forestry and protected area planning and management. Maintaining strong leadership and political
commitment will be essential to build on Project progress in managing protected areas, biodiversity
conservation, and sustainable forestry.

6. Lessons Learned
Some key lessons learned from the project include:
Project design should be based on a shared understanding of objectives and outcomes as well as an
accurate assessment of local implementation capacity to achieve them. Introducing new approaches,
such as beneficiary participation in selecting activities, initially created confusion and implementation
inefficiencies. Also, project implementers were overburdened with a multitude of project subcomponents
involving different institutions and stakeholders.


                                                     14
Project design should take into consideration timing requirements if project objectives rely on
policy and legal changes, or objectives should be aligned with the existing policies and legal
framework if the timeframe is tight. Several project activities hinged on legal reform, which created
delays for these activities and others dependent on them, effectively compressing much of project
implementation in the last two years of project life.
Sustainable Natural Resource Management requires strong beneficiary commitment: After the
MTR, Project activities were funded only after villages had signed resource management agreements that
committed them to managing natural resources in accordance with watershed and grazing management
plans; when this process was followed, the likelihood of sustainability increased. Early in the Project,
activities were implemented in villages without this prior commitment, and as such, were largely
ineffective.
Participatory approaches require extra time to introduce the concept and involve local stakeholders.
The time for developing management plans was underestimated for Lake Sevan and Dilijan National
Parks because the concept was new to Government and clearance procedures took a long time. Delays in
development and adoption of management plans are common for Armenia, so developing protected area
management plans should occur early in the project cycle to allow for full implementation.
The capacity of Bilateral donors to supervise parallel financed activities should be assessed during
design. Institutional and legal reforms in a sector such as forestry, characterized by multiple conflicting
interests, require time and continual oversight. Parallel grant financing from Sida (the FISP support) was
essential to Project achievements; however, its monitoring was complex. The second Sida grant (i.e., co-
financing) was more successful in mainstreaming project activities in the Ministries because it was
directly managed by the PIU, and had clearer TORs and monitoring.
Donor coordination and collaboration are essential to tackle complex problems such as illegal
logging that benefit from harmonizing experiences and funding potential. Collaborating early on is
important, as is coordinating funding from multiple outside sources, as in this Project. In Armenia, an
Illegal Logging Action Plan was developed early on using a participatory process as well as applying
funds and expertise from, inter alia: the PRSC-DPL (a prior action); PHRD grant (technical assistance to
the FSMC); Sida (financing for advancing legislative and institutional reforms and training); IDF grant
(strengthening monitoring capacity) and this Project (ensuring an overall, cohesive approach).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Draft ICR was shared with the Armenian Government for their comments. Overall, the Government
was satisfied with its quality and they believe that the ICR assessed the project with consideration of both
achievements and omissions. The Ministry finds that there is no need to place any limitation whatsoever
on the publication of the evaluation results.
(b) Cofinanciers
The Draft ICR was shared with Sida for their comments. Overall, Sida was satisfied with its quality and
they believe that the ICR conveyed the picture on the ground.

                                   Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Progress was mixed on Project components--considerable achievements in some areas and less
satisfactory performance, outputs, and outcomes for others.

Component 1: Community-based Watershed Management

Overall, Component 1 outcomes have been substantial, but short of fully meeting expectations at
Appraisal. The Project generated substantial awareness and understanding of improved natural resource
management. Many communities used the Project to implement sustainable improvements in their use of
natural resources; some villages have successfully demonstrated improved and comprehensive natural
resource management and have pioneered examples for sustainable watershed management. Outcomes on
biodiversity conservation through the small grants scheme and community forest management remain
behind appraisal expectations.

Watershed Management Plans and Village Agreements were implemented only in the fourth and fifth
groups of villages (some 40 of the 100 project villages that entered the Project after the Mid-Term
Review (MTR). They entailed detailed resource management plans, including specific actions for grazing
and fodder management. Reference maps and detailed management measures for individual village areas
have been carried out in some villages but must still be posted at mayors' offices and discussed in village
meetings, in particular with village shepherds, who need to understand and adopt grazing management
arrangements. Project visibility remains in the villages with signboards and documentation materials
posted in the field and the mayor's offices. Using existing institutions to engage the local administration
in natural resource management activities was a Project strong point, but not without shortcomings. For
example, not all villages had strong and engaged local leaders, and sustainable management practices
depend to some extent on future engagement of active village mayors and village administrations to
maintain continuity of Project natural resource management achievements. New village administrations
are often less familiar with the Project and therefore less committed. Resource User Groups created under
the Project were intended to organize local stakeholders but were less powerful and effective than
envisaged at Appraisal.

Common Natural Resource Management/Protection Activities. Each village received US$15,000 for tree
planting, fencing, and demarcation for protection and natural regeneration of degraded land and gully
protection works. Some 1,554 ha of multipurpose trees were planted, 69 km of fences and 14 gully
protection measures were implemented. In general, tree planting was carried out on highly degraded
community pasture land and on slopes sensitive to soil erosion, using a mixture of local indigenous forest
and fruit species, and horticulture trees, such as walnut, plum, apricot, apple, pears or cherries. Most
plantings are protected by Project-supported fences. These activities were implemented with community
participation. Survival rates and plantation conditions were generally satisfactory especially after
additional efforts to water seedlings and/or replant. Most plantations are expected to provide protection
and generate income from fruit and nut harvesting but lack of resources to maintain plantations after
Project closing could erode sustainability. Several villages have already contracted out plantation
management or plan to do so, which would increase the likelihood that this investment is sustainable.

Natural Resource Management for Livelihood Improvement. Under the Project, each village received
US$35,000 to invest in their choice from a list of livelihood improvement activities that included
constructing stock watering points, restoring field tracks, fertilizing community pastures, improving and
rehabilitating village hay meadows, reintroducing forage legumes into crop rotations, improved wheat and
spring barley technology demonstrations, and bee keeping for honey. Contractors implemented these
activities, supervised by villagers and the PIU.



                                                    17
The Project provided support for stock watering points and field tracks, which facilitate access to remote
pasture and fodder, promote more rational resource use, and reduce pressure on the land. Under the
Project, some 782km of field tracks were improved and 102 stock water points were constructed, which
facilitated access to over 20,000ha of pasture and hay meadowland and some 3,200ha of crop land; an
estimated 30,000 head of livestock use the stock watering points. Villagers were highly appreciative of
these activities, which reduced pressure on local overgrazed land and forest resources.

Project-supported grass and fodder production introduced legumes and fertilizing of hay meadow and
pasture areas, which increases pasture fertility and the availability of winter fodder so that early and late
grazing can be curtailed, thereby reducing pressure on overgrazed land. Some 6,000ha of community
pastures and 2,900ha of hay meadows were fertilized and 2,340ha of legumes were planted; fodder
production is well established in the communities and has gained momentum. Some communities are
expanding legume production by producing seed from Project areas. Combines, provided under other
projects such as the World Bank-financed RESCAD project, have supported commercial legume seed
production. Leguminous fodder production is also important and expected to expand post-Project.
However, sustainability of the fertilization program for pasture and hay meadows remains questionable
despite implementation changes introduced at the MTR that called for gradual cost-sharing arrangements.
The effect of pasture fertilization on biodiversity was assessed due to concerns that Alpine pasture areas
with a rich composition of indigenous plant species may have been affected by fertilization. However, the
impact appears to be small and temporary, although no precise data are available.

The Project provided 2,260 beehives to villagers up until June 2007, an income-generating activity that
was enthusiastically received. Local farmers report a good market for honey in Armenia, where one
beehive can produce 10-20kg that sells for US$10 per kg, yielding some US$70-140 per beehive per year.
The initial number of bee families has been substantially increased, for example, in Agahvnavank, from
60 Project-provided beehives to around 250 at the time of the ICR.

Early during the Project, 12 biogas production demonstration units were installed in Project villages;
these use livestock manure to produce methane gas for cooking or heating. In winter, some methane gas is
required to heat the digester to sustain methane production. The biogas units, at about US$2,200, were
fully Project-financed and given to larger households with access to sufficient livestock dung (from 8-10
head) to keep the units operating. Most units have successfully produced biogas and some are still in use,
but the investment costs did not justify the potential gas production so this activity was discontinued after
the MTR. The Project demonstrated that this technology is feasible, but farmers declined to adopt it if
they had to use their own funds to build biogas units.

Demonstration Villages. Three villages-- Vaghashen, Berdavan and Agahvnavank--were selected from
the first round of Project villages, based on strong local leadership and commitment to comprehensive
natural resource management. An extra US$50,000 was provided to these villages to demonstrate that
sustainable resource management is feasible and could increase local incomes. Overall, in the
demonstration villages, improved resource management benefits were clear and visible, and in at least
two villages, the Project contributed new ideas that enabled local leaders to develop their strategies for
livestock production, grazing management, and community-owned land resource use.

In Vaghashen, the Project's visible impact on key village area land resources include increased grass
coverage of protected and managed grazing land, and well-managed stands of fruit trees and shrubs that
are expected to provide additional income. The village mayor has proposed using lessons learned from the
Project to help restructure village livestock production by introducing improved breeds, adopting more
fodder cut and carry, and reducing overall grazing--intentions that demonstrate changed thinking about
land resource use.



                                                     18
In Agahvnavank, some Project activities were delayed by lack of clarity on borders and land access rights
involving village authorities and the nearby Dilijan National Park, but the Project is now fully
implemented and results exceeded expectations. The village established a comprehensive resource
management plan: pastures have visible demarcation for improved grazing management; several highly
degraded areas are fully protected for regeneration and most of these are planted with trees and shrubs for
faster re-vegetation. Local people now collect wild berries, which have begun to grow back on these lands.

At Project end, two of the three demonstration villages have become public outreach tools--they model
more sustainable natural resource management so the larger audience of other villagers in Armenia can
understand and commit to better natural resource use. Government organizations, NGOs, and the public
can learn from Project villages and scale up their activities.

Community Small Grants Scheme for Biodiversity: The Project provided US$250,000 for financing small
community-driven investment projects, up to US$5,000 per project, awarded through competition. Funds
were supported under the GEF grant to assist Armenia to meet its commitments under the Convention on
Biological diversity. Implementation of this activity was delayed such that it was delinked from the
remaining watershed management component. However, the sub-component was implemented in three
rounds of applications with 28 proposals executed. Most of the early proposals failed to show a clear
biodiversity conservation impact, but over the three rounds, improvements were noticeable toward
measurement of the biodiversity conservation objective. The importance of conserving biodiversity was
not well understood among local villagers, who were expected to be the source of investment proposals.
As a result, the approach was changed toward the end of the Project. It was decided that the
subcomponent would be supported by professional inputs from Government, research institutions, and
NGOs working in biodiversity conservation. Four additional proposals were implemented involving the
two local universities that undertook training and awareness building, and two proposals that included
video documentaries for training and awareness-raising in schools, local communities, and civil society.
These four proposals have potential to raise awareness of biodiversity well beyond the Project areas.

Community Forest Management: This sub-component was intended to support three key activities to be
implemented in phases, each step depending on successful implementation of the previous one: 1)
develop community forestry management plans for former kolkhoz and sovkhoz forest areas; 2) legally
transfer forest areas management rights and responsibilities to local communities or village-level
organizations; and 3) invest in rehabilitation, reforestation, enrichment planting, or other improvements.
This sub-component was a key element of the overall Project objective of improved natural resources
management, since these forests are crucial village natural resources assets that suffer from severe
deforestation and damage inflicted by grazing.

Contract management issues in community forest management plan preparation delayed implementation
of this sub-component. Only seven of 12 planned forestry management plans were prepared, but at the
time of the ICR, none had yet been approved. Late in the Project, some physical plantation and forest
rehabilitation works were implemented, but were not fully completed. Community forest management
planning, though significantly delayed and not completed to a stage of full transfer of management rights,
has established an important precedent and prepared the ground for a new concept of forestry
management in Armenia. Under the Project, seven community forest management organizations were set
up to be in charge of implementing physical works for the community forest rehabilitation financed under
the Project. These were intended to initiate establishment of other community forest management
organizations as envisaged under national law. Based on this Project, discussions on more formal
arrangements with communities about forest management have progressed steadily over the past years.
Based on the above discussion, overall, this component is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Component 2: State Forest Management.


                                                   19
Management planning. The Project aimed to demonstrate improved management practices by providing
resources to prepare and initiate implementation of forest management plans for a targeted 70,000 ha of
Armenia's 334,100 ha of forests. To date, management plans are complete for 128,000 ha of forest, for
the Forest Enterprises of Ijevan, Sevqar, Tsambarak, Artsvaberd and Novemberyan. The first two (i.e.,
from original targets) are approved, while the last three (introduced during Mid-Term Review) have
passed the environmental assessment process and are ready for Ministerial approval--doubling projected
targets, and paving the way for mainstreaming modern principles of sustainable forest management.

Pre-commercial thinning and thinning of pole stands in naturally regenerated forests. This proposed
Project activity was never implemented. The Project Environmental Management Plan specified a forest
certification process before initiating forest management with Bank financing, to avoid environmental
risks and ensure sustainable forest management. Therefore, in October 2006, the Project financed a pre-
certification exercise for the Sevqar Forest Enterprise and for the Zikatar Training Forest. The pre-
assessment, carried out by the UK-based Soil Association, provided an independent third-party view of
the quality of the Sevqar Forest Management Plan, management practices on-the-ground, and the legal
and regulatory framework within which the management plan was to be implemented. It also specified
measures needed to complete the certification process and provided Hayantar management with a more
informed basis for decision-making and strategic planning. The certification process is more valuable to
clarify the scope for development and implementation of standards for sustainable forest management,
than as a means for producing marketable quantities of certified timber; certification is key to the
Government Illegal Logging Action Plan. Armenia does not yet have forest certification and is unlikely to
achieve it without substantial additional investment to improve forest management practices.

Forest rehabilitation activities. The original target was reforestation and rehabilitation of some 1,100 ha of
high elevation, degraded forest lands, but when works were initiated, weaknesses were detected in the
original designs. Some sites were inappropriate for rehabilitation as well as fencing and maintenance
costs had been underestimated; therefore, the contract was revised as per Table 1 in Annex II. These
changes increased the contract value by about 12 percent from AMD 231 million to AMD 258 million.
The total area of forest that benefited from natural regeneration due to the fencing was increased to 6,822
ha (Table 2 in Annex II), surpassing the original target of 1,100 ha reforested or rehabilitated forests.
During the ICR Mission, Hayantar SNCO had accepted the project-financed forest rehabilitation and
fencing works in both Ijevan and Sevqar Forest Districts, accepting management and budgetary
responsibility for replanting on these sites. The level of survival, noted in Table 1 (i.e., less than 25
percent and greater than 25 percent) is a contracting and community relations issue, as noted below. This
activity have been completed successfully; it not only exceeded Project targets, but resulted in a Hayantar
commitment to rehabilitate between 4,000 to 9,000 ha annually, using similar technologies.

Protection against Forest Fires and Insects: Forest fire fighting tools and equipment were purchased and
delivered to five of Hayantar's Forest Enterprises; pest control measures were never implemented due to
environmental safeguard risks. In 2004, Government requested the Bank to finance procurement of
pesticides to counteract a brown-tailed moth infestation. The Bank mobilized assistance from a USDA
Forest Service pest management specialist, who visited project sites and reported low capacity for
environmentally sound forest pest management; the expert report noted that only substantial additional
investments would achieve sufficient human and physical capacity to justify additional project funding
for forest pest management. Moreover, the Task Team recognized that there was insufficient capacity to
ensure that Project-financed pest management would comply with Bank Operational Policies. As a result,
due to environmental safeguard risks, Project pest control measures were not undertaken

Rehabilitation of road network. Originally, some 70km of forest roads were to be rehabilitated to
implement the approved forest management plans and facilitate efficient forest protection. However,


                                                     20
during the MTR, it was recognized that costs for many activities had been significantly underestimated;
for example, the cost of forest management planning was US$5.33 per ha rather than the PAD estimate of
US$2.00 per ha, the number of management plans to be prepared was greatly increased, and the actual
cost of road rehabilitation was about 10 times original estimates. Moreover, the Bank team recognized
that without a forest certification process, rehabilitated roads risked being used for unsustainable logging.
As a result, this activity was scaled back to 7km for an access road to the Zikatar Forest Training Center,
and some savings went to expand forest management planning.

Strengthening operational capacity of the forest service (Hayantar), the Ministry of Nature Protection, and
the Forest Research and Experimental Center (FREC). This activity was successfully completed,
including a wide range of civil works--construction or rehabilitation of three Hayantar forest enterprise
offices (Ijevan, Sevqar, and Novemberyan 2 ), rehabilitation of the Novemberyan forest nursery,
rehabilitation of the Zikatar training facility, including access road and bridge--and office furniture,
equipment, and vehicles were provided for those field offices. This activity also strengthened the capacity
of the Bio-Research Management Agency (BRMA) of the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP) by
providing seven GIS workstations, plus software and training--a first in Armenia. Similar training was
provided to six other institutions, including FREC and the Monitoring Center, to build institutional and
technical capacity to use this powerful planning and monitoring tool. A follow-up practical training
helped BRMA assemble compatible data sets for incorporation into the overall GIS database. GIS has
been integrated in some forest operations and is now used in ongoing forest management operations. The
Project supported Hayantar's change of status to a State Non-Commercial Organization (SNCO), and
helped it improve financial management capacity, which included a new Financial Management Manual,
accounting software, and property register that allowed project-financed equipment to be delivered to the
field offices. The Project helped develop a financial stabilization plan for Hayantar, which included
commercialization and marketing studies.

Strengthen Legal and Institutional Framework: The Forest Institutional Support Project (FISP) proved
most successful at: (i) developing, through a highly participatory process, a National Forest Policy and
Strategy (approved by Government in September 2004); (ii) drafting and promoting Government approval
(October 2004) of an Illegal Logging Action Plan, to counteract illegal logging; (iii) developing the
National Forest Program (gazetted in 2005); (iv) instituting a new Forest Code (ratified in November
2005) with the principles of modern sustainable forest management; (v) drafting a Community Forest
Management Regulation; and (vi) providing a large variety of training and capacity-building activities. At
the conclusion of FISP, Sida initiated a follow-up trust fund (under direct Bank supervision) to support (i)
Project priority actions to prepare key legal and regulatory instruments (called for in the Forest Code); (ii)
community forest management planning and implementation; (iii) improved forest management and
supervision; and (iv) improved organizational and institutional development. Through this support, the
Project generated proposals to clarify forest sector institutional structure, roles, and organizations. This
includes the units linked to the MOA--for policy and legal function, for forest management function
(Hayantar), and for monitoring, regulation and law enforcement. When the Project closed, restructuring
proposals were incomplete but they fostered a healthy debate on options for checks and balances in the
sector. Much work remains to sort out conflicting legislation and duplication of functions, but the Project
helped advance the legal and institutional framework required for multi-purpose sustainable forestry.
Given the stage of development of the Armenian forestry sector in 2002, a `big bang' approach to

 Rehabilitation works on the Novemberyan Forest Enterprise office were only around 70% complete by the Project's Closing
date. Alternative financing, such as Hayantar's regular budget, will be needed for any work completed after Project closing.




                                                            21
institutional reforms would have been impossible; incremental reforms of the type undertaken with the
help of this Project were, and continue to be, the most appropriate.

The ICR mission identified the following additional lessons learned in the forestry component.
    Certification could play a critical role in counteracting illegal logging. Although it did launch
       the first steps toward forest certification, Armenia has otherwise made little progress in
       completing the process. Certification was a key measure identified in the Illegal Logging Action
       Plan, and could also help identify improvements to overall management practices.
    Public consultations help identify issues but only Government intervention can resolve disputes
       and eliminate contradictions. Consultations during the planning process with local villagers were
       essential to reach common understanding of land ownership, land use, and forest functions.
       Despite this, approval of management plans have run into cadastre problems due to overlapping
       claims for forest land. Better stakeholder consultation would have helped resolve contradictory
       management decisions resulting from unclear or conflicting laws and regulations, such as
       protection of water bodies (no harvesting allowed) and production forests.
    Before approval, management plans should be assessed by qualified independent reviewers.
       Guidelines for management planning have been developed and tested, but require an independent
       review of completed plans, similar to that for civil works. To avoid potential conflicts of interest,
       the oversight functions should be located in MNP or the Monitoring Center.
    Reforestation should rely on planting seedlings to improve monitoring of outcomes. The Project
       lifetime was too short to evaluate direct seeding germination rates, therefore, seedlings are better.
    Successful Project information strategies and participatory approaches should convince
       stakeholders of the value of protecting reforested areas. Some percentage of Project seedling
       mortality in Armenia was due to livestock grazing, which the agency or the community could
       have been prevented. Livestock managed to breach fenced areas, raising questions about (a) the
       value of fencing for forest regeneration; (b) whether villagers see the fencing as protecting future
       shared assets or an externally imposed barrier to their traditional grazing lands; and (c) whether
       Hayantar could have developed a closer working relationship with villagers and provided them
       with alternate pastures.

    Based on all the above, this component has therefore been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Component 3: Protected Areas Management and Biodiversity Conservation

The general outcome of this component is positive, though not all milestones have been achieved. Project
impact was most tangible on the two target protected areas, Lake Sevan and Dilijan National Parks, for
which the objective was to align their management with modern international good practice. Although the
Parks have yet to mature, they now represent an up-to-date model for replication throughout the country.

Armenia's network of protected areas is forming and the Project provided useful technical assistance for
several MNP units engaged in protected areas management. However, the existing institutional
framework needs adjustment before it can handle a holistic approach to protected areas planning and
development, maintaining functional linkages among them, and managing various categories of protected
areas as an integrated system. Mainstreaming biodiversity conservation in Government policies, line
ministries' activities, and local government activities is a challenge among countries with an economy in
transition and a developing democracy. The Project duration was insufficient to achieve multi-sectoral
planning, but it triggered inter-sectoral dialogue on balancing multiple interests in and around protected
areas.

Preparing participatory protected area management plans. Protected area management plans for 2007-11
were prepared for the first time for the Dilijan and Lake Sevan National Parks, using modern standards,
and were approved by Government in 2007. It was anticipated that the management plans would be
adopted during the earlier stages of the Project, but it took longer because such documents are completely
new to Armenia and cover critical issues such as use of land, forests, and fisheries. The delay left little
time to provide Project support to implement the plans.

Development of management plans set a precedent of multi-sectoral planning, because the process
involved reconciling diverse interests through consultations with central and local government agencies,
businesses, and local communities. Although consensus was possible only with major compromises on
conservation needs, the hard-won achievements do have tangible biodiversity value.

After Project closing, several issues raised concerns regarding the quality and effectiveness of the
management plans, in particular for Lake Sevan National Park. Over many decades, Lake Sevan's level
had fallen considerably as water was abstracted for irrigation and hydropower. Studies suggested that lake
ecology would improve if the level were raised and this has been Government policy since the late 1950s.
In 2001, Government prepared a program to counteract the lake's ecological problems by raising the
water level by around 6.5 meters over 30 years to raise the level to 1903.5m above the level of the Baltic
Sea (ABSL), which local scientists calculated would improve lake conditions. This was to be achieved
primarily by reducing abstractions for irrigation and using interbasin water transfers.




                                                    24
The Management Plan noted some "half-built, abandoned" derelict Soviet-era buildings that would likely
be submerged as the water level rose; it called for a detailed inventory these derelict buildings and a
program for their deconstruction/removal. The Plan included a provision for "possible upgrading" of
buildings found within the Park or the buffer zone and indicated that unregulated construction within the
National Park's buffer zone was a significant negative anthropogenic influence.

The Management Plan contained no mention of any of the derelict state-owned properties being occupied,
or implied any scope whatsoever that they could be. However, sometime during 2004, the state-owned
lakeshore property that is now the Park's Recreation Zone, was leased long-term to investors who
expanded and modernized the "half-built, abandoned" derelict Soviet-era buildings. Other properties were
acquired as greenfield sites for new development, and parts of the lake were filled in to extend the land
area on which buildings could be constructed above the 1903.5 m level.

After the Management Plan, the Ministry of Nature Protection completed the inventory of illegal
buildings; it identified 1,062 buildings within the boundaries of the National Park and its buffer zone that
do not comply with current regulatory frameworks. The Chamber of Control has inventoried buildings
that fall below the 1903.5m water level, and identified around 150 buildings that will be inundated by a
raised lake water level.

At Appraisal, World Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was triggered by the Project; a Process
Framework was prepared that focused on potential loss of access to resources by poor communities living
near the National Park. The highly participatory preparation of the Management Plan met the key
objectives outlined in the Process Framework, although neither the Framework nor the Environmental
Assessment that was prepared before Appraisal explicitly addressed potential issues related to the
inundation of derelict state-owned buildings, a Management Plan shortcoming that will have to be
resolved through ongoing review processes.

Developing monitoring systems and undertaking applied studies in support of improved management.
The zoning and management planning of the Dilijan and Lake Sevan National Parks drew heavily from
the ecosystem studies, especially those on plant and animal species and their habitats, and the detailed
forest inventory. This research enabled the Project to identify and map Red Book species inhabiting the
area and biodiversity hot spots--a substantial contribution to establishing the National Parks. However,
continuous monitoring of key ecosystem indicators will be crucial to manage protected areas. To facilitate
biodiversity monitoring in protected areas, special software was developed to record, store, and
systematize monitoring data, and a users' manual was published for the software. Information collected
from individual protected areas will flow to the MNP for inclusion in a master database.

Providing professional development and training for protected areas staff. Institutional capacity building
comprised an important part of assistance to Project beneficiary protected areas. During the Project life,
the Lake Sevan and Dilijan National Parks administrations acquired adequate staff and established park
ranger services. Professional training was delivered to 47 MNP staff and park administrations. Some 40
park rangers acquired new knowledge and skills to deliver their services. The Project helped develop
training modules for protected areas staff, which the MNP is expected to use in scaling up human
resources capacity in the national system of protected areas.

Developing environmental education and programs to build public awareness of protected areas' multiple
objectives and encourage local participation. Overall understanding of ecosystem balance, conserving
biodiversity, and sustaining natural resource use is weak at the level of rural communities. Protected areas
are generally perceived as a constraint to local livelihoods. Therefore, the public awareness campaign
faced tremendous challenges; it began with the affected population participating in protected area
planning, followed by information disseminated through print and television documentaries. Over the


                                                    25
Project life, public outreach efforts changed local peoples' perceptions of the National Parks. A 2008
independent survey found that 100 percent of respondents in a focus group knew about the Dilijan and
Lake Sevan National Parks and were aware of the regime of resource use inside the Parks; however, less
than 25 percent understood the concept of sustainable resource use, or saw the need for it.

Establishing infrastructure and logistical support at Dilijan State Reserve and Lake Sevan National Park.
The Project invested substantially in physical infrastructure for selected protected areas. Both Dilijan
National Park and Sevan Lake National Park now have premises for administrations and their branches,
and Dilijan National Park has a visitor center. Overall, premises of both Parks are satisfactory but the
visitor infrastructure needs further development. Protected area administrations understand future needs
for servicing visitors, such as walking trails, campsites, shelters, bird watching towers, and information
displays; visitor interpretation needs significant strengthening and follow-up. The Project helped provide
both Park administrations with furniture; office, laboratory, and field equipment; transportation (vehicles,
boats, and horses); a fire engine and construction machinery for maintenance works; and uniforms.

Reforming legislation and regulations for flora and fauna conservation in protected areas to strengthen the
role of MNP management, and mechanisms for revenue retention. In 1991, Armenia passed the first law
on protected areas but changes in the country make updates to the legal framework essential. The Project
supported a new iteration of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Specially Protected Natural Areas,
adopted in December 2000. However, effective enforcement required several new bylaws to regulate
aspects of governance and Project technical assistance helped develop regulations for monitoring, land
registry, and use. Regulations on monitoring and land registry are approved, but the Ministry of Justice is
reviewing regulations on land use. The new legislation permits protected area administrations to generate
and retain income--significant progress to diversify financing to sustain operations. Project achievements
in reforming regulations for managing protected areas are remarkable, although some legal gaps still need
to be closed. Most importantly, the MNP role should be reconsidered, perhaps planning, developing, and
managing the national network of protected areas should be consolidated under this agency.

Mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into planning and policy processes of central and sectoral
ministries. This was among the overly ambitious Project outputs in the original design. Conservation
interests are low priority on the national agenda and Armenia had no experience mainstreaming
conservation needs in sectoral policies. Therefore, it was impossible to expect this level of transformation
during the Project life, since it would have required altering entrenched governance patterns. However,
the Project did succeed in engaging sectoral ministries and local governments in dialogue about the
protected area planning, and negotiations on natural resource use, which led Park administrations and
local administrative authorities to sign bilateral agreements on land use. This important progress provides
a foundation for future mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation in sectoral and spatial planning.

Strengthening information dissemination. The Project's local and national dissemination of information
increased public awareness and support for protected areas and biodiversity conservation. The Project
information strategy used a range of outreach methods and tools targeted to various audiences including
print media such as leaflets, brochures, and catalogues of species; electronic media such as Web pages for
the Lake Sevan National Park and the Dilijan National Park, and several televised documentaries. The
Project also helped strengthen the existing system of information dissemination by increasing the capacity
of the MNP public information unit through developing guidelines on dissemination of environmental
information through mass media, and publishing a local language version of the Aarhus Convention.

Rapid assessment for biodiversity conservation at landscape level by establishing PC-based GIS for
integrated resource management and mapping. The Project introduced and established GIS, a modern and
effective tool for protected area management and monitoring by providing the hardware and software to
National Parks, MNP, Biodiversity Management Agency, Analytical Information Center, FREC, and


                                                    26
Hayantar; and providing training for a critical mass of professionals in GIS use. This innovation created
an excellent cadre of users, and workable databases, and thematic maps, and GIS use made possible
precise delineation of protected area boundaries and specific internal zones within.

Strengthening transboundary cooperation in biodiversity monitoring and protected areas management.
Transboundary cooperation for biodiversity conservation in the Caucasus was supported primarily by
GTZ and WWF. Work is most advanced in planning a transboundary protected area in partnership with
Georgia to cover an ecosystem of high altitude lakes and wetlands that is an important avian habitat.
Since existing efforts financed from alternate sources appeared sufficient, the Project did not invest
directly in supporting the transboundary work.

In conclusion, the ICR mission is convinced that the Project succeeded in strengthening significant
aspects of planning and management for protected areas in Armenia. Some delays in delivering critical
outputs, combined with generally limited resources and time meant that the Project closed with some
issues of concern, which are highlighted below for future consideration by the client.

Protected area management plans. Because the management plans for the two National Parks were
delayed, the Project covered less than two years of their implementation so support is required for the
Protected Area administrations to sustain their motivation and capacity to adhere to the management
plans.

Conservation within the National Parks. Planning of the two National Parks was challenging because it
required reconciling competing interests. Since land designated for protected areas is typically decided
through consensus, insufficient size of strictly protected zones within the National Parks is understandable
but problematic since small fragmented habitats cannot sustain key species over the long term. Dialogue
among park administrations, resource users, and other interest groups should continue to explore the
potential for revising existing boundaries of some zones within National Parks to align sizes and
functions. Overall, definition and management regimes assigned for types and zones of protected areas
should more closely align with internationally accepted IUCN categories.

Managing the national system of protected areas. Under existing institutional arrangements, protected
area administrations are discrete legal bodies subordinated to institutions such as MNP, Ministry of
Agriculture, and Hayantar. Within the MNP, several departments and agencies cover aspects of protected
areas, such as managing natural resources and biodiversity, monitoring, public information, and
inspection. Consolidating leadership in policymaking, planning and development is required to develop
and run an effective connected network of protected areas, although autonomy and diverse affiliations
among departments and agencies are not incompatible with effective functioning. A systemic approach is
essential to amplify conservation roles of individual protected areas and achieve national- and global-
level outcomes. Based on the above discussion, this component is rated Moderately Satisfactory.


Component 4: Project Management and Administration

Component 4 was envisioned to support Project administration and implementation. The Project was
intended to finance incremental operational costs of the Project management team and essential technical
assistance for Project management (e.g., financial management and procurement training, project audit,
institutional coordination, implementation assistance to communities, and public sector training for
capacity building, basic equipment and facilities, and 85 percent of PIU operating costs).

The Project experienced delays, especially in the first years after Project effectiveness. The complex
project design and innovations made implementation difficult. The PIU was slow to become proficient


                                                    27
and experienced a high staff turnover, and initially misperceived their role resulting in limited direct
interaction with Project beneficiaries and local communities; this failed to create the necessary Project
identity in participating villages. The MTR recommended strong and continuous interaction between the
PIU and villages during project introduction, awareness building, planning and implementation, which
was successfully achieved under the watershed management component, and improved Project
understanding local ownership. Only in the Project's final year, with the appointment of new project
director, did the PIU adopt a more proactive role to further Project objectives.

Progress reporting was weak throughout the Project; reports were often of limited value. Regular
video/audio conferences between the PIU and the Bank were introduced after the MTR to solve
immediate implementation issues and address the reporting gap.
During Project implementation, PIU capacity to manage contracts was limited, which delayed many
contracts, meaning several project activities had to be revised or scaled back. The considerable
momentum gained in the final year under a proactive Project director could not completely recoup Project
objectives from earlier shortcomings. As a result, there are concerns that much remains to be done to
ensure that lessons learned and new practices are fully integrated into regular protected area planning and
management, and forestry sector administration. Strong leadership and political commitment are essential
to build on Project achievements and benefit the national protected area and forestry sectors and promote
stronger national support for biodiversity conservation in a sustainable development agenda.

Financial management throughout the Project lifetime was fully satisfactory, reflected by financial Audit
reports. Bank procurement procedures were new to Armenia and some initial challenges caused
misunderstandings and delays; but this improved as the Project progressed.

Based on all the above, this component is rated Moderately Satisfactory, a higher rating might have
been possible if PIU capacity had been stronger earlier during the Project.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


A cost benefit analysis was conducted to quantify Project benefits and to evaluate efficiency. The
following analysis used some of the assumptions discussed in the PAD together with actual outputs at
Project closing to estimate economic and financial benefits. Efficiency was evaluated to the extent to
which non-GEF funds could be leveraged to achieve Project objectives.

Around $8.3 million were invested as an IDA credit in the Project activities. These investments were
made in all three components and no IDA financing was used in the Protected Areas component. On the
other hand, the Armenian government contribution in this Project was around $1.5 million. The
investments made in first two components can be valued by examining the benefits of the watershed
component activities, the regeneration and rehabilitation of forest area, and the benefits associated with
the reduction in illegal logging.

Watershed component activities had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of rural people in the
Tavoush and Gegharkunik Marzes. These activities can be divided into those that (a) reduced poverty or
(b) improved environmental conditions. Category (a) will value all activities that introduced or improved
local agricultural practices that helped reduce poverty and improve economic conditions; Category (b)
will include all the economic valuation of environmental benefits (reduced sediment flows and improved
water retention) related to pasture and forest rehabilitation and regeneration.

In the PAD, each activity in the watershed component is evaluated separately, but to evaluate all activities
combined would more accurately capture the overall impact. Project benefits relating to sustainable
natural resource practices and improving incomes in local communities can be evaluated by comparing
average incomes from Project and non-Project villages, which were estimated (based on a Baker-Tilly
Armenia 2008 survey) for the Tavoush and the Gegharkunik Marzes. The 2007 survey estimated incomes
as part of the Government-prepared ICR and the results are in Table 1 below and in their report.


                    Table 1: Average annual income in Armenian Dram
                                                Total Farm & non-Farm Income
                                             Project Village     Non-Project Village
                    Gegharkunik Marz             480,000                437,000
                    Tavoush                      719,000                631,000


Project activities were carried out in 40 villages--20 in the Tavoush and 20 in Gegharkunik Marzes,
including 100 households in the Tavoush Marz and 200 in the Gegharkunik Marz. The average Project
village household in the Tavoush Marz had an annual income of AMD 719,000 compared to AMD
631,000 in a non-Project village household. The average 2007 exchange rate was 345 AMD per US$ and
the income difference of US$255.2 was projected over the Project lifetime of 30 years for a total benefit
on households in the Tavoush Marz equivalent to US$14,291,200. The analysis was replicated for the
Gegharkunik Marz where the average 2007 household income was AMD 480,000 in Project Villages and
AMD 437,000 in non-Project villages. In Gegharkunik Marz, the income difference was US$124.7,
smaller than in Tavoush Marz, however, the villages had almost double the number of households.
Repeating the previous analysis yields an overall benefit of around US$13,966,400.




                                                    29
Over the lifetime of the Project, 307.5 ha of forest were regenerated and 6,746 ha of pasture land were
rehabilitated. Similar to the assumptions used for the PAD, the environmental benefits (reduced sediment
flows and improved water retention) related to pasture and forest rehabilitation and regeneration were
valued (in 2002) at $5 and $10 respectively. Generally speaking, economic values of watershed protection
services of forests range from $7 - $20 per hectare and therefore the above estimates are reasonable.
Assuming these were achieved in a linear function during 2002-08, the overall undiscounted benefit value
is around US$1,012,038 over the Project lifetime.

Overall, Component 1 activities generated total benefits of US$29,269,738--some US$28,257,600 in
improved local incomes and US$1,012,038 in environmental benefits. The IDA allocation for Component
1 was US$4,953,900, together with the Government contribution, the total cost was US$5,473,800;
therefore the ERR of economic benefits would be 14.5 percent.

Component 1 and 2 activities contributed to some extent to the same outcomes, but for this analysis,
efforts to rehabilitate and regenerate forest areas also reduced sediment flows and improved water
retention, which was included in the valuation above. However, it also helps regenerate and rehabilitate
pasture and forest areas, which in turn contribute to forest regeneration and development and can be
anticipated to help sequestrate carbon and create a sustainable fuel wood harvest.

The Project regenerated oak, beech, and pine species, which can support a sustainable harvest of around
40 m3/ha every thirty years. Assuming that regenerated and rehabilitated areas will experience a 6 m3/ha
of annual growth and that after 2012, 2 m3/ha/yr can be sustainably harvested, then 14,107 m3 of
sustainable wood can be harvested annually, beginning in 2012 and until 2032 (some 40 m3/ha in 30
years). The Project area forest consists of beech (70 percent), oak (20 percent), and pine (10 percent);
based on their carbon density, around 0.3 tons of carbon can be sequestrated in one cubic meter of wood
(see Table 2). In addition, the weighted average of a cubic meter was based on international wood prices
presented in Table 3, based on the UNECE/FAO roadside price series. Typically, local Armenian prices
are lower than international prices, so the weighted average was halved to correct for harvesting and
transportation costs. The 2008 price was assumed to be the average of six previous years, which was used
as a basis for all future years.

      Numbers are based on Birdsey 1996.


Based on the above, over the Project lifetime, the economic value of sustainable wood harvested from
rehabilitated and regenerated areas would be about US$13,326,508. Assuming US$19.25 per ton of
sequestrated carbon over the Project lifetime, the discounted value of sequestrated carbon would be
US$6,073,208, based on April 27, 2009 carbon futures, European carbon market closing assessment.

In addition, this component and other Project activities have contributed to substantially reducing overall
illegal logging in Armenia, estimate at 34,194 m3 of wood in 2002. Based on Hayantar forest enterprise
estimates, around 13.2 percent of illegal logs were used for construction and the rest for fuel wood. In
2008, illegal logging estimates dropped to 19,852 m3. A conservative assumption is that 50 percent of the
reduction resulted from Project-related activities and that future illegal logging rates will decline at half
that experienced during the Project lifetime. Thus, using the above carbon and wood prices, the economic
value of the protected wood is about US$4,148,597, and the value of sequestrated carbon, US$986,464.

The IDA allocation for Component 2 was US$2,833,900, together with the Government contribution, the
total cost was around US$3,514,900. Component 2 activities generated an overall benefit of
US$24,534,518, and the ERR is estimated to be 13.3 percent.

Total economic benefits of the Project are US$53,804,255; the final ERR is 13.0 percent. A more
conservative carbon-pricing scenario would reduce economic valuation of environmental benefits. If the
assumed price per ton of sequestrated carbon is US$5, the ERR would be 11.95 percent. The overall
Project ERR estimate in the PAD is 20 percent.

Component 3 was financed via a GEF Grant of US$3,489,000, and Government funds, US$179,500.
Financial and economic efficiency were evaluated above as the degree to which non-GEF funds could be
leveraged to achieve Project objectives, basic to GEF Incremental Cost Analysis. GEF funds were
leveraged with the IDA credit, Sida contribution, and Government commitments (Tables 3 & 4 below). In
total, GEF contributed an additional US$935,200 to Component 1; US$175,500 to Component 2; and
US$515,400 Component 3. Overall, GEF funds were leveraged in the ratio of 1:2.3.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This Implementation Completion Report on behalf of Government is an overall assessment of Project
objectives, design, implementation, and operational experience; it summarizes Project impacts,
achievements, and Lessons Learned. A summary of this 25-page report follows below.

The Project changed natural resource management policy and attitudes within Armenia. Only a decade
ago, awareness of environmental protection was limited and rural poverty resulted in unsustainable forest
and land use. Through the Project, attitudes toward the environment have shifted and the country has
begun to address environmental and natural resource issues in a new, holistic manner that is creating
visible socio-economic impacts, and behavior changes.

Although it is difficult to isolate Project impacts on poverty reduction, the Impact Evaluation Report finds
that participation in the Community-based Watershed Management component contributed to increasing
crop and livestock productivity and farm incomes: during 2002-07, among Project communities, total
average annual income rose by 21.5 percent, compared to 8.3 percent for non-Project communities.
Government is pleased to note that Armenia's 2006 poverty rates declined to 26.5 percent from 34.6
percent in 2004, and extreme poverty rates dropped to 4.1 percent from 6.4 percent, surpassing PRSP
projections,3 and creating conditions conducive for Project implementation.

The Project introduced a new approach and attitudes toward the environment. The Social Assessment4
carried out during Project preparation reveals the level of despair in rural communities regarding forest
protection, loss of livelihoods, illegal logging, and environmental damage. Now, in 2009, Government is
addressing the challenge of harmonizing socio-economic and environmental protection objectives,
recognizing the strength of public consultation to support top-down decision-making with bottom-up
strategies, and promoting acceptance and sustainability of environmental policies.

Armenia is developing a long-term vision to manage natural resources so that future generations will have
a homeland that is richly endowed and pleasant place to live. The country has signed 14 international
environmental conventions, signaling commitment to attaining international standards; Armenia is the
leader among all CIS countries in pursuing best practices and innovative approaches and is on the path to
environmental recovery. Key Project performance indicators agreed during Project pre-appraisal were
met and progress was made in line with the Government Strategy to: i) reduce rural poverty; ii) reverse
declining soil fertility and degradation of pastures; and iii) conserve biodiversity and strengthen protected
areas. While acknowledging considerable progress, Government recognizes that much remains to be done,
including committing resources to maintain, consolidate, and deepen Project gains.

Component 1: Community-based Watershed Management

By the late 1990s, Armenia was overexploiting its natural resources in large part because of the economic
crisis. The collapse of state industries led to mass unemployment; land privatization encouraged many
who had little agricultural knowledge to seek land ownership for their livelihoods, including an influx of
urban refugees from Azerbaijan. In the face of scarce resources, people with inadequate knowledge and
skills resorted to `mining' their environment, and even people who understood the result would be long-
term resource degradation, felt they had few alternatives. 5 Community participation and sustainable

management of shared natural resources, forests, and pastures are concepts that did not exist prior to the
Project. People felt little responsibility for community decision making.

Component 1 Project activities encouraged active community participation; raising awareness and living
standards helped communities understand that managing their resources is essential to achieve short- and
long-term benefits. The participation rate was satisfactory and some communities became enthusiastic
about the Watershed Management Plan, Community Forest Management Plan, and the formation of
Resource User Associations (RUAs). Local people began to understand that unmanaged tree cutting
would leave nothing for the next generation, which resulted in independent decisions and implementing
activities independently. Community Forest Management Plans were developed to introduce communities
to accredited management of forests within the administrative boundaries of each community. These were
developed in a participatory manner for 5-6 Project villages, covering approximately 2,100 ha of
community forest area--a first in Armenia. For each Community Forest Management Plan, a
Memorandum of Understanding agreement was signed with the MoA.

Restricted grazing provided by fencing, and planting fruit trees, forest trees and leguminous fodder crops
in overexploited communal areas helped reverse the degradation. Fencing land, combined with adopting
rotational grazing principles reduced pressure on adjacent pastures, maintained newly planted trees and
shrubs, improving the grazing system on community land and the quality, quantity, and productivity of
pastures. There were visible increases in fodder grasses and trees in 220 ha of degraded communal areas
in the 40 Project villages. Livestock owners could travel farther to graze their animals, which significantly
improved the community pastureland vegetative cover, the quality and productivity of forest cover, and
reduced pastoral conflicts.

Community-based watershed management activities demonstrated how quantifiable short-term socio-
economic benefits could be harmonized with long-term environmental protection. Evaluations confirmed
economic benefits for Project communities, and Project impacts were broadly welcomed, but these pilot
activities raise questions about the sustainability of these gains, since community mayors report that few
communities have sufficient resources to replicate and expand Project activities. This is true even in
model communities with high rates of revenue collection, such as Aghavnavank.

Component 2. State Forest Management

During the 1990s, Armenian forests were affected by rapid transformation from a centrally planned to a
market-oriented economy. The concept of a Forest Management Plan was foreign and most forestland
was not managed productively. State Forests were not fenced; illegal logging was persistent and
widespread among commercial interests and individuals and large areas of forest were heavily cut, often
in a non-sustainable manner. Sida forestry consultants predicted that in the longer term, forested areas
would be destroyed or eliminated, damaging the economy and reducing biodiversity.6 The same report on
the Armenian forest sector revealed that local people did not feel responsible for the forest; therefore,
well-intentioned forest laws would not always have the desired effect.

During the Project lifetime, Armenia progressed significantly toward a multi-purpose approach to forest
management. National program policy and strategy documents are being developed with the potential to
strengthen sustainable forestry management and clarify roles and responsibilities. The Forest Code was
drafted and passed. 7 Forest Management Plans were prepared and related project interventions have
improved the forest cover. In Project areas, illegal logging, and grazing and fencing conflicts with local

communities have been reduced, while timber volume has improved. Drafting is underway for five sub-
legal acts to regulate activities such as management planning, although the institutional framework
remains incomplete and contradictory. Until forest legislation is revised to eliminate gaps and overlaps
and clarify responsibilities among ministries, the Armenian forest sector will remain at risk. Coherent
legislation must be discussed, agreed, explained, and accepted, followed by a period of monitoring to
ensure that new practices are entrenched and aligned with the new policies.

Illegal logging, measured by number of trees cut and volume of wood in cubic meters, has significantly
declined from 2003 levels. This is due to several factors: (a) better forest sector monitoring (forestry
officials are now more forthcoming in providing data on illegal activities); (b) cooperation from local
communities; (c) newly developed capacity for independent forest inspection services; and (d) overall
economic improvements. In addition, Project-installed fencing helped protect over 5,000 ha of forest from
excessive grazing and illegal logging, which improved forest cover and supported natural regeneration of
forest vegetation. Public participation in the preparation of State Forest Management Plans reduced
conflicts with local communities on grazing and fencing issues.

Project staff provided local and international training courses to ministry and agency staff, including on
GIS, forest operations, management planning, inventory assessment. These trainings improved
performance because some 90 percent of forest sector staff lacked specialized knowledge, especially chief
foresters and Hayantar department. Civil works included rehabilitating offices, construction of the Zikitar
training center, and 7 km of forest roads. Trucks, excavators, and vehicles were purchased, improving
guards' ability to build forest roads, harvest trees, and reconstruct forest areas.

Component 3: Improved Management of Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation

There are many unaddressed legal and regulatory issues for two key protected areas, Sevan and Dilijan
National Parks: a Bio and Landscape Monitoring System (GIS), as well as systematic process of
recording indicator species of flora and fauna (as per Red Book indicator species) are urgently needed.
Inventory and control is difficult and time consuming without adequate vehicles, equipment, or
systematic training programs for the staff of MNP, PAs, and Park Rangers. Study area community
participants were aware of Sevan National Park, resource locations, and ways of obtaining them, but most
knew little about sustainable use of natural resources, or conservation and management of wildlife, due to
poor information.

The Project helped convert two National Parks into functional and well-managed protected areas (PAs).
Dilijan NP and Sevan NP can no longer be described as `paper parks'. Management Plans were updated
and facilities and equipment were completely upgraded. Revised PA legislation, passed in January 2007,
replaced the 1991 law. The PIU was instrumental in overcoming bureaucratic resistance and successfully
lobbied for a new law. Legal and regulatory changes were implemented to facilitate boundary and zoning
changes, retain revenue in protected areas, and strengthen economic activities. The PA facilities were
upgraded and equipped and defunct structures removed. Staff working conditions, salaries, motivation,
and sense of responsibility have all improved, especially compared to pre-Project conditions.

Management plans and capacity building in MNP to administer the system of protected areas, and public
awareness for biodiversity conservation have contributed to population stabilization or increases in
several key indicator species of the Red Book in the Sevan and Dilijan National Parks. The Plans were
developed through local community participation and professional training. A detailed survey of indicator
species of flora and fauna was carried out as part of the Management Plan, the first of its kind since the
1990s. The national parks administration is transformed. These positive steps are a prelude to much more
that remains to be done, for example, visitor information centers and services are rudimentary, and Project
activities need to be extended to all Armenian PAs to achieve Global Environmental Objectives.

Assessment of the Objective, Design, Implementation, and Operation Experience

Despite weaknesses, Government is satisfied with Project achievements. Adapting the Project midway
through its lifespan based on Lessons Learned, and completing most Project activities in spite of setbacks,
is a testament to World Bank responsiveness and excellent cooperation with PIU staff.

The Project could have achieved more if serious delays in launching NRMPR activities could have been
avoided; bureaucratic procedures limited some achievements. Some delays were due to: i) incomplete
preparation at Project effectiveness; ii) the vast scope of activities; iii) PIU inexperience and staff
turnover; iv) Armenia's lack of experience with environmental projects; v) procurement delays; and vi)
Ministry bureaucracy. The initial lengthy delay resulted in six years of Project activities being condensed
into the final 2-3 years. Many Project goals were revised downward at the Mid-term Review; time for
institutional learning and development was insufficient.

Several activities that were only partially realized are urgent and must be continued. It is important to
build on the Project momentum before it dissipates. Follow-up Project design and scope are open to
discussion, but Government strongly believes in expanding and deepening the work begun under
NRMPRP to extend Project activities, build on Project gains, and promote sustainability. The condensed
Project implementation period did not allow sufficient time to nurture and communicate with local
stakeholders and institutions. Coherent policies still need to be developed, addressing gaps in legislation,
a clear ministerial mandate, and an incentive structure for responsive management. The Armenian public
is realizing only now the importance of environmental protection. Sustained public awareness needs to be
built and there is a pressing need to expand program activities beyond Tavush and Gegharkunik marzes in
line with NEAP-2, PRSP, and CAS priorities.

Government is satisfied with the Project as implemented by the PIU, an essential component of Project
architecture. The PIU flexibility due to its independent status outside of the Ministries, general quality of
the PIU staff, and smooth relations between the PIU and Ministries, were key to achieving results. As the
implementing agency, the PIU is more familiar with Bank procedures, better informed about the Project,
better remunerated, less bureaucratic, and uniquely positioned to resolving contradictions among Ministry
priorities. The NRMPRP had a large and diverse program that the Ministry alone could not have managed,
due to its narrower focus. However, PIU implementation was initially very slow because the staff lacked
experience and familiarity with some issues, staff turnover was high, and staff tended to focus on
logistical issues, with a corresponding inattention to Component activities and results. However, late in
the Project, the PIU began to function extremely well under new leadership and Project team guidance.
Therefore, Government is satisfied with World Bank cooperation. Flexibility to make design adjustments
to Project components mid-way and closer engagement, especially assessing conditions `on the ground'
was crucial to Project outcomes.

In the future, it would be beneficial if the World Bank engages more fully during Project preparation with
lower-level stakeholders, a process that was insufficiently handled during NRMPRP preparation, creating
a lack of awareness and misunderstandings among stakeholders on some issues, including a
miscalculation about the applicability of what was done in other countries, but unsuitable for Armenia.
Furthermore, despite lengthy and expensive Project preparation, key practical elements, such as the
Operations Manual and Terms of Reference, were not ready at Project effectiveness and took several
years to complete. During Project preparation and Project launch, the World Bank was slow to respond,
Bank procurement rules were unfamiliar, and PIU performance was below par, creating severe delays.
Mid-way through the Project, the Bank became more responsive, and managerial changes noticeably
improved implementation and results. The Armenia World Bank office was responsive and supportive.



                                                    38
World Bank procurement guidelines were valuable for their strict control but some flexibility would have
speeded procurement and implementation because aspects of Bank procurement guidelines are
inappropriate for countries like Armenia. For example, requirements for separate 14-day periods for
advertising, presentation, and proposals slow procurement considerably, particularly if insufficient bids
are received and the process must be repeated. In addition, waiting for World Bank `no objection' ruling
at every phase necessitates considerable correspondence. A significant brake on Project implementation
was slow World Bank responsiveness on even minor procurement issues. While it is desirable to
consistently follow correct procedures, addressing irregularities, errors, or unforeseen issues delayed
Project implementation, and in the future, improved communications between procurement officers in
Washington and Armenia would be welcome.

Project procurement had some design weaknesses which required revisions before implementation. First,
the Project was originally designed to hire individual consultants, but in the event, procurement had to be
revised to hire firms to supervise individual consultants. Second, a lengthy revision process resulted
when it was discovered that costs for many goods and services had been underestimated, the basis for the
original estimates was unclear, and inflation had not been taken into account.

International experts who supported all three components were extremely helpful and were instrumental
in raising the knowledge and competency levels of staff at various agencies. Government recognizes and
greatly appreciates the significant impact of foreign expertise in setting Armenia on the path to a better
environmental future. However, there were exceptions: sometimes the competence of consultants and
firms did not match their CVs or credentials; one firm, apparently competent, appeared to have
outsourced tasks to poorly qualified individuals, resulting in some unusable outputs. In the Forestry
component, coordination was so poor that it was unclear to newly contracted consultants which tasks had
been completed; a Sida-supported consultant arrived only to find that his assigned tasks had already been
completed. A team leader should have reviewed completed outputs and provided direction. Furthermore,
consultants working on institutional issues should report to an inter-ministerial committee to avoid the
risk that recommendations reflect the interests of only one institution. Inter-ministerial consensus is
essential to effective institutional reforms.

Finally, the Government expresses satisfaction for the many significant achievements made under the four
Project components, and is grateful for invaluable support and spirit of cooperation among the World
Bank and international experts. The Government is eager to continue its cooperation with the World Bank
in nature protection, forestry, biodiversity, and other environmental concerns.

Annex 6: Using the Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool in Armenia

The Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool8 was prepared with the assistance of the
World Bank/WWF Forest Alliance to provide an overarching framework for assessing management
effectiveness of both protected areas and protected area systems, to give guidance to managers and others
and to help harmonize assessment around the world. It is organized around the assessment framework
identified by the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), which is summarized in Table 1. It has
been mandated as a reporting tool for GEF-financed biodiversity conservation operations.

evaluations were carried out of the four pilot sites with the full involvement and engagement of the
project teams. The Tracking Tool was introduced as a self-assessment tool, to help management teams
understand where progress had been good, where more progress was needed, and to provide a frank
assessment of park management team performance. The Tool was not originally intended to be a
reporting mechanism, though GEF later chose to use it as such. However, the aim of presenting the results
here is to show that progress was being self-monitored, not that particular performance targets were being
set and assessed using the Tracking Tool.

Rather than using the gross total scores that were produced by the Tracking Tool, a series of spider graphs
have been created to compare baseline performance against each of the six WCPA criteria over time. The
results from the two pilot sites are summarized in the charts.

Mr. Aristomene Varoudakis
Country Manager
World Bank Armenia Office

Your Excellency Mr. Varoudakis,

On January 27 - February 6, 2009, the World Bank carried out a Mission on Implementation Completion
Report for Armenia Natural Resources Management and Poverty Reduction Program (P057847,
P069917).

The purpose of the Mission, headed by Ahmad Salibi, was to review the overall progress in achieving
program development and global environmental objectives, as well as to collect data for the Final Activity
Report. The evaluation team was diligent and impartial in carrying out its mission, as a result of which the
project was assessed with consideration of both achievements and omissions.

The report has been discussed in relevant services and agencies of the Ministry of Nature Protection. The
Ministry finds that there is no need to place any limitation whatsoever on the publication of the evaluation
results.

Meanwhile, I would like to thank you, your colleagues, as well as our partners in the WB Washington
D.C. Office for their support of the program and effective collaboration. I look forward to working with
you again in near future.

Sincerely Yours,



A. Harutyunyan
