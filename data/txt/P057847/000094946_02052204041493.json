is now reaching a critical point.\n            The project will help avert further deterioration of natural\n            resources (soil, water, forest, fishery, and biodiversity)\n            and stabilize incomes in the local communities. There are\n            three project components. The first component focuses on\n            selected micro-catchments. Support will be provided for\n            preparation and implementation of community forest\n            management plans; local assistance initiatives which benefit\n            biodiversity conservation through community small grants;\n            community pasture management; sustainable agricultural\n            practices; community infrastructure and income generation;\n            and development of community institutions. The second\n            component supports rehabilitation, protection, and\n            sustainable management of state forests in the project area;\n            improves the forest sector's institutional, legal, and\n            policy framework; and enhances institutional capacity to\n            monitor and control forest operations. The third component\n            supports measures to improve the role of two key protected\n            areas in the conservation and sustainable use of the\n            region's biodiversity and sustain these improvements;\n            and improves the capacity of the Department of Bio-resources\n            and Land Protection of the Ministry of Nature Protection to\n            meet its conservation mandate."}, "docdt": "2002-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
