where identified positive\n            impacts could be enhanced. This report discusses some of the\n            impacts: 1) environmental impacts of construction can be\n            mitigated by requiring all sub-contractors be subject to\n            contractual clauses to manage the environmental impacts. 2)\n            Increased pressure on grazing can be mitigated by developing\n            grazing management plans for each watershed. 3)\n            Environmental impacts of fertilizer use can be mitigated by\n            ensuring that the correct dosage is known. 4) Environmental\n            impacts of irrigation can be mitigated by providing\n            appropriate training which covers use minimization through\n            precise application, waterlogging and salinization, erosion,\n            eutrophication, and water pollution. 5) Negative impacts on\n            water resources, e.g., increased pollution and sediment can\n            be reduced by developing water resource management plans. A\n            water balance should be calculated for each micro catchment,\n            and a water quality survey should be carried out to provide\n            a baseline for subsequent monitoring. 6) To develop\n            sustainable provision of wood and tree products, all trees\n            planted sustainable harvesting rates should be calculated\n            and observed."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
