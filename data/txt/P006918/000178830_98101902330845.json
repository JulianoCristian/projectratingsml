extending the transmission and distribution network, and to\n            help define the power investment program after 1982. It\n            consists of the installation of transmission lines,\n            substations, subtransmission and distribution works;\n            extension of the load dispatching center; engineering\n            studies of the Boruca hydroelectric power station; studies\n            of non-conventional power stations for isolated locations;\n            the provision of construction and laboratory equipment for\n            transmission facilities; and training.
