proposed project\n            are to increase the productivity and the export performance\n            of two state-controlled companies in the mechanical and\n            engineering industries subsector; to consolidate their\n            financial recovery and to rationalize their operations; and\n            to assist Portugal in developing the mechanical and\n            engineering industries subsector. The project involves: (i)\n            relocation and expansion of COMETNA's steel casting\n            foundry; (ii) relocation and expansion of COMETNA's\n            industrial valve plant, including diversification of\n            products; (iii) expansion of SOREFAME's hydro-power\n            equipment manufacturing facilities; and (iv) strengthening\n            management systems in the two companies. In addition, the\n            project includes environmental control equipment to improve\n            working conditions in COMETNA's existing iron foundry,\n            and a study of the mechanical and engineering industries\n            subsector. The risks associated with the project are mainly\n            related to demand for some products of SOREFAME from the\n            consumer industries, mainly the power and the railway\n            company will be assisted by the Government and possibly the\n            Bank in implementing its investment plan. It is considered\n            that the company would offset partial shortfalls through\n            higher sales in other markets."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
