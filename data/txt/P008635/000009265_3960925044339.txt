PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the experience with the
Mechanical Industries Project for which loans totalling US$44 million (Loan
1874-PO for US$33.4 million and Loan 1875-PO for US$10.6 million) were
approved on June 19, 1980. US$31.98 million were utilized out of the total of
US$44 million, the remaining amounts being cancelled (US$9.45 million under
Loan 1974-PO and US$2.57 million under Loan 1875-PO). Loan 1874-PO closed on
December 31, 1984, one year after the planned date, and disbursements
continued in 1985 to enable completion of existing commitments. Loan 1875-PO
closed on December 31, 1983 as planned.
The PCR has been prepared under the Guidelines for PCRs overdue by
over two years, issued by COD on November 4, 1988 (paras. 23 to 27 of the
Guidelines). The delay was due to changes in the Borrowers' managements, the
desire of the new managements to review the submissions of the earlier
managements, and discontinuities in Bank staff involvement caused by the
Bank's reorganization in mid-1987. Part I is based on draft completion
reports prepared in 1984 and 1986 by the Borrowers' then managements, the
Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 2846-PO of May 30, 1980), the President's
Report (Report No. P-2835 of May 30, 1980), the legal agreements for the
loans, project supervision reports, correspondence with the Borrowers,
internal Bank memoranda, and informal submissions by the Borrowers.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy
Operations Division, Country Pepartment IV, Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office.

MECHANICAL INDUSTRIES PROJECT
(LOANS 1874 AND 1875-PO_
EVALUATION SElMARY
Objectives
1.   The Borrowers, Companhia Metalurgica Nacional SARL (COMETNA)  and
Sociedades Reunidas de Fabricacoes Metalicas SARL (SOREFAME), are among the
largest companies in the engineering industries subsector in Portugal. The
primary objective of the Project was to contribute towards the improvement of
the performance of the Portuguese engineering industries subsector through (i)
the rehabilitation and modernization of these two companies whose products are
Tmportant inputs to the other engineering industries; (ii) increase in the two
companies' export capabilities and competitiveness; and (iii) preparation of a
comprehensive study for the future development of the engineering industries
subsector, and implementation of its recommendations (paras. 1 and 2 of the
Report).
Implementation Exnerience
2.    The Project was physically completed (i.e. commissioning and start-up)
with a delay of about 2.5 years but substantially within the original cost
estimate (paras. 6 to 9 in the Report). The delays in construction were
largely caused by unforeseeable factors such as the change in site of major
project components due to a withdrawal by the local authorities of their
approval for the original site; civil contractors' financial problems due to
the general slowdown in the local construction industry; and unfavorable
weather conditions. However, the original implementation schedule may have
been optimistic to some extent given the new technology involved and the
specific equipment problems faced during commissioning and start up (para. 8
in the Report). There were no significant changes in project scope. Total
project cost was about 16X lower than the appraisal estimate. This resulted
mainly from a decrease in foreign cost which was lower by about 351 as
compared to the appraisal estimate due to the favorable prices resulting from
the general situation of excess capacity in the supplier industries, and the
appreciation of the US$ versus supplier country currencies during the project
implementation period (para. 7 in the Report).
Results
3.    Project objectives were achieved up to a limited extent. The Project
resulted in the establishment of modern facilities comparable to that in other
European countries; acquisition and assimilation of new technology;
development of staff and management skills; improvement in environmental
conditions through relocation of COMETNA's steel foundry and improvements in
the existing foundry; and upgrading of production capability and product
quality (paras. 10, 13 and 14 in the Report). However, the objective of
providing for the return to financial health of the two Borrowers has not yet
been achieved. Both companies were heavily dependent on the domestic
investment program which did not materialize as projected due to unfavorable



- iv -
changes in the macroeconomic situation and the Government's conseq-'ent
stabilization programs. Although both companies made considerable efforts to
expand their exports, they were constrained by the fierce international
competition, and, to some extent, by the appreciation of the Escudo versus the
US$ during the period. Consequently, both companies incurred substantial
losses during the implementation period (paras. 10 and 11 in the Report).
4.    At the Bank's urging, both Borrowers produced Action Plans, covering
three to five year periods, to improve their performance. However, the
required restructuring of the two companies was delayed due to the desire of
the concerned authorities to decide on such measures in the context of an
overall plan of restructuring other ailing companies in the subsector.
SOREFAME's restructuring, involving closure of some of its facilities and
major reductions in employment, was carried out with some delay and it
returned to profitable operations in 1987 and 1988. COMETNA's management is
taking some steps to restructure and consolidate its operations. However,
achievement of any lasting improvement would depend critically on the prior
financial restructuring of COMETNA to improve its working capital situation.
The concerned authorities are examining possibilities in this regard within
the wider context of integrating selected COMETNA operations with those of
other companies under their purview (para. 11 in the Report). Meaningful
revised estimates of the Project's financial and economic rates of return are
not possible at this time given the uncertainties due to the major
restructuring underway in the Project components (para. 12 in the Report).
5.     The Project had limited impact on macro level or subsector policies.
Although the subsector development study whi.b, was expected to provide the
basis for future development of the engineering industries subsector was
completed, it was not implemented due to changes in the Government and the
desire of the new Government to reassess its approach to the subsector in view
of Portugal's accession to the European Community (para. 14 in the Report)
SustainabLit
6.    The main benefits under the Project (para. 3 above and paras. 10,13 and
14 in the Report) are expected to continue. However, sustaining them will
require, apart from improvements in the domestic and foreign markets, early
action by the concerned authorities to expedite implementation of a
comprehensive restructuring program for COMETNA, and to help SOREFAKE to
consolidate the progress made so far (para. __' in the Report).
Findings and Lessons
7.    The main rindings and lessons learned appear at paras. 16 through 21 in
the Report. For the concerned authorities, the Project highlights the
importance of early implementation of rationalization and restructuring
measures to prevent the progressive deterioration in the performance of the
affected companies (para. 21 in the Report). An important lesson for both the
Bank and the concerned authorities was that, in a project of this nature,
involving public sector producers and consumers, an inter-ministerial group
should have been set up at the outset for problem-solving (para. 20 in the
Report).

AackimroSund
1.      Manufacturing has been a leading sector in tbr Portuguese economy.  The
engineering industries subsector was identified as one with export potential in
which Portugal has a comparative advantage in view of its low labor costs,
availability of skilled labor and requisite technical skills, and the proximity to
Europe.11 Main subsector objectives included restoring the financial health and
increasing the export comJetitiveness of the subsector companies whose operations
had been adversely affected by the loss of former colonial markets, and by the
disruptions caused by labor and management instability following the revolution in
1974,.through their rehabilitation and modernization, and appropriate upgrading of
technology. The Project was developed for the rehabilitation and modernization of
two of the largest companies in the subsector whose products are important inputs
to the other engineering industries, and to increase their export capabilities and
competitiveness. The Project provided for the preparation of a comprehensive
study which was expected to provide a basis for the future development of the
subsector. The Project was also expected to be a first step and to serve as a
model for further rehabilitation, modernization and restructuring projects in the
subsector.
Project Objectives and Description
2.      The primary objective of the Project was to contribute towards the
improvement of the performance of the Portuguese engineering industries subsector
through the following components: (i) relocation and expansion of COMETNA's
existing steel casting foundry (from 5,000 tons per year (tpy) to 10,000 tpy);
(ii) relocation and expansion of COMETNA's existing valve manufacturing facilities
with an increase in capacity from 3,000 to 15,000 units per year; (iii)
rationalization and expansion of SOREFAME's hydro-power equipment manufacturing
facilities to enable SOREFAME to upgrade its production capability from 150 MW to
Bank report titled "Manufacturing Export Industries in Portugal"
(Report No. 1695-PO of December 27, 1977).



2 -
250 MW units; (iv) provision of environmuantal control facilities in COMETNA's
existing foundry to improve working and environmental conditions; and (v)
provision of technical assistance for the preparation of a subsector development
study for the engineering industries subsector.
Prolect DesiMn and Organization
4.      The Project design emerged after considerable preparatory work, the basis
for which was a study for the rationalization possibilities in the subsector
enterprises prepared wit'h the assistance of foreign consultants. The selection of
companies to be included under the Project was based on this study. Original
feasibility studies were updated with the assistance of foreign consultants.
Market confirmation was obtained through reviews carried out by independent
consultants retained by the Bank. This included a confirmation of their
individual investment programs with the main domestic customers of the Project's
output, namely EDP (electric power), CP (railways), the steel industry, and the
chemicals and petrochemicals industries. The Project provided for the
establishment of modern facilities and equipment with technology comparable to
that in other leading similar producers in Europe. The Project also provided for
improvement in environmental conditions through the relocation of COMETNA's steel
foundry away from a residential area and installation of environmental control
equipment in the existing foundry. To provide COMETNA assistance in developing
valve design and technology, the Proje!nt provided for technical assistance from
experienced foreign consultants.
5.      Project organization was based on securing strong internal project
management arrangements in the Borrowers with the assistance of experienced
foreign and local consultants, through the construction and early operation
phases, and the close involvement of IPE, as the main shareholder in both
companies, in monitoring of project implementation. IPE's close involvement was
helpful in overseeing the performance of the project implementation units in the
Borrowers, the provision of funds, and ensuring access to the concerned Government
departments/agencies. These arrangements were particularly effective through tne
project preparation and construction phases but less so after Project start-up.
In particular, there was no single interministerial agency or group that could
reconcile the conflicting interests of the different entities involved - the
producers (COMETNA. SOREFAME) and the major domestic customers (EDP, CP, the steel
company, the chemicals and petrochemicals companies, etc.)
Project Imnplementation
6.      The Project was physically completed (i.e. commissioning and start-up)
with a considerable delay of about 2.5 years but substantially within the original
cost estimate (in US$ terms). Delays in the construction of COMETNA's new steel
foundry and valve plant occurred because of a change in the already approved site
which led to changes in the design of civil works and buildings, and in cost
estimates; civil construction delays due to the prime civil contractor's financial
problems, and unfavorable weather conditions; erection and installation delays due
to procurement-related delays and the unforeseen bankruptcy of the foreign
supplier involved in a key facility (the sand plant); and specific problems with
key equipment (e.g. induction and heat treatment furnaces) during commissioning



and start-up. Delays in the installation and implementation of the management
information system (HIS) in the foundry and valve plant occurred because of delays
in the completion of the main facilities, initial design problems, and ensuring
compatibility with the company's seisting hardware and software configurations.
COMETNA personnel made considerable efforts to adapt the systems and this is being
gradually achieved. Delays in installation of the environmental control equipment
occurred because of the delayed completion of the new steel foundry and the
relocation of equipment without which the installation could not proceed.
7.      There were no significant changes in project scope.  overall project cost
(in US$ terms) was about US$74.5 million, significantly lower by about 16X than
the appraisal estimate. Local costs (US$41.6 million) were higher by about 121
due to higher than projected local inflation, the effects of the change in site,
delays in civil construction, etc., but this increase was more than offset by the
decrease in foreign costs (US$33.9 million) which were considerably lower (by
about 351) as compared to the appraisal estimate due to the favorable prices
resulting from the general situation of excess capacity in the supplier
industries, and the appreciation of the USS versus supplier country currencies.
8.      The delays in implementation were largely caused by unforeseeable factors.
The change in site occurred due to the withdrawal of the local authorities'
approval for the or.ginal site. The other factors, e.g. civil contractors'
problems, unfavorable weather conditions, and the foreign supplier's bankruptcy
were also largely unforeseeable. To cover the anticipated implementation risks,
the Bank had required strict prequalification of suppliers and the close
involvement of the foreign consultants during the construction and commissioning
phases, but nevertheless could not avoid their occurrence. The Bank insisted on
strengthening of the project management units in the two companies, the close
involvement of the foreign consultants during construction and implementation, and
IPE's close monitoring of the Project implementation process. However, the
original construction schedule may have been optimistic to some extent given the
new technology intiolved and the specific equipment problems faced during
commissioning and start-up.
9.      Actions taken by the Bank that helped Project implementation were
requiring the strengthening of the Borrowers' and IPE's project management units,
ensuring timely funds availability through IPE, ensuring continuity of enterprise
management through the project preparation and implementation phases, the
employment of experienced foreign and local consultants, and the close involvement
of IPE in the project implementation process. The Bank was less effective in
problem solving and providing assistance to overcome the specific problems
encountered during equipment erection and installation, and during Project
commissioning and start-up.
Project Results
10.     Project objectives were achieved up to a limited extent.  The Project
resulted in the establishment of new facilities with modern technology comparable
to that in other European countries, development of staff and management skills,
acquisition and assimilation of new technology despite some initial problems in
this regard, improvement in environmental conditions through relocation of the
steel foundry and improvements in the existing foundry, some operational and



- 4 -
management strengthening of the Borrowers and IPE, including in management
information, costing and accu'nting systems, and increase in the Borrowers' export
capability in terms of ability to produce higher quality products. However, the
objective of providing for the return to financial health of the two Borrowers has
not yet been achieved. Both companies were expected to return to a sound
financial situation by 1985. The Project was to reach full capacity production,
for SOREFAtlE by 1984, and for COMETNA, by 1986. This has not been achieved mainly
because of factors external to the two companies. The main domestic customers of
both companies are other public sector entities like EDP (electric power), CP
(railways), and the steel, chemicals and petrochemical industries. Both companies
were, therefore, heavily dependent on the domestic investment program which did
not materialize as projected due to the unfavorable changes in the macroeconomic
situation, the Government's consequent stabilization programs, etc. In the
external market, the expected revival did not occur and both companies faced
fierce competition from established and new producers (e.g. some East European and
newly industrialized Asian producers), often aggressively pricing at levels below
those needed br the Borrowers to cover their higher capital-related costs arising
from the new facilities. The appreciation of the Escudo versus the US$ during
1985-1987 further affected the Borrowers' export earnings. Nevertheless, both
Borrowers made considerable efforts to expand their exports. Against the
appraisal expectations of 40X of total sales, COMEETNA's actual exports from its
steel foundry represented 60-65X of total steel foundry sales in 1985 and 1986, an
indication also of the major deterioration in the domestic market. Both companies
made efforts at diversification, formation of links with foreign partners, but
with limited success.
11.     The Bank continued to urge both Borrowers to intensify their
diversification and export marketing efforts, and to achieve cost efficiencies in
operations including through the necessary rationalization and restructuring of
capacities, particularly SOREFAME, which at the time was facing the more severe
problems. At the Bank's urging, both companies produced Action Plans covering
three to five year periods. IPE established a separate subsidiary (METALGEST) to
oversee the operations of the subsector enterprises in its portfolio. SOREPAME's
restructuring wai to be carried out in this overall context and was consequently
delayed. However, SOREFAME has reduced its capacity and employment (from 4,200 in
1978 to about 2,000 at present), mainly in its rolling stock and industrial
equipment divisions, and returned to profitable operations in 1987 and 1988. The
energy division (involving the Project) now forms the backbone of SOREFAME
operations. CONETNA's situation is now more grave. It has incurred continuing
large losses in 1986 through 1988, and the progressive constraints on funds and
working capital have further affected its performance. CONETNA's management is
taking several steps e.g. consolidation of the steel and iron foundries into a
single foundry at the new steel foundry, supplementary investments and
diversification of product mix, integration of the facilities of the new valve
plant and the machining facilities at its Palmela plant (which may be closed
down), links with foreign partners for the valve plant, etc. Howsver, major
financial restructuring would be required to restore COMETNA to financial
soundness. METALGEST and IPE are examining possibilities, in this regard, within
the wider context of integrating selective COMETNA operations with those of other
enterprises in its portfolio.
12.    Meaningful revised estimates of the Project's financial and economic rates
of return (ERR and ERR respectively) are not possible at this time given the



uncertainties due to the major restructuring underway In the Project components.
It is likely however, that, in the absence of such restructuring, despite the
lower than estimated capital costs for the Pr",ject, the revised FRR and ERR would
be much lower than appraisal estimates because of the delays in project
construction and the slow build-up of production to capacity levels. Due
primarily to market constraints, full capacity production is not expected to be
reached until the mid-1990s for all the Project components. The weak domestic and
foreign markets have also meant substantially lower prices for the companies'
products. At the same time, COMETNA also encountered learning curve problems
associated with assimilation of the new technology in certain areas (e.g. chemical
sand moulding), leading to slower production build-up, quality problems, and
higher operating costs. These are gradually being resolved. Achievement of any
lasting improvement would depend critically on the prior finaneial restructuring
of COMETNA to improve its working capital situation, and consolidation of the
progress made in SOREFAME.
13.     In teoms of institution building, the Project resulted in significant
strengthening of the Borrowers; and IPE's project implementation and monitoring
capabilities, gradual improvements in the Borrowers' management information,
costing and accounting systems, and some organizational improvements. However,
the progress in organizational aspects has been much slower than recommended in
the management consultants' recommendations (e.g. SOREFAME) due to the company's
internal constraints, and the social anr legal constraints concerning labor
reduction.
14.    The Project had limited impact on me:ro level or sectoral policies.  As
explained (para 1), the Project was envisaged as a first step to be followed by a
subsector development study which was expected to provide the basis for further
development of subsector institutions and policies. Although the study was
completed, it was not implemented due to changes in the Government and the desire
of the new Government to reassess its approach to the subsector in the light of
Portugal's accession to the European Community (EC). However, IPE is planning to
carry forward the rationalization/restructuring work that was the basis for the
Project but progress in this regard has been slow. The Project has led to skills
development through the transfer of technology to the two Borrowers, strengthening
of the Borrowers' and IPE's project implementation and monitoring capabilities,
and the experience gained by CESEM (the agency established to coordinate the work
on the subsector study) staff in coordinating the multi-consultant, multi-
component subsector study. The Project also provided valuable experience to the
local consultant firms involved through the interaction with experienced foreign
consultants. Despite some absorption problems, the Project resulted in
acquisition and assimilation of new technology comparable to that in other leading
European producers, and to the upgrading of production capability and product
quality. CESEM's involvement in coordination of the subsector study involving
many consultants provided useful experience, but with the dissolution of CESEM,
and the delay in implementation of the study, there is no institutional continuity
to preserve and disseminate the experience.
Project Sustainabilitv
15.     The main achievements under the Project were summarized earlier (paras.
10, 13 and 14). These benefits are expected to continue. But, sustaining them



* 6 -
will require, apart from improvements in the domestic and foreign markets,
financial restructuring of COMETNA, some rationalization and i"-egration of
CONETNA's facilities, and consolidation of the belated progress made in SOREFAME.
Financial and technical assistance will likely be needed to help the companies to
reorganize, diversify and consolidate their activities. IPE and the authorities
will, therefore, have to expedite the restructuring programs for the concerned
enterprises, particularly COMETNA, and to help SOREPAME to consolidate the
progress made so far. The Project's impact on subsector institutions and policies
has been limited this far (para 14). Prospects, in this regard, remain uncertain
since the Government has not taken, as yet, a decision on the utilization of the
study results and recommendations which may now have to be updated and modified in
the light of events since thie study's completion in 1983.
Bank Performance
16.     The Bsank's performance was effective in the preparation and implementation
phases, but it could not significantly influence the largely external factors that
severely affected the Borrowers' performance, particularly after ProSect start-up.
The Bank contributed to the preparation work through recommending the preparation
of a detailed rationalization study by experienced consultants, and careful
enterprise selection based thereon. Potential market, technical and financial
risks were identified. Market confirmation was sought through reviews by
indeperdent corsultants and the Government's approval of a specialization
agreement for power equipment producers (e.g. SOREFAME to specialize in hydro-
power equipment, other producers in thermal power equipment). To cover technical
risks, ieasibility studies were updated and reconfirmed. Provision was made for
technical assistance during project constriction and implementation, and for
product design and technology (e.g. for valves). Financial restructuring of the
Borrowers was ensured through obtaining the agreement of the concerned financial
institutions and the Government on the viability contracts (financial assistance
packages) for the Borrowers and identificatior of additional financial measures
required. Conclusion of satisfactory agreements on the financial restructuring of
the enterprises was made a condition of loan effectiveness.
17.     During implementation, Bank supervision ensured strengthening of project
management after resolution of early weaknesses; effective consultant/client
interface after ironing out of early problems; generally, timely availability of
funds; and continuity in the Borrowers' managements to provide the necessary
stability during Project implementation. Bank supervision, however, could not
overcome the largely unforeseeable implementation problems described earlier
(para 8).
18.     After Project start-up, at the Bank's continued strong urging, SOREFAME
and IPE undertook the rationalization/restructuring of SOREFANE though with
considerable delay due to IPE's need to integrate this within a larger context
(involving several other enterprises), and the concomitant social and legal
constraints to reduction of labor, etc. The Bank, however, could have no
significant impact on the deteriorating domestic and export market situation that
severely affected the Borrowers' performance. The Bank was also unable to secure
implementation of the subsector study recommendations for the reasons mentioned
earlier (para 14).

19.     Main lessons learned from the Project that may 'ne relevant, elsewhere are:
(i)   project construction schedules proved optimistic and should have provided
for the types of implementation difficulties encountered, particularly
during equipment erection/installation and commissioning/start-up;
(ii) prequalification requirements should be strengthened, if possible, to
prevent the disruptions of the type caused, e.g. by equipment suppliers'
bankruptcies;
(iii) new technology problems should be anticipated and contingency provisions
made;
(iv) in a project of this nature, involving public sector producers and
consumerc, an inter-ministerial group should be set up at the outset for
problem-solving; lacking such a group, the Bank should perhaps have
considered a more aactivist# role during Project implementation in respect
of problem-solving, e.g. in helping resolve the problems in the domestic
market, early implementation of rationalization/restructuring measures,
etc.; and
(v)   in view of the delay in implementation of the study, the responsibility
for preserving and disseminating the subsector study preparation
experience should have been clearly specif'ed with the concerned
government agencies.
Borrower Performance
20.     Overall, the performance of the Borrowers, IPE and the concerned
Government agencies in the preparation and implementation phases was good.
Considerable preparatory work was carried out with the assistance of the Bank.
The Borrowers' performance during project implementation was satisfactory as well
after resolution of initial problems arising from the lack of familiarity with the
Bank's procurement and other procedures. The Borrowers and IPE complied, though
in some cases with some delay, with all main covenants until physical completion
of the Project. Reporting was satisfactory. Compliance with financial covenants
was affected after Project start-up by the severe underlying market constraints.
The Borrowers took the initiative to overcome civil construction, equipment
erection and installation, and commissioning problems. Project management was
strengthened, cooperation with consultants became more effective, and IPE closely
monitored progress of the Project.  Performance was less effective in securing
organizational improvements (e.g. SOREFAME), where implementation of the
management consultants' recommendations was slow given internal constraints, and
social and legal constraints concerning labor reduction. IPE's monitoring of
project progress was effective, it contributed funds generally in a timely manner,
and it was able to secure the necessary rationalization/restructuring of SOREFAME
though with considerable delay. The subsector study was carried out effectively
by CESEM. Initial gaps were covered by additional work. CESEM was successful in
coordinating the work of the multi-component, multi-consultant study.
21.     Main lessons of significance for the Borrowers, IPE and the concerned
agencies were:
(i)   the importance of strong project management units and close management
attention to project implementation;



(ii) the need for contingency planning and alternative arrangements for
problem-solving;
(iii) the need to strengthen export marketing arrangements and establish links
with capable foreign partners;
(iv) the need for an inter-ministerial group to resolve issues between public
sector producers and consumers;
(v)   the importance of early implementation of rationalization and
restructuring measures to prevent the progressive deterioration in the
companies' performance; and,
(vi) arrangements should have been defined for pL ,erving the experience during
the preparation of the study until such time as the concerned authorities
made a final decision as to whether, or not, to implement the study's
recommendatiors.
Project Relationship
22.     The working relationships between the Bank, the Borrowers, IPE and the
different agencies concerned were good at all times. Bank-Borrower/IPE
cooperation was particularly effective in the preparation and implementation
phases of the Project. Bank supervision could not, however, influence the mainly
external factors that affected Project results, i.e. the unfavorable domestic and
export markets.
Consultant Services
23.    Consultants employed under the Project, in general, performed
satisfactorily. Preparatory work for the Project was acceptable to the Borrowers
and the Bank. The foreign consultants formed effective consortia with local
consultants. After initial difficulties due to locational problems (the
consultants abroad and the clients in Lisbon), CONETNA's project consultants
worked in close cooperation with the Borrower. The management consultants
employed by SOREFAME were effective in the diagnosis and action plan definition
phases but less so in the implamentation phase due to SOREFAME's internal
constraints, and the social and legal constraints concerning labor issues. The
main consultants employed for the subsector study also generally performed well
although there were gaps in their preliminary work which were later covered
through additional work carried out by them, and by additional, new foreign and
local consultants, and which resulted in a delay in finalization of the study.
Project Documentation and Data
24.     The legal agreements for the Loans provided a good basis for supervision
of the Project. At no time were there any disputes regarding interpretation of
any of the provisions. The Project Staff Appraisal Report provided a continuing
basis for monitoring the progress of the Project. Information from the project
files was adequate during active project supervision.
