AGREEMENT, dated OCAP &<"< 2. , 1980, between REPUBLIC OF

(hereinafter called the Borrower) the Bank has agreed to make to
the Borrower a loan in various currencies equivalent to ten
million six hundred thousand dollars ($10,600,000), on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, but only on
condition that the Guarantor agree to guarantee the obligations of
the Borrower in respect of such loan as hereinafter provided;
and
WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank's enter-
ing into the Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed so to
guarantee such obligations of the Borrower;
NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
General Conditions; Definitions
Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all
the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated March 15, 1974, with
the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein
(said General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agree-
ments being hereinafter called the General Conditions).
Section 1.02. Wherever used in this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the
General Conditions, of the SOREFAME Loan Agreement and the SORE-
FAME Shareholder Agreement have the respective meanings therein
set forth.
ARTICLE II
Guarantee; Provision of Funds
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any
of its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor


﻿-2-
and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the
premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan and the punctual
performance of all the other obligations of the Borrower, all as
set forth in the Loan Agreement.
Section 2.02. Without limitation or restriction upon the
provisions of Section 2.01 of this Agreement: (a) the Guarantor
specifically undertakes, whenever there is reasonable cause
to believe that the funds available to the Borrower will be
inadequate, to meet the estimated expenditures required for the
timely carrying out of the Project and promptly to provide the
Borrower or cause the Borrower to be provided through the Share-
holder with such funds as are needed to meet such expenditures;
and (b) the Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as
primary obligor and not as surety merely, the provision of cash
funds in accordance with Section 4 of the SOREFAME Shareholder
Agreement.
ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek,
in normal circumstances, specific security from the member con-
cerned but to ensure that no other external debt shall have
priority over its loans in the allocation, realization or distri-
bution of foreign exchange held under the control or for the
benefit of such member. To that end, if any lien shall be created
on any public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any
external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the
benefit of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation,
realization or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall,
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto, and at no cost
to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in
creating or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make
express provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be
made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of its
political or administrative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall
promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on
other public assets satiofactory to the Bank.


﻿-3-
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i)
any lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof,
solely as security for payment of the purchase price of such
property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of
banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more than
one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets"
means assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative
subdivision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by,
or operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including assets held by any institution
performing the functions of a central bank or exchange stabili-
zation fund, or similar functions, for the Guarantor.
Section 3.02. The Guarantor and the Bank shall from time
to time on the request of either of them consult with each other
regarding the Guarantor's long-term strategy for Portugal's
mechanical industries sub-sector and any substantial investments
in it.
Section 3.03. Without limitation to its obligations under
Article II of this Agreement, the Guarantor shall: (a) take, or
cause to be taken through the Shareholder, all reasonable action
including provision of funds to assist the Borrower in meeting
operational losses and debt service until completion of the
Project and its obligations under Sections 5.05 and 5.06 of the
SOREFAME Loan Agreement and the SOREFAME Viability Contract; and
(b) except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, refrain from any
action which might materially restrict or affect the Borrower's
ability to meet its obligations under Section 4.02 of the SOREFAME
Loan Agreement.
Section 3.04. (a) Should the Guarantor decide to transfer the
ownership of the Borrower from the Shareholder to another public
entity, it shall inform the Bank of the arrangements intended for
such proposed successor of the Shareholder to assume all of the
Shareholder's obligations under the SOREFAME Shareholder Agree-
ment.
(b) Should the Guarantor wish to transfer the majority
ownership or effective control of the Borrower from the Share-
holder to a private entity acceptable to the Bank, it will ex-
change views with the Bank on arrangements for the successor of
the Shareholder to assume all of the Shareholder's obligations
under the SOREFAME Shareholder Agreement.


﻿-4-
(c) Prior to an agreement with the Bank on the arrangements
referred to in (a) or (b), as the case may be, the Guarantor shall
not carry out such transfer and shall not affect the Shareholder's
control of the Borrower.
(d) Unless the Bank and the Guarantor otherwise agree, the
Guarantor shall not take any action which would relinquish or
affect its ownership or effective control of the Shareholder or
interfere with exercising its rights and obligations as owner
of the Shareholder.
Section 3.05. The Guarantor shall take all action required
