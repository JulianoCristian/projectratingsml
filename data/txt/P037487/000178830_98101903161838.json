Credit would be provided for the\n            development of improved pastures, fencing, water supplies,\n            machinery for fodder production, livestock buildings, and\n            the purchase of cattle. In the dry land zone of the\n            southwest, where the project would be mainly located, the\n            most important element would be the replacement of natural\n            pastures of low productivity through the exploitation of\n            subterranean clover and forage crops offering a substantialy\n            higher level of output. Farms in this area would produce\n            mainly feeder cattle and fat stock for slaughter. In the\n            northern area, where conditions are ideal for their product,\n            improved strains of the more productive temperate zone\n            species of permanent pasture would be introduced. Production\n            in this area would be mainly of milk, with weaner calves as\n            a significant by-product. In both areas, cattle would be\n            vaccinated against prevalent diseases."}, "docdt": "1969-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
