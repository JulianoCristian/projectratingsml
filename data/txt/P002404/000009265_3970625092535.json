Population Project is\n            designed to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) for planning, management, coordination and\n            monitoring, to improve basic health and family planning\n            services, and to help develop population policy and programs\n            for family planning demand-generation activities. A key\n            project objective is to reduce dependence on public\n            expenditure to finance developments in the sector by using\n            available resources more efficiently and by significantly\n            improving cost recovery and cost containment practices. To\n            assist in the policy reforms and management improvement\n            efforts, the project will provide technical assistance and\n            training, equipment, materials, vehicles and incremental\n            staff. To strengthen health and family planning service\n            delivery, it will finance renovation and equipping of a\n            limited number of service facilities and provision of\n            essential drugs and medical supplies."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
