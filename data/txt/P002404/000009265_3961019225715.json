Lessons learned from\n            the project are: 1) A project that aims at the institutional\n            development of two different Government entities, but gives\n            only one of them access to project funds, runs the risk of\n            seeing the other entity crowded out. In such a case, it\n            might be more effective to either have two separate projects\n            or to provide both Government entities with a special\n            account and access to the credit. This problem may be of\n            particular relevance for the population sector which remains\n            a highly sensitive area of assistance; 2) cost recovery\n            programs and drug revolving funds are unlikely to yield a\n            100 percent recovery of costs. They are difficult to operate\n            and vulnerable to abuse. Full-fledged management systems and\n            measures to reduce the risks need to be designed and set up\n            before and not after their establishment; and 3) if projects\n            are approved even though a country is threatened by\n            subsequent International Development Association (IDA)\n            suspensions, adequate precautions need to be taken to reduce\n            the possible damage for all parties involved. It should be\n            ensured that suppliers are advised to request letters of\n            credit so that they are not faced with non-payment in case\n            of suspension."}, "docdt": "1996-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
