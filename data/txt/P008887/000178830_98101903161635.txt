INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE
THIRD CUKUROVA POWER PROJECT
June 11, 1969



REPCRT AND RECaCMMATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTCRS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR THE
TEHRD CUKUROVA POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$11-5 million to
the Republic of Turkey for the Third Cukurova Power Project, to assist in
financing the foreign exchange costs of the Kadincik II hydroelectric plant
of the Cukurova fLektrik A.S.
PART I. HISTORICAL
2.        The Bark made a loan (63-TU) of US$22.8 million equiva'ent to the
Turkish Government in 1952 to help finance the multi-purpose Seyhan Dam
project at Adana.   At the Bank's suggestion Cukurova Elaktrik A.S. (CEC)
was formed in 1953, and the Government granted it a 14 year concession to
purchase and operate the pcvcerhouse of the Seyhan hydroelectric facility;
a revised concession, increasing the concession area and providing more
flexibility is to become effective in the coming months.
3.        IDA has extended two credits to the Goverment for relending to
CEC, aggregating US$25.7 million equivalent.    The first (34-TU, 1963), for
US$1.7 million, financed in part a third 18 MW unit in the Company's
Seyhan hydroelectric plant, and the second (59-TU, 1964) for US$2h million
equivalent, is helping to finance the Kadincik I hydroelectric plant of
70 MW (upstream from the presently proposed Kadincik II), and a thermal
plant of 100 MW near Mersin.
i.        The only other Bank loan for power in Turkey was a US$25 million
loan in October 1968 (568-TU) for the Keban Transmission Lines Project.     The
Bank also made a technical assistance grant of $1,950,000 to Turkey in 1967,
to assist in the reorganization of the power industry; of this amount,
US$550,000 has so far been committed for consultant services.
5.        Although it had been assumed that the Bank would lend directly
to CEC as is normal practice, the Government informed the Bank during
negotiations that there was some question of the Government's authority,
without special legislation, to guarantee such a loan.    14hen it became
cbvious that this question would not be resolved in time to avoid a serious
delay in going ahead with the Project, the loan wfas renegotiated as a loan
to the Turkish Government for relending to CEC under a subsidiary loan
agreement, with a Project Agreement between the Bank and CEC.
6.        The negotiations on the proposed loan took place in Washington
from Nay 5 to 19, 1969 and were completed by cable on June 6, 1969.
Mr. Turgut Yegenaga, Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Vakif Acunsal, General
Manager, represented the CEC, and Mr. Zeki Toker, Director General of the
Treasury and OIEC, and Mr. Ahmet Gul, Economic Counselor, and Mr. Aydemir Moo,
First Secretary (Economic Affairs), and Mr. Bedr6ttin Sarp, Technical Adviser,
of the Turkish Embassy, represented the 1urkish Government.

8.        Execution of most of the project has been satisfactory.    Two
changes in the construction plans of the Second Cukurova Power Project
were agreed in 1967 and 1968, and the project is now scheduled for completion
in 1970.   Progress with on-farm development under the Seyhan Irrigation
Project which had been disappointing until 1967, is now satisfactory.    An
improvement in the administration for implementation and an increase in
agricultural credit have been agreed with the Government for both Seyhan
Irrigation Projects, Stages I and II.
9.        Further projects are now under consideration in agriculture
(livestock, fresh fruits and vegetables) and in power.   These projects still
need some months of preparation before they can provide the basis for loans
or credits.
10.       IFC has made and has under consideration several investments in
Turkey.   In July 1966 IFC invested nearly $1. million jointly with TSKB,
in a loan and shares for the expansion of a synthetic yarn factory (SIFAS).
On May 15, 1969 IFC's Board of Directors approved a second investment of
$1.93 million in loan and equity in SIFAS.   IFC has also made two equity
investments in TSKB totalling $1.25 million, and a third equity investment
of $417,200 was authorized by IFC's Board on March 4, 1969.    IFC expects
to submit to the Board in June 1969 a project for a $3.1 million investment
in loan and equity in Viking Kagit ve Seluloz A.S., a ccmpany to be formed
which will build and operate a paper mill near Izmir.    IFC is also
considering requests for the partial financing of projects in the following
sectors:  flat and container glass, soua ash, and polyester fiber.

PART III. THE PROJECT
12.       A report entitled "Turkey - Appraisal of Third Cukurova Power
Project" (PU-13a, dated June 2, 1969) is attached.
Background
13.       The Second Five Year Plan (1968-1972) emphasizes the branches of
the manufacturing sector which have a high technology input, such as
chemicals, steel, engineering and electrical irH.ustries.   In the powEr
sector investments of almost US$1 billion over these five years are expected
to increase power production by 1 per cent annually, compaz'ed with an
increase of 11.5 per cent annually during the first plan period.    The total
capacity of generating plant in Turkey at the end of 1967 was about
1,950 MW.   Of this capacity 70 per cent is connected to systems owned and
operated by Etibank, a State Enterprise; 25 per cent is autonomous and
installed in a number of towns and industrial plants; and the balance,
5 per cent of the total, constitutes the present CEC system.    This CEC
system will have doubled its capacity to 22h MW in 1970 when the works under
construction are completed.
1.       The CEC is the principal private power company in Turkey and the
only one of a significant size.   About h0 per cent of its share capital is
held by the Etibank, the remainder by individuals and organizations, many of
which are CEC's consumers.   The CEC system serves one of the most prosperous



- 5 -
and rapidly developing agricultural areas in Turkey.    The company's
operations are being managed satisfactorily.   Although there are some
organizational problems, CEC plans to solve these by a training program
to be financed under the loan.
15.       In 1970 and 1971 when a power shortage in the Etibank system is
anticipated, CEC is expected to have a surplus of power for its needs.
Etibank is building a connection from its grid so that it may buy this
surplus, estimated at 220 GWH for 1970 and 100 GWH for 1971.   The sale of
power to Etibank may begin in late 1969 if either the Mersin thermal plant
or the Kadincik I hydroelectric plant, construction of which is progressing
satisfactorily, is ready for full commercial operation by that time.
The Project
16.       The proposed loan is to finance the foreign exchange costs of the
Kadincik II hydroelectric plant, consisting of a low diversion dam, a power-
house with a 50 MW generating unit, penstocks, and a six kilometer tunnel.
The site is a short distance dowmstream of the Kadincik I plant now being
completed.   I;hen both Kadincik projects are completed, they will fully
develop the Seyhan river's pouer potential.   A training program is also
included in the Project, which will enable local personnel to go abroad to
receive instruction for a few months, and allow CEC to hire experts to work
within CEC for about a year and to give on-the-job training.    The project
is technically sound and with the assistance of its engineering consultant
Syndibel, the company is capable of executing the project.    Commercial
operation is scheduled for late 1972.   Total estimated cost of the project
is $17.2 million, including interest on the Bank loan payable during the
construction period,which is estimated at three years.
17.       Local costs would be financed in part from cash generation and in
part froa a new stock issu6 of TL25 million, which has already been subscribed,
and from two bond issues of TL5 million 6ach to be offered in 1970 and 1971.
18.       The only reasonable alternative to the proposed Kadincik II
hydroelectric plant would be an oil-fired steam plant.   A study made by
Syndibel, the company's consulting engineers, shows that, assuming the cost
of capital in the power sector does not exceed about 17 per cent, Kadincik II
represents the least costly solution to meet 1972 power requirements.
19.       Between 1964 and 1966 CEC's operations, based on the Seyhan
hydroelectric plant only, were satisfactory; the rate of return on average
fixed assets wias in the order of 19 per cent and net income per share, after
corporate taxes, averaged about 23 per cent of par value.   Dividends were
consistently paid at 15 per cent to 17 per cent of par value, which has
contributed to the good reputation of the company among investors.    However,
the results for 1967 and 1968 have been less favorable.   The rate of return
fell to 12.7 per cent and 12.2 per cent respectively.   Similarly net income
per share, after taxes, fell to 17 per cent of par value in 1967, and is



- 6 -
expected to be only 15 per cent in 1968.  Although CEC's ample cash
reserves would enable it to maintain its dividend record without difficulty,
this would imply in 1968 a distribution of about TL2 million out of past
retained earnings.
20.       In order to provide a more adequate earnings base for meeting
the forthoaming financial requirements, a tariff increase of 1.6 kurus
(about 13 per cent over 1968 levels) has been agreed with the Company and
the Government, to be instituted by the end of October 1969.  I;ith this
tariff increase, CEC's performance is expected to be fully satisfactory.
A Letter of Representation was signed on behalf of the Government, on
June 10, 1969, confirming that a request from CEC has been received for the
above mentioned tariff increase, that permission for such increase will be
granted, and that the increased tariff will be in effect before the Government
asks the Bank to make the loan effective.  A period of about 120 days after
signature of the agreements will be allowed for this purpose.
21.       Maximum future interest payable, including interest on the
proposed Bank loan, would be covered 1.76 times by 1969 income, taking into
account the tariff increase.   The present agreement wTith IDA, which requires
a 1.75 times coverage would be incorporated in the loan documents.  Total
annual debt service would be covered by internal cash generation at least
2 times, which is satisfactory.
22,       CEC will follow Bank procedures for procurement anid bidding for
the civil works and all equipment will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding.   No provision has been made for ary preference to be
enjoyed by domestic bidders as it is believed unlikely that any Turkish
contractor would be successful in supplying the goods and services needed.
However, the Bank would be prepared to finance the documented foreign
exchange portion of any contract won by a successful domestic bidder.
PART IV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement (Third Cukurova Power Project) between
the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the
Bank and Cukurova Elektrik A.S., the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section  (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text
of the Resolution approving the loan are being distributed separately to
the EXecutive Directors.
2h.       Aside from the relending procedure employed for the reasons
stated in para. 5 above, the Agreements follow the general pattern of those
for similar projects.
PART V. THE ECONOMY
25.       The report of the 1968 Economic Mission to Turkey entitled
"The Economy of Turkey" (No. EMA-ha) wias distributed to the Executive
Directors on February 18, 1969.   It reappraises the country's economic
situation in the light of its performance under the First Five-Year Plan



- 7 -
(1963-1967) and the problems and prospects to be faced in the period of
the Second Five-Year Plan (1968-1972).   Although economic progress has
been substantial in recent years, Turkey seems to have reached the
juncture where major changes in basic policies are required to bring
about improvements of decisive importance for the longer term.    The success
of these measures is likely to depend on the increase, or, at least, the
maintenance of the present level of external capital inflow required to
enable Turkey to maintain its growth and new investment until a greater degree
of external viability can be achieved.
26.       Turkey has had a heavy burden of debt, with service charges
amounting to some 25 per cent of visible export earnings in 1968, and, in
order to meet its obligations without impeding its development, a considerable
portion of external aid has taken the form of debt relief; most official
capital during the years 1966-1968 has been made available on concessionary
terms, with interest averaging 3 per cent per annum and repayment periods of
30 years.   Although it has a high debt service ratio, Turkey has a margin of
creditworthiness for loans on conventional terms, provided that part of
future assistance will continue to be on concessionary terms.    Improvement
in Turkey's economic performance will increase its creditworthiness and the
efforts of the authorities in this direction i-ll be kept under continuing
review.   In the light of all these factors, I consider that part of Turkey's
needs can be provided on conventional terms and I consider Turkey credit-
worthy for the proposed loan.
PART VI. COMPLIANCE WfITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII. REC0IMIENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
