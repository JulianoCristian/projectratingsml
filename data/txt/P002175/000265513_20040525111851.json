The Requesters\n            state that the IDA-financed project in the slum communities\n            in Ijora Badia and Ijora Oloye has resulted in forced\n            eviction of some 2,000 persons who have lost their homes and\n            businesses, while thousands of others face an imminent\n            threat of eviction.

The Requesters claim\n            that the IDA has done harm to the affected people because of\n            its failure to follow its own policies and procedures\n            relevant to the Project.
