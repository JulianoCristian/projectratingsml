The key lessons convey\n            primarily, the importance of involving beneficiaries, as of\n            the early stages, in project selection, preparation, and\n            design, to attain project ownership, as shown by the success\n            of this project. The creative innovation of a financial\n            management consultant, responsible for payments,\n            disbursement commitments, and project account monitoring,\n            although successful in comparison to the former independent\n            banks' approach, did not achieve the necessary\n            skills' transfer to Project Unit (PU) staff, hence,\n            sufficient capacity should be built within the PU in the\n            future. But, both the resource mobilization method of a\n            standing payment order - which avoided experienced delays in\n            obtaining counterpart funds, - and, the establishment of a\n            maintenance account, for the release of funds for regular\n            drain maintenance, proved successful. However, the lack of\n            clearly defined responsibilities between consultants and PU\n            staff, was conducive to conflicting situations, where\n            legitimate instructions were ignored. This should be defined\n            alongside the enhancement for PU supervision capacity, and\n            training needs, as well as an increased flexibility in\n            contract documents."}, "docdt": "1999-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
