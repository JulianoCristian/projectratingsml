The project objectives\n            were primarily to: (a) rehabilitate existing equipment to\n            improve postal and telecommunications services; (b) promote\n            efficient operation and maintenance of rehabilitated systems\n            and provide for their limited expansion; and (c) assist in\n            implementing sector reform and institutional development,\n            particularly financial management, through technical\n            assistance. The project's objectives have generally\n            been met, and implementation was generally satisfactory. The\n            equipment to be rehabilitated has successfully been\n            upgraded. Some improvement in postal service and in\n            telephone services has been realized, particularly in the\n            capital, Vientiane, where a new digital telephone exchange\n            was installed. The installation of long distance telephone\n            services to provincial capitals by means of high frequency\n            (up to 30 MHz) used for radio communications radio systems\n            was completed, albeit with some delay. The selection and\n            deployment of consultants for project implementation were\n            also delayed, and the original consulting team needed to be\n            replaced after about one year in the field. Delays in these\n            two areas led to a delay of about two years in project\n            completion and in the closing of the credit. The\n            institutional development component for accounting and\n            financial management achieved marginal results, but this\n            activity has been strengthened and is progressing with the\n            ongoing second telecommunication project."}, "docdt": "1993-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
