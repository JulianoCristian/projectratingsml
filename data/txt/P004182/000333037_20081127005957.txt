                       Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Lao People's Democratic
       Republic - Telecommunications Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project
        (Credit 1684-LA)" prepared by the East Asia Regional Office, with Part 11
       prepared by the Borrower.

                       The project, which was co-financed by UNDP, was essentially
       successful       in     supporting:        (i)    the     rehabilitation         of     the     country's
       telecommunication network (albeit with some delay) and (ii) the initiation of a
       program of institutional development through technical assistance and training.
       The latter has been furthered under the Second Telecommunication Project (Credit
       2101-LA, approved in 1990)' currently being implemented.

                       The project is rated satisfactory overall, its institutional impact
       substantial and its sustainability likely.                    The Project Completion Report is
       thorough and informative and no audit is planned.

                           PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT


                                     PREFACE


            This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Telecommunica-
tions Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project in Lao PDR for which a
credit of SDR 3.5 million was approved on April 22, 1986. The creqit was closed
on June 30, 1992, one year behind schedule.    The last disbursement was made on
December 14, 1992 and the undisbursed balance of SDR 179,873.27 was canceled.

            The PCR, excluding Part 11, was jointly prepared by the Industry and
Energy Operations Division, Department 1, East Asia Region (EAlIE), the Private
Sector Development and Privatization Group (CFSPS), and the Telecommunications
and Informatics Division, Industry and Energy Department (IENTI).    Preparation
of the PCR was based inter alia on the President's Report, the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, and correspondence between IDA and the Borrower
and internal Bank memoranda .A/

                               EVALUATION SUMMARY

i.    Objectives.  The project objectives were primarily to:

      (a)   rehabilitate existing equipment to improve postal and telecommunica-
            tions services ;
      (b)   promote efficient operation and maintenance of rehabilitated systems
            and provide for their limited expansion; and
      (c)   assist in implementing sector reform and institutional development,
            particularly financial management, through technical assistance.

ii.   m.                           The project's objectives have generally been
met, and implementation was generally satisfactory.        The equipment to be
rehabilitatedhas successfully beenupgraded. Some improvement in postal service
and in telephone services has been realized, particularly in the capital,
Vientiane, where a new digital telephone exchange was installed.   The installa-
tion of long distance telephone services to provincial capitals by means of HF
radio systems was completed, albeit with some delay.          The selection and
deployment of consultants for project implementation were also delayed, and the
original consulting team needed to be replaced after about one year in the field.
Delays in these two areas led to a delay of about two years in project completion
and in the closing of the credit.   The institutional development component for
accounting and financial management achieved marginal results , but this activity
has been strengthened and is progressing with the ongoing Second Telecommunica-
tion Project.

iii.  Results. The project achieved its objectives. EPTL's existing telecommu-
nications network was rehabilitated and improved to a modest degree, and now
provides a basis for further expansion.   EPTL was able, with the assistance of
consultants, to prepare the 1990-95 Development Plan.      The project also was
instrumental in introducing modern digital telephone switching technology in the
capital, Vientiane.   The technical assistance component, supported by UNDP,
provided staff development in management and engineering and also to a lesser
extent in the financial and accounting areas.

iv.   Lessons Learned.  (a) Where a borrowi,ng country has a weak technical core,
IDA should ensure that the scope of all consultancies are well defined, and the
process of selecting consultants is well advanced by the time the project is
presented to the Board.  (b) Also for countries where telecommunication network
development is still somewhat basic, the experience of suppliers should be given
greater weight in the bid evaluation process.    (c) The technology alternatives
should be evaluated carefully, even for small rehabilitation projects.       This
project was developed around the approach of repairing old telephone equipment
and using HF radio links for the main long-distance links.        The use of new
equipment (e.g., the telephone exchange installed in Vientiane) and modern

transmission systems might have been a surer alternative, and therefore the
analysis of technical alternatives should have been more comprehensive and
documented in greater detail. (d) The project included an audit covenant that
was unrealistic, given EPTL's accounting weakness during the project's early
stages and the lack of auditing capabilities within the country. This latter
issue is a national problem in Lao PDR that cannot be addressed by a single
operation.

2.   Background

     Domestic and international posts and telecommunications (P&T) services in
the Lao PDR are state monopolies. The P&T services were an integral part of the
provincial administrations until 1982 when they were reorganized into 17
autonomous provincial P&T enterprises.    Given the need to improve the poor
quality of service, the Government decided to merge all P&T enterprises into a
single autonomous state enterprise, the Enterprise dlEtat 4es Posts et
T&l&communications Lao (EPTL), which was established on January 1, 1986. The
Ministry of Communications, Transport, Posts and Construction (MCTPC) is
responsible for regulation with respect to the quality of service, financial
management and administration. EPTL is headed by a Director General assisted by
department managers. As a result of the dialogue between the Government and the
Bank to improve the quality of service and organization, the Bank agreed to
consider a project which was regarded by the Government as essential for
stimulating economic development.     Following an exploratory IDA mission,
agreementwas reached with the Government that priority should be given to sector
reorganizationand immediate rehabilitation and limited expansion of P&T services
throughout the country. The Government officially presented the project to IDA
in September 1984 with a request for financing.

          through technical assistance.      In particular,    improving
          financial management and performance of EPTL by introducing an
          appropriate accounting system and setting financial perfor-
          mance targets that require increased operating efficiency.

3.2 pro1ect Descri~ti~q

    The project components were as follows:

    (a)   Rehabilitation of:

          (i)   the telephone exchanges in Vientiane and the four main
                provincial capitals (Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet,
                and Thakhek).  Simultaneously, exchange capacity would
                be increased from 4,000 to 5,000 lines in Vientiane and
                from an average of about 200 lines to 750 lines in the
                provincial capitals; and

          (ii) the local cable network in Vientiane, through replace-
               ment (60%) and repair (40%); replacement of excessively
                long and vulnerable overhead lines by cables in the four
               major provincial capitals; and limited extension of
                subscriber cable networks and outside plant to match the
                rehabilitated existing exchange capacity.

    (b)  Provision of:

          (i)   duplex HF radio circuits for telephony and telex between
                Vientiane and the four provincial capitals with automat-
                ic exchanges, and transfer of their present equipment to
                other provincial capitals;

          (ii) HF radio circuits for telephone and telegraph links
                between Vientiane and some provincial capitals, and
                between provincial capitals and smaller cities;

          (iii) equipment for the relocated HF radio receiving station
                in Vientiane and a buried cable between the new station
                and the Vientiane telephone exchange;

          (iv)  small manual and automatic telephone exchanges in small
                cities;

          (v)   equipment for regional maintenance centers in Luang
                Prabang and Savannakhet and establishment of a warehouse
                for cables; and

                  (vi) specialized vehicles, machinery, accessories and tools
                        for construction/maintenance of the networks and for
                        postal   services, power    supply,   air  conditioning,
                        building    and   accounting    equipment,    and   sup-
                        plies/equipment   to carry out the project and for
                         training.

            (c)   Construction of:

                  (i)    a building to relocate Vientiane's HF radio receiving
                         station; and

                  (ii) building and facilities for Posts in Vientiane, and 30
                         additional post offices to extend the postal network.

            (d)   Technical Assistance and Trainine consisting of:
                                                    -



                   (i)   foreign experts (90 expert-months) to advise EPTL in (1)
                         financial management, accounting, billing and collec-
                         tion, management information, and tariff; (2) organiza-
                         tional matters; (3) project engineering, procurement,
                         installation acceptance; (4) operation and maintenance;
                         and (5) staff training; and

                   (ii)  overseas fellowships for EPTL staff (40 employee-months)

4.     rolect Desian and Or~anization
         -         -


      4.1   The project was designed within the framework of EPTL's 1986-90 Post
and Telecommunications investment program.      The physical components of the
project were those of highest priority to overcome the poor condition of exchange
facilLties and the lack of alternative means of communication.

      4.2   Due to the lack of expertise and experience of P&T management and
staff it was considered essential to provide technical assistance to support
sector reorganization, management improvement and development of the technical
and financial data base necessary for efficient operation and future investments.
UNDP grant financing supported the technical assistance component of the project.

5.    Project Im~lementation

      5.1   1:                                               The IDA credit was
approved on April 22, 1986, but only signed on December 12, 1986. The reason for
this delay was the time needed to get agreement on the use of ITU as executing
agency for the UNDP assistance, and the finalization of the UNDP project document
(it was signed on December 5, 1986). The original date of credit effectiveness
was April 14, 1987. Due to delays in the recruitment of consultants, which was
a condition of effectiveness, the effectiveness deadline was first postponed
until June 11, 1987; after a second postponement, the credit became effective on
July 1, 1987. More preparation of the consulting services and familiarization
with UNDP and ITU processes and the coordination required might have resulted in
less delay at the start, and more timely project implementation.

      5.2   Im~lementationSchedule: The project was originally scheduled to be
completedby December 31, 1990. Procurement actionon the IDA financed component
of the project, which depended on inputs from the consultants, could only begin
in January 1988. Thus the original implementation schedule was revised for the
first time in February 1988.   The project was completed only in December 1992,
a delay of two years (Tables 111-2 and 111-4C).    The difficulties in selecting
consultants were responsible for one year of this delay.     The second year was
caused by malfunctions in the HE equipment and the measures needed for the
supplier to comply with the purchase contract (para. 5.3).

      5.3     The physical component which experienced the greatest delay was the
implementation of the HE radio equipment.   The equipment that was supplied did
not perform according to the technical specifications and had to be adjusted and
repaired.   As far as the technical assistance was concerned, the technical
experts generally provided timely support for planning and engineering, but the
finance and administration component was delayed in part by the selection process
and also by the need to change some members of the consultant group who lacked
the appropriate expertise.

      5.4   The original closing date was June 30, 1991. There was an extension
of the closing date by one year up to June 30, 1992, mainly to enable the
contractor to resolve the problems found in the acceptance testing of the HE
radio equipment.

      5.5   procurement : EPTL1s performance on procurement under the project was
satisfactory.   Once the UNDP technical assistance experts were in place, the
procurement action on the various packages relating to HE radio equipment,
vehicles, machinery and tools and civil works proceeded smoothly. Rehabilitation
by repairing the existing old telephone exchanges, an important component of the
project, did not prove to be feasible or practical because the spare parts or
suitable equipment which could have been refurbished, transplanted and installed
were generally unavailable at reasonable cost.    This component was substituted
by a new digital exchange of 1,000 lines in Vientiane, procured under interna-
tional competitive bidding, to meet the most immediate needs of the city.     The
procurement for civil works and vehicles and tools proceeded with no special
problems.

      5.6   The UNDP Technical Assistance Project Agreement, signed on December
5, 1986 provided funding of USS1.5 million, essentially to support IDA'S project.
It financed mainly the provision of long-term consultants for (i) development
planning; and (ii) financial management and accounting, each for a period of
three years.   The UNDP project also financed some short-term consultants for
telephone switching and radio communication, to assist the detailed design of the
switching and transmission components of the IDA project. The UNDP project also
provided fellowships for overseas training of 8 middle managers.

      5.7   Proiect Costs:   The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was
USS7.75 million with a foreign exchange component of USS4.29 million. The actual
cost of the project is now estimated to be about USS9.64 million   (Tables 111-5A
and 111-5B). About 30% of the local cost demanded by the project was used for
postal service rehabilitation.   The deviation of the local cost component from
the appraisal estimate was less than 10% and therefore is not considered

material. The foreign cost increase of about 40% was mainly due to the increased
costs resulting from the purchase of new telephone exchanges instead of
rehabilitating old equipment, and the increased cost of the transmission links
and of the UNDP component for technical assistance. While the procurement of a
new exchange for Vientiane increased the project's cost, EPTL made that decision
because of the urgent need to improve international service. The cost of the HF
system was underestimated at appraisal.

      5.8   Pisbursements:   The disbursement performance on credit 1684-LA is
given in Table 111-3A.    The disbursements were slow in starting due to the
initial start up delays (para 5.2), but accelerated later. The credit was closed
on June 30, 1992, and EPTL was authorized to submit by October 30, 1992
withdrawal applications covering expenditures incurred before June 30, 1992.

      5.9   The originalandrevisedallocationbycategories for credit1684-LA
is shown in Table 111-3B. The revised allocation was agreed to in December 1989
to provide for funds originally allocated for rehabilitation of existing
exchanges instead for purchase of a new 1000-line exchange for Vientiane (para
5.5).

6.    Pro1ect Results

      6.1   project Objectives:    The project achieved its main objective of
rehabilitation and limited expansion of the telecommunications systems in
Vientiane and the four main provincial capitals, and of the postal service in the
country. The technical assistance provided under the project also enabled EPTL
to meet some basic staff training needs and start a program of institutional
development that is being furthered by the Second Telecommunications Project.

      6.2   Physical Results:    In physical terms, Tables 111-4A and 111-6A
indicate the increase in exchange capacity and additional telephone and telex
subscriber lines that resulted on completion of the project.        Although the
additional telephone exchange capacity is concentrated almost exclusively in
Vientiane (with a new 1,000 line exchange), the rehabilitation of outside plant
in the larger provinces allowed service lines in those areas to continue to
function while remaining connected to old exchanges.    In other provinces, old
small telephone exchanges or manual switchboards had to be decommissioned due to
the lack of replacement parts. Post offices were rehabilitated through building
maintenance works and new office equipment in most of the provinces.

      6.3   Technical Assistance:   Notwithstanding the delay in selecting the
consulting company, the initial core did not perform satisfactor$ly and had to
be replaced after a period of about a year, because they lacked the appropriate
expertise.  All objectives of the Technical Assistance, including training of
middle management, were achieved, albeit with some delay. Additional efforts in
the accounting and finance areas have been addressed in the second IDA
Telecommunications Project    (which is partly supported by UNDP       technical
assistance).

      6.4   Financial Performance:    The President's Report does not contain
financial projections, and therefore the PCR cannot compare actual results for
the project implementation period with projections made at appraisal.     Still,

EPTL has maintained proper accounts since 1990, and Table 111-4B herein
summarizes EPTLUs key financial data for 1990 and 1991.           EPTL's  financial
statements and finances are generally satisfactory, and it has complied with most
of the financial covenants of the credit.

            (a)   Accounts. On the one hand, the Borrower has made significant
                  progress in setting up an internationally accepted accounting
                  system, which is presentlybeing implementedmanually. A full
                  set of financial statements for headquarters operations is
                  being produced and reviewed on a monthly basis.         This is a
                  significant achievement for the Borrower given the state of
                  the accounting functions and personnel at the outset of the
                  Project.   The Borrower is now in the process of documenting
                  procedures for automating the accounting system as well as
                  other subsidiary systems, including billing and collection,
                  provincial accounts, and budgeting.

            (b)   i t . During the implementation period, EPTL's accounts were
                  not audited annually by independent auditors, as required by
                  the covenants under the Development Credit Agreement.       In the
                  project's early stages, the quality of EPTL's accounts were
                  not adequate to enable an audit.         The consultants helped
                  remedy this weakness, so that annual accounts have been
                  developed from 1990 onward.      While those accounts have had
                  imperfections, they are fundamentally auditable. At the same
                  time, the accounting profession at the national level has not
                  yet developed to a point where private firms have auditing
                  capabilities.   The Ministry of Economy, Planning and Finance
                  has developed an Audit Department, which has certified the
                  accuracy and reliability of the accounts since 1991. The Bank
                  has accepted this certification as satisfying the audit
                  covenant with respect to this project as well as others in Lao
                  PDR.

            (c)   Billinrc and Collections.      EPTL has failed to comply with
                  financial covenants regarding collection of receivables. The
                  covenant stipulates that for government departments and public
                  enterprises, receivables be reduced to 4 months and for
                  private subscribers to 2 months.         Between 1988 and 1990,
                  collections steadily worsened. EPTL with the help of consul-
                  tants strengthened its billing and collection procedures and
                  implemented a rigorous disconnection policy.       These measures
                  have helped in reversing the trend in 1991, but the results
                  still fall well short of targets, as indicated in Table 111-7.
                  IDA continues to monitor       EPTLUs performance     during   the
                  supervision of the Second Telecommunications Project.

            (d)   The Borrower has also strengthened its financial management
                  practices by introducing internal control procedures and cash
                  management practices. Specialized financial reports have also
                  utilized since 1992 in order to anticipate cash liquidity
                  problems and to access the enterprise's financial position overall.

            (e)    Return.Aneconomicrateofreturnwasnot
                   calculated for this project in the President's Report, and
                    therefore this report cannot compare the actual rate of return
                   with what had been projected at appraisal. The President's
                   Report did indicate that this was primarily a rehabilitation
                    and technical assistance project; and rates of return for such
                   projects in countries with similar levels of development had
                    averaged about 23 percent. However, since the rehabilitation
                    component had mixed results, and the Vientiane component was
                    dropped in favor of purchasing new digital exchange equipment,
                    the actual rate of return is likely to fall well short of that
                    23 percent level.

      6 . 5 u t u t i o n a l Impact: With the establishmentof EPTL, the Government
provided an institutional framework that consolidated management at the national
level and should have improved the reliability of postal and telecommunication
services. The lack of suitably qualified personnel at all levels of management
has been a major impediment to achieving this objective. The project partly
addressed this constraint by providing on-the-joband overseas training; as a
result, institutional capacity has improved appreciably.

7.    Project Sustainabilitv

            The project was designed to provide only rehabilitation and limited
expansion of existing networks, and EPTL has the capacity to operate and maintain
the specific assets developed under the project. A Second Telecommunications
Project has followed in 1990 with a relatively substantial component for
expansion of the network.        The additional institutional development being
provided under that second project will further enhance EPTL's capacity to
sustain the assets being provided by this project.



      8.1   IDA'S performance has been satisfactory.        IDA'S involvement was
propitious in responding to the Lao PDR's request for assistance in the
telecommunications sector, especially considering its very poor state, and for
stimulating economic development. In spite of the initial difficulties in the
technical assistance component and the choice of rehabilitation to meet the
project's hardware objective, a considerable supervision effort enabled IDA to
provide a valuable intellectual as well as financial input.

      8.2   In this project IDA was assisted by ITU, which was the Executing
Agency for the Technical Assistance component financed by the UNDP.

      8.3   During implementation of this project, IDA identified and appraised
the Second Telecommunications Project and approved a Credit of SDR 19.1 million
in 1990. That project is now under implementation.



            The Borrower's performance has also been satisfactory. The initial
delays in finalizing the UNDP Technical Assistance Agreement and the delay in

choosing consultants/experts was overcome.                    EPTL's performance with regard to
billing and collection has been below expectation at appraisal (Table 111-7).
However, the Second Project has a provision to implement additional remedial
measures in this area, and those efforts are being implemented. Part I1 of this
report includes a copy of the assessment of the project results prepared by the
~orroweru


10.     proiect Relationship

                The Bank maintained a harmonious working relationship with EPTL
managers and staff, and also with related Government agencies throughout project
implementation.          The Resident Mission in Bangkok assisted these efforts.
Relationships with UNDP headquarters in New York, the Resident Representative in
Vientiane and with ITU in Jakarta were good.

11.     Consultine Services

                The consulting services for this project were financed by the UNDP
(para 6.3) under the Technical Assistance Agreement.                     The initial selection and
placement of the consulting team did not prove satisfactory, and they had to be
replaced.      The new team carried out its assignment satisfactorily.


12.     prolect Documentation and Data

                The President's Report and Legal agreements were adequate for the
project. The periodical progress reports from EPTL were not received regularly
in the project's early stages, but later, the quality and timeliness of regular
reports improved as a result of help provided by the consultants.

  Subject: Evaluation Telecommunications Project Phase I.

               Lao PDR has received a credit from the World Bank
  3.5 Million SDR or 4.3 Million US Dollars and others funds from
  UNDP, Bilateral Aids Programmes from Governments of France and
  Australia.
    There funds play the important role to assist and rehabilitate
  the first development of Posts and Telecommunications services in
  our country.
-   In view of the project completion,We have honour to inform You
  that:
      -  In spite of our obiour network, the quality of internal an&
  international telecommun icationa have improved better than nothing
 existed.
      --.Acces to Telecommunications has been increased.
         A nation-vide connecting the major provincial cities with
 capital Vientiane has been developped.                            .
      The project put in public services since late 1989. Bythen
 customers complaints were reduced gradually. EPTL commenced getting
 revenues increasely.
    In parallel to the improvement of Telecommunications services in
 Lao PDR,We still observe some main weak points,they are as follow:
      - The Talesystem Consultant team was insufficient pratices in
 the field of Planning,Design and Management. The time was           delayed
 by overlap of consultants. SoltheMaster Plan of Telecommunications
 was only available by the end of 1990.

     - Since the beginning,f      KW HF radio system provided by Telecom
 Australia was poor installation. Spare parts are not available on
 spot. men the equipment is out of order. The service is stopped
 due to lack of spare parts .The matched Telex syrtem into this HF
 radio does not uork until1 now. The system was delayed one year and
 half.   As of the end of June 1992, revenue of 14 months through the
 HF radiocornmunication represents only 8.85% of the contract price.

-  Earth satellita station Vista does not work properly due to the
lack of spare parts. Transfer of know-hou of the operation aad
maintenance was not sufficient.

  At the end, the Ministry of Communication,Transport,Posts and
Construction appreciated very much and thanks to the World Bank for
its       assistance       and cooperation   in      executing   Lao PDR
Teleconr~lunications not only for this project but also for the
future one.
  Also, we would like to express our thanks to the UNDP and donors
governments for their precious financial supports and grant aids.
We hope the World Bank,UNDP and donors governments will continue
their participations into our next Posts and Telecommunfcatlons
