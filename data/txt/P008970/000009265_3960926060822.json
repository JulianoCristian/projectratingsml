Project\n            aims to help the government to refine and implement its\n            decentralization strategy through selective interventions in\n            five major cities; Adana, Mersin, Tarsus, Ceyhan and\n            Iskenderun. These cities were selected for the project\n            because they exemplify the problems of rapid urban growth\n            and service deficiencies, and because future growth there\n            will be jeopardized if services are not provided more\n            efficiently.  It intends to assist the five municipalities\n            in directing urban growth and catching up on service\n            deficiencies through financing infrastructure investments.\n            At the same time, it seeks to strengthen their ability to\n            plan, implement, operate, and maintain these services, while\n            improving their resource mobilization and financial\n            management.  The project will finance part of the 1987-94\n            segment of the five municipalities' investment\n            programs.  The main components to be supported under the\n            project include:  (a) area-based infrastructure programs;\n            (b) citywide infrastructure development programs; and (c) an\n            institutional development program.  The project will help\n            refine and implement the Government's decentralization\n            policy.  It will demonstrate a strategy which should enable\n            Turkey to handle its urban growth problems in a more\n            cost-effective manner."}, "docdt": "1987-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
