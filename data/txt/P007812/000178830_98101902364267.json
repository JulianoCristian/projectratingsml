The project includes: (a) assistance in\n            compilation of petroleum exploration information,\n            negotiation of contracts with oil companies, revision of\n            petroleum legislation, preparation of specialized studies,\n            and monitoring of oil company activities, if required. (b)\n            assistance in developing the capabilities of the Technical\n            Secretariat of CONADE through staff training, the\n            development of a data management system and the preparation\n            of studies on pricing, energy aspects of transportation, and\n            integration of the results through the formulation of a\n            national energy strategy; and establish an energy library\n            and an energy conservation unit. (c) an electric resistivity\n            survey (a geophysical study) of a geothermal site (Cerro\n            Pando), completion of analyses of 23 additional geothermal\n            sites, and a preliminary field investigation of coal resources."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
