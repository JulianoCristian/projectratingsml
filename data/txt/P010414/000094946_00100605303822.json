development\n            impact is substantial. Nonetheless, several lessons are\n            drawn from the project: 1) Capacity building in the areas of\n            financial management, and procurement should be part of the\n            project design, together with an assessment of the capacity\n            of implementing agencies at appraisal time, and include\n            built-in safeguards in the form of end-use audit reviews.\n            Additionally, performance indicators need to be agreed at\n            appraisal, as well as project costs to establish benchmark\n            values. 2) Operational aspects suggest that regional\n            projects should rather be replaced with province specific\n            projects, to reduce complex geographical issues, number of\n            implementing agencies, and, to better address the province\n            macroeconomic framework, while minimizing long-term\n            implementation periods. 3) Administrative aspects call for\n            coordination mechanisms, and adequate monitoring -\n            particularly for projects funded by a variety of donors,\n            with parallel financing arrangements - to be defined at\n            appraisal. Guarantees for continuity of key managerial, and\n            technical staff should be contained in the legal documents,\n            to include as well a clause in the Project Agreement to\n            minimize political interference in managerial aspects, but\n            agree on the selection criteria for essential project staff."}, "docdt": "2000-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
