MEMORANDUM AND RECOIDGMUTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVIIOFnENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVM DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAXISTAN
FOR A SECOND FAMEILY EALT PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of SDR 35.0 million (US$48.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finance a second family health
project. The project will also be financed, under parallel arrangements, by the
German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW -- US$22.2 million equivalent) and by
the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA -- US$12.2 million
equivalent).
2.   Backgrgud.   Pakistan's demographic and health indicators remain poor.
It is the ninth most populous country in the world with an annual population
growth of 3.1Z and a fertility rate of 5.8 births per woman. The expectation of
life at birth has slightly improved to about 56 years, but infant mortality at
103 per thousands births, and maternal mortality at about 600 deaths per 100,000
births, remain extremely high.  Child mortality is dominated by infectious
diseases, especially gastrointestinel infections; malaria and malnutrition are
important contributory factors. Malnutrition is a major problem, particularly
for children and pregnant or lactating women.
3.   Traditionally, the public sector has accorded priority to hospital and
curative care while primary and preventive services were neglected. A greater
focus on basic health services, especially infrastructure, developed in the mid-
1980s but preventive services, outreach and health education remain limited.
Recent policy has sought to address these deficiencies but implementation of
health and population programs has been disappointing. Staff development has
been characterized by an over-supply and under-employment of young doctors and
under-supply of paramedical staff, especially females, resulting in severe
operational problems in providing services for women. Service quality, outreach
and utilization are low due to systemic problems including manpower, management
and finance. Few health facilities currently offer family planning services; the
emergency and referral system is ineffective; health education and nutrition are
neglected; and public health continues to be under-funded. The private modern
health sector is large and growing but mainly confined to urban areas and to
curative care and the involvement of non-goverrment organizations is limited.
4.   The federal and provincial governments are committed to increase resources
in the social sectors including health and population. This is consistent with
the new health policy published in May 1990, which emphasized the importance of
meeting health needs of the poor and giving priority to primary care. The drafts
of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1993-1998) emhasize the strategies included in the
health policy with its focus on decentralization of the health administration,
the Introduction of Community Health Workers, a major expansion of female
paramedical and nursing staff, encouragement for the private health sector, and
improved financing.  Moreover, the governoent is preparing a Social Action
Program (SAP) which is designed to remove policy barriers and to improve project
and program implementation. The contents of the new policy, the Eighth Plan and
the SAP confirm a major shift in favor of primary health care. Within this
framework, the provincial governments are preparing detailed health investment
programs.  The proposed project will help support the health programs in the
provinces of Balochistan and the Punjab for the next five years.   The



-2-
sustainability of project investments has been carefully reviewed, the government
is committed to their continued financing, and funding is assured through macro-
economic, SAP and project conditionality.
5.   Rationale for IDA    olyement. Through  its  policy  dialogue, IDA  in
agreement with the donor community has been advocating strongly the need for
increased government activity in the social sectors, the development of which has
lagged badly despite Pakistan's economic progress. IDA and cooperating donors
are supporting the development of the SAPs and the health programs; the proposed
project is within this framework. It will focus on and finance key parts of the
government's primary health investment programs especially for maternal and child
health earvices, and contribute to institutional strengthening and policy
reforms.   it will focus on the poor and try to make better use of past
infrastructure investment. The one previous IDA health project is at a very
early stage and there is little implementation experience to draw on.  A
population project wa: completed in December 1989. It achieved only limited
success due to: (a) the erosion of political support for the population program;
(b) an under-estimate of the institutional constraints on implementation; and (c)
difficulties arising from the distribution of responsibilities between the
federal and provincial levels. OED evaluations of social sectors' projects in
South Asian countries indicate that sustained political support, sound planning
based on recent sector studies, establishment of strong links between project
organization and program administration, and management training accompanied by
administrative commitment and improved technical performance are important for
the success of such projects. These lessons have been taken into account in
preparing the proposed project through: (a) ensuring political commitment towards
the PFP and the SAP; (b) basing the planning rrocess on an updated health sector
study; (c) making the project an integral part of the program; and (d) ensuring
that management and staff development are major components of the project.
Furthermore, in order to increase its effectiveness, the proposed project
includes:  (a) fleLble implementation arrangements; ,b) advance readiness for
Implementation; and (c) simplified design and involvement of existing sector
institutions.
6.   tPvoiect Objectives. The project has the main objective of improving the
health status of the population of the two provinces through assisting with the
implementation of the provincial health development programs. These programs
will increase the emphasis on:  (a) primary health; and (b) preventive and
promotive services.
7.   Project Descriution. The proposed project will finance key parts of the
Balochistan and the Punjab programs concentrating on: (a) strengthening primary
health services focusing on improved maternal and child health services including
family planning, through inputs to improve service access, quality and
utilization, especially in rural areas; (b) staff development aimed at improving
staff capabilities and performance, increasing the number of female paramedical
staff, expanding female paramedical training capacity and increasing recruitment
and incentives; and (c) management and organizational development through
increased management capacity, and improved management quality and efficiency.
There are also limited inputs to selected supporting federal programs. The
project will be implemented on the basis of annual agreed sub-programs which,
inter alia, will seek to ensure an appropriate balance between recurrent and
investment financing and which would allow for adjustments in work plans based
on previous years's accomplishments.



-3-
8.    The total capital investment cost of the five year health programs in
Balochistan and the Punjab is estimated at US$520 million. The proposed IDA
Credit will partly finance priority sub-programs with a total cost est.mated at
US$114.0 million equivalent (including $0.5 million for retroactively financed
activities after appraisal to advance project readiness for implementation of
technical assistance, civil works and staff training) and a foreign exchange
component of US$49.7 million equivalent (44X). A breakdowr. of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D respectively.   A map
showing the geographical coverage of the project is attached.   The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 11127-PAK is being distributed separately.
9.    Actions  Amrged.    During Negotiations,  the  Federal  and  Provincial
Governments as appropriate provided assurances that: (a) each province will
prepare a health sector policy and strategy statement which will be discussed
with IDA and issued by December 1993; (b) annually, by March 31, each province,
together with IDA and the cooperating donors, will (i) review program
implementation for the past fiscal year, (ii) agree plans and development
budgetary allocations and planned overall recurrent budgetary allocations,
irnluding IDA and other assistance, for the coming fiscal year, and (iii) reflect
these agreements in the budget proposals. Each province will provide sufficient
development and recurrent funding to primary and rural health services throughout
the program; the recuri .t health budget proposal will reflect the real rate of
growth of GDP; and preference for the allocation of additional resources will be
given to basic health services and non-salary items. A similar federal annual
review will also be conducted; (c) essential drugs lists will be approved by both
provinces by July 1994 and introduced by December 1994; (d) an in-depth study of
the proposed reorganization of the communicable disease control program will be
completed by July 1994, necessary measures agreed with IDA by December 1994, and
implementation started by July 1995; (e) by December 1994 about half of all
government health facilities in both provinces will offer family planning
services and all such facilities will do so by July 1996; (f) the provincial
staff development teams will be established and adequately staffed by December
1993; (g) a study of the incentives and service cenditions of female paramedical
staff will be conducted by July 1994, necessary measures agreed with IDA and
implementation started by December 1994; (h) at least 75X of the professional
staff of the Provincial Health Development Centres will be recruited by December
1993 with the Centres being fully staffed by December 1994, and at least 751 of
the professional staff for the District Health Centres will be recruited by the
end of the first year of their operation with the balance appointed during the
second year; (i) powers will be delegated to District Health Officers by June
1994 to hire, transfer and promote staff up to Basic Pay Scale 12; and existing
levels of financial delegation for operating exponditures will be implemented;
(j) arrangements with local universities and non-governmental organizations for
obtaining technical support for the project by the provinces will begin during
the first project year and continue throughout the -,roject; (k) agreements for
the provision of the main technical assistance consultants for management and
training development services will be signed by March 1994; and (1) standard
requirements will be met including: acquisition of the few remaining sites;
preparation of progress reports; satisfactory accounting arrangements for annual
audits; administration of the Special Accounts; use of Statements of Expenditure;
conduct of a mid-term review; preparation of a Project Completion Report; and the
use of IDA Procurement Guidelines and satisfactory LCB procedures.



-4-
10.   There is one special Condition of Credit Effectiveness:  the approval of
the project PC-lsl by the Executive Commitcee of the Federal Government's
National Economic Council.
11.  sn     umeal Consideatona.  The proposed project was determned to be
in screening Category C, which includes projects that are expected to have no
significant negative environmental impact.
12.   Benej ts.  The proj&ot will improve the health status of the population
with a special emphasis on high risk and other under-privileged sections of the
community. Women will benefit particularly, through improved maternal health
services including increased availability of family planning.   By project
completion, the health services available to some 70-80X of the total population
of the two provinces will improve. Service use is expected to increase from
present low levels, especially for women and children, with a doubling to 20-251
of pregnant women in the catchment area receiving some prenatal care and,
similarly, a doubling in the proportion of deliveries supervised. The government
will benefit from the institutional development components.
13.   Risks.  The project fa;es three main risks.  The most important is the
limited implementation capacity of the two provincial Departments of Health.
This risk is addressed through having a substantial management strengthening
component, simplifying and incorporating flexibility in the project design, and
providing technical assistance. The second is that women's health problems
including family planning may not receive sufficient priority from the present
health system; this risk is minimized through fostering strong commitment to the
project from senior officials, the project reinforcing and financing key aspects
of the maternal/child care focus of health policy, and the involvement of local
university departments and NGOs.  Finally, as the government's normal PC1-
procedures are not well adapted to the sectoral approach of this operation, there
Is the risk that those procedures will interfere with proper implementation of
the project; this risk has been minimized by including the maximum flexibility
permitted by government rules in the PC-ls for this project and by the
requirement of annual reviews which will induce changes in the PC-la when needed.
14.  RsgggMMW&&1on. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
