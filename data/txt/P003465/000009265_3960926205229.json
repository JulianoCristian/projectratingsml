The project\n            emphasizes improvement in the quality of teachers and\n            institution building. To that end, the project has three\n            components. The first component assists institutes of\n            education (IOEs) to expand and improve their capability to\n            meet the urgent demand for qualified lower secondary\n            teachers. The second component assists three municipal IOEs\n            to evolve into: (a) information clearinghouses; and (b)\n            research and evaluation and monitoring centers. The third\n            component improves management capability of the teacher\n            training system.  The Government plans to take parallel\n            action with the proposed project to further improve the\n            teacher training system: (a) to increase intake of students\n            from disadvantaged provinces; (b) to experiment with\n            training teachers to teach two subjects; (c) to increase IOE\n            average weekly teaching hours by 50 percent (d) to increase\n            female participation in teacher training; (e) to increase\n            funds to equip lower secondary science laboratories\n            adequately; and (f) to increase annual intake of lower\n            secondary teacher trainees to at least 70 percent of the\n            total intake at provincial IOEs."}, "docdt": "1988-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
