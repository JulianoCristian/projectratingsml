Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Teacher Training Project in China. The\n            project sought to: (a) assist 16 provincial and 52\n            prefectural institutes of education (lOEs) by expanding and\n            improving their capability to meet the urgent demand for\n            qualified lower secondary teachers; (b) assist three\n            municipal IOEs (Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) in becoming\n            information clearinghouses on teacher training curriculum,\n            methodology and materials as well as monitoring and\n            evaluation centers on key issues in teacher training; and\n            (c) improve the capability of the central State Education\n            Commission (SEdC) and the local authorities to manage the\n            teacher training system. Overall implementation of the\n            project was satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the\n            project experience are: (a) horizontal dissemination of good\n            practices even within the same type of institutional\n            structure (IOE network) is very difficult; (b) Likewise,\n            future projects need to be better designed to facilitate the\n            dissemination of new ideas and practice within institutions,\n            taking advantage of the rich experience of returning\n            (project supported) faculty from abroad.<BR>"}, "docdt": "1995-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
