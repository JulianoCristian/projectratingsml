                         management practices and improving fiduciary oversight; and (ii) increase access, quality and efficiency of the education, health and public transport services (by
                         modernizing the education system; modernizing, decentralizing and integrating various levels of health care; and strengthening the institutional and operational
                         capacity of the public transport sector).
