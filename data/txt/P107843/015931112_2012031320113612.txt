                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project development objectives (PDOs) are the following: i) improve public sector management and accountability by establishing results-based
                         management practices and improving fiduciary oversight; and (ii) increase access, quality and efficiency of the education, health and public transport services (by
                         modernizing the education system; modernizing, decentralizing and integrating various levels of health care; and strengthening the institutional and operational
                         capacity of the public transport sector).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This interim ISR is based on a desk review of Project implementation to-date.

                         The GDF SWAp was signed on September 10, 2009 and declared effective on October 15, 2009. The Project shows less than satisfactory progress in meeting objectives. In the last
                         Progress Report (August, 2011) targets were shown to have been met in only 3 out of 11 indicators, and only 40% of the resources budgeted in the Eligible Expenditure Programs
