                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project development objectives (PDOs) are the following: i) improve public sector management and accountability by establishing results-based
                         management practices and improving fiduciary oversight; and (ii) increase access, quality and efficiency of the education, health and public transport services
                         (by modernizing the education system; modernizing, decentralizing and integrating various levels of health care; and strengthening the institutional and
                         operational capacity of the public transport sector).

                         Government request for Project restructuring. Finally, the Bank's financial management (FM) team worked with the Project coordination and the TCDF to develop acceptable terms
                         of reference (TOR) for audits. The audit will be carried out by the TCDF and will be completed on September 30, 2011. The first disbursement on March 29, 2011 was in the amount
                         of US$15.6 million, including US$2.6 million for technical assistance (TA).
