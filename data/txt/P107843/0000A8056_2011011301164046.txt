                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project development objectives (PDOs) are the following: i) improve public sector management and accountability by establishing results-based
                         management practices and improving fiduciary oversight; and (ii) increase access, quality and efficiency of the education, health and public transport services
                         (by modernizing the education system; modernizing, decentralizing and integrating various levels of health care; and strengthening the institutional and
                         operational capacity of the public transport sector).
