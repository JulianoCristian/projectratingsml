for the Federal District\n            Multisector Public Management Project for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also highly\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: strong\n            government and implementing entity ownership and capacity\n            are critical for effective design and implementation.\n            Project design needs to introduce safeguards to protect the\n            project in case of a change in political situation,\n            particularly when taking risks with a new instrument and new\n            counterparts. Assessing changes in management practices has\n            to go beyond the signing and evaluation of Result Agreements\n            (RAs). Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be part of\n            fiduciary review package, particularly if disbursing against\n            results. This will include preparing a solid log frame;\n            developing measurable indicators; and establishing viable\n            M&E arrangements. Bank fiduciary rules and reporting\n            systems remained a challenge even though the project design\n            intended to introduce more flexible arrangements. Consistent\n            recording of project events and issues is necessary for\n            management to be able to make informed decisions regarding projects."}, "docdt": "2013-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
