growing\n            demand for municipal, industrial, and irrigation water in\n            the Han Basin 20 years following its completion in 1984. It\n            would also substantially reduce flood damage, generate an\n            average of 770 million kilowatt hours annually and provide\n            460 MW of peaking capacity for Korea's power system.\n            The principal features of the project include: a 90 m high\n            concrete dam across the south Han River; a power plant\n            containing four 115 MW generating units and associated\n            transmission facilities; a reregulating dam about 20 km\n            downstream of the main dam; relocation of about 100 km of\n            roads and 10 km of railway; protective works in the\n            reservoir area including the raising of an existing\n            embankment of a cement plant and other miscellaneous works;\n            implementation of a resettlement program for some 9,300\n            families affected by the project; and consulting services. A\n            demanding feature of the project in terms of management will\n            be the timely acquisition of land and property in the\n            reservoir area, and the prompt payment of compensation.\n            However, programs of a similar nature in Korea have been\n            undertaken in the past without serious delays or social problems."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
