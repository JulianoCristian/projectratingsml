the Financial Sector\n            Technical Assistance Loan Project (FSTAL) for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            technical assistance loans are a good complement to\n            Programmatic lending. The Brazilian government's strong\n            commitment to financial sector reform and the Bank's\n            extensive work in preparing the programmatic loans\n            facilitated the design of the FSTAL and its focus on\n            supporting institutional development needs of the principal\n            financial sector regulatory agencies. High capacity\n            countries like Brazil need Technical Assistance (TA) loans\n            to support institutional strengthening, but the projects\n            have to be focused on the needs of the beneficiary. In the\n            case of Brazilian Central Bank (BCB), their interest was\n            mostly in hardware and software to upgrade essential\n            components of the payments system and in training programs\n            for banking examiners. Brazilian Securities and Exchange\n            Commission (CVM) needs were concentrated in the operational\n            areas of enforcement, inspections, surveillance, and\n            financial and accounting norms. TA projects should have a\n            short duration with active Bank participation. The project\n            timeline should define the scope of activities. Simpler,\n            shorter and possibly more frequent projects may result in\n            better outcomes over time. TA loans should be stressed as an\n            important part of the Bank's economic development mission."}, "docdt": "2008-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
