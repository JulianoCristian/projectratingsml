capacity, to assist in the implementation of\n            Brazil's program of financial sector reforms. The two\n            main components will: 1) provide support in addressing\n            systemic financial sector issues, by reinforcing banking\n            supervision, through the Central Bank. Included is the\n            support for the payments system reform, through policy\n            advice on risk control management, operational upgrading,\n            and development of an efficient government securities\n            market. Banking supervision will be strengthened, through a\n            combination of studies, information technology upgrade,\n            policy formulation, and training assistance. In addition,\n            improvements in the banking system safety net will be\n            supported, through a revision of bank failure resolution\n            rules, initiation of contingency planning, and improved\n            monitoring of bank interventions; and, 2) strengthen\n            regulation, and compliance, and, increase transparency and\n            investor protection in the area of securities markets, by\n            supporting the Brazilian Securities Commission - CVM.\n            Specifically, diagnostic work will propose options on the\n            role, responsibilities, and resources of the CVM. Included\n            is the revision of the regulatory framework in terms of\n            governance, accounting techniques expected under the revised\n            Corporate and Securities Laws, improved market surveillance,\n            and strengthened disclosure, and investor protection.\n            Technical assistance, training, and information technology\n            will support capacity building of both the Central Bank, and CVM."}, "docdt": "2001-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
