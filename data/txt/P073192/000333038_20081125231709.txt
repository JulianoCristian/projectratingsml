F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The central objective of the project is to support the development of institutional
capacity to assist the implementation of Brazil's program of financial sector reforms.



                                               ii

The Financial Sector Technical Assistance project was prepared in parallel to the first
phase of programmatic lending, and was intended to facilitate the achievement of reforms
targeted for the subsequent stages, as well as reinforce, in the medium term, institutional
capacity at the two key financial sector regulatory agencies in Brazil; the Banco Central
do Brasil (BCB, Brazil.s central bank) and the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM,
Brazil's securities commission).

  Technical assistance is targeted at a number of areas which are included in the scope of
the reform program and which would support the overall effectiveness of the supervisory
agencies. Specifically, assistance to the Central Bank would include: support for the
reduction of interest rates and spreads, strengthening of banking supervision, regulation,
and failure resolution as well as enhanced preparedness for banking sector difficulties,
payments system reform, and finally, support to increase the overall efficiency of the
Central Bank through a follow up to Bank-assisted diagnostic work on information
technology systems. Support to the CVM would focus on: strengthening compliance,
supporting greater transparency and better monitoring of corporate financial accounting
and disclosure, improving market surveillance, strengthening investor protection and
public information, and finally, undertaking diagnostic studies on the present and future
roles, resources and responsibilities of capital market regulatory agencies.

1.       Program Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.       The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FSTAL) was designed within
the context of the financial sector reforms supported by two programmatic adjustment
loans, and as continuation of another technical assistance loan. The FSTAL was to
support the Central Bank (Banco Central do Brasil, BCB) and the Securities and
Exchange Commission (Commissao de Valores Mobiliarios, CVM), the two principal
financial regulators in Brazil.

1.1      Context at Appraisal:

2.       The Bank's first programmatic adjustment loan to Brazil's financial sector had its
underpinnings in a series of financial sector reform actions initiated with the Real
Stabilization Plan introduced in 1994 Real Plan, which accelerated after 1999, when
macroeconomic stabilization was demonstrated to endure.

3.       The Real Plan succeeded in sharply reducing inflation, which had been the driver
for bank earnings during the years of hyperinflation since the banks would re-invest non-
interest bearing deposits in high yielding financial instruments. The end of inflationary
profitability left the banks exposed to high-cost structures, non-performing loans, and few
earnings alternatives. Failure to adapt to a new competitive environment led to the failure
of a number of banks including two large institutions: Banco Economico and Banco
Nacional. In 1996, Bamerindus, the fifth largest bank in the country, also encountered
some problems and was sold in early 1997 to a major international bank.

4.       Having battled serious banking difficulties, the BCB embarked on a program of
institutional renewal to strengthen their regulatory and supervisory capabilities. As main
regulator of the banking system, the Central Bank instituted in 1995 a program of
incentives to allow the restructuring of banks (PROER ­ Programa de Estimulo a
Restructuracao e ao Fortalecimento do Sistema Financeiro Nacional) and created a
private deposit insurance agency. Motivated by bank intervention and restructuring costs,
BCB had begun a long-term modernization initiative to upgrade its ability to anticipate
and prevent major bank failures, to manage bank failures more expertly, and to make the
financial system more crisis-resilient. As part of these initiatives, the Bank's support was
sought in the form of a Central Bank Modernization Technical Assistance Loan
(CBMTAL) which was approved in November 1997.

5.       Although macroeconomic circumstances confronting the country grew more
difficult in 2001, due to both a deterioration in external conditions and a domestic energy
crisis, the government not only maintained but accelerated its pace of financial sector
reforms. CAS discussions in 2001 reconfirmed the financial sector as a priority area for
assistance through programmatic adjustment lending. The first Financial Sector
Programmatic Loan (PFSECAL I) approved in 2001 rested upon a series of reform
achievements that had occurred cumulatively over the period since 1999.




                                              4

 


6.      A series of macroeconomic setbacks confronted the country in the year prior to
the approval of the Second Programmatic Financial Sector Loan (PFSECAL II) in June
2002, approximately one year after the approval of the First Loan. These included (i) an
international demand slowdown following the crises of September 2001, corporate
scandals, and an oil price shock; (ii) the rapid downturn in Argentina and Uruguay, and
ensuing erosion of confidence towards Brazil; and (iii) a domestic energy crisis
precipitated by historically low rainfall levels that depleted hydro reservoirs, and ensuing
electricity rationing that constrained economic activity. The Government reacted to the
shocks with an appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal tightening. The Central Bank
increased short-term interest rates in order to contain inflationary pressures resulting from
a sizeable depreciation of the currency.

7.      Financial sector reforms supported by PFSECAL I had raised the level of
confidence in the soundness of the financial system. And by the time of Board approval
of the PFSECAL II, the economy appeared to have resumed steady but modest
expansion, but with somewhat higher inflation.

8.      This FSTAL was designed to provide the institutional support for the effective
implementation of the financial sector reforms which were in turn supported by the
programmatic adjustment loans. The FSTAL was to follow the CBMTAL with continued
support to BCB and expand the focus to the securities industry through its support to
CVM. The rapid growth of capital markets after the inception of the program proved the
importance of including support to this regulator.


1.2     Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key
        Indicators (as approved)

9.      The central objective of the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FSTAL)
was to support the development of institutional capacity to assist in the implementation of
Brazil's program of financial sector reforms. The specific objectives were (a) to raise
efficiency in financial intermediation and broaden access to financial services; (b) to
enhance financial system transparency and effectiveness of regulation and supervision;
and (c) to bolster defenses against crises.

10.     The specific objectives of the FSTAL were in line with the overall financial sector
reforms which were supported by the programmatic lending program (PFSECAL I & II).
In order to achieve those stated goals, the loan would formulate reform strategies, prepare
regulatory reforms; and strengthen institutional capacity of the principal regulatory
agencies.

Main Beneficiaries

11.     The project was to achieve these objectives through technical assistance to the
two key financial sector regulatory agencies in Brazil entrusted with the design and




                                               5

 


implementation of the reform program; BCB and CVM. The TA resources were aimed at
building capacity or institutional development of these two agencies.

Original Components

12.      The project was divided into two major components pertaining to each of the
regulatory agencies: BCB and CVM. The output consisted of diagnostic studies to help
formulate appropriate reform strategies; preparation and adoption of new regulations
associated with the financial sector reforms; and institutional strengthening consisting of
acquisition of software and hardware, training of staff, compiling of information and data
bases, and development of policies and procedures manuals, and other reference
materials to enhance the institutional memory of the two agencies.

13.      The design of the project components reflects a balance between diagnostic
studies, preparation of new regulations and institutional strengthening. Table 1 shows a
list of the principal components for each agency and the corresponding output indicators
as approved by the Board. In the case of the BCB component, some of the sub-
components were building on work already completed under the previous TA loan, the
CBMTAL. With respect to CVM, this was the first TA loan provided by the Bank

BCB Component

14.      The BCB component was to provide support to address systemic financial sector
issues and to reinforce banking supervision. Financial sector reforms had created a new
Brazilian payment system characterized by the co-existence of several clearinghouses.
Payment system risk reduction was a critical systemic financial sector issue. Diagnostic
studies of risk management at clearinghouses would help identify areas for BCB control
of payment risks and the acquisition of hardware and software for a new BCB-owned and
operated RTGS (real time gross settlement) would strengthen the functioning of the
payments system, which in turn would help to augment the efficiency of financial sector
intermediation.

15.      The banking supervision sub-component built on and expanded on considerable
work initiated in this area in the CBMTAL. This project focused on information
technology needs for off-site supervision. This involved the development of information
systems that would capture information from depository institutions on a timely basis for
easy analysis and review by bank examiners and to generate standard as well as
customized reports. Through this sub-component, the project was to contribute to
increased effectiveness of banking supervision, particularly off-site supervision.

16.      The strengthened bank failure resolution was an attempt to facilitate the process
of extra-judicial liquidations of failed banks that had been obstructed by legal and
bureaucratic hurdles. This was a response to the challenges faced by BCB in the mid-
1990s following the failure of a number of banks including two large institutions.
Reinforcing BCB's effectiveness in defending against financial crisis was one of the
pillars of the financial sector reforms.



                                              6

 



17.     With the support of the Loan, BCB was to undertake several studies to explore
selected areas of the financial system with the potential for improving intermediation
efficiencies. These studies emphasized concrete recommendations that would lead to
action plans for regulatory reforms. If the recommended changes in legislation and
regulatory policies were to be achieved and BCB was equipped with the tools to
implement these new policies, then the recommendations made by the studies would have
contributed to greater efficiency in financial intermediation.

18.     Other important areas for institutional improvement of BCB were the
enhancement of the Credit Risk Center and the preparation of an IT diagnostic with
recommendations for upgrading of the system. In an effort to reduce credit risk through
better information on borrowers' credit standing, the Loan was to provide funding for
expanding the coverage of the Credit Risk Center (Central de Risco) to very small loans,
above Reais1,000. This sub-component was a continuation of substantial work in the
development of the Credit Risk Center that had already been accomplished through the
CBMTAL. The outcome of the Credit Risk Center would be reflected in greater
intermediation efficiency, through better pricing of risk, and in broader access to
financing, since financial institutions would have up-to-date debt servicing information
on customers that they would otherwise not have considered as loan candidates. The IT
diagnostic study was also an important institutional piece given the highly intensive
information processing requirements of BCB as regulator and monetary authority.

CVM Component

19.     Being a relatively newer agency than BCB, CVM's principal challenge in the face
of fundamental financial sector reforms was gearing up for regulating increasingly
sophisticated markets but with severe constraints on available resources. The overall
growth of the market, as well as the internet, automated securities trading and increased
access to foreign markets was making market oversight more challenging. The specific
tasks identified for this project were determined against the background of an overall
review of CVM, of its present and future responsibilities, and its institutional
development needs in some of the key functional areas. The institutional strengthening of
CVM was expected to enhance financial system transparency and the effectiveness of
regulations as well as to raise efficiency in financial intermediation

20.     In terms of strategic positioning, several diagnostic studies were to be completed
dealing with different aspects of the organization. These studies dealt with key
organizational issues. The first was an assessment of CVM's organizational structure and
its adequacy in meeting the challenges of a rapidly changing regulatory environment. The
second was a study on the enforcement capabilities of the agency, which are essential in
establishing its credibility as an effective regulator. The third addressed the
organization's IT infrastructure needs. The quality of regulatory oversight hinges on the
availability of state-of-the-art IT, particularly in an industry dominated by technology
driven financial services.




                                                7

 


21.     Strengthening of compliance and regulations were important in terms of financial
system transparency and the effectiveness of regulations. In order to promote greater
transparency, CVM designed a project for digitalizing and indexing of all official CVM
statements, legal and accounting interpretations and disciplinary actions, and making
them available on the CVM website. Ready access to policy statements also facilitates
compliance and reduces the workload of CVM staff by eliminating requests for advice or
interpretation on previously disseminated topics. CVM staff also identified a number of
existing Instructions (regulatory statements) requiring updating and revision, including 5
Instructions on listing standards, 13 on tender offers, and 31 on material event disclosure
in accordance with a new Corporations Law and other initiatives.

22.     Supporting corporate governance and disclosure was important in terms of
financial system transparency as well as efficiency of intermediation. In view of the large
volume of corporate disclosure documents, including securities registration filings, IT
support was needed to improve the throughput of important information. This sub-
component called for the installation of a system to track all documents filed with the
capability to selectively review certain types of documents as well as the on-line
availability of the full text of all corporate disclosure documents. Loan funds were also
earmarked for training in selected areas of corporate governance and accounting. In order
to support the adoption of international standards a comparative study on international
accounting norms was planned.

23.     One of the critical components for effective supervision of securities market
activities is a well-grounded surveillance and inspection program. A fundamental
responsibility of a securities regulator is monitoring activities of securities markets and
participants to ensure fair dealing for investors and financial integrity of the system.
Because of limited resources, CVM had not kept up with technological changes regarding
market surveillance systems and thus the project was to finance the upgrade of the system
and associated hardware. Another important initiative was the upgrading of inspection
manuals which had become outdated in terms of changes in regulations, market activities,
and best practices that had been developed by CVM staff through years of in-the-field
experience but had not been molded into the institutional memory.

24.     The central focus of the investor protection sub-components was on increased
disclosure and other information investors need to make informed decisions. The main
initiatives included a consultancy to redesign and upgrade the CVM website, including
the identification of all categories of public information to be made available on the
website; and the procurement of equipment and software to upgrade the website. With
respect to the mutual funds, the project included a consultancy on the use of the CVM
website to make publicly available statements of mutual funds' data including monthly
holdings, net asset value, expenses and administrative fees. In addition CVM was to
perform a survey of investors to better assess the needs for regulations and educational
programs. By providing up-to-date financial information to investors via its website,
CVM would help enhance financial system transparency and as a consequence raise
efficiency in financial intermediation by encouraging greater investor participation in the
securities markets.

25.     At the time of project preparation, higher focus was given to the specific project
outputs relative to market outcomes. During project implementation, however, outcome
indicators related to those outputs were added in consultations with the Government in
order to more thoroughly review the implementation status of the project. These outcome
indicators referred to payment system efficiency as well as capital markets evolution in
terms of companies, trading value, and investment funds.

Cancellation of BCB Component

26.     In an unexpected turn of events, not foreseeable at the time of project design nor
related to the performance of BCB or the BCB component, the Bank was informed in
December 2004 by the President of the Central Bank that it would not seek an extension
of the project closing date of June 2005 and that it would cancel any remaining funds not
utilized by that date.

27.     The reason for cancellation by BCB was a fortuitous decision by the Brazilian
courts which made available to the Central Bank a sizeable amount of revenues collected
from the financial transactions tax. The Central Bank was formally granted the use of
certain public revenues from financial transactions, the RECHEQUE funds providing
them with up to an estimated US$20 million in annual funds. The funds could be used for
strategic projects and were costless for BCB. The Central Bank indicated that it would
continue the technical assistance collaboration with the Bank, although financing would
not be sought. At the time of cancellation of the BCB component, US$3.7 million had
been utilized of the original US$8.3 million project allocation, for a net cancellation
amount of US$4.6 million; thus 44.6 percent of the original project funds were utilized.



                                             10

 



28.          Bank staff recommended to cancel the BCB component but opted not to seek
Board approval for a formal restructuring of the project since the activities that had been
completed were considered to be key priorities identified in the PAD. Other key activities
were completed by BCB with its own funds.

Extension of Closing Date

29.          At the request of CVM the project closing date was extended twice. The closing
date was first extended from the original date of June 2005 to June 2007; and
subsequently it was extended a second time to June 2008. As explained in the section on
Implementation, the extension was in part due to notable delays in terms of the Brazilian
Government's budgetary approval process, and to a lack of coordination between the
UNDP and CVM's project management. At the time the project closed in May 2008
CVM had utilized US$3.5 million or 51.5 percent of the original allocation of US$6.8
million.


2.           Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1          Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30.          The FSTAL had a solid foundation in terms of the underlying Programmatic
Financial Sector Program to which it was providing support. The sector analysis and
diagnostic was developed during the preparation of the Program. The ICR for the
Programmatic Loans rated the program as satisfactory and its institutional development
impact as substantial.1 The FSTAL provided support in areas where there was widespread
agreement: improving prudential regulations and strengthening bank and securities
markets supervision.

31.          In preparation of this loan, consideration was given to several options. First, an
expansion of the existing CBMTAL was looked at but the available funding was
insufficient and it did not incorporate a CVM component. Second, the possibility of
adding other beneficiaries, in this case SUSEP, the regulator of insurance and open-ended
funds, and SPC, the regulator of closed-end funds, was evaluated but not adopted because
of the additional risk associated with a more complex institutional structure.

32.          Lessons learned were incorporated into the design of the project. According to GP
8.40, TA projects need to be flexible to accommodate the borrower's evolving needs and
priorities. For these reasons, the project included funds that were to be specified later
based on the recommendations of the diagnostic studies to be undertaken during the
initial phase of project implementation.

33.     The design of the project also recognized the high technical capacity at both
agencies, BCB and CVM. The design of the BCB component was greatly facilitated by
the existence of the CBMTAL. In fact, this project expanded on activities that had
already been initiated under the earlier TA loan. Those earlier activities initiated in the
previous CBMTAL included:

    · Upgrading of banking supervision: diagnostic study of the supervision
        department; preparation of supervision manuals; and development of training
        programs for bank examiners.

    · Review of financial sector issues: studies on bankruptcy law, interest rate spreads,
        inflation targeting, and methods for currency circulation.

    · Payments system: upgrade of hardware to expand capacity.

    · IT upgrades: development of software to process banks' information, a data
        warehouse to consolidate all data systems, and a catalogue of information dealing
        with the financial system

    · Enhancement of the Credit Risk Bureau through increased capacity and more
        powerful software for data analysis and reports.

34.     In terms of the BCB, the FSTAL was thus a follow-up operation to the first
CBMTAL with a broader scope by including new areas for improvement such as
upgrading the banking supervision department's off-site supervision capabilities,
strengthening of bank failure resolution, and preparing an IT unified access interface. On
the other hand, the overlap of some activities between the two projects delayed the launch
of the new one, as explained below.

35.     On the other hand, CVM was relatively new to Bank lending, particularly a TA
project. CVM's important resource constraints underscored the importance of this
project. CVM also had to create space within its organization to manage special projects
such as the Bank's TA loan. In this regard, the workload as specified in the CVM
component was somewhat ambitious. While there were important institutional needs in a
number of areas of the agency, it may have been helpful to have prioritized the tasks, and
to have reduced the scope of the work to address the more critical needs of the agency,
with the option of structuring a follow up TA loan to CVM that could also include the
other agencies that had been considered at the time of loan preparation. Since this was the
first formal working relationship between the Bank and CVM, a narrower work agenda
would have allowed CVM to move up a shorter learning curve before deciding whether it
made sense to negotiate a follow up TA loan.

36.     Both implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment to the project. The
Central Bank saw it as a logical extension of the work done under the CBMTAL and was
very interested in including other areas in the project. CVM's support for the project was



                                             12

 


expressed by all levels of the organization. Many units contributed their own proposals
for design and keenly debated alternative conceptual approaches towards implementation.

37.     At the time of project preparation Bank staff had identified several areas of risk.
The critical risks were considered modest such as lack of budgetary allocations from the
government to use project funds, the potential for startup difficulties of CVM as a
relatively new and resource constrained agency and its inability to allocate sufficient
human resources to the project.

38.     Based on the project's preparation and design, quality at entry is judged to
be Moderately Satisfactory. While continuity under the BCB component was a
favorable factor, the design of the CVM component was somewhat ambitious.


2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

39.     Project implementation was facilitated by the Government's commitment to
financial sector reforms and demonstrated through the successful completion of the
Bank's financial sector programmatic loans (PFSECAL I & II). The improvement in the
macroeconomic environment starting in 2003 and the consequent influx of foreign
investment into the securities markets underscored the importance of staying committed
to the project.

40.     The implementation experience of BCB and CVM was influenced by a
combination of technical and organizational factors. The technical capacity of BCB and
CVM staff was a favorable factor for successful implementation. However, in some
instances each agency faced the challenge of managing a relatively young professional
staff which had the technical skill sets, but still lacked the operational and field
experience to internalize project components. After completing the CBMTAL, BCB's
priority was training bank examiners to use the new manuals, before taking on more
commitments under the FSTAL. In the case of CVM there was a bigger constraint in
terms of limited staff resources.

Implementation factors

42.     The final list of outputs was shorter than what was proposed at the time of Board
approval and some of them had been changed in scope. The reduced level of output is
explained by the partial cancellation of the BCB component and decision not to further
extend CVM's closing date.

43.     Delays in budget allocations led to closing date extensions. The project could not
begin for approximately a year and a half after its Board presentation in September 2001
due to delays in meeting effectiveness conditions until July 2002, and subsequent delays
by the Government in approving the transfer of project funds to the general budget of the
two agencies ­ January 2003 for CVM and May 2003 for BCB. In the pluriannual budget
framework of Brazil's Government, budget requests have to be submitted up to a year in
advance for Congressional approval. The Loan was finally approved by the Senate in
May 2002. Then initial budgetary funding was authorized for release in December 2003
in the amounts of $1.2 million for CVM and $3.7 million for BCB. This was a critical
setback for timely implementation of the project.



                                                14

 



44.     The skill set of BCB and CVM staff as regulators facilitated their supervision and
quality control over consultants' output. The regulatory culture at each agency proved to
be a useful transferrable skill in terms of project monitoring and control. For example,
staff in both agencies was quick to discover problems with translation of consultants'
reports. In the case of CVM, staff overseeing the work by the consultant identified a
design flaw in a survey of enforcement practices in time to incorporate changes before
implementation. Project ownership by the staff of both agencies also contributed to
efficient implementation.

45.     Lack of coordination in TA lending resulted in a bottleneck for the BCB
component. The FSTAL was approved when the CBMTAL had not yet closed. One of
the setbacks for the BCB component was the overlap with the CBMTAL, which was not
closed until December 2003, or two years after the approval of this project (see table 3
below). This created a backlog for the project's work schedule particularly for those sub-
components that were to be implemented as a follow-up to the work in the prior TA loan.
In fact, the banking supervision department was hesitant to move ahead with its sub-
component of the project pointing out that under the previous project numerous outputs
had been achieved, such as the establishment of the Risk Center, the development of a
bank rating system, the preparation of examination manuals; and that the supervision
department needed time to internalize the new instruments.

46.     Change in BCB leadership led to some shifting of project priorities. Following the
change in its senior leadership with the appointment of a new Governor in January 2003,
there was less emphasis on further strengthening of banking supervision and more on the
need to train entry level staff, particularly recent new hires that were replacing a higher
than normal attrition rate of experienced examiners. Another significant change involved
the promotion of the head of the project team to the position of secretary to the Governor,
and the consequent loss of project leadership. The project unit was then transformed to a
new project management unit with considerable expanded responsibilities for BCB
special projects.



                                                   15

 


47.     BCB moved quickly on the priority areas of the project. Once project funds were
approved and the CBMTAL project had closed, BCB made strong progress on the
payments system components of the project and the banking supervision department
proceeded with a training program for new examiners.

48.     As a high capacity agency, BCB preferred institutional strengthening through on-
the-ground organizational improvements. BCB tended to focus more on central bank
modernization ­ including equipment for its payment systems than on policy support,
although the project's studies agenda showed some progress. Based on the actual output,
the BCB component emphasized the purchase of equipment for the operation of the
payment system and for other IT needs, training for banking supervision staff, expanded
coverage of the Risk Center, and a very focused study to identify those areas where the
central bank needed to incorporate new accounting norms consistent with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). BCB took advantage of the latest technology and
best practices available through the Bank's expertise in the design and delivery of
technical assistance support.

49.     An unexpected and important windfall in BCB revenues reduced the need for
Bank funding. As explained in the earlier section on design, BCB's decision not to extend
the closing date was driven by economics. Neither BCB nor the Bank could have
anticipated a Court decision on a complex case involving the Central Bank's access to
revenues originating from the financial transactions tax. In light of its unexpected
windfall, BCB re-assessed its budgetary needs and decided that the costs, both
opportunity and financial costs, of the Bank loan were higher than their own reduced
internal cost of funds. Just prior to this decision, a Bank supervision mission had rated the
BCB component as satisfactory, and there was still an active project pipeline.

50.     Changes in CVM leadership and in the project management unit may have
contributed to a slower pace of implementation progress. CVM underwent a series of
changes in its leadership from the start to project closing which posed a challenge to
project implementation, although the potentially disruptive effects were attenuated thanks
to the support shown by each new leadership team towards the project (see table below).
Nevertheless, the changes in leadership and its consequent impact on the organization
may have contributed to a slower pace in project implementation. The project
management team within CVM also underwent changes particularly during the
preparation and initial phase of implementation, these also included changes in the
procurement sub-team which created duplication of efforts due to the need to train new
members on Bank procurement policies.

51.     Delays caused by lack of coordination with UNDP further held up
implementation. The UNDP has played a critical role in most TA loans by the Bank in
Brazil in terms of coordinating procurement and financial management practices of
project implementing agencies. The UNDP office was located in Brasilia which served
BCB well and their earlier experience with the CBMTAL had helped establish a closer
working relationship between the two organizations. However, since the project
management unit of CVM was located in Rio de Janeiro, coordination with UNDP on the
procurement and disbursement process was complicated, which was further compounded
by the fact that this was CVM's first participation in a Bank project, meaning it also
needed to assimilate the Bank's project management culture. The procedural differences
in procurement between the Bank and UNDP did not facilitate the implementing
agency's work. CVM pointed to delays in disbursements due to UNDP agents for this
project where some staff lacking experience had inadvertently contributed to startup
deferrals. A Bank procurement review in November 2006 assessed that the relationship
with UNDP provoked procurement delays and rated performance as marginally
unsatisfactory. This rating was upgraded after the delays were resolved.

52.     The project provided an opportunity to overcome CVM's resources constraints.
Due to its budget constraints, CVM had pent up demand for institutional development in
a number of areas. During project preparation, CVM staff presented a number of
initiatives that had been identified as operational priorities. The rapid changes in the
regulatory environment, particularly the new responsibilities assumed by CVM, as well
as reforms in financial sector legislation had stretched the agency's capacity to undertake
key institutional development projects. At the same time, the long-standing lack of
resources to hire more technical staff had meant that CVM professionals were fully
occupied with day-to-day regulatory and enforcement matters and with little time to keep
up with new initiatives, to upgrade their policies and procedures, and to learn from the
practices of securities regulators in other countries. The consultants hired through this
project helped launch the organizational initiatives that had been held up in CVM's
internal pipeline.


2.3     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

53.     No significant deviations were found with respect to the Bank's financial
management, procurement, and disbursement policies. The Controller's Office of Brazil


                                                17

 


conducted annual audits of project expenses and found no material issues. The quarterly
reviews of applications for report-based disbursements found that the periodic reports
prepared by the project implementation units were satisfactory. However, a procurement
post-review supervision mission in November 2006 found procurement marginally
unsatisfactory due in large part to excessive unacceptable delays in procurement
processing.

54.     An issue of contract management arose in the case of the CVM sub-project to
develop an enhanced surveillance system for monitoring market activities. The firm
chosen for the project was acquired by another company after they had started work on
the project, and the new firm requested a renegotiation of the scope of work. CVM had
already made an initial disbursement of funds to the contractor. Fortunately, after both
parties reached an amicable settlement the funds were returned except for minor costs
that had already been incurred by the consultant. In view of the approaching closing date
the decision was made not to proceed with a new RFP. Nevertheless, CVM is currently in
the process of contracting with another firm using its own funds to complete the market
surveillance project.


2.4     Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase (if any):

55.     No operation has been defined as a next phase. However, given the strong
relationship developed during the course of the project, CVM and the Bank agreed on
future collaboration on research of specific regulatory topics of interest to both parties.


3.      Assessment of Outcomes


3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.     Brazil's past experience with financial crises and the consequent deterioration in
economic performance, had served as a key lesson on the importance of financial sector
reforms to the stability and sustainability of economic growth. After taking office in
January 2003, one of the first signals that a new Government gave to the markets was its
continued commitment to financial sector reforms. That posture has not wavered. In fact
the new Corporations Law in 2007 adopted international accounting standards as the
norm in Brazil. In view of the current turmoil in global financial markets, the
Government's successful implementation of financial sector reforms will prove to be the
major factor in dampening the impact from these external shocks on the rest of the
economy.

57.     Without the institutional strengthening of BCB and CVM, which are the principal
regulators of the financial system, many of the financial sector reforms would have
become ineffective. The design of the FSTAL was thus logically consistent with the goal
of enhancing efficiency in financial intermediation, financial system transparency, and


                                              18

 


effectiveness of regulation and supervision. A strong payments system is critical to the
stability of the financial system in times of liquidity problems like nowadays. Well
trained bank examiners are essential to providing effective oversight of the banking
system. Providing in-depth studies on securities industry practices in other countries is an
essential input in the design of new regulations that are relevant to the Brazilian reality.
Updating of the institutional memory of regulatory agencies in terms of their procedures,
manuals, and supervisory practices ensures that best practices are established as the norm.
For these reasons, the relevance of this project is deemed to be High.


3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

58.     The central objective of the FSTAL was to support the development of
institutional capacity to assist the implementation of Brazil's program of financial sector
reforms. The specific objectives were to formulate reform strategies; prepare regulatory
reforms; and strengthen institutional capacity of the principal regulatory agencies.

Contribution of the BCB component towards project objectives

59.     From a front-line perspective, BCB's role in supporting the efficiency of financial
intermediation, maintaining the effectiveness of regulations, and bolstering defenses
against financial sector crisis is heavily reliant on the integrity of the payments system
and on the quality of banking supervision. The other institutional strengthening
components such as the improved Risk Center and the IT plan have also contributed to
BCB's technical capacity. The policy studies were a valuable component; although
several policy studies had already been completed under the previous CBMTAL such as
the one on bankruptcy and on interest rates. The preparation of regulatory reforms for
bank failure resolution was not pursued in view of insufficient political support for
additional financial sector legislation as became evident during the preparation of the
PFSECAL II. While greater attention was paid to the key institutional areas, the partial
cancellation of this component was a limiting factor to the achievement of program
objectives.

60.     Key BCB outputs in terms of development impact were:

    · Upgrading of the payments system: The acquisition of hardware and software to
        expand the new system's capacity was necessary in order to ensure the integrity
        of the payments system by enabling the Central Bank to monitor large system
        payments on a real time basis including the non-banking clearing houses and to
        prevent systemic risks arising from overdrafts and other liquidity problems.

    · Training of banking supervision staff: At the time of loan preparation the
        BCB's banking supervision department had experienced an exodus of
        experienced bank examiners through retirement as well as other professional
        opportunities in the financial industry. As a new crop of examiners was hired, it
        was imperative to bring them up to speed quickly with the use of the new



                                               19

 


        examination manuals that had been prepared as part of the CBMTAL. This was an
        important institutional development initiative that had a material impact on the
        effectiveness of banking supervision.

Contribution of the CVM component towards project objectives

61.     The strengthening of institutional capacity of the resource-constrained CVM was
evident in the quality of outputs even with the limited use of the available funds under
this component. There were additional sub-components that had been programmed
including some for which an RFP had already been prepared; however, it was decided
that they would not be ready or near completion by the expiration of the second extension
of the project closing date. This in turn diminished the effectiveness of the CVM
component.

62.     Key CVM outputs in terms of development impact were:

    · Study and recommendations for strengthening enforcement: One of the
        principal outcomes of this study was the decision to establish a separate
        enforcement division within CVM. Other recommendations of the study included
        the preparation of a manual for investigations, reinforcement of CVM's
        supervision of SROs such as the BMF Bovespa exchange, Brazil's principal
        securities exchange. As the newly created enforcement division adopts these and
        other recommendations made by the consultant's report it will enhance the
        effectiveness of securities markets regulations and supervision.

    · Diagnostic of IT needs: Due to the rapid growth in the securities industry, the
        new responsibilities assumed by CVM, the introduction of new instruments, and
        the increase in information processing, CVM's IT system could not keep up with
        the demand by its users. The IT diagnostic study addressed the system's capacity,
        its technological relevance and adequacy of existing hardware. Some of the other
        sub-components of the project that involved the acquisition of software and
        hardware were postponed until completion of this study in order to benefit from
        its diagnosis and recommendations. As a result of the study recommendations
        were made that led to the decision to outsource the IT infrastructure to a large
        government-owned IT company but to maintain an in-house capability of systems
        analysts in order to respond more effectively to IT requests from other
        departments. A larger state-of-the-art IT system will strengthen the effectiveness
        of financial system regulation and supervision.

    · Comparative study on international accounting norms: With the new
        Corporations Law in 2007 Brazil adopted the IFRS standards. This was an
        important reform that called for CVM to develop new rules on reporting of
        financial information. The comparative study of international accounting norms
        will be a key instrument since it provides recommendations based on international
        practices for the development of the new norms. Through its impact on the goal of
        helping to prepare regulatory reforms this initiative will enhance financial system



                                             20

 


        transparency and also raise the efficiency of intermediation by increasing the
        accuracy of financial information.

    · Update of inspection manuals: While CVM already had inspection manuals,
        these had not been updated. There was a body of institutional knowledge that
        experienced inspectors had not been able to incorporate into the prevailing
        documents. By carefully updating and then posting the manuals online with links
        to numerous references such as legislation, CVM policies, and regulations, as well
        as standard forms used to execute inspections, it has materially improved the
        quality of inspections, particularly for less experienced staff. This initiative will
        significantly improve the effectiveness of regulations in the securities industry.

    · Comparative study of international regulatory norms in the investment
        funds industry: The objective of this study was to identify regulations in foreign
        countries that could serve as a reference to Brazilian accounting standards
        particularly in light of the adoption of IFRS. The study addressed a number of
        issues such as administrative fees, custody, legal framework, and accounting
        standards. Given the surge of investment funds in Brazil, this study was critical to
        the development of new regulations that would enhance financial system
        transparency through better disclosure of investment funds information,
        strengthen the effectiveness of regulations and also raise the efficiency in
        financial intermediation by providing investors with more accurate and timely
        information on investment funds.

Consistency of Outcomes with Market Indicators

63.     The FSTAL was designed to support institutional capacity for implementing
financial sector reforms. The linkages from outputs to outcomes occur first through the
institutional strengthening of BCB and CVM, then through the preparation of regulatory
reforms, and eventually through the combined effect of these outcomes at the agency
level with the overall impact of the financial sector reforms supported by the Bank's
programmatic loans (PFSECAL I & II) on the overall financial system development
objectives.

While it may not be possible to quantify the specific contribution of the FSTAL to
financial system outcomes, it is reasonable to establish the consistency of actions taken
under the project with overall developments in the financial system. Some of the salient
features include:

    · Consolidation of the payments system has increased the efficiency of interbank
        transfers and the settlement operations of other systems as well as securities
        markets exchanges. For example, the volume of interbank funds transfer
        settlement system doubled between 2002 and 2005.




                                              21

 


    · The securities market capitalization to GDP has gone from 29.7 percent in 2002 to
        97.1 percent in 2007. Consistently, trading value has grown from R$ 205 billion
        in 2003 to R$ 1,154 billion in 2007.

    · The issuance of private sector debt in the securities market has risen from 5.1
        percent of GDP in 2002 to 13.0 percent in 2007.

    · The BOVESPA securities exchange has become the leader in Latin America in
        the total number of listed companies with 404 issuers as of December 2007. This
        also makes Brazil the most heavily weighted emerging market contained in the
        MSCI equity index, in which both China and India are also represented.

64.     Based on the effectiveness of project outputs and the positive contribution to
outcomes, but cognizant of lost opportunities from partial cancellation of project funding
in terms of additional outcomes that could have resulted in a higher degree of
achievement of the project's objectives, the efficacy of this project is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.


3.3     Project Efficiency

65.     Perhaps the principal factors affecting project efficiency were the long delays in
disbursements and the partial cancellation of the project. Both agencies were satisfied
with the work performed by consultants and with the quality of the equipment purchased.
However, the long period between the approval of the project and the completion of its
components lowered the overall efficiency in terms of the opportunity costs from delays
in implementation and the lost opportunities from having had more time to complete
other sub-components that were eventually cancelled. As explained in the previous
section, implementation delays were mainly caused by the nature of Government budget
allocations as well as by lack of coordination between CVM and UNDP. In the case of
BCB some of the policy studies were not viewed as important as focusing on the
upgrading of their information and data systems and their regulatory and operational
infrastructure. Thus design of the BCB component may have adversely affected
efficiency by including policy studies which could have been more efficiently financed
through the agencies' internal resources. Based on the experience of the project,
efficiency is considered to have been Moderately Unsatisfactory.


Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

66.     The FSTAL has had significant positive outcomes in terms of the strengthening of
both regulatory agencies and is expected to facilitate the development of new securities
markets regulations as Brazil continues to achieve greater compatibility with international
norms. Relevance of project objectives was thus rated High and project outcomes as
Moderately Satisfactory due to the partial cancellation of the project. The long delays in
implementation and consequent loss opportunities in terms of outputs resulted in a



                                             22

 


Moderately Unsatisfactory efficiency rating. The overall outcome rating is thus
considered as Moderately Satisfactory.


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.     Given the nature of the project on financial system strengthening, it has only
indirect impact on these issues.

Institutional Change/Strengthening:

68.     The FSTAL's contribution to institutional development has been discussed in the
previous sections on implementation and outcome. About 80 percent of the output from
the project was directly related to institutional strengthening. The relevance rating
reflected the importance of institutional development for an efficient and well regulated
financial system.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

69.     The risk to the project's development outcome is deemed as Moderate. The
FSTAL sustainability factors are favorable in a number of key areas. Government
commitment to financial sector reforms is firmly embedded in macroeconomic policies.
The recent turbulence in global financial markets has heightened the importance of
effective regulation and supervision of the financial system as a deterrent against local
contagion from external shocks, and Brazilian regulators have proved very professional
and effective in handling its local impact.

70.     As the two principal regulators of the financial system, BCB and CVM benefitted
from the institutional strengthening achieved through their participation in this project.
BCB had the advantage of a previous TA loan, the CBMTAL, which had already
contributed to institutional improvement in a number of areas. At the same time, BCB has
had experience in dealing with financial crises, the most recent being the banking system




                                              23

 


problems in the mid-1990s; and has then adequately equipped to deal with the sources of
systemic risk in the financial system.

71.     CVM is a relatively newer agency with tighter resources, in part due to the
historically dominant role of the banking industry in the development of the financial
system. The impressive growth of the securities markets heightens the risk to
development outcomes if CVM does not continue to reinforce its institutional capacity.
The partial cancellation of the CVM component leaves a gap in terms of initiatives for
which the agency may still lack the funds and the personnel to complete them without
additional support. Some of these activities will be probably done under an existing
Growth TA Loan, and the recent agreement between the Bank and the CVM will help in
further strengthening the regulatory framework.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending
phase):

72.     The FSTAL was designed to support institutional capacity to assist in the
implementation of broad financial sector reforms. Thus, the Bank's policy and
institutional analysis related to the preparation of the programmatic financial sector loans
(PFSECAL I & II) served well in the assessment of this project. The Project Appraisal
Document provided an in-depth analysis of institutional needs and appropriate
instruments to achieve the goals of the project. However, as mentioned in the section on
design, the decision to proceed with this project with a BCB component before the
previous CBMTAL had been closed contributed to implementation delays, and to BCB's
hesitation to take on additional projects after just completing the CBMTAL. The CVM
component was based on a thorough analysis of its institutional needs that were
represented in a detailed matrix of project activities. While the preparation was
commendable, Bank staff may have been somewhat ambitious in terms of the scope of
the CVM component. The Bank's risk assessment identified the key challenges facing
project implementation, including the possibility that BCB and CVM would not receive
adequate budgetary allocations from the Government, yet this risk should have called for
a more streamlined design. For these reasons, Bank performance in ensuring quality
at entry is judged to be Moderately Satisfactory.


Quality of Supervision:

73.     Bank staff was diligent in monitoring the implementation of the FSTAL. The
status reports showed a focus on the project's development objectives, presented a good
summary of key implementation issues, and included outcome measures not present at
the preparation stage. Frequent missions by the project team, including procurement and



                                               24

 


financial management specialists helped address implementation issues. Special attention
was noted in terms of supervision of the procurement process with periodic assessments
by the Bank's procurement department. Perhaps greater focus on detailed flow-of-
project-funds would have been helpful. Quarterly financial reports showing programmed
expenditures by detailed sub-components and the actual amounts posted on a data file
showing the evolution of the project would help in monitoring the pace. Bank
performance during supervision is deemed as Satisfactory.

Rating of Overall Bank Performance:

74.    In determining the overall Bank performance rating, greater consideration is given
to quality at entry in view of the design and risk issues that eventually led to the partial
cancellation of parts of the BCB and the CVM components. Even though effective
supervision helped to produce productive outputs in key areas of institutional
development in both agencies, the overall evaluation results in a Moderately
Satisfactory rating.


5.2    Borrower Performance

75.    The evaluation of Borrower performance is based on the role played by the two
implementing agencies BCB and CVM, and by the Government overall. Commitment to
project objectives was satisfactory. As reported in the ISRs, the twin objectives of
supporting reform and simultaneously building institutional capacity at both agencies
were being actively supported. The high technical skills of the staff at both agencies
contributed to the good quality of outputs. BCB benefitted from the successful
implementation of the previous CBMTAL and the continuity of the staff that had
participated in the previous project.

76.    Implementation was met with some challenges. Leadership changes in both
agencies affected the effectiveness of implementation, although the staff appointed to key
project tasks proved to be a positive factor in the quality of the outputs. High Government
ownership was not able to overcome delays due to the process of budget approval. Since
these agencies do not have budgetary autonomy, this was a detrimental factor to the
project's outcome. The partial cancellation of the project by BCB heightened risks to the
development objectives. CVM's procurement problems arising from lack of coordination
with UNDP staff further delayed implementation.

77.    The strong project commitment and high quality of staff in the two agencies was
an important factor in performance; however, due to some implementation shortfalls the
overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.



6.     Lessons Learned



                                              25

 


78.    The principal lessons learned are:

    · Technical assistance loans are a good complement to Programmatic lending.
       The Brazilian government's strong commitment to financial sector reform and the
       Bank's extensive work in preparing the programmatic loans facilitated the design
       of the FSTAL and its focus on supporting institutional development needs of the
       principal financial sector regulatory agencies.

    · High capacity countries like Brazil need TA loans to support institutional
       strengthening, but the projects have to be focused on the needs of the
       beneficiary. In the case of BCB, their interest was mostly in hardware and
       software to upgrade essential components of the payments system and in training
       programs for banking examiners. CVM's needs were concentrated in the
       operational areas of enforcement, inspections, surveillance, and financial and
       accounting norms.

    · A TA loan, in general, should not be approved until an existing project to the
       same beneficiary has been closed. At the time the FSTAL was approved, the
       previous CBMTAL was still under implementation and did not close until about
       two years later. In the case of the FSTAL consideration should have been given to
       a stand-alone CVM project.

    · Budgeting and procurement capacity of the Borrower are important factors
       in appraising a project. In view of the extensive delays in budget approval by
       the Brazilian government and the subsequent procurement coordination issues
       involving UNDP and CVM, perhaps limiting the scope of the project to a few
       large sub-components would have been a more efficient approach.

    · TA projects should have a short duration with active Bank participation. The
       project timeline should define the scope of activities. Simpler, shorter and
       possibly more frequent projects may result in better outcomes over time. TA loans
       should be stressed as an important part of the Bank's economic development
       mission.



7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/
       Partners

(a)    Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

79.    The Borrower highlighted the fact that this loan represented a key point in the
history of CVM. They depicted certain projects financed through this loan that they
consider of great relevance, including the Enforcement Study, the formulation of
Supervision Manuals, the Infrastructure Diagnostic, and the study on Accounting
Convergence to IFRS.


                                             26

 



80.     They also acknowledged that at the outset of the project they were not fully
prepared to manage it complexity, and added that this experience has helped them create
an internal unit that manages all of its projects. They underlined the collaborative
relationship with the Bank, which helped address CVM's needs. Annex 7 has a complete
detail of the comments received, both the original in Portuguese, and its English
translation.

Economic Costs and Benefits of the Project

As established in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), cost effectiveness analysis was not
applicable in this project. The TA character of institutional strengthening of a government
agency of the operation implied that quantitative economic and financial analysis was not
possible or appropriate. However, the project was expected to generate benefits at two levels:
support of overall financial sector reforms in Brazil; and enhanced capacity, credibility and
effectiveness of key policy making, regulatory and supervisory bodies in the financial sector, the
Central Bank and CVM. The project was quite successful in improving the regulatory support
environment and the capacity of the agencies involved, particularly CVM. For a detailed analysis
of project outcomes see the main text of this report.

Original Comments in Portuguese:

O acordo de empréstimo com o Banco Mundial, sem dúvida, representa um marco na história da
autarquia. Por meio dele, foram realizados projetos de grande relevância. Apenas para fazer
referência a alguns exemplos relevantes, por meio do Estudo de Enforcement, criou-se a
Superintendência de Processos Sancionadores e busca-se aprimorar a tramitação dos inquéritos;
por meio dos Manuais de Fiscalização, conseguiu-se a padronização dos procedimentos relativos
a esta área; com o Diagnóstico de Infra-estrutura, vislumbrou-se o cenário tecnológico para os
próximos anos e foi fundamento para o início de outros projetos da autarquia; os estudos
contábeis criaram-se condições para o amadurecimento da Convergência Contábil e para a
adoção de novos instrumentos de regulação no mercado brasileiro em consonência com o
mercado mundial.

Ao longo da execução do projeto ocorreram algumas mudanças de escopo, mas não houve
mudança nos objetivos a serem alcançados. O gerenciamento de projetos na CVM, antes
inexistente, experimentou grande amadurecimento durante a vigência do programa e, por isso,
criaram-se condições para que outras iniciativas similares sejam adotadas. O programa tornou a
CVM melhor tanto no que se refere ao público externo, o mercado, quanto no interno, relativo à
sua eficiência.

Não há dúvidas de que, para tanto, concorreram os esforços da própria equipe da CVM.
Contudo, é fato que merece especial destaque o bom relacionamento que sempre tivemos com o
Banco Mundial, sensível às necessidades da CVM, e sem os quais os benefícios, de certo, não
teriam sido sentidos.

Roberto Dias, Superintendente da CVM


English Translation:

The Loan Agreement with the World Bank certainly represents a high point in the history of this
autarchy (organization). Many projects of great relevance were accomplished through this loan.

Just to mention some important examples, with the Enforcement Study was created the
Superintendence of Sanctioned Processes and improvements were being made to the
investigations' processes; with the Supervision Manuals, we were able to standardize procedures
regarding this area; with the Infrastructure Diagnostic, we were able to project the technological
scenario for future years and it served as a base for other autarchy projects; with the accounting
studies conditions were created for the adoption of an Accounting Convergence (IFRS) and for
the adoption of new regulatory instruments in the Brazilian market consistent with the global
market.

Throughout the execution of this project changes were made to its scope, but not to its
objectives, which remained the same. The management of projects at CVM, inexistent until then,
experienced great growth throughout the life of program, and for that reason, conditions were
created so that similar initiatives can be also launched. This program has promoted
improvements at CVM not only to the external public, the market, but also to the internal one,
related to its efficiency.

The efforts of the CVM Team played a key role in achieving these results. Nonetheless, it is
important to emphasize the good relationship we have with the Bank, always sensible to CVM's
needs, and without which it would not have been possible to achieve these benefits.
