Enterprise Sector\n            Adjustment Program (PESAP) Project in Mauritania are as\n            follows: overall outcome of the project satisfactory,\n            performance of the Bank was rated as satisfactory, and the\n            performance of the Borrower was rated as good. Four main\n            lessons can be drawn from the PESAP implementation\n            experience. First, economic liberalization does not\n            necessarily translate into competitive markets and private\n            sector development, but may lead to private monopolies, if\n            the liberalization process is not accompanied by appropriate\n            measures to ensure fair competition between the\n            entrepreneurs involved - both public and private. Second,\n            experience of the PESAP also stresses the need for a\n            prefeasibilty study which should help assess and design the\n            most appropriate conditions to implement a divestiture\n            program. If such a study had been carried out during the\n            preparation of the PESAP, it would have clearly identified\n            the peculiarities of certain mixed-economy companies and the\n            constraints to be addressed in order to facilitate their\n            divestiture within a more realistic timeframe. Third, in\n            rehabilitating public enterprises, financial restructuring\n            is not an end by itself. If in the meantime the enterprise\n            management does not implement forceful reforms to improve\n            the management system and the enterprise productivity and to\n            significantly reduce its operating costs, the financial\n            restructuring would have little impact in the long run. Last\n            but not least, within the framework of public enterprise\n            (PE) sector adjustment operations, important resources are\n            sometimes allocated directly to enterprises to carry out\n            their financial restructuring. In this context the Bank\n            should be more demanding on the quality of management and\n            design explicit criteria to monitor enterprise performance\n            improvements. The signing of a \"contract-plan\" is\n            not a sufficient criteria to ensure that an enterprise will\n            effectively implement the reforms required to restore its\n            profitability. It should be reinforced by specific\n            performance objectives whose satisfactory achievement should\n            also be reflected in the legal covenants or conditional\n            ties, as appropriate."}, "docdt": "1995-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
