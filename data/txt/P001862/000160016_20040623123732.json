The purpose of reassessing the PESAP is to test the\n            durability of its results, that is, whether the findings of\n            an evaluation change if the operation is evaluated after a\n            longer interval, in this case in 2003 rather than in 1996.\n            The reassessment focuses on the initial evaluation findings,\n            facts that have emerged since the evaluation, and the\n            current assessment in 2003. The exercise is important for\n            the reliability and credibility of OED's evaluations\n            and could help determine which OED should undertake\n            assessment of certain operations, especially adjustment\n            programs. The outcome of the PESAP is rated satisfactory as\n            in the 1996 PPAFL Although the institutional development\n            impact of Bank assistance as a whole in the Public\n            Enterprise sector has been substantial, the impact of the\n            PESAP on institutional development has been modest, compared\n            to moderate in the 1996 PPAR.  The sustainability is rated\n            likely, compared to uncertain in the PPAR. Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory, as in the PPAR. The\n            following lessons of general applicability emerge from this\n            re-assessment: 1) The reform of the parapublic sector is a\n            very long process measured in decades rather than in years.\n            Its outcome in economic terms and impact on private sector\n            development take many years to materialize. Issues are\n            numerous and complex: legal, social, financial, etc. Bank\n            country assistance strategies and projects should plan\n            public enterprise reforms over a long period of time. 2)\n            Proper sequencing in PE reforms is critical. The first step\n            should be streamlining and strengthening the legal and\n            institutional framework. 3) To move from a phase of\n            rehabilitation/restructuring to a phase of privatization or\n            public-private partnership is a big step and may represent\n            for some governments a difficult and delicate decision.\n            Continuous Bank support is essential. 4) A broad PE reform\n            managed and monitored at the central level should be\n            complemented by sector reform supported by technical\n            assistance projects, especially in the case of public\n            utilities. 5) In PE reforms, performance agreements may be\n            valuable tools in the rehabilitation and restructuring\n            phase, but their purpose is limited and their success highly\n            dependent on the commitment and independence of each side.\n            6) The setting up of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system is essential to monitor PEs' operational and\n            financial performance in a consistent manner and over a\n            length of time. It also requires a staff capable of\n            analyzing data. Bank projects should pay particular\n            attention to this at preparation/appraisal."}, "docdt": "2004-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
