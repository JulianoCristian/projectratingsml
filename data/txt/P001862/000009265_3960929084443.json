facilitating increased\n            private sector participation; (b) a program of divestiture\n            aimed at reducing the number of enterprises in the sector;\n            and (c) financial restructuring programs for key enterprises\n            remaining in the sector, particularly Societe Nationale\n            Industrielle et Miniere (SNIM), the iron ore mining company,\n
