POWER III PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01     Overview:  Tunisia's presently known indigenous energy resources con-
sist of oil, non-associated and associated gas, and a relatively small hydro-
power potential. Recently, some coal deposits were discovered but their
extent has not yet been determined. Geothermal springs are also known to
exist, and the potential for their exploitation is currently being assessed in
a study financed by USAID (para. 1.07). In addition, Tunisia has a good solar
regime with insolation varying between 2,800 and 3,600 hours per year.  Pilot
projects for demonstrating the possible uses of solar energy are currently
underway financed from bilateral aid agencies (para. 1.05).
1.02     Oil and Gas:  The remaining proven recoverable oil reserves are
presently estimated to be about 58 million tons. These reserves are expected
to sustain the future annual production of oil at its present level of about
5.8 million tons until 1985 (para. 1.09). The remaining proven recoverable
reserves of associated and non-associated gas are estimated to be about 36
billion cubic meters (38 million toe). About 83% of these reserves are
located offshore at the Gulf of Gabes in the form of natural gas; principally
at the undeveloped Miskar field. Associated gas is produced from three fields
of which the most significant is the El-Borma oil field near the Algerian
border. In 1980, domestic gas production was about 0.39 million toe of which
El-Borma contributed more than half. However, the contribution of El-Borma
gas to the total supply of energy is declining and is expected to cease by the
late 1980s. Tunisia will also have a gas supply of 0.2 million toe in 1982
increasing to 0.8 million toe per year by 1987, as a transit fee for natural
gas transported from Algeria to Italy, via Tunisia, through the trans-
continental pipeline.
1.03     Hydropower;  Tunisia's Hydropower potential is relatively small
amounting to only 65 MW of which 29 MW (El Aroussia, Kasseb, Fernana and
Nebeur) has already been developed and the rest would be exploited when the
multipurpose dam at Sidi Salem is completed (see map). Presently no informa-
tion is available on whether there are sites suitable for mini-hydro
schemes. This shortcoming would be addressed in the energy assessment study
financed by the USAID (para. 1.07).
1.04     Coal and Geothermal:  Small deposits of lignite (brown coal) are
known to exist at Cap Bon, in the north eastern part of Tunisia.  New deposits
(1.5 m thick) have also been recently discovered at Sabria about 140 km South-
west of the city of Gabes. Hot water springs exist at several locations in
Tunisia of which the most important is at El Hamma about 20 km West of the
city of Gabes. This spring gives about 2,000 liters of water per minute with
a low surface temperature (about 850C). The extent of the newly discovered
coal deposits and potential for the exploitation of the geothermal springs
would be determined in conjunction with the energy assessment study financed
by the USAID (para. 1.07).



-2-
1.05     Renewable Energy Resources:  USAID and the US Department of Energy in
collaboration with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) have initiated a demonstration project for the exploitation of solar
energy in providing power for lighting in a small village of about 500
inhabitants (Haman Biada). NASA has issued tender documents for the supply of
equipment and materials. The European Economic Community (EEC) is also
expected to finance renewable energy related demonstration projects for solar
pumping, windmills, and reforestation for fuel wood. In anticipation of
greater use of the solar energy potential in the future, STEG has completed a
study of the market for solar water heaters which concluded that by 1986,
about 200,000 units could be installed provided a public information and                    4
education campaign is undertaken. Gordian Associates (UK firm) under
financing from the Government is in the process of completing a study for the
development and pricing of renewable and non-renewable energy resources. This
study together with the studies financed by USAID would provide the Government
with the data and tools needed for formulating a comprehensive plan for the
development of all energy resources (para. 1.07).
1.06     Nuclear:  Although no uranium deposits are known to exist in Tunisia,
the Government with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
is working on a preliminary economic and technical study which would examine
the viability of a possible nuclear power plant.
1.07     Studies for the Development of Energy Resources:  Under Loan
1355-TUN, the Government agreed to finance an energy pricing study the com-
pletion of which has been delayed by about one year. In 1979, Gordian
Associates were selected to undertake this study which involved the
formulation of a comprehensive plan for the development and pricing of all
energy resources, including renewable energy. The approach adopted by Gordian
Associates for the study relies heavily on computer modeling. The Government
has been concerned about the preliminary recommendations of the study because
the data used was highly aggregated (consumption of energy by sector was not
available). In an effort to remedy this shortcoming, the Government has
requested USAID and the US Energy Department to undertake an energy assessment
study, and the construction and compilation of an extensive energy data base
which would be used in conjunction with the model developed by Gordian. The
energy assessment study has started and is expected to be completed by the end
of 1981. It is divided into a number of independent small studies each
focusing on one of the major energy consuming sectors of the economy. The
findings of the small studies would then be integrated and used to outline
several scenarios for developing and managing the energy sector; however, it
will be up to the Tunisian Government to formulate its own policies on the
basis of the information provided.
B. Sectoral Organization
1.08     Tunisia's energy sector is managed by the Ministry of National
Economy through a number of state-owned enterprises. ETAP (Entreprise



- 3 -
Tunisienne d'Activites Petrolieres), a Government-owned enterprise, is respon-
sible for coordinating oil imports and the exploration and oil production
activities of the multinational firms and three other small enterprises which
are each 50% Government-owned. STIR (Societe Tunisienne des Industries de
Raffinage), also a Government-owned enterprise, owns and operates the only oil
refinery. Distribution of petroleum products is divided between the
Government-owned SNDP (Societe Nationale de Distribution de Petrole) which
distributes about 40% of the refined products, and several private firms with
more limited markets. The Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz
(STEG), a Government-owned enterprise was created in 1962 to take over the
operation of six privately-owned electric utilities which were nationalized at
that time. STEG is also responsible for gathering, transporting and distri-
buting associated and non-associated gas, and manufacturing and distributing
town gas in the city of Tunis. Since 1963 STEG has been the sole utility in
Tunisia responsible for the public production, transmission and distribution
of electricity and gas. In addition, several industries generate their own
electricity. In 1979 private generation accounted for about 14% of the total
electricity produced in Tunisia.
C. Energy Demand and Supply
Energy Balance
1.09     Historical Trends:  Tunisia is almost totally dependent on oil and
gas for meeting its demand for commercial energy. In 1978 the per capita
consumption of energy was 543 kilograms of coal equivalent (kgce) compared to
285 kgce for Morocco, 463 kgce for Egypt, and 687 kgce for Algeria. In 1980,
oil comprised 82% of the commercial energy consumed, associated, non-
associated and town gas another 14%, and the remaining 4% was met by hydro
(0.5%) and imported coal and coke (3.5%). Between 1971 and 1980, production
of crude oil and gas increased from about 4.1 million toe to 6.1 million toe
representing an average annual rate of growth of about 4.5%, while hydropower
production remained unchanged at about 12 thousand toe. During the same
period, commercial energy consumption increased from 1.2 million toe to 2.8
million toe, representing an average annual rate of growth of about 9.9%. Up
to the present time Tunisia remains a net exporter of crude oil (3 million
tons in 1971 and 3.5 million tons in 1980) and the Government continues to
depend on the foreign exchange provided by these exports in order to sustain
the growth of the economy. In 1980 the petroleum products consumed had the
following mix: LPG 3.7%; gasoline 7.4%; jet fuel 4.8%; kerosene 5%; gas oil
36.1%; and fuel oil 43.0% 1/. However, because of the limited local refinery
1/ Tunisia's consumption of fuel oil is disproportionately high. The USAID
study (para. 1.07) would investigate the reasons for this relatively high
consumption and the efficiency by which this fuel is used.

throughput (1.1 million tons per year) and the continued growth in demand,
Tunisia's imports of oil products since 1974 have been increasing steadily,
reaching 1.2 million tons in 1980. Jet kerosene (0.11 million tons) is
totally imported, and more than 50% of the gas oil, and 30% of the fuel oil is
also imported 1/. The energy balance for Tunisia is summarized below:

1/ Tunisia sells its yearly output of crude oil at a premium price because of
its superior quality (low sulfur content) and imports lower quality crude
for its domestic needs. Exports of crude oil in 1980 provided about 25%
of Tunisia's foreign exchange needs.

1.10      Future Developments:  It is believed that the two major oil fields
which currently contribute about 92% of the total output, would continue to
produce substantial but declining quantities after the mid-1980's, while the
remaining small fields would cease production between the mid-1980's and
mid-1990's. However, a number of small new fields are expected to be brought
on stream within the next two years which will delay the decline of the
overall production to at least the mid-1980's. Although the associated gas of
the El-Borma field is expected to cease by the late 1980's, the replacement of
natural gas for associated gas would be possible if Tunisia's presently known
gas reserves are developed.
1.11      Natural gas is expected to play a major role in meeting Tunisia's
future energy requirements. In addition to the gas received as transit fee
and its probable increase as the demand in Europe for Algerian gas increases,
the Government has two options for meeting the future energy demand of the
country: (a) develop the Miskar gas reserves which is associated with heavy
capital investment; and (b) purchase gas from Algeria by tapping the trans-
continental pipeline.  Presently the Government is 'examining the two options
and a decision is not expected until the USAID eneAngy assessment study is
completed (para 1.07).
1.12      Apart from the total energy consumed in Tunisia, and the energy used
by the power subsector and large-scale industry, no historic information is
available regarding the energy consumption by subsector. The UbAID energy
assessment study would remedy this shortcoming (para. 1.07). The available
data for 1980 shows that the power subsector and large industries used all of
the hydro, gas and coal, 94% of the fuel oil and 28% of the gas oil; all
together representing 56% of the entire energy consumed in the country. In
particular, the power subsector used 26% of the total energy, large industries
30%, transport 34%, and the commercial and domestic subsectors 10%.
1.13      Between 1980 and 1985 the mix of petroleum products consumed is
expected to remain practically unchanged. During this period, associated and
natural gas is expected to meet both the incremental increase in demand and
any shortfall in the domestic supply of oil by supplying 20% of the total
commercial energy demand by 1985, compared to 14% in 1980. The Government is
planning to expand the capacity of the refinery to meet the domestic demand
for petroleum products and as a result their imports would be reduced to only
0.06 million tons in 1985. However, by the same year, the increased domestic
demand for petroleum products would reduce Tunisia's export of crude oil to
about 2.7 million tons.
Trends in the Consumption of Electricity Supplied by bTEG
1.14      Historical Trends:  Between 1970 and 1980, 6TEG's peak demand in-
creased at an annual rate of 13% (from 142 MW to 490 MW), generation of elec-
tricity at 14% (from 680 GWh to 2,524 GWh), electricity sales at 14% (from 576
GWh to 2,120 GWh), and number of consumers at 9% (from 284,000 to 689,000)
while transmission and distribution losses, which are still high, decreased
from 18% to 16%. In 1980, high-voltage consumers accounted for 21% of STEG's
total sales, medium-voltage consumers 46%, and low-voltage consumers the



-6-
remaining 33%, of which domestic consumers accounted for 27%. During the same
year, low-voltage consumers amounted to 685,000 of which 88% (603,000) were
domestic, 2% (14,000) irrigation pumping and the remaining 10% (68,000)
commercial, small industrial and others. Of the domestic consumers 87%
(525,000) lived in urban areas, 11% (66,000) in rural conglomerations and the
remaining 2% (12,000) in rural dispersed areas (Annexes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4).
1.15     Future Developments:  During the period 1980-1985 forecast of the
trends in the consumption of electricity supplied by STEG indicates that peak
demand would continue to increase at the historic rate of 13% (from 490 MW to
910 MW), while generation, sales of electricity, and number of consumers would
continue to increase, but at a slower rate. In particular, generation is
forecast to increase at 12% (from 2,524 GWh to 4,370 GWh), sales at 11% (from
2,120 GWh to 3,650 GWh), and number of consumers at 8% (from 689,000 to
993,000). After rehabilitation of the urban distribution systems and the
reinforcement of the transmission network (paras. 1.27 and 1.28), transmission
and distribution losses are expected to be reduced from 16% to 12%.
D. Energy Pricing
1.16     Petroleum Products:  Retail prices of petroleum products are set by
the Government. Lighter products (LPG and gasoline) are taxed while middle
distillates and fuel oil are subsidized. In September 1980, the weighted
average price of lighter products was 182% of their weighted average border
price (US$610/ ton compared to US$335/ton), middle distillates and fuel oil
was 56% (US$130/ ton compared to US$232/ton), and all petroleum products was
76% (US$185/ton compared to US$244/ton). A summary of domestic prices and
taxes (or subsidies) is presented in Table 1 below:

In 1980, the net economic subsidy extended to the consumers of petroleum
products amounted to US$127 million. The retail prices of middle distillates
and fuel oil in Tunisia are kept low in order to foster agriculture and
industry, and maintain the prices of products consumed by the low income
families at an affordable level. However, with the anticipated decline in the
exports of crude oil due to the increase in the domestic demand for petroleum
products, it would be difficult for Tunisia to maintain these subsidies at
their present level for long.
1.17     In spite of the absence of information on both the sectoral con-
sumption of energy (para 1.12) and a measure of the impact of increased prices
of petroleum products on the economy, the Government has taken the first step
towards rationalizing the pricing of petroleum products. In January 1981, the
price of gas oil was increased by 20% (from 83 TD to 100 TD per ton), fuel oil
by 46% (from 24 TD to 35 TD per ton), premium gasoline by 14% (from 220
milliemes to 250 milliemes per liter), and regular gasoline by 9% (from 215
milliemes to 235 milliemes per liter). As a result of these increases the
weighted average of domestic prices of petroleum products increased from
US$185 to US$221/ton representing 81% of their January 5, 1981 weighted
average border price. If the average annual growth in the consumption of
petroleum products continues at its historical rate of 10% and the mix of
products consumed remains unchanged, and if the international prices during
1981 are maintained at their January 5, 1981, level, the total economic sub-
sidies extended to the consumers of petroleum products would be about US$120
million in 1981 compared to US$127 million in 1980. The Government intends to
reexamine its overall oil pricing policy when the USAID study is completed
(para. 1.07).
1.18     Electricity Tariffs:  Electricity tariffs in Tunisia are set by STEG
and implemented after Government approval. The current tariff structure
classifies STEG's customers under three main categories: High Voltage; Medium
Voltage; and Low Voltage. For the high and medium voltage, the tariffs are
based on time of day pricing (peak/off peak). Sales at the low voltage are
classified according to the end use of electricity such as residential, small
commercial and industrial, agricultural, etc. All low voltage consumption is
charged at a uniform tariff, with the exception of water pumping and water
heating which have a time of day tariff, and public lighting which has a
declining block tariff (Annex 1.5).
1.19     The average tariff at each voltage level is below the economic cost
of supply.  Table 2 summarizes the difference between the average tariff at
each voltage level and the long run average incremental cost of supply (LRAIC).

/1 Fuel valued at its border price.
In 1980, the total economic subsidy extended to the consumers of electricity
in Tunisia amounted to about TD 21.5 million (US$53.7 million). Of this
subsidy, 23% accrued to the high voltage consumers, 22% to the medium voltage
consumers, and the remaining 55% was extended to the low voltage consumers.
This subsidy was passed on to STEG's consumers through the low prices paid by
STEG for its fuels, particularly the associated gas from El-Borma which the
corporation collects almost free of charge. However, the subsidy to the con-
sumers of electricity is expected to be gradually eliminated since; (i) the
Government's stated objective is to increase the domestic prices of petroleum
products so as to reach parity with international prices by 1987 (although no
specific timetable has been set); and (ii) the supply of associated gas from
El-Borma will practically cease to be available for power generation by 1987.
1.20     Future Pricing of Electricity:  The Government is reluctant to intro-
duce a fuel adjustment clause that would transmit automatically to consumers
of electricity any future increases in the prices paid by STEG for petroleum
products. Its objection stems from the automaticity of the proposed clause.
The argument is that such a clause would deprive the Government of the right
to determine which group of customers should bear what portion of the total
burden of each case of tariff increase. In addition, it was argued that such
a clause would set a precedent for indexation in other sectors of the economy,
something which the Government is unwilling to accept.  In the past the
Government has adjusted electricity tariffs to account for increases in the
domestic prices of petroleum products. These adjustments, however, have
usually lagged between four to seven months imposing a financial burden on
STEG. For the first time the Government has increased, as of February 1,
1981, electricity tariffs by an average of 8% to fully compensate STEG for the
increased fuel bill resulting from the fuel increases of January 1981. In
order to ensure that STEG's financial standing will not suffer in the future
from lags which may occur between adjustments of fuel prices and electricity
tariffs, the Government has agreed to revise electricity tariffs promptly, and
in any case not later than two months after the fuel price increases, to
enable STEG to recover the total increases in its fuel cost.

E. The Beneficiary: STEG
1.21     Historical Development:  Since its creation in 1962, STEG concen-
trated on integrating into a single national power system the six separate
systems it had taken over (para. 1.08). By 1970, the corporation was able to
start a systematic expansion of the integrated national system and within ten
years it was able to increase its installed generating capacity seven-fold,
the production of electricity eight-fold, and the number of its customers two
and one half-fold, while improving its management and financial position.
.
1.22     Management:  STEG is governed by a Board consisting of eight members
and headed by a President General Manager (PGM). All members of the Board are
appointed by the President of the Republic. The daily management of the
corporation is the responsibility of the PGM, assisted by a Deputy General
Manager (DGM), and 14 Departmental Managers who report to the DGM. STEG's
operations are managed through 14 Departments from the Head Office in Tunis
(Annex 1.6). For administrative and operational purposes, the country is
divided into 23 Districts (another 3 will be created during 1981; see Annex
1.7) with their managers reporting to the DGM. The Districts are responsible
for the operation and maintenance of the system in their jurisdiction,
customer relations, planning and studies, stores and transport, surveys and
preparation of detail engineering of new distribution projects, supervision of
contractors, and data collection and planning for future expansions of their
local systems (Annex 1.8). The Head Office staff of the 14 Departments, in
addition to providing technical support to the Districts, supervises and
coordinates the activities of all Districts. Although STEG's present organi-
zation is adequate for the fulfillment of its tasks, a further decentrali-
zation is currently underway. This involves the creation :f local agencies in
the framework of the Districts, in the larger demand centers; the
decentralization of the District of Tunis has already taken place and the rest
will follow.
1.23     Existing Facilities and Equipment:  STEG currently operates four
steam power plants (550 MW), four hydro plants (29 MW), seven combustion
turbine plants (320 MW) and some small diesel plants amounting to a total of
15 MW (Annex 1.1). Except for some of the diesel stations located in isolated
areas, the generating stations are interconnected (see map).
1.24     The main transmission system operates at 225-kV with a 150-kV ring
around Tunis, and 150-kV and 90-kV secondary branches.  The total length of
this system is about 2,210 km (see map).  The medium-voltage lines (10-kV,
15-kV and 30-kV) have a length of about 9,960 km, and low tension distribution
lines and cables (220-V and 100-V) about 12,000 km (see Annex 1.4).
Development Program
1.25     STEG's five-year (1982-1986) least cost development program (DP)
coincides with, and forms part of, the sixth National Economic and Social



- 10 -
Development Plan (NESDP). The DP involves expansion of generation, reinforce-
ment and extension of both transmission and distribution, the construction of
a load dispatching center, extension of the gas distribution system, construc-
tion of a testing and measurement laboratory, training of staff, and miscella-
neous works at an estimated total cost of US$1,057 million, of which US$739
million would be in foreign exchange. Financing of this program is not yet
complete (para. 3.10).
1.26     Expansion of the generating facilities involves:  (a) installation of
154 MW of combustion turbines to be commissioned by the end of 1983 at a cost
of US$60 million 1/; and (b) erection of a new 600-MW steam power plant
(Rades) at a cost of US$528 million 2/, to be commissioned in 1985-1986. In
the short-term, the combustion turbines would meet the demand up to 1985, when
the first unit of Rades is expected to be commissioned, and in the medium term,
would replace the old steam units of Goulette I and combustion turbines of
Ghannouch which would be retired. The new combustion turbines would be
installed at Korba (2x22 MW), Kasserine (3x22 MW), Robbana (1x22 MW), and
Tajerouine (3x22 MW) 3/. At Korba and Kasserine the units would be fired with
natural gas received as transit fee (para. 1.02), while the units at Robbana
and Tajerouine would be fired with gas oil. The steam plant would be erected
at Rades, 3 km Northeast of Tunis, and would consist of dual fired (fuel oil,
or bituminous coal) 4x150 MW units.   If the plant is fired with coal, 1.2
million tons per year would have to be imported.
1.27     Extension and reinforcement of the transmission system would be
implemented in three stages; (a) construction of a new 150-kV line (5 km) to
connect Kasserine to the grid, reinforcement of the 30-kV line around Tunis,
and erection of a 225/30-kV substation at Zaghouan. This stage is estimated
to cost US$20 million and would be ready by 1983; (b) construction of 2
double-circuit 225-kV lines (one from Rades to M'nihla, and the other from
Rades to Naassen). These lines would be ready by 1984 at a cost of US$20 mil-
lion and would complete the 225-kV loop around Tunis; and (c) reinforcement of
existing 90/30-kV transformer stations and the construction of new 225/30-kV
and 150/30-kV transformer stations by 1986. This stage is not yet well
defined but its cost is estimated at about US$65 million. Tender documents
for the first two stages would be ready by mid-1981.
1/       It includes substations associated with the plants, spares for at
least 3 years of operation, and training of 5 engineers and 15
technicians.
2/       Including the plant substation and coal-handling facilities on the
plant site. Of the US$528 million, US$60 million would be disbursed
in 1987.
3/       It is not yet decided whether 4x22 MW units would be installed at
Kasserine, or 3x22 MW at Kasserine and 1x22 MW at Tajerouine.



- 11 -
1.28     Extension and reinforcement of the distribution system, estimated
to cost US$250 million involves four activities and woald affect all Gover-
norates: (a) electrification of rural Tunisia; (b) rehabilitation of the
urban distribution systemts; (c) extension of the urban distribution systems;
and (d) extension of medium voltage system to supply new industries. The
first constitutes an indispensable part of the NESDP which aims at the reduc-
tion of migration of rural inhabitants to urban areas by: creating new jobs
and consolidating the existing by granting loans to small and middle size
producers and entrepreneurs involved in agriculture, fisheries and traditional
crafts; trJining in farming, traditional craftsmanship and other trades; and
improving living conditions by providing farming equipment, potable water,
health services, access roads, electricity, and social services. This acti-
vity is estimated to cost a total of Ub$94 million and involves the connection
of 65,000 new domestic consumers living in 1,650 villages, the connection of
4,600 new surface and deep well pumps for potable water and irrigation, and
the connection of 500 small industrial and commercial consumers. Since STEG
will continue to be the executing agency of the rural electrification program
of the NEsDP, and in view of the corporation's past performance and manpower,
this program can be realized satisfactorily. The Government, realizing the
financial burden imposed on STEG to electrify so many villages in the short
period of five years, has agreed to contribute about 60% of the total cost
associated with the electrification of rural Tunisia (para. 2.08). The second
activity estimated to cost US$60 million constitutes a necessary measure that
STEG has to take in order to improve its quality of service and its revenues
by reducing the present distribution losses by about 33% (paras. 2.02 and
2.04). The beneficiaries of this activity are estimated at 150,000 existing
consumers. The last two activities reflect the Government's decision to
extend electricity service to almost all inhabitants living in the main urban
centers (about 60 cities and large towns) and promote industrialization of the
country. Extension of the urban distribution system would provide access to
electricity to about 170,000 new consumers at an estimated total cost of U6$83
million. On the other hand, STEG's revenues would improve because the capital
investment required to capture the existing high demand for energy is
relatively small.
Manpower and Training
1.29     Manpower:  At the end of 1979 STEG's total number of regular staff
was 5,730 of which 1,700 were professional, 2,360 skilled technical and
administrative, and the remaining 1,670 unskilled. This staff is considered
adequate and capable to conduct STEG's current activities.  However, to meet
the staffing requirements of its development program, sTEG plans to recruit
the necessary personnel and to create three new District offices; two in the
Governorate of sfax (Jebiniana and Mahres); and one in the Governorate of
Gafsa (Metlaoui). STEG is very conscious of productivity gains which, on the
average, increased by 7% per year. In 1979, the ratio of energy sold per
employee was 320 MWh, which compares favorably with the ratios achieved in
other countries of the region (260 MWh for Egypt and 399 MWh for Algeria).



- 12 -
1.30     Training;  During its early years, STEG concentrated on filling the
gaps in supervisory and skilled manpower created when the expatriate personnel
of the privately-owned electric companies left Tunisia. Electricite de France
(EdF) assisted materially in this program by seconding personnel to STEG and
conducting training courses in France. At present the output of the National
Polytechnic (Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs) is adequate to cover STEG's needs
in engineers and those of the rest of the economy. The Bank has also assisted
STEG in its training needs.  Under Loans 815-TUN and 1431-TUN, financing was
provided for training staff in accounting, inventory control, billing and data
processing. In addition, various suppliers of electromechanical works
provided training to STEG's personnel.
1.31     In 1976, the corporation constructed a training center at Khledia
(20 km from Tunis) staffed with 70 instructors of which 30 are permanent
training staff. The center offers basic training courses to middle level
technical and administrative personnel lasting from 6 to 11 months. The basic
training received in the center is followed by training on-the-job which takes
place in STEG's plant or abroad 1/. In addition to the basic training, the
center offers seminars and upgrading courses lasting from 1 day to 3 weeks.
In 1980, 218 staff members had received basic training and 1,140 had attended
upgrading courses. STEG's 1982-1986 development program includes a training
component which consists of: (a) extension of the training center by con-
structing 3 new living quarters and the allied classrooms and other facili-
ties; (b) construction of a laboratory for tests and measurements; and (c)
erection of a full size medium tension network for training of personnel on
live lines (lines fed with voltage). The expansion of STEG's training facili-
ties is reasonable and the Government and the corporation have requested Bank
assistance in its financing. The proposed Project contains a training
component (para. 2.04). STEG has agreed to furnish to the Bank for its
approval the proposed training program.
F. The Past and Future Involvement of the
Bank in the Energy Sector
1.32     Since 1971, the Bank has been involved in the development of
Tunisia's energy resources, through lending in the energy sector. The first
loan of US$7.5 million (Loan 724-TUN) was made in 1971 to finance a gas pipe-
line. The second loan of US$12 million (Loan 815-TUN) was made in 1972 to
finance the supply and installation of 2x30 MW combustion turbines, expansion
of the transmission and distribution systems, consulting services, and
training. The third loan of US$14.5 million (Loan 1355-TUN) was made in 1977
to cover about 50% of the foreign exchange cost of 7 additional combustion
turbines. In 1978, a loan of US$42.0 million (Loan 1431-TUN) for an irriga-
tion project involved the multipurpose Sidi Salem dam which would tap a hydro-
power potential of 36 MW. In June 1980, the Bank approved another loan of
1/ In 1980, 124 staff members were trained abroad at a foreign exchange cost
of US$625,000.



- 13 -
US$37.0 million (Loan 1864-TUN) which would finance the foreign component of
the first phase of a gas distribution pipeline.
1.33     The Bank's continued involvement in the power subsector has been res-
ponsible for strengthening all aspects of STEG's operations and management.
Since 1972, the corporation has consolidated its control over the sector and
developed its technical capabilities and practices to reach levels that are
comparable to those of similar institutions in developed countries. In
addition, STEG has been able to achieve in the past a satisfactory financial
position. However, STEG's financial performance and much of the institution
building work fostered by the Bank is likely to be eroded, if the Government
continues its present policy of using STEG's healthy financial position to
relieve some of the burden on the national budget. The continuation of the
Bank's involvement in the energy sector by lending in both the oil and gas
subsector, and the electricity subsector, would strenghthen the existing
institution building efforts, improve technical standards and achieve overall
coordination of energy pricing. It would also induce the growth of the sub-
sectors along a least-cost path.
II. THE PROJECT
2.01     The setting:  In 1980 Tunisia's population was 6.25 million
(1,150,000 families) of which 52% lived in urban areas, 21% in rural con-
glomerations 1/ and the remaining 27% in dispersed rural areas 2/. STEG's low
voltage consumers increased by 63,000 in 1980 of which, about 85% were domes-
tic. Thus, by the end of the same year, the level of electrification was:
urban 87%; rural conglomerations 31%; rural dispersed 4%; and country as a
whole 54%. The aim of the Government's sixth NESDP is to double, by 1986, the
level of electrification of rural conglomerations (from 31% to 60%) and to
extend electricity service to almost all inhabitants living in large urban
centers.
2.02     Between 1976-1980, the number of new low-voltage consumers connected
in the urban areas averaged 48,000 per year. During the same period, their
average consumption increased by 12% per year (from 600 kWh/year to 940
kWh/year). These high rates of growth were beyond STEG's forecast for the
fifth plan (1977-1981), and consequently funds allocated in its budget for the
reinforcement of the distribution network were inadequate for providing the
required equipment and materials. This shortfall coupled with the higher
priority given to generation and transmission, has rendered the urban distri-
bution system inadequate to cope with the demand. On average, the voltage

drop in the urban areas is double the maximum permissible level (20% as com-
pared to 10%), and in certain lines it reaches as high as 40%. Rehabilitation
of the distribution system is expected to reduce distribution losses by about
33% (from 12% to 8%). In addition, power failures in most urban load centers
is the rule rather than the exception. This low quality of service and the
substantial energy losses incurred by STEG (which can be reduced in value by
about US$0.2 million in 1982, and US$1.9 million per year by 1986) have forced
the corporation to give top priority to a rehabilitation program of the urban
distribution systems, see Annex 4.5 11.
2.03     Project Description:  The Project consists of the supply, construc-
tion and erection of about 870 km of medium voltage three-phase lines, about
2,260 km of medium voltage single-phase lines, about 2,840 km of low voltage
single-phase lines, about 1,000 (single phase) and 290 (3-phase) distribution
transformers (total capacity about 62 MVA). It would also provide for con-
struction and erection equipment, testing and training equipment, tools,
consultants' services, and training of staff abroad. Details are found in
Annexes 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.
2.04     Project Scope, Beneficiaries and Location:  The Project consists of
the first three years (1982-1984) of STEG's five-year program (1982-1986) for
the development of the urban and rural distribution systems (para. 1.28). It
consists of three components: (a) rural electrification component; (b) urban
rehabilitation component; and (c) a component covering the foreign cost of
equipment, tools, training and consulting services. The rural electrification
component would affect 15 Governorates by extending electricity service to
about 30,400 new domestic customers, 2,100 pumping stations and 300 commercial
and small industrial consumers situated in about 990 villages 2/. It involves
the supply, construction and erection of about: 200 km of threephase medium
voltage lines; 2,260 km of single-phase medium voltage lines; 2,060 km of
single-phase low voltage lines; and 1,140 distribution transformers (3-phase
and single phase) with a total capacity of 32 MVA (Annex 2.1). The cost of
material and installation of public (street) lighting is borne by the budget
of the Governorates and is therefore excluded from the Project. The urban
rehabilitation component would encompass the entire country, and would improve
the quality of service to more than 150,000 existing customers by rehabilitat-
ing the distribution systems of about 60 cities and large towns. It involves
the supply, construction and erection of about: 670 km of three-phase medium
voltage lines; 780 km of single-phase low voltage lines; and 150 transformers
with an estimated total capacity of 30 MVA (Annex 2.2). The third component
would provide the necessary construction and erection equipment for the
realization of the second component, testing equipment, tools and training
(about 70 persons for a total of about 130 man-months) which would assist STEG

in improving its technical capabilities. In addition, it irncludes a study of
tile distribution system of Tunis. Details of this component are given in
Annex 2.3.
2.05     Objectives:  The Project when completed would extend electricity
service to the beneficiaries at least cost by implementing the long-term
program for rural electrification, reducing system losses, improving sales of
electricity and operating efficiency of the system, and continuing the Bank's
efforts in assisting STEG to expand its training program. In addition, the
proposed Project would follow up in the efforts started by a previous Bank
loan (TUN-1864) in rationalizing the energy pricing by having STEG pass on to
its consumers the increased cost of fuels used for generation.
2.06     Project Cost Estimates:  The estimated cost of the Project, excluding
interest during construction, is TD 35.9 million (US$89.6 million), of which
TD 16.6 million (US$41.5 million) would be in foreign exchange. Customs
duties and taxes, estimated at US$5.1 million, would be met by STEG. The
approximate breakdown of the Project cost is summarized below while Annex 2.4
gives the yearly Project cost estimates.

2.07     The Project base cost estimates are expressed in terms of anticipated
rid-1981 prices. These estimates were developed by STEG and reviewed by the
consultant and the Bank. Physical contingencies of 15% are considered
appropriate due to the dispersion of the Project area. Price contingencies
for the local cost components have been calculated at 8% per year for the
period 1981-1984. Price contingencies for the foreign cost components have
been calculated at 9.0% for 1981, 8.5% for 1982, and 7.5% for 1983-1984.
2.08     Project Financing:  The proposed loan of US$41.5 million would
finance 100% of the foreign exchange costs of the Project, excluding interest
during construcion. Local costs would be met by customers' contributions,
STEG's internal cash generation, and Government's contribution towards the
cost of rural electrification. The proposed financing plan of the project is
summarized below.

Project Preparation, and Engineering
2.09     Status of Project Preparation:  During 1979-1980 and in anticipation
of the sixth NESDP, STEG through its district offices, compiled information
relating to rural Tunisia. Thus, by mid 1980, more than 2,000 villages had
been surveyed and information pertinent to the electrification of each of
those villages was collected. On the basis of this information and following
the methodology used by TECSULT International Limited (Canadian consultants)
who prepared a rural electrification study for the previous (fifth) NESDP, and
suggestions made by the Bank, STEG has prepared a program for the development
of the rural distribution system. The methodology used for the formulation of
the plan has been reviewed by the Bank and the program is considered to
represent the least-cost scheme for extending electricity service to the
beneficiaries.
2.10     The physical quantities of equipment and material required
(Annex 2.1) and the costs associated with the implementation of the rural
electrification component of the Project, were derived from the information
collected by STEG (para. 2.09).  However, in the case of the urban rehabilita-
tion component, since it was not possible to perform measurements on each line
of the system, a representative sample of 60 lines situated in Tunis and its
suburbs was selected. Measurements were performed on the sample lines and
their average values were used to estimate the physical quantities of mate-
rials (Annex 2.2) and associated costs for implementing the rehabilitation of
the system. Finally, on the basis of the available stock and the volume of



- 18 -
works involved in the second component of the Project, the necessary construc-
tion and erection equipment was determined by STEG and reviewed by the con-
sultants and the Bank. The type and quantities of equipment required have
been found to be reasonable, see Annex 2.3.
2.11     Engineering:  The distribution equipment and materials used by STEG,
as well as typical construction designs of distribution facilities are
standardized.  However, as new equipment and materials become available on the
market, this standardization is revised. Consequently, technical specifica-
tions for the equipment and materials needed to implement the Project are
already available. In addition, STEG's procurement procedures call for inter-
national competitive bidding and therefore specimens of tender documents are
ready for review by the Bank. STEG's District offices, supported by the Head
Office, have already started detailed Project design including topographic
survey. In view of the volume of works involved, this task would continue to
end-1983 with assistance provided by local engineering firms (see Implementa-
tion Schedule, Annex 2.5). The detailed design relating to the portion of the
Project which would be implemented in 1982, would be completed by July 1981.
In the aggregate, contracts for detailed engineering to be awarded to local
firms would provide for about 320 man-months of consultants' services. The
study of the distribution system of Tunis would be a lump sum contract esti-
mated at a foreign exchange cost of US$500,000 and would be awarded to a
foreign firm. Terms of reference for this study have been cleared by the
mission during appraisal and the contract is currently being negotiated. For
the study of the distribution system of Tunis, STEG has agreed to employ
consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Implementation and Construction Supervision
2.12     Project Implementation:  The Project would be implemented over four
years, including one year (1981) for the preparation of detailed design and
tender documents for the procurement of goods and works (Annex 2.5).
Installation and erection of Project facilities would start in January 1982,
and is expected to be completed by June 1985. In view of STEG's ability in
the past to connect about 63,000 new rural and urban consumers per year (para.
2.01), implementation of the proposed Project in parallel with the extension
of the urban distribution systems (representing on average 56,000 new connec-
tions of rural and urban customers per year) is considered to be within STEG's
capabilities. Upon commissioning, all facilities would be owned, operated and
maintained by STEG.
2.13     For the rural component, installation and erection contracts and
civil works associated with them would be awarded entirely to local contrac-
tors on the basis of competitive bidding advertized locally. The installation
and erection of the facilities of the urban component which involve work on
live lines would be undertaken by STEG, while new extensions of the urban
system would be awarded (as above) to local contractors. Due to the geo-
graphical dispersion of the areas affected by the Project, individual con-
struction and erection contracts would be small (not expected to exceed



- 19 -
US$10,000) and it is therefore unlikely that foreign contractors would be
interested in bidding for these contracts.
2.14     Construction Supervision:  STEG would be responsible for the execu-
tion of the entire Project. To that end it would prepare detailed Project
implementation schedules, supervise installation and erection of Project
facilities and handling of equipment and materials, monitor progress imple-
me-tnt-inn -nd Trr -2r- quarte'1  -rngrcss r-oprt- for th- IBRD.
2.15     Procurement:  Except as indicated below, contracts financed under the
proposed loan for the supply of equipment and materials for electrical plant,
construction and erection equipment, testing equipment, and tools, would be
let by international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines for Procurement. since local manufacturers are expected to bid for
about 40% of the distribution equipment and materials, for purposes of bid
comparison, a preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods,
or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to responsive local
manufacturers. Minor quantities of standard distribution equipment and
materials, testing equipment, and tools, not exceeding Us$700,000 equivalent
in total, would be procured in accordance with international shopping, after
inviting quotations from at least three manufacturers. Meters and poles
purchased locally will not be financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan.
2.16      In the interest of economy and efficiency, sTEG procures its yearly
needs of distribution equipment and materials, once a year. In June of each
year, bids are obtained for goods to be used during the following year. After
award of contracts, and not later than December, STEG makes use of its option
to revise upwards the ordered quantities, valued at the agreed unit price of
the contract. In view of the soundness of this approach, procurement of
equipment and materials for the electrical plant to be used in the Project
will follow the same procedures.
2.17     Disbursement:  Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan would be made for: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures of directly
imported equipment and materials for the electrical plant, or 80% of local
expenditures of locally manufactured equipment and materials for the elec-
trical plant; (b) 100% of the foreign cost of consultants' services; (c) 100%
of the foreign expenditures of directly imported, or 80% of local expenditures
of imported and locally supplied construction and erection equipment, testing
equipment, and tools; and (d) 100% of the foreign cost of training. The esti-
mated closing date would be December 31, 1985, six months after the estimated
completion of the Project, to allow for payment of retention monies.
2.18     Retroactive Financing and Advanced Contracting;  No retroactive
financing or advanced contracting is involved in the proposed Project.
2.19     Environmental Aspects:  The Project has no adverse pollution effects
on the environment. Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to a
minimum by suitable routing of overhead lines.



- 20 -
2.20     Risks:  No special risks are foreseen, and no major implementation
problems are expected.
III. FINANCE
3.01     Accounts:  STEG has a well organized accounting department and an
efficient computerized accounting and management information system. However,
present computing facilities are saturated and STEG is considering expansion
of these facilities in 1982 by creating a regional computer center at Sfax for
billing customers in the central and southern regions of the country. Most
accounting work is decentralized in the districts, whose performance is ade-
quate. Tight control is exercised over all expenses by the Inspection Depart-
ment and performance is monitored through a system of key performance indi-
cators that has been in effect. for the past year. Computer applications have
been extended to accommodate formulation of technical design, rural electrifi-
cation and economic studies. In accordance with the National System of
Accounts, interest during construction is not capitalized. Income taxes are
recorded as charges and liability until formal exemption is given, usually the
following year. STEG, being in a period of heavy investment, has been granted
exemption from income taxes for 5 years (1977-1981), and this exemption is
expected to be extended for another 5 years. Accordingly, income taxes have
been eliminated from the financial statements.
3.02     Audit:  Under the existing loan agreement (1355-TUN), STEG's
financial statements are to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank and submitted within 5 months after the end of each fiscal year. In
the past, STEG has not submitted the audited accounts within the agreed time
limit; the audited accounts for 1979 were received only in September 1980.
The delay in closing the accounts was attributed to the heavy workload of the
Computing Department which gives priority to billing. Efforts are being made
to allocate sufficient computer time for accounting work and it is expected
that the 5-month period would be adhered to in the future. Since 1974, STEG's
accounts were audited by an expatriate firm of chartered accountants, Nawar &
Co., who were accepted by the Bank. STEG is now considering the appointment
of another firm of auditors from a short list of auditing firms agreed with
the Bank. The existing audit covenant would be repeated in the proposed loan.
3.03     Revaluation of Assets:  Under Loan 1355-TUN, STEG is required to earn
an annual rate of return of at least 8% on the current net value of its
average fixed assets in service, valued from time to time with consistently
applied methods of valuation or revaluation acceptable to the Bank. In the
past, revaluation methods were not discussed or agreed with the Bank. The
Bank did not also push for revaluation of STEG's assets since a high
proportion of these assets have been added in the recent past. However, in
view of the increasing inflation, STEG should now be required to revalue its
assets and to compute the rate of return on such revalued assets. During
appraisal, STEG agreed to revalue its electricity assets on a proforma basis
for the purpose of calculating the rate of return. In the Second Natural Gas



- 21 -
Pipeline Project (Loan 1864-TUN) STEG agreed to revalue its gas assets each
year using the wholesale price index for Tunisia. In order to ensure
consistency, the same index would be used in revaluing STEG's electricity
assets. STEG has agreed to revalue its electricity assets each year using the
Tunisian official wholesale price index.
3.04     Past Performance:  STEG achieved a rate of return on unrevalued
assets of 7.5% in 1977, 7.4% in~ 1978 and 8.5% in 1979 compared to the
covenanted 8X (para 3.03); the riLLe of return in 1980 is estimated to be 7.9%
on unrevalued assets, although tariffs were raised an av6rage 15% in October
1980 (see STEG's income statements for 1977-1980 in Annex 3.1). The
corresponding rate of return on revalued assets was 5.6%, 5.4%, 6.6% and 5.0%
in the years 1977 through 1980.
3.05     STEG's average tariff was increased by 20% in June 1977, 12% in
December 1978, 15% in October 1980, and 8% in February 1981 to meet the
increase in the cost of fuels and to finance a reasonable portion of its
ambitious development program. With these tariff increases, STEG was able to
finance from internally generated funds (after debt service and providing for
working capital requirement) 28.0% of its investment program for the period
1977-1980. Including customers contribution, the self-financing level during
the period was 47.2% (see STEG's Sources and Applications of Funds for
1977-1980 in Annex 3.3). Loan 1355-TUN also requires that STEG would not
incur any debt without the approval of the Bank, except for financing the
Project, if the principal amount of such debt would raise the aggregate
principal amount of its debt to more than 45% of the sum of its equity plus
the aggregate principal amount of its debt (including the principal amount of
the debt to be incurred). So far, STEG has been able to maintain its debt
below the above agreed percentage (40% in 1977, 38% in 1978, 44% in 1979 and
43% in 1980).
3.06     STEG's current liabilities have consistently exceeded current assets
for the period 1977 through 1980 reflecting a tight liquidity position. The
current ratio was 0.83, 0.80, 0.73, and 0.75 for the years 1977, 1978, 1979
and 1980 respectively. In the past, STEG has borrowed rather imprudently on a
short-term basis to finance long-term investments. However, STEG's management
has addressed the problem by requesting the appropriate authorities to convert
some short-term loans into medium-term loans (TD 6 million in 1980 and TD 6.15
million in 1981) which would improve the current ratio. Of the current assets
at the end of 1980, 75% consisted of accounts receivable for electricity
supply and loans for watery heaters. Receivables on accounts of electricity
bills alone represented 94 days of electricity sales at the end of 1979 (see
para. 3.08).
3.07     In view of its tight working capital position, STEG has recently
decided to change its policy of promoting electricity consumption by selling
water heaters to domestic consumers on credit, repayable over 2 years. STEG's
balance Sheets as of December 31, 1977-1980 are given in Annex 3.2.

3.08     Collection of Receivables:  As mentioned in para. 3.06, STEG's
accounts receivable for electricity supply represented revenues equivalent to
94 days of sales at the end of 1979. Accounts receivable have in the past
increased at a yearly average of 29% which indicates a deterioration in the
collection work. The bulk of the accounts receivable are dues owed by state
enterprises (30.9%), and Government offices and municipalities (27%). One
state enterprise, SOTEMI, with an overdue amount of TD 3.2 million at the end
of 1979, has suspended all payments since 1977 and diverted for other purposes
Government subsidies granted to it to settle electricity bills. The Govern-
ment departments operating under centralized state budget pay in advance 80%
of the year's estimated bills.  However, since their budget estimates for
electricity consumption are unrealistic and do not reflect increases both in
consumption and power rates, and since they do not make further monthly pay-
ments in the course of the year, they too keep accumulating overdue amounts to
STEG.
3.09     The question of overdue electricity bills by state enterprises
(SOTEMI in particular) and Government departments has been seriously addressed
by STEG's management and is being considered by the Government. With effect
from June 1980, the heads of STEG's districts were empowered to cut off supply
to delinquent consumers (domestic consumers, and private industrial), to
follow-up very closely payments due by municipalities, and to participate in
preparing the annual budget of Government departments in respect of elec-
tricity consumption. STEG has agreed that at no time its receivables for
electricity shall exceed the equivalent of three months' sales. Government
has also agreed to take all measures necessary on its part to enable STEG
always to maintain its receivables for electricity at no more than three
months' sales. As recorded in the minutes of negotiations, Government and
STEG would take all necessary measures to ensure that arrears owed by State
enterprises through December 31, 1980 are settled by the end of 1982.
3.10     Financing Plan:  The following table summarizes the sources and
applications of funds of STEG for 1981-1986 assuming: (i) equal annual
increases in fuel prices so that domestic prices reach parity with inter-
national prices by 1987; and (ii) average tariff increases of 3.6%, 21.2%,
24.2%, 18.7% and 15.7% in each of the years 1982-1986, so as to secure for
STEG a return on revalued assets of 8% in 1981 and 6% in 1982 through 1986
(Annex 3.4). STEG's investment program for 1981-1986 amounts to US$1,141
million which will be financed 35.5% from STEG's internal cash generation
excluding customers' contributions, 6.2% from Government contributions, 10.2%
from customers contributions, 3.3% from customers' deposits (net of other
requirements), and 44.8% from borrowings.

3.11     Of the total borrowing requirements estimated at US$512.0 million
equivalent, US$41.5 million would be from the proposed IBRD loan, US$19.8
million from existing loans and US$450.7 million from other loans (mainly
supplier's credits) to be secured. In the past, STEG has successfully
obtained suppliers' credits which, coupled with bilateral assistance at
concessional terms, resulted in very favorable credit terms (average of 7%
interest rate, 15 years repayment period after 3 to 5 years of grace). It
is reasonable to expect this trend to continue especially in view of the
type of equipment for which supplier's credits will be sought (generation,
transmission and dispatching center). In addition, STEG's investment
program allows for flexibility in its implementation without jeopardizing
the Project. By postponing the realization of some components of its
development program (two of the four units of Rades and the completion of
the 225-kV loop around Tunis) STEG can curtail its financing needs by about
US$250 million.



- 24 -
3.12     The proposed Bank loan would finance about 3.6% of the construc-
tion requirements of the 1981-86 program and the full foreign exchange cost
of the Project. The Government would cover any shortfall in the funds
required to complete the Project including cost overruns.
3.13     Future Financial Performance:  Any target for STEG's future finan-
cial performance should take account of the Government's stated objective
to gradually eliminate subsidies extended to petroleum products by 1987
(para. 1.19), and the following:
(a) the need to reach an appropriate rate of return after recovering
all increased operating costs from year to year arising from
inflation and otherwise;
(b) the need to maintain a satisfactory self-financing level; and
(c) the feasibility of the tariff increases necessary to secure the
above objectives.
Assuming equal annual fuel price increases (31% for fuel oil and gas, and
17% for diesel oil) beginning in 1982 so that domestic prices reach parity
with international prices by 1987 (para. 1.19), and reasonable rates of
inflation in other operating expenses, it is estimated that STEG could earn
a return of 8% on revalued assets in 1981 without any tariff increase.
However, it would need much higher increases than have been realized in the
past to earn the convenanted return of 8% on revalued assets in the years
from 1982 onwards. In order to avoid abrupt and drastic price adjustments
that would be disruptive socially and economically and at the same time
move the entire economy to a better system of pricing policies, the rate of
return required will be reduced to 6% in any year in which the prices of
fuels used by STEG are increased by at least 20%. Even with a lower rate
of return of 6% from 1982, STEG's internal cash generation during the
period 1981-1986, including customer contributions, would be a healthy
45.7%. During this period STEG would also have a satisfactory debt/equity
ratio (ranging from 31/69 to 36/64) and a satisfactory debt service cover-
age (above 1.7). Government has agreed to progressively raise the domestic
selling prices of petroleum products to international levels within a
period of five years from January 1, 1982. Government and STEG have also
agreed to take all necessary measures, including tariff increases, if
necessary, to enable STEG to meet the rate of return of a minimum 8%.
However, from 1982, the rate of return to be achieved by STEG would be 6%
in any year in which fuel prices are increased as above. In order that the
Bank may be aware of STEG's earnings prospects in good time, STEG has
agreed to prepare and submit to the Bank and the Government, by October 31
each year, financial forecasts for the current and following years indicat-
ing the underlying assumptions, the changes in tariffs, if any, required,
and the measures proposed to produce the annual rate of return.



- 25 -
3.14     As a result of the proposed tariff increases (see para. 3.13) and
of revaluation reserves, STEG's debt/equity ratio would improve from 43/57
at the end of 1980 to 35/65 at the end of 1986. STEG's current ratio which
was 0.75 at the end of 1980 would improve to slightly above 0.9 during
1981-1986 reflecting an improving liquidity position.
3.15     Debt Service Covenant:  In response to STEG's request, and to be
consistent with Loan Agreement 1864-TUN (Second National Gas Pipeline
project) the debt limitation covenant under Loan 1355-TUN (see para. 3.05)
would be superseded by a more conventional debt service covenant, under
which STEG would obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term
borrowing unless the net revenue for each year during the term of the debt
(before depreciation and interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times the
projected debt service requirement for such year, on all its debt, includ-
ing the debt to be incurred.
3.16     Insurance:  STEG's insurance arrangements are satisfactory.  It
has insured its assets with a national company against risks of fire,
explosion, mechanical and electrical damage at all generating plants and
substations of 90 kV and over and against only fire in the head office,
district offices, storage depots and warehouses. It carries its own risks
in respect of transmission and distribution lines, and distribution sub-
stations. This arrangement is satisfactory, considering STEG's high opera-
tion and maintenance standards.
3.17     Lending Arrangement:  In accordance with normal Bank policy, the
entire loan would be made to STEG, the beneficiary, with the guarantee of
the Government on standard Bank terms (17 years including 4 years of
grace). The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the borrower.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Load Forecast
4.01     The forecast of electricity sales in Tunisia between 1981 and 1986
was estimated by STEG. Both the assumptions and the methodology used for
forecasting were reviewed by the Bank and were found to be acceptable.
Electricity sales are expected to grow at an average annual rate of about
15%, compared to an average annual rate of 16%(from 1,010 GWh to 2,120 GWh)
for the period 1975-1980. The growth of sales is expected to almost remain
at its historical level because of the Government's intensified efforts in
industrializing the country, and expanding the rural and urban distribution
networks which would result (during 1982-1986) in the connection of about
56,000 new low voltage consumers per year. Details of the forecast of
sales by voltage level of service are summarized in Annex 4.1.
4.02     A very conservative forecast of sales for the rural electrifica-
tion component of the Project, disaggregated by customer category such as



- 26 -
domestic, pumping, commercial and small industrials, was derived by the
mission on the basis of information extracted from STEG's records and data
collected by visiting 36 villages. The data collected was used to derive
three parameters which were used to forecast the demand by the bene-
ficiaries: (a) initial connection rates; (b) consumption during the first
year of service; and (c) rate of growth of consumption. The initial con-
nection rate refers to the number of consumers that would be connected to
STEG's system in the first three years, once service is made available.
They were estimated to be about 23% for the first year, 34% for the second,
and 43% for the third. The consumption during the first year of service
was estimated to be 300 kWh per domestic connection; 2,500 kWh per shallow
pumping installation; 150,000 kWh per deep-well pump; and 1,200 kWh per
small industrial consumer. Very conservative rates of growth have been
used in calculating the consumption of the rural beneficiaries and are
summarized below:

4.03     The forecast of the demand for electricity by the urban beneficiaries
was derived by STEG's distribution department based on the historical data
maintained by the corporation. The assumptions used in forecasting were
reviewed by the Bank and found to be reasonable. The average consumption per
urban domestic connection during the first year of service was estimated to be
about 600 kWh, and per small commercial and industrial consumer was 1,000
KWh. In this case also, very conservative rates of growth have been used in
calculating the consumption of the urban beneficiaries and are summarized
below:

B. Least Cost Alternative
4.04      The Project consists of the first three years (1989-1984) of 6TEG's
five-year program for the extension of electricity service to the rural
consumers and the rehabilitation of the urban distribution system. During
preparation of the long-term program for the extension of the rural distribu-
tion network, the Bank discussed with sTEG the elements to be taken into
consideration to ensure that the program is least cost. After its completion,
the Bank reviewed the program and found the basis used for its formulation to
be consistent with the methodology accepted by the Bank for designing such
programs.
4.05      bTEG has had at least 10 years experience in formulating its own
least cost program for the extension and rehabilitation of its urban distribu-
tion network. During its early years of development, iTEG worked closely with
EdF in strengthening its capabilities for planning and implementing urban
distribution projects. sTEG's program for the development of its urban dis-
tribution network between 1982-1986 was reviewed by the Bank and found to be
acceptable, both conceptually and technically.
C. Return on Investment
4.06      The Project consists of three components:  (i) the electrification of
about 990 villages; (ii) the rehabilitation of the distribution systems in
about 60 cities and large towns; and (iii) equipment, tools, training and
consulting services (para. 2.04). The calculation of the economic rate of
return on the Project is not possible because the quantification of the bene-
fits associated with the urban distribution component and the component cover-
ing the tools, training, and consulting services is not possible. Instead,
the return on STEG's 1982-1984 program for the development of its low voltage
distribution networks (urban and rural) is calculated as a proxy for the
return on the Project. The return on the rural electrification component on
the Project is also calculated to ascertain its economic merit.
4.07      The economic return on STEG's distribution program is 11.6%.  It is
based on benefits comprised of; the incremental revenues associated with the
sale of electricity to the urban and rural consumers; the connection and meter
charges; the consumers' net fuel savings; and the fuel savings that would
accrue from the reduction of distribution losses (Annex 4.4). The long run
average incremental cost for the electricity delivered to the low voltage
urban and rural distribution networks is taken as a proxy for the economic
cost associated with the program. Although the return on bTEG's distribution
program compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital of about 11%,
it nevertheless underestimates the real return on the program because the
entire surplus accruing to the consumers could not be estimated.



- 28 -
4.08     The return on the rural electrification component of the Project is
8.3%. This is based on benefits which include the revenues generated from the
sale of electricity to the beneficiaries, the connection and service charges,
and the net fuel savings to the beneficiaries (Annex 4.4). The long run
average incremental cost of electricity delivered to the rural distribution
network is taken as a proxy for the economic cost of electricity supplied to
the beneficiaries.  The assumptions used in calculating the rate of return are
summarized in Annex 4.4.
V.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     Government and STEG will take all necessary measures, including
tariff increases, to ensure that sTEG achieves a rate of return on revalued
assets of not less than 8% (as described in para. 3.10). However, from 1982
the rate of return to be achieved by STEG would be 6% in any year in which the
prices of fuels used by STEG are increased by at least 20% (para. 3.13).
5.02     Government will:
(a) implement revised electricity tariffs promptly, and in any case not
later than 2 months after the fuel price increases, so that STEG
recovers the total increases in its fuel cost (para. 1.20);
(b) take all measures necessary to enable STEG always to maintain its
receivables for electricity at no more than three months' sales
(para. 3.09);
(c) cover any shortfalls in the financing plan of the Project
(para 3.12); and
(d) progressively raise the domestic selling price of petroleum products
to international levels within a period of 5 years from January 1,
1982 (para. 3.13).
5.03     STEG will:
(a) furnish to the Bank for its approval a detailed description of the
proposed training program (para. 1.31);
(b) employ, for the study of the distribution system of Tunis, consul-
tants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.11);
(c) revalue each year the fixed assets that relate to its power activity,
using as revaluation factor the wholesale price index for Tunisia
(para. 3.03);
(d) ensure that its receivables for electricity supply shall at no time
exceed the equivalent of three months' sales (para 3.09);



- 29 -
(e) prepare and submit to the Bank and the Government, by October 31 each
year, financial forecasts for the current and following years, indi-
cating the underlying assumptions, the changes in tariffs, if any,
required, and the measures proposed to produce the annual rate of
return (para. 3.l3); and
(f) not incur any debt, without Bank approval, if its debt service cover-
age ratio is less than 1.5 in each year. This covenant would replace
the existing debt limitation covenant of the becond Power Project
(para 3.15).
5.04     The audit provisions under Loan 1355-TUN would be extended to the
proposed loan.
5.05     In view of the agreement on the matters set forth in this report, the
Project is suitable for a loan of U6$41.5 million on the usual terms. There
are no special conditions of loan effectivenss. The loan is expected to
become effective within 3 months of loan signing.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. Income Statement
1.       Sales of electricity are based on STEG's estimated load growth.  The
forecasts assume annual energy sales growth of 14.6% in 1981, 12.3% in 1982,
12.4% in 1983, 12% in 1984, 11.9% in 1985, and 11.9% in 1986. Average tariff
increases of 3.6% from January 1, 1982, 21.2% from January 1, 1983, 24.2% from
January 1, 1984, 18.7% from January 1, 1985, and 15.7% from January 1, 1986
are assumed.
2.       Prices of heavy fuel oil are assumed to increase an average 31% each
year from January 1, 1982, and prices of gas oil are assumed to increase an
average 17% during the same period.
3.       Operating and maintenance costs are assumed to increase by 14.3% in
1982, 15% in 1983 and 1984 and 17% in 1985 and 1986.
4.       Depreciation is computed at an average annual rate of 4.5% per annum
of the average gross fixed assets.
5.       Interest charges are based on STEG's actual calculations.  New
borrowings are assumed to be at the following interest rates: IBRD loan at
9.6%, other loans (suppliers' credit) at 7.5% with maturities of 15 years
including 4 years of grace. Interest during construction has been charged to
operations in accordance with the Tunisia National System of Accounts.
B. Balance Sheet
6.       Gross fixed assets are revalued at the end of 1981.  Thereafter, they
have been revalued at the end of each subsequent year assuming an average
inflation rate of 7% each year.
7.       Inventories are assumed to increase during 1981-1986 in keeping up
with operating requirements.
8.       The rate of return is calculated on the average net revalued fixed
assets.

Assumptions for Rate of Return Calculation
Consumers' Willingness to Pay -/
1.        About 60% of the rural families are presently using a single kerosene lamp
for lighting purposes at an estimated cost of TD30.5 per year (including equipment,
maintenance, and fuel). The same service, namely lighting, could be met with a
60 W lamp (130 kWh/year).
2.        About 40% of the rural families are presently using battery operated tele-
vision and radio sets at an estimated cost of TD 80 per year (battery purchase,
charging, and replacement). The same service could be met by using 110 kWh per year.
3.        Under the present conditions (without electricity service) the weighted
average cost for both service is estimated at TD 62.5 per year. These services could
be met by consuming on the average 175 kWh per year, if electricity was available.
4.        Presently, the cost of connection of a domestic consumer is TD 50, and the
electrical installation for a rural house is estimated at TD 100. Therefore, the
discounted yearly cost (at 10% over 40 years) of a rural family to obtain electricity
service is TD 17 per year. The electricity bill for consuming 175 kWh per year would
be TD 8.7 (50 milliemes/kWh). The total cost of having electricity service is
therefore TD 2 6 per year.
5.        The average consumers' surplus is the difference between what consumers are
paying for alternate energy to meet their lighting needs and the power needed to operate
their television and radio sets, less the cost of electricity needed to provide the
same service. This is estimated to be TD 36.5 (based on the domestic prices of fuels
and the prevailing tariffs for electricity) which is equivalent to 200 milliemes per
kWh (TD 36.5/175 kWh). The savings to consumers (proxy for consumers' surplus)
tabulated below are assumed to be only 60% of the estimated 200 milliemes per kWh.

/2 About 50% would be single-phase connections (TD 50.0) and 50% three-phase
connections (TD 80.0).
Fuel Cost and Fuel Savings
(a) Fuel Cost: About-40% of the total cost of delivering power to the con-
sumers was assumed to represent the fuel cost of generation, including system
losses. Fuels were valued at their border prices which were inflated at 3% per
year for the first 10 years.
(b) Fuel Savings: The yearly consumption of only the new consumers that would
be connected to the grid during implementation of the Project (1982-1984), valued
at 58% (70 milliemes/kWh compared to 120 milliemes/kWh, for the domestic customers)
of their savings, was taken as a proxy for fuel savings. Thus, the fuel
savings used in calculating the rate of return reflect, at least, the savings
that would have accrued from the displaced alternative sources of energy that would
have been consumed, if the Project was not implemented. Fuel savings have also
been inflated at 3% per year for the first 10 years.

Benefits Accruing from the Rehabilitation of Urban
Distribution Network
Data
Losses before rehabilitation               :  (a)  16% (transmission and distribution)
of which,
(b) 12% (distribution)
Number of domestic consumers in 1980    :  (a)  603,000 (urban and rural) of which,
(b) 525,000 (urban)
STEG's total sales in 1980                    (a)  2,120 GWh of which,
(b) 570 GWh to domestic consumers
(urban and rural).
Assumptions
1. Consumption of urban domestic customers is taken to be double the consumption
of rural domestic customers.
2. All energy losses are assumed to be generated from a fuel oil fired plant with
an efficiency of 0.26 kgoe/kWh (including generation losses).
3. Benefits accruing from the rehabilitation of the distribution system are assumed
to be only from fuel savings (valued at its border price, $182 per ton).
4. Annual growth of sales to domestic customers up to the end of STEG's urban
rehabilitation program (1986), is assumed to be 12% per year.
5. Losses after rehabilitation are assumed to be 8%'(distribution).
Computation
x = Yearly consumption (kWh) per urban domestic customer
Consumption of domestic customers = 525,000 x + 78,000 E = 570,000,000 kWh, and
x  =  1,010 kWh, rounded  x  =  1,000 kWh, and therefore
Sales to urban domestic customers in 1980 = 525 GWh
