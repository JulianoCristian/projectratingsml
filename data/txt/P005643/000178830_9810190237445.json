will assist Tunisia in\n            implementing the first three years of a five year program\n            for the development of rural electrification and in\n            rehabilitating the urban distribution systems. The project\n            will connect about 990 villages in 15 Governorates to the\n            national network and improve the supply of electricity in\n            about 60 towns. The project consists of the following\n            components: (i) supply and erection of about 3,130 km (2,460\n            km for rural electrification and 670 km for urban\n            distribution) of medium tension and 2,840 km (2,060 km\n            rural, and 780 km urban) of low tension lines; (ii) supply\n            and installation of about 1,290 transformers for a total\n            capacity of 62 MVA (32 MVA rural and 30 MVA urban); (iii)\n            provision of equipment and tools for implementing the urban\n            rehabilitation component; and (iv) provision of technical\n            assistance for training, and a study for strengthening the\n            power distribution system in Tunis. The project, when\n            completed, will extend electricity services to about 30,400\n            new domestic rural customers, 2,100 pumping stations and 300\n            commercial and small industrial consumers, and improve the\n            quality of service to more than 150,000 existing urban consumers."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
