PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT - LOAN 2003-TUN
PREFACE
This project, supported by Loan 2003-TUN for $41.5 million (reduced
to $37.5 million during implementation owing to a redutction in the foreign
cost), consisted of the first three years (1982-1984) of STEG's five-year
program (1982-1986) for the development of the rural and urban distribution
systems. The loan was closed on the original closing date of December 31,
1985. Final disbursemene was made on July 16, 1986 raising the total
disbursements to $36.1 million.  The amount of $1.4 millioi remaining
undisbursed was caricelled on July 16, 1986 and the account was closed on that
date. This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office based on the Bank's appraisal report,
supervision reports and other documents in the Bank's files and on the
.      findings of a proj!ct completion missions which visited Tunisia in February
1987.
*               The PCR summarizes the main points of interest.  The loan was the
sixth of a continuing series of Bank loans for the energy sector, begun in
1971, whici. have helped develop STEG into an efficient national public utility.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), but the project will not be audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

THIRD POWER PROJECT - LOAN 2003-TUN
HIGHLIGHTS
(i!      The purpose of the project was to extend electricity service in the
rural areas and to improve the quality of service to urban customers. It was
also part of the effort to continue the institution building activities in the
energy sector, specifically in rationalizing pricing policies and in helping
STEG to improve its operating efficiency and to strengthen its financial
viability.
(ii)     The project fully accomplished its objectives except in the financial
and accounting area (p-. i. 7.01). In the financial and accounting area, STEG
has had a setback. Although its internal cash generation was still a
respectable 302 of its investment program, this was only two-thirds of what
was estimated at appraisal (para. 5.01). The project achieved a re-estimated
rate of return of 18.5% (para. 6.06) as against 11.6% estimated at appraisal
on the same basis.
(iii)    Except for the installation of a submarine cable to connect the
island of Kerkennah (para. 2.07) in lieu of the planned overhead line, the
project scope was unchanged. Although the number of villages electrified was
less than expected, thte number of pumping stations and domestic and other
customers connected to the system exceeded the appraisal estimate by 10X. The
project was also completed without any significant delay. In US dollar terms,
the actual project cost was ouly 61.32 of the appraisal estimate but in
Tunisian dinar terms it was 5.7% above the appraisal estimate. This was
because of the substantial appreciation of the US dollar and the devaluation
of the Tunisian dinar during project implementation (para. 3.03).
(iv)     One item of particular interest is the effort to raise the domestic
prices of petroleum products in the country to international levels within a
period of five years from January 1, 1982. Beginning in 1981 the Government
started introducing fuel increases - in certain years two increases were made
during the year. In December 31, 1986, all petroleum product prices were
above international prices (Annex 6).  Although the Government did take bold
measures in an effort to comply with the agreement, the objective was achieved
partly due to the fall in international prices in 1986/87.



- vi -
(v)      The project demonstrated the need to take into account the political
and social constraints a government is likely to encounter in implementing
institutional and financial reforms of public utility corporations.

the Bank approved another loan of US$37.0 million (Loan 1864-TUN) which would
finance the foreign component of the first phar? of a gas distribution
pipeline.
1.04     The Bank's continued involvement in the power subseetor contribut3d
to the strengthening of all aspects of STEG's operations and management. At
appraisal, the Corporation had consolidated its control over the sector and
developed its technical capabilities and practices to reach levels that were
comparable to those of similar institutions in developed countries. In
addition, STEG was also able to achieve in the past a satisfactory financial
position. It was expected that the cortinuation of the Bank's involvement in
the energy sector would strengthen the existing institution building efforts,
improve technical standards and achieve overall coordination of energy
pricing. It was also expected to induce the g:,wth of the energy sector along
a least-cost path.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.01     Between 1976 and 1980, the number of low-voltage consumers in urban
areas increased on the average by 48,000 per year, and their average
consumption by 12% per year. These high rates of growth were beyond STEG's
expectations and consequently the funds set aside for the reinforcement of the
distribution network were inadequate for providing the required equipment and
materials. This shortfall coupled with the higher priority given to
generation and transmission rendered the urban distribution system inadequate
to cope with the demand. The result was a considerable voltage drop, reaching
double the maximum permissible level, and frequent power failures in urban
areas. Likewise, the level of service in rural areas was low. Clearly, the
rehabilitation of the urban distribution system and extension of electricity
service in rural areas were matters of high priority for Government and STEG.
The subject project had 4ts genesis in the above state of affairs.
Project Preparation, Negotiations and Effectiveness
2.02     Following a methodology introduced earlier by an expatriate firm of
consultants, STEG prel-red a five-year program (1982-1986) for the extension
of the rural electrification system. STEG also prepared, through sampling
measurements, a five-year program (1982-1986) for the rehabilitation of the
urban distribution system. The project consisted of the first three years of
these programs (para. 2.05).
2.03     The project was appraised by the Bank in October/November 1980 and
negotiations were held in April 1981. During the negotiations, agreement was
reached by the Bank and the Tunisian delegation that STEG's assets be revalued
annually using the official Tunisian wholesale price index. The following
were also agreed during negotiations:



(a) Fuel Adiustment Clause. Agreement had been sought by the Bank that,
whenever increases in fuel prices were introduced, electricity
tariffs would be raised to cover STEG's increased fuel bill on the
same date the new fuel prices were effective. The Tunisian
delegation argued that the proposed simultaneous increases in fuel
prices and electricity tariffs might not be feasible at all times
because of political resistance to raising all energy prices at the
same time. The delegation, therefore, proposed, and the Bank agreed,
that tariffs be adjusted as soon as possible after fuel price
increases and in any case, within a period of 2 months to fully
recover the increased fuel bill for SIEG;
(b) Accounts Receivable. The Bank had sought agreement to STEG's
accounts receivable for electricity being limited to not more than 2
months' sales. The delegation argued, and the Bank agreed, that the
2-month limit be raised to 3 months because the lower limit could not
be adhered to with STEG's present billing cycle (bi-monthly for
domestic and monthly for high and medium voltage customers);
(c) Rate of Return. The Bank had proposed a reduction in the rate of
return from 8% to 61 in any year from 1983 through 1986 provided the
average price of fuels used by STEG was increased by at least 30% per
year over the period from 1082 through the year under consideration.
As requested by the Tunisian delegation, it was agreed to reduce
STEG's rate of return to 6% from 182 onwards if fuel prices were
increased, at least by 20% in any given year, since even with a 62
return on revalued assets, STEG's internal cash generation would be
fully satisfactory; and
(d)  Settlement of Arrears.  The Bank had proposed that the arrears
accumulated by State enterprises through November 30, 1980 be settled
by March 31, 1982. Since good progress was being made in settling
overdue payments by State enterprises, and receivables would in
future be limited to three months' sales, it was agreed to delete the
proposed covenant. However, Government and STEG signified their
intention to settle all accumulated arrears through December 31, 1980
by December 31, 1982.
The request of the Tunisian delegation that the portion of the Bank loan
corresponding to the foreign costs of the rural electrification component
(US$20.7 million) be lent to the Government, which would then pass it on to
STEG in the form of an equity contribution was not agreed to by the Bank in
view of STEG's sound financial condition which did not justify grants from the
Government for this purpose.
2.04     The loan was signed on July 15, 1981 and was made effective on April
21, 1982. There were no special effectiveness conditions.
2.05     The project consisted of the first three years (1982-1984) of STEG's
five-year program (1982-1986) for the development of the rural and urban
distribution systems and comprised the following components:



(a)  Rural Electrification.  About 200 km of three-phase medium voltage
lines, 2,260 km of single-phase medium voltage lines, and 2,060 km of
single-phase low voltage lines to be erected, and about 1,140
transformers (for a total estimated capacity of about 32 MVA) to be
installed to extend electricity service to about 990 villages in 15
Governorates;
(b)  Urban Rehabilitation.  About 670 km of three-phase medium voltage
lines and 780 km of single-phase low voltage lines to be erected, and
about 150 transformers (with an estimated total capacity of 30 MVA)
to be installed to strengthen the distribution systems in about 60
urban centers;
(c)  Equipment and Tools.  Construction and erection equipment, tools and
laboratory testing equipment to be provided to enable STEG to
implement the urban rehabilitation component and improve its
technical capabilities; and
(d)  Technical Assistance.  About 50 man-months of consulting services to
be provided for a study of the distribution system of Tunis aiming at
determining the least-cost long-term development of the city's
distribution system, improving the quality of service, and reducing
system losses.  The project also provided for training of STEG's
staff abroad (about 70 people for a total of about 130 man-months).
Proiect Obiectives
2.06     The proposed project aimed at extending electricity service in the
rural areas and improving the quality of service to urban customers.  About
30,400 new domestic customers, 2,100 pumping stations and 300 commercial and
small industrial consumers in rural areas were to be connected to the national
grid, and about 150,000 urban customers were to benefit from the improved
quality and reliability of the service. The project was intended to helF
implement the least-cost program for rural electrification, improve operating
efficiency by reducing system losses, continue the Bank's efforts in assisting
STEG to improve its technical competence by providing financing for equipment,
tools and training, and to strengthen its financial viability, and follow up
on the efforts started under a previous Bank loan to the energy sector
(1864-TUN) in rationalizing pricing policies.
Changes in Proiect Scope
2.07     The project was completed as envisaged at appraisal except for the
increase in project scope so as to include the connection of the island of
Kerkennah to the main grid via a submarine cable. 1/ The original design
involved the connection of the island to the main grid via an overhead medium
voltage line for which the project scope provided only for the financing of
the supply of materials but not for its erection.
1/ When the project was studied in detail, the submarine cable yielded the
least cost solution.

2.08     Annex 1 sets forth the major covenants of the Guarantee and Loan
Agreemt.nts. Except in regard to the revenue and audit covenants (paras. 5.03
and 5.06), compliance with the covenants was satisfactory.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Project implementation was initiated on schedule with materials drawn
from STEG's stores (to be replaced by Bank-financed materials wher received).
There were no problems in project implementation and the project was
successfully completed with a slippage of only six months (December 1985 as
against the appraisal estimate of June 1985).
Procurement
3.02     There were protracted discussions between the Bank and STEG in
reaching agreement on substantive tender document revisions proposed by the
Bank for compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures. Considerable
delays in procurement also occurred on account of the delayed initiation of
the procurement cycle for each year by STEG. Although a great deal of effort
was made to shorten STEG's procurement cycle, only some improvements were
achieved by way of concrete change. Obviously old habits and established
procedures die very hard.
Project Cost
3.03     Annex 2 gives a comparison of the estimated and actual number'of
villages electrified and connections made, the estimated and actual works
under the rural component, and the estimated and actual lines and transformers
rehabilitated under the urban component. Although the actual new connections
made were more than estimated at appraisal, the number of villages electrified
4nd the quantities of materials used - with the exception of transformers in
urban areas - were less than those estimated. Annex 3 gives a comparison of
the actual and estimated cost of the project. It will be seen that in US$
terms, the actual cost was only 61.3% of the appraisal estimate. However, in
TD terms, the actual cost was 105.7% of the appraisal estimate. This is
because of the substantial appreciation of the US dollar and the devaluation
of the Tunisian dinar during the implementation of the project.
Disbursements
3.04     Annex 4 compares the actual disbursements with the appraisal
estimates. Altiiough disbursements at the end of December 1984, after nearly
three years of project implementation, were only about 39% of appraisal
estimates, procurement of equipment and material gained momentum and loan
funds committed for works and serv'ices financed under the loan amounted to
about US$33.0 million. Disbursements were slow in the beginning stages of the
project due to slow tendering resulting from substantial revisions of tender
documents for compliance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. However, the



- 6 -
execution of the project itself was not delayed because of slow tendering and
slow receipt of materials since implementation was started with the draw-down
of the required materials from STEG's stores that were replaced by the
Bank-financed materials on receipt.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     The project was completed by December 1985, six months later than
estimated at appraisal. The facilities constructed under the project have
been operating satisfactorily. Annex 5 gives a comparison of STEG's total
forecast and actual sales for the period 1981-1985, as well as forecast and
actual sales broken down into three consumer categories (high, medium and low
voltage). Although during this period total sales and sales in each year to
each consumer category increased at an average anniual rate of about 8%, actual
sales were below those forecast mainly due to the slow down of the Tunisian
economy. In summary, STEG's average sales over the period 1981-1985 were only
86% of forecast sales. This shortfall had an adverse impact on STEG's net
revenue which, coupled with the devaluation of the Tunisian Dinar contributed
to the corporation's poor financial performance.
4.02     Although the rehabilitation of the urban system has yielded the
anticipated results as witnessed by the improved voltage level of supply (no
voltage reductions are currently experienced in many heavily populated areas)
and more secure supply of power (failures were considerably less frequent than
they were in 1981), no adequate hard data exist to estimate the achieved
reduction in power loss. STEG's failure to accumulate the needed data is due
to the late delivery of the special recording instruments which were financed
under a Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN) extended to the
Government of Tunisia. However, the appropriate instruments and computer
facilities to collect and treat the data have now been received and the
administrative procedures for undertaking a power loss study are in place. It
is expected that this issue would be examined in more detail under the ongoing
Fourth Power Project.
Consultant's Performance and Training
4.03     As agreed, STEG hired the services of a consultant to execute the
study of the distribution system of Tunis. The study was initiated in
November 1981 and was completed in May 1983 -- six months ahead of the
estimaLced datce -- at about 44% of the original cost estimate (US$220,000
compared t' US$500,000).  The performance of the consultant, including the
training of STEG's staff, was exceptionally good.
4.04     Although STEG formulated and submitted to the Bank its training
program for the period 1982-1984, the program was not implemented in its
entirety. The training foreseen within the context of the study of the
distribution system of Tunis was completed with great success, as was the
training undertaken in the training center of Khledia. However, the



-7-
progranmed short duration specialized training of 50 staff members was not
undertak~en because the devaluation of the Tunisian Dinar rendered the per di
allowance stipulated by law inadequate to cover the expenses of trainees
abroad. Although this training would have helped STEG improve its technical
capabilities, its lack did not seriously detract from STEG's operating
capability.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     One of the objectives of the Project was to increase the domestic
selling prices of petroleum products progressively to reach international
levels by January :987 and thus to gradually eliminate the subsidies extended
to petroleum products. During appraisal, it was recognized that while seeking
to achieve this goal of energy pricing a balance would have to be maintained
between the need to maximize internal cash generation, to restrain borrowings
to the minimum and at the same time to avoid disruptive electricity tariff
increases. Accordingly, the loan covenants required STEG: (i) to achieve a
minimum rate of return on revalued assets of 82; and (ii) not to incur any
debt, without the Bank's approval, if its debt service coverage ratio was less
than 1.5 in each year. If the average price of fuels used by STEG increased
by at least 2U% in any given year, starting from 1982, the minimum rate of
return would be reduced in these years from 82 to 62. The covenants farther
provided that Government and STEG would implement revised electricity tariffs
promptly, and in any case not later than two months after the fuel price
increases, so that STEG recovers the total increases in its fuel cost.
Unfortunately, Government and STEG did not live up to the commitments
regarding tariff increases and the rate of return with the result that STEG's
financial position was significantly eroded during the project period. The
problem was compounded by the substantial appreciation of the dollar and the
devaluation of the Tunisian dinar during this period, raising STEG's debt
service obligations considerably. STEG's net internal cash generation as a
percentage of construction requirements, after deduction of customers
contributions, decreased from 87% in 1981 to 172 in 1984 and closed at 27% in
1986. The average net internal cash generation ratio for the project period
was around 302 as compared to 45S estimated at appraisal.  The details of
Government's and STEC's performance vis-a-vis their commitments are given
below.
Tariff Increases
5.02     STEG was not allowed by Government to increase tariffs, as necessary,
during the project period. For example, fuel prices were increased in January
1982 but the tariff increase to compensate for the fuel price increase was
postponed to October 1982 for political reasons. There was a further fuel
price increase on October 1, 1982 but no further tariff increase until a 10%
increase on June 1, 1984. During 1981, 1984 and 1985, Government gave
subsidies to STEG to compensate for the increase in the cost of fuel, notably
gas, which was against the policy objective of gradually eliminating the



-8-
subsidies to consumers on petroleum products. The subsidy was as high as
about 10% of STEG's fuel cost in 1984 and 1985.
Rate of Return
5.03     STEG failed to achieve the agreed rate of return targets from 1983
mainly because of Government's reluctance to authorize tariff increases and
the slower growth of load than estimated at appraisal. The actual returns in
1985 and 1986 fell significantly short of even the reduced target of 52 (under
Power IV).

/ Reduced from 8.0/6.0% under Power IV.
Debt Service Coverage
5.04     Debt service coverage during the project period was generallv
adequate and except in 1986 (when it dropped to 1.2 times) in excess of 1.5
times. However, STEG experienced shortages of cash from time to time. In
March 1983 a Bank mission observed that owing to a shortage of cash, STEG had
not met its debt service obligations from 1981 onwards on two loans 'one of
US$15.0 million due to a French bank and the other of US$13.4 million onlent
to STEG by Government out of USAID funds).
Collection of Receivables
5.05     In view of STEG's past problems in collecting its bills the loan
covenant required STEG to maintain at all times its accounts receivable for
electricity at a level not exceeding three months' sales. The problems
persisted for a long time, the receivables at the end of 1983 being about 110
days' sales. However, as a result of STEG's determined efforts the
receivables have been brought down to reasonable levels; at the end of 1986
they amounted only to 74 days' sales.
Audit
5.06     The loan covenant required STEG to rubmit to the Bank its annual
financial statements, audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
within five months after the end of each fiscal year. With the allocation of
increased computer time to the accounting department, it was hoped during
appraisal that the past delays in the submission of audited accounts would not
recur. However, for one reason or the other (computing problems,-change of
auditors to improve quality or to save foreign exchange, etc.), the delays
persisted. The extent of delays is clear from the following:

/1 Under the Fourth Power Project of August 1984, the time limit for the
submission of audited accounts was increased from five months to six
months.
Submission of Financial Forecasts
5.07     During most of the project period, STEG did not produce financial
forecasts by October 31 of each year, thus frustrating the objective of giving
Government, the Bank and itself an opportunity to assess its earnings
prospects for the next year and to determine the measures required to be taken
to secure the agreed rate of return for that year.
--                  Vi.  ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01     An economic re-evaluation of the project has been done, essentially
on the same basis of the SAR. The re-evaluation is based on constant end-1982
prices.  The main points which highlight the differences between the data and
assumptions used in the SAR and those used in the re-evaluation are summarized
below.
Number of New Connections and Incremental Electricity Sales
6.02     Parallel to the Third Power Project financed by the Bank, STEG
implemented another project financed by the African Development Bank. Through
these projects STEG was able to expand its rural network and considerably
reinforce its urban network which allowed, between 1981-1985, the connection
of a greater number of low voltage consumers (about 252,400) than envisioned
in the SAR. In addition, the average specific consumption per consumer was
also greater than that assumed in the SAR. As a result actual low voltage
incremental sales in 1985 were about 207 GWh compared to 126 GWh assumed in
* the SAR.



- 10 -
Fuel Savings Resulting from Reduced Distribution Losses
6.03     As mentioned in para. 4.02, no adequate hard data exist to estimate
the achieved reduction in power losses stemming from the rehabilitation of the
urban network. Thus in the economic re-evaluation no attempt was made to
calculate the benefits resulting from loss reduction due to the
rehabilitation. However, the direct consequence of connecting considerably
more consumers at a marginal incremental capital cost has reduced the average
cost per consumer which, combined with the greater sales and fuel savings
achieved, contributed positively towards the Internal Economic Rate of Return
on the investment.
Cost of SuPplY
6.04     In 1986/87 the Bank reviewed Tunisia's Public Expenditures.  The
mission which reviewed the electricity subsector calculated among other things
STEG's Long Run Marginal Cost of Supply which for the low voltage was
estimated at:
-  Capacity Charge:                         162 TD/kW/Year
-  Energy Charge  :      Peak                32 milliemes/kWh
Day                 22 milliemes/kWh
Night               20 milliemes/kWh
On the basis of these costs and.assuming that the low voltage consumers' load
factor is 502, the cost of power delivered to the distribution system was
computed.
Net Fuel Savings to Consumers
6.05     Although the domestic price of kerosene increased from 61 TD/ton in
1982 to 216 TD/ton in 1987, in the economic re-evaluation the same net fuel
saving assumed in the SAR to accrue to the domestic consumers who benefitted
under the project, namely 120 milliemes/kWh, was used.
ERR Computation
6.06     Details of the economic re-evaluation are presented in Annex 7.  The
IERR (internal economic rate of return) works out to about 18.52. This is
above the SAR figure for the reasons stated above.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     The project provided the facilities envisaged for the development of
the urban and rural systems. Though the number of villages electrified was
less than expected the number of new customers connected to the system



- 11 -
exceeded the appraisal estimate by 10%. The project was also completed
without any significant delay. Thus the project more than fulfilled the
appraisal expectations regarding the physicai facilities and the social and
economic considerations. However, in regard to the institutional objectives,
the results were mixed. In the financial and accounting area, clearly STEG
has had a set-back although its cash generation during the project period was
still a respectable 30% (paras. 5.01 and 5.06). STEG has, moreover, brought
its collection problem under control.
Lessons Learned
7.02     The Bank's expectations on electricity pricing policies were not
achieved because of lack of political will on the part of the Government.
Consequently, STEG's financial position has continued to deteriorate. The
lesson may be that setting institutional objectives in public utilities
projects to be financed by the Bank should be carried out with a more
realistic appreciation of the political and social framework.
7.03     There is one aspect that needs to be stressed and that is that while
certain aspects of a utility's operations are outside its control (increases
in tariffs, increases in fuel prices, economic conditions in the country
etc.), there are others that are fully within its control such as compilation
of accounts, audit of accounts, revamping of procurement procedures etc. A
utility that is on a path of progress should be expected to show strong
improvement in areas that are primarily within its control, and stringent
standards should therefore be applied to measurement of performance in such
areas. STEG's performance was less than satisfactory in this respect. In the
light of this shortcoming a "contrat programme" has been drafted which is
expected to come into force in 1987, and would set standards on the basia of
which the performance of the utility woalld be measured.

/L  In view of the significant reduction in the foreign cost of the project
arising mainly irom the appreciation of the US dollar, the loan was
reduced by $4.0 million to $37.5 million on November 8, 1984 at the
request of the Tunisians. An amount of $1.375 million remaining
unutilized out of the revised loan amount of $37.5 million after the final
disbursements was cancelled on July 16, 1986.
