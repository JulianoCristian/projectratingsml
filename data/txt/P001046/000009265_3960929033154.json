 of a comprehensive package of educational policy reforms,\n            aimed at preventing a major deterioration of the education\n            system and creating a basis for the sector to contribute to\n            medium-term socioeconomic development, to be achieved\n            through: (a) improving sector strategy formulation and\n            managerial capacity; (b) rationalizing public expenditure in\n            the sector; (c) launching a primary school construction and\n            rehabilitation program; (d) increasing the relevance of\n            education to employment prospects, and the economic needs of\n            the country; and (e) addressing gender issues with programs\n            of special emphasis.  Specific reforms targeted by the\n            operation include measures that address: (a) national policy\n            and strategic framework; (b) general sector management; (c)\n            more efficient and effective resource use and generation;\n            (d) underdevelopment and poor relevance of the educational\n            system; and (e) more efficient use and distribution of staff."}, "docdt": "1990-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
