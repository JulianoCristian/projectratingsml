     Adjustment Credit for Guinea was highly satisfactory. The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            development has been partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was highly satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, complex projects, encompassing a range\n            of interventions, can be successfully undertaken if they are\n            situated within a coherent policy framework and given\n            intensive supervision. Second, the leverage that comes from\n            taking a broad sectoral approach can lead to meaningful\n            changes in resource distribution across and within\n            sub-sectors. Third, the provision of external funds through\n            the budget process, rather than through direct project\n            financing, can result in a situation in which the sector is\n            penalized because of implementation obstacles posed by other\n            ministries. Fourth, the development of a coherent sectoral\n            strategy approved by the Bank can help to attract support\n            from other donors. Fifth, there are poverty implications\n            when sector adjustment programs linked to macroeconomic\n            performance are adopted. Sixth, much greater financial\n            sustainability is achieved when existing financial\n            structures are used. Finally, experimentation and testing\n            should be a part of all operations and much more emphasis\n            should be placed on developing a \"learning\" approach."}, "docdt": "1995-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
