Though most objectives of Education I1 were\n            not met, the project was rated moderately satisfactory\n            because the infrastructure and staff training it provided\n            has increased institutional capacity in the long run. The\n            Education Sector Adjustment Credit was rated highly\n            satisfactory because nearly all its policy conditions were\n            met, and their effect was lasting. Institutional development\n            for the Pre-service Teacher Training Project was rated\n            substantial but for all others it was rated modest.\n            Sustainability was rated likely for all projects. Bank\n            performance was rated unsatisfactory for Education I1 (Bank\n            did not effectively intervene to resolve problems) and\n            satisfactory for the other projects. Borrower performance\n            was rated unsatisfactory for Education 11, highly\n            satisfactory for the Education Sector Adjustment Credit and\n            for the Pre-service Teacher Training Project; it was rated\n            satisfactory for the remaining three. Experience with the\n            projects confirms OED lessons from education projects: 1)\n            Policy dialogue and project activities must stay focused on\n            improving instructional effectiveness and providing students\n            with basic skills. Activities aimed at strengthening\n            management and procuring educational commodities may be\n            necessary but they are not sufficient for the improvement of\n            learning and quality in educational systems. Providing mass\n            education under clearly inadequate instructional conditions\n            may graduate functional illiterates and benefit only a\n            minority of students. 2) Textbooks are crucial providers of\n            information in schools. Procurement methods and plans must\n            aim at making large numbers of textbooks available at an\n            affordable cost and free to the poor. Textbook management\n            must build on the strengths of the private sector and of\n            community associations. 3) Sustained investment in human\n            resources can improve implementation capacity of specific\n            institutions. For example, foreign fellowships for persons\n            who return and devote their career to the agencies they were\n            expected to serve may result in a considerable cadre of\n            trained and competent staff. 4) In earlier decades, the Bank\n            supported vocational training schools in many countries,\n            which often function with few students, high unit costs, and\n            outdated equipment and curricula. Bank investments will be\n            best used if policy dialogue is focused toward modernizing\n            courses, generating income, and catering to the populations\n            likely to be interested in vocational training."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
