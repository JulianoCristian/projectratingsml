activity, while streamlining\n            the public sector and restoring financial stability to the\n            country. This operation is built on policies described in\n            the first Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1991-1993 and is\n            designed to address the most urgent issues facing Comoros --\n            a small Franc-zone country with a weak administration and\n            limited growth potential. Specifically, the operation will\n            support policy measures to: (a) streamline the civil\n            service; (b) withdraw the state from productive and\n            commercial activities, and rationalize the remaining public\n            enterprises; (c) establish a process of public expenditure\n            programming and ensure a \"safety net\" of social\n            expenditure; (d) improve the incentives framework for\n            private investment; and (e) develop local institutional\n            capacity in economic management."}, "docdt": "1991-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
