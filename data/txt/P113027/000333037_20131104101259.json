The main beneficiaries will\n            be the communes and communities supported during first phase\n            of the Community Development Program Support Project (155)\n            plus 167 non covered communes, in which 110 in the five new\n            regions. The reallocation is necessary to increase resources\n            allocated to category 2 of the financing agreement. Indeed,\n            the additional resources will enable the project to cover\n            the overdraw done in category two to finance the first\n            installments of grants (allocations) to 54 communes in the\n            regions of the Northwest, Littoral, South West, Adamaoua and\n            Far North, and the updating of Communal Development Plans\n            (CDP) of ten former communes of the first phase of Project\n            (PNDPI). Indeed, this reallocation of funds has been agreed\n            with the government during the mid-term review of the\n            project in order to account for changes in the costs of some\n            goods and services. The category overdraws was authorized by\n            the task team during supervision mission while a formal\n            restructuring is being processed. The reallocation among\n            categories will be done as follow: SDR 1,400,000 will be\n            transferred from category one to category two and SDR\n            1,300,000 will be transferred from category three to\n            category two.
