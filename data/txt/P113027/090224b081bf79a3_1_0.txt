                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR has been updated based on findings of (i) the semi-monthly meetings between the Bank task team and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that are regularly held to assess
                         implementation progress, and (ii) the identification mission of the third phase of the project that was conducted from March 18 to 29, 2013.

                         1. The credit became effective on January 29, 2010. The overall performance of the project is rated Satisfactory (S). Progress towards achievement of the Project Development
                         Objectives (PDO) is rated Satisfactory (S). Compared to end-of-project targets, three out of the six Outcomes Indicators (OIs) have been achieved at 100, 157 and 386 per cent

                         respectively. Three other OIs have recorded achievement rates of 11, 45 and 65 per cent. Based on the above, the Project Development Objectives will be likely achieved by the
                         project closing date, scheduled for the November 30, 2013.

                         2. As of March 29, 2013, 178 out of 170 Communal Development Plans (CDPs) have been prepared (achievement: 105 per cent). This includes 87 CDPs that originally were to have

                         been prepared during the first phase of the Project (CDPSP-I), and 91 CDPs of newly-engaged communes in the regions that have been added under the second phase (CDPSP-II).

                         3. With regard to capacity building, out of the 658 staff (two staff for each commune: one financial staff and one technical) that will be recruited to support communes, 413 staff (63
                         per cent) have been hired and are working in 251 communes. These staff are responsible for: (i) tracking fiscal assets; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The recruitment
                         process of these staff for other communes is in progress.

                         4. As of April 5, 2013, the disbursement rate is satisfactory: (i) 92 percent disbursement for IDA funding; and (ii) 79 percent disbursement for counterpart funding.

                         5. With regard to the status of triggers to move to the third phase, two indicators out of the four triggers have been met, including: (i) draft laws and decrees on decentralization
                         prepared during the first phase of the project will have been adopted and promulgated to pave the way for the improved intergovernmental fiscal transfer; (ii ) at least 90 percent of
                         communes supported by the project (292) will have reflected priority investments in the communal development plans and budgets. For the indicator relating to satisfaction of
                         beneficiary's communes with service delivery, a pilot citizen control (scorecard) was conducted in ten communes and a survey on the satisfaction of beneficiaries is underway in
                         project's intervention areas. Regarding the trigger on the preparation and approval by the Government of the Charter on Decentralization, the draft Charter was prepared and is
                         awaiting government approval.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team agreed with the PCU on the following key decisions:
                         1. The Project Coordination Unit must complete the studies and evaluations of the second phase in progress before the end of June 2013 in order to provide the information
                         necessary for the preparation of the third phase of the project. These studies and evaluations are the following: (i) technical and financial audit of the project, (ii) project impact
                         assessment, (iii) evaluation of the level of satisfaction of beneficiary communes, (iv) assessment of the functioning of the management committees of municipal investments.
                         2. A Level II restructuring will be carried out to reallocate the IDA credit proceeds, to account for unexpected changes in the costs of some goods and services.
                         3. An agreement will be established between the PCU and the Ministry of Defense to facilitate the implementation of project activities in the Bakassi Peninsula.
                         4. Contracts will be established between the PCU and the decentralized public services, under the oversight of regional delegates of the Ministry of Economy and Planning

                         (MINEPAT), for the purpose of improving the participation of sectoral services in the implementation of the program at regional and local levels.
                         5. Coordination will be strengthened between the Bank-financial instrument support to CDPSP-II and the upcoming French Development Agency financing instrument which is under
                         preparation, in order to better ensure complementarity/synergy between the two instruments.
                         6. The Government will inform the Bank about the outcome of its investigation into concerns expressed by a former project staff member concerning alleged unprofessional conduct
                         by the National Coordinator.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
