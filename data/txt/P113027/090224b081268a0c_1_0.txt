This ISR has been updated based on findings of (i) the semi-monthly meetings between the Bank task team and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that are regularly held to assess
3    implementation progress, (ii) the progress report prepared by the PCU and (iii) the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the project, that was implemented from December 28, 2011 to January
13, 2012. The Bank team expresses his appreciation to the French Development Agency (FDA) for having actively participated in the MTR and also to German Cooperation for their
participation.

1. The Credit became effective on January 29, 2010. The overall performance of the project is rated as satisfactory (5). Progress towards achievement of the Project Development
Objectives (PDO) is rated Satisfactory (S), thanks to progress achieved (see Results Framework section) since the last supervision mission that was carried out in December 2010.
Three out of the six Outcomes Indicators (Ols) have been achieved at 161, 175 and 511 percent, one 01 has been achieved at 57 percent, and another at 21 percent. The sixth 01
will be measured by June 2010 according to schedule. Based on the above, the project development objective will be likely achieved by the end of the Project, scheduled for late
November 2013.
3 2. As of January 2012, 68 Communal Development Plans (CDPs) that originally were to have been prepared during the first phase of the Project (CDPSP-1) have now been delivered.
U) These CDDs were not completed during CDPSP-1 and therefore were rescheduled for preparation during the second phase (CDPSP-ll). In addition, a first set of 34 new CDPs has
0
-6  been prepared, out of the 110 new Communal Development Plans (CDPs) planned in the four new regions to be covered by the second phase. The remaining 76 new CDPs are
U   being prepared according to schedule and will be completed by end of March 2012.
2   3. With regard to Capacity Building for communes, out of the 658 staff (two staff for each commune: one financial staff and one technical) that will be recruited to support communes,
J    515 staff (78 percent) have been hired and are working in 251 communes. These staff are responsible for: (i) tracking fiscal assets; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The
remaining 143 communes have not yet signed conventions with the PCU and hence cannot yet receive the staff to be recruited by the project to support them; it is expected that the
remaining conventions will be signed in the coming months, according to schedule.
4. As of January 17, 2012, the disbursement rate is satisfactory: (i) 52.19 percent disbursement for IDA funding; and (ii) 34.8 percent disbursement for counterpart funding.

Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
The Bank team agreed with the PCU on the following key decisions:
1. The project had previously reported on indicators using baseline values that reflected progress achieved during the first phase of the Project; i.e., the current values being reported
during the current phase reflected the cumulative progress of the two phases. Following guidance received from AFTOS, starting with this ISR, progress achieved against the
performance indicators will be reported with the baselines reset to their values at the beginning of the current phase (CDPSP-ll), so as to show progress achieved during this phase
alone. For that reason, the actual values for many Ols and lOls are lower in the current ISR than in the previous ISR (see the Results Framework section).
2. A Level II restructuring will be carried out to reallocate the IDA credit proceeds, to account for unexpected changes in the costs of some goods and services.
0
O    3. The project implementation manual will be updated to allow per diems to be paid to staff of sectoral ministries involved in the implementation of Project activities. These payments
0   will be in strict compliance with the current official rules and procedures in Cameroon with regard to the financing of mission costs for civil servants.
U)  4. An agreement will be established between the PCU and the Ministry of Defense to allow the Project to carry out its activities in the Bakassi Peninsula.
0
-Z   5. Contracts will be established between the PCU and the decentralized public services, under the oversight of regional delegates of the Ministry of Economy and Planning
.U)  (MINEPAT), for the purpose of improving the participation of sectoral services in the implementation of the program at regional and local levels.
6. The Bank Team and the PCU will implement an in-depth review of the project financial management function to identify and eventually mitigate risks related to the lack of clarity
regarding roles and responsibilities of beneficiaries in managing IDA funds.
7. The coordination will be strengthened between the Bank-financial instrument support to CDPSP-ll and the upcoming FDA financing instrument which is under preparation, in order
to better ensure complementarity/synergy between the two instruments.
8. The Government will inform the Bank about the outcome of its investigation into concerns expressed by a former project staff member concerning alleged unprofessional conduct
by the National Coordinator.
