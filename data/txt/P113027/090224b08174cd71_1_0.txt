                         This ISR has been updated based on findings of (i) the semi-monthly meetings between the Bank task team and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that are regularly held to assess
                         implementation progress, and (ii) the July progress report prepared by the PCU.

                         1. The credit became effective on January 29, 2010. The overall performance of the project is rated Satisfactory (S). Progress towards achievement of the Project Development
                         Objectives (PDO) is rated Satisfactory (S), thanks to progress achieved (see Results Framework section) since the last Mid-Term Review mission that was implemented from

                         December 28, 2011 to January 13, 2012. Compared to end-of-project targets, two out of the six Outcomes Indicators (OIs) have been achieved at 101 and 253 per cent. Three OIs
                         have recorded achievement rates of 11, 41 and 52 per cent. For the indicator relating to improving the coverage of basic social services, data collection is in progress. Implementation
                         is progressing satisfactorily, suggesting that the Project Development Objectives will be achieved by the project closing date set for November 30, 2013.

                         2. As of June 30, 2012, 162 out of 170 Communal Development Plans (CDPs) have been prepared (achievement: 77 per cent). This includes 86 CDPs that originally were to have
                         been prepared during the first phase of the Project (CDPSP-I), and 76 CDPs of newly-engaged communes in the regions that have been added under the second phase (CDPSP-II).
                         Preparation of the remaining CDPs is in progress.

                         3. With regard to capacity building, out of the 658 staff (two staff for each commune: one financial staff and one technical) that will be recruited to support communes, 517 staff (79
                         per cent) have been hired and are working in 251 communes. These staff are responsible for: (i) tracking fiscal assets; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The remaining 143
                         communes have not yet signed conventions with the PCU and hence cannot yet receive the staff to be recruited by the project; it is expected that the remaining conventions will be
                         signed in the coming months, according to schedule.

                         4. As of August 13, 2012, the disbursement rate is satisfactory: (i) 60 percent disbursement for IDA funding; and (ii) 74.2 percent disbursement for counterpart funding.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team agreed with the PCU on the following key decisions:
                         1. A Level II restructuring will be carried out to reallocate the IDA credit proceeds, to account for unexpected changes in the costs of some goods and services.
                         3. The project implementation manual will be updated to allow per diems to be paid to staff of sectoral ministries involved in the implementation of Project activities. These payments
                         will be in strict compliance with the current official rules and procedures in Cameroon with regard to the financing of mission costs for civil servants.
                         4. An agreement will be established between the PCU and the Ministry of Defense to allow the Project to carry out its activities in the Bakassi Peninsula.
                         5. Contracts will be established between the PCU and the decentralized public services, under the oversight of regional delegates of the Ministry of Economy and Planning
                         (MINEPAT), for the purpose of improving the participation of sectoral services in the implementation of the program at regional and local levels.
                         6. Coordination will be strengthened between the Bank-financial instrument support to CDPSP-II and the upcoming FDA financing instrument which is under preparation, in order to
                         better ensure complementarity/synergy between the two instruments.
                         7. The Government will inform the Bank about the outcome of its investigation into concerns expressed by a former project staff member concerning alleged unprofessional conduct
                         by the National Coordinator.
