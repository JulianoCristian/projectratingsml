                         1. The credit became effective on January 29, 2010. The overall performance of the project is rated Satisfactory (S). Progress towards achievement of the Project Development
                         Objectives (PDO) is rated Satisfactory (S). Compared to end-of-project targets, four out of the six Outcomes Indicators (OIs) have been achieved at 111, 121, 157 and 490 per cent
                         respectively. Two other OIs have recorded achievement rates of 17 and 91 per cent. Based on the above, the Project Development Objectives will be likely achieved by the project

                         2. As of November 21, 2013, 178 out of 170 Communal Development Plans (CDPs) have been prepared (achievement: 105 per cent). This includes 87 CDPs that originally were to
                         have been prepared during the first phase of the Project (CDPSP-I), and 91 CDPs of newly-engaged communes in the regions that have been added under the second phase
                         (CDPSP-II).

                         3. With regard to capacity building, out of the 658 staff (two staff for each commune: one financial staff and one technical) that will be recruited to support communes, 505 staff (77
                         per cent) have been hired and are working in 251 communes. These staff are responsible for: (i) tracking fiscal assets; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The recruitment
                         process of these staff for other communes is in progress.

                         4. As of November 26, 2013, the disbursement rate is satisfactory: (i) 100 percent disbursement for IDA funding; and (ii) 79 percent disbursement for counterpart funding.

                         5. With regard to the status of triggers to move to the third phase, three indicators out of the four triggers have been met, including: (i) draft laws and decrees on decentralization
                         prepared during the first phase of the project will have been adopted and promulgated to pave the way for the improved intergovernmental fiscal transfer; (ii ) at least 90 percent of
                         communes supported by the project (292) will have reflected priority investments in the communal development plans and budgets and; (iii) at least 80 percent (260) of the
                         beneficiary's communes will be satisfied with service delivery. Regarding the trigger on the preparation and approval by the Government of the Charter on Decentralization, the draft
                         Charter was prepared and is awaiting government approval.

                         6. Following the recommendations of the MTR, the project was restructured at level II and restructuring became effective on October 30, 2013. The restructuring did not entail any
                         change in the PDO, Project design, scope, or expected outcomes.The proposed reallocation represents a reallocation of 10 percent of the IDA Credit proceeds. As a result, the
                         restructuring is considered a minor change under BP13.05 on Project Supervision and may be approved at the Country Director level. The main objective of the reallocation was to
                         increase resources allocated to category 2 of the financing agreement. Indeed, the additional resources will enable the project to cover the overdraw done in category 2 to finance the
                         first installments of grants (allocations) to 54 Communes in the regions of the Northwest, Littoral, South West, Adamaoua and Far North, and the updating of Communal Development
                         Plans (CDP) of 10 former Communes of the first phase of Project (PNDPI). The category overdraws was authorized by the Task team during supervision mission while a formal
                         restructuring is being processed. The reallocation among categories was done as follow: SDR 1,400,000 were transferred from category 1 to category 2 and SDR 1,300,000 were
                         transferred from category 3 to category 2.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team agreed with the PCU on the following key decisions:
                         1. The Project Coordination Unit must complete the studies and evaluations of the second phase in progress before the end of November 2013 in order to provide the information
                         necessary for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the project. These studies and evaluations are the following: (i) technical and financial audit of the
                         project and, (ii) project impact assessment.
                         2. Contracts will be established between the PCU and the decentralized public services, under the oversight of regional delegates of the Ministry of Economy and Planning
                         (MINEPAT), for the purpose of improving the participation of sectoral services in the implementation of the program at regional and local levels.
                         3. Coordination will be strengthened between the Bank-financial instrument support to CDPSP-II and the upcoming French Development Agency financing instrument which is under
                         preparation, in order to better ensure complementarity/synergy between the two instruments.
                         4. The Government will inform the Bank about the outcome of its investigation into concerns expressed by a former project staff member concerning alleged unprofessional conduct
                         by the National Coordinator. Indeed, a staff member complained of being unfairly dismissed by the Project Coordinator.
