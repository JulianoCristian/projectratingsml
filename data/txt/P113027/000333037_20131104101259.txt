                       PROJECT PHASE-II
                            P113027
                    CREDIT NUMBER 4593-CM
                                 Restructuring Paper

1.      The proposed reallocation represents a 10.17 percent of Credit proceeds. It does
not affect the project design, scope or expected outcomes. Based on Operational Policy
OP/BP13.05, this corresponds to a Level II Restructuring (CD level approval). Proceeds
for Cameroon, CM-Community Development PROGRAM SUPPORT PROJECT
PHASE-II, Credit No 4593-CM, will be reallocated as follow:

  Category of Expenditure         Amount of the financing         Change     Percentage of
                                         allocated              (Expressed   Expenditures
                                   (Expressed in SDR)            in SDR)         to be
                                  Original       Proposed                      financed
                                  Amount        Reallocation                 (inclusive of
                                                                                Taxes)

2. The overall implementation progress of the PNDPII (Cameroon, CM-Community
   Development Program Support Project Phase-II) is satisfactory. Progress towards
   achievement of the Project Development Objective is rated satisfactory. As of
   October 10, 2013, the disbursement rate of IDA credit stood at 100 percent.
   Moreover, the whole process of implementation of PNDPII is progressing
   satisfactorily and suggests that the program results will be achieved by the project
   closing date set for November 30, 2013.

3. The proposed reallocation is necessary to increase resources allocated to category 2 of
   the financing agreement. Indeed, the additional resources will enable the project to
   cover the overdraw done in category 2 to finance the first installments of grants
   (allocations) to 54 Communes in the regions of the Northwest, Littoral, South West,
   Adamaoua and Far North, and the updating of Communal Development Plans (CDP)
   of 10 former Communes of the first phase of Project (PNDPI). Indeed, this
   reallocation of funds has been agreed with the government during the Mid-Term
   Review of the project in order to account for changes in the costs of some goods and
   services. The category overdraws was authorized by the Task team during supervision
   mission while a formal restructuring is being processed. The reallocation among

                                              1
   categories will be done as follow: SDR 1,400,000 will be transferred from category 1
   to category 2 and SDR 1,300,000 will be transferred from category 3 to category 2.

4. The restructuring does not involve the extension of the closing date.
