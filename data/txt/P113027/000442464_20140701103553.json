risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the communal\n            development plan (CDP) can be considered as a reference tool\n            for planning and dialogue to support local development, but\n            its level of ownership by line ministries remains weak.\n            Funding and implementation of multi sectoral development\n            priorities can improve access to basic social services, but\n            mobilization of beneficiaries contributions remains\n            insufficient and the demand for economic investments very\n            important. The funding allocation system improves resource\n            management by municipalities. The citizen control mechanism\n            improves communes' governance. Governance remains an\n            important challenge for the promotion of local development\n            in Cameroon. Decentralization is a very long-term process,\n            exceeding project deadlines despite the use of an adaptable\n            program loan (APL)."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
