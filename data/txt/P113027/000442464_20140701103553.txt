I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

(a) Local Development and Decentralization in Cameroon
1.      For more than a decade, the Government of Cameroon (GOC) has emphasized
that rural development in the country depends primarily on local (i.e., provincial and
commune) services and investments. Decentralization of government administration is
crucial to providing these services and facilitating the financing of local priorities.

2.      In a bid to promote local development and implement the decentralization agenda,
the government adopted community-based approaches, using a participatory procedure to
get beneficiaries actively involved in identifying their own development priorities and in
planning interventions over the long term. Therefore, on February 20, 2004, the GOC in
collaboration with the World Bank and other development partners prepared the
Community Development Program (PNDP Programme National de Développement
Participatif), implemented using an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument with
three four-year phases. The program’s long-term vision is that rural communes will
collaborate with communities in the planning and control of local development by: (i)
identifying and managing infrastructure and service needs; (ii) managing the resources
needed to establish and maintain community infrastructures; and (iii) promoting good
governance. The first phase of the program closed on November 30, 2009. Therefore, this
ICR pertains to the second four-year phase of the APL.

(b) Poverty and Rural Situation
3.       Despite significant progress in fighting poverty between 1996 and 2008, poverty
still affects a large share of Cameroon's population, and poverty remains a major concern
for the Cameroonian authorities.

4.      In 2004, Cameroon’s GDP achieved a growth rate of 3.7 percent, which
corresponded to an increase of about 1.0 percent in per capita income given the
population growth rate of 2.7 percent. Thus, the GDP growth rate of 2.0 percent in 2005
resulted in negative per capita income growth. In 2006, the situation turned slightly
positive again, as the real GDP growth rate rose to 3.5 percent, partly because of strong
oil exports. In 2008, the GDP growth rate reached 3.9 percent, up from 3.5 percent in
2007. However, overall economic growth has not contributed significantly to reducing
poverty in monetary terms in recent years. The GOC’s “second-generation” strategy to
fight poverty aims to find means other than economic growth, such as provision of
improved services, to ensure a more equitable distribution of earned revenues and more
significant poverty reduction.

(c) Government Objectives and Strategies in the Sector
5.      The government’s ownership of and commitment to the PNDP is evidenced by
the fact that it was presented in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as one of
the main instruments of the GOC’s decentralization and local development strategy. As
mentioned, the GOC has demonstrated its political will by forcefully implementing the
decentralization agenda and by pursuing substantial poverty reduction in rural areas
throughout the country. To promote local development, it has adopted community-based

                                            1
approaches, using a participatory procedure to get beneficiaries actively involved in
identifying their own development priorities and in planning interventions over the long
term. This process has resulted in local or communal development plans (CDPs) that
specify priorities among subprojects to be implemented.

6.     The CDP is a powerful tool for selecting priority investments and forming a
global and shared vision on local development at the communal and community level.
The GOC’s decree of November 2008, which created and organized Cameroon’s 10
regions, confirmed its commitment to use CDPs to improve implementation of its
decentralization agenda.

(d) Rationale for Bank Assistance
7.      The Community Development Program Support Project is the World Bank’s key
instrument to support the GOC’s efforts to promote local development and
decentralization. The design of PNDP in three four-year phases demonstrates the Bank’s
long-term support to the government’s agenda for local development and decentralization.
The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is aligned with the government’s
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and with its goal of poverty reduction through
delivery of basic services, private sector-led growth, and improved local governance.
PNDP I (the first phase) achieved its objectives and all triggers for the second phase were
essentially achieved, thus allowing the Bank to move to the next stage.

8.      PNDP I covered communes in five of Cameroon’s 10 regions, and it was planned
that PNDP II would scale up the approach to cover the remaining five regions. The
success of PNDP I led to high demand from the communes in all regions for the
government to move to the second phase to allow them to benefit from the Project’s
social, economic, and environmental impacts.

9.      Justification for the World Bank’s participation in the second phase of PNDP was
based on the same reasons observed at the predecessor project’s appraisal, that is: (i) the
Bank has extensive multisectoral experience in Cameroon, allowing it to participate in
efforts to harmonize support for community action plans; (ii) the Bank has acquired
broad experience with community-driven development projects in Africa and is thus in a
good position to draw lessons from similar development efforts; and (iii) PNDP II seeks
to address the government’s long-standing decentralization agenda, facilitating
development or improving the operational framework and capacity of communes to
effectively manage their own development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

10.    The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the delivery
of specified basic social services (health, education, water and sanitation) in targeted
communes and to extend the ongoing process in support of decentralization to new
regions. The main beneficiaries were the communes and communities supported during
PNDP I (155) plus 167 non-covered communes, of which 110 were in the five remaining
regions.

11.    The original outcome indicators were the following:

                                            2
For service delivery: At least 5 percent increase in the rate of coverage of basic social
services in one of the following four sectors for eligible communes (147) having
implemented subprojects: health, education, water, and better road access to markets and
social services (number) (as measured in the number of users over the baseline situation):
     Students in Project area with improved access to education facilities (number);
     People in Project area with improved access to health care facilities (number);
     People with access to an improved water source (number);
     Households in Project area with better road access to markets and social services
        (number).

For scaling-up of the program: Eligible communes (number) in the five new regions that
have prepared CDPs of a quality acceptable to the Association (%).

Key Performance Indicators
12.   The main indicators for Project outputs (for details, see Outputs by Component in
Annex 2) used to evaluate Project achievements included:
     Communes benefiting from the Project grant (number) – disaggregated by new
      and old; new CDPs implemented (number);
     Communes supported by the Project that have reflected priority investments in the
      CDPs and budgets (%);
     Subprojects that have implemented the required environmental and social risk
      mitigation measures and are functional (%);
     Improved community water points constructed in rural areas served by the Project
      (number);
     Classrooms built and/or rehabilitated (number);
     Health facilities constructed, renovated, or equipped (number);
     Roads rehabilitated, rural (km);
     Land use management plans prepared (number);


                                              3
      Communes with a public information and citizen control mechanism of grant
       management in place and operational (number);
      External financial audit reports are produced on time and without any major
       reservations (%);
      At least one technical and financial audit on the use of the grant and the quality of
       achievements is carried out randomly each year (Yes/No);
      A systematic evaluation system (scorecards) for the beneficiaries on the quality of
       procurements is put in place (Yes/No);
      A database on the quality of technical service providers (TSPs) is put in place and
       is made available for public access (Yes/No);
      Biannual monitoring/evaluation reports are produced within the agreed time
       frames (Yes/No).

13.     In addition to the PDO and key performance indicators, four triggers were
identified for phase 3 of the PNDP:
     The draft laws and decrees on decentralization prepared during the first phase of
        the Project will have been adopted and promulgated to pave the way for improved
        intergovernmental fiscal transfers. These are the law on local taxes, the law on the
        financial regime of communes, and the decree on the organizational chart and
        staffing of communes;
     At least 90 percent (292) of communes supported by the Project will have
        reflected priority investments in their CDPs and budgets;
     At least 80 percent (260) of the beneficiary communes will be satisfied with
        service delivery (as measured by monitoring scorecards and independent technical
        audits); and
     The ‘‘Decentralization Charter” will be approved by the GOC.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

14.      The PDO and key indicators were not revised. However, during Project
implementation, baseline values were set to zero and target values for related indicators
were accordingly amended in accordance with the PAD’s guidelines (see footnotes No. 5
and 6 on the arrangements for results monitoring, pages 36-37 of the PAD). In fact, given
that the PNDP is a three-phase APL, the implementation progress of the Project was
initially evaluated based on indicators with baselines reflecting the achievements of the
first phase of the Project (PNDP I), while the results obtained reflect the cumulative
progress of both Phase I and II. This presentation of the baselines and target values did
not facilitate the identification of PNDP II’s achievements. Faced with this situation, the
Africa Regional Core Operational Services Department (AFTOS) unit advised the task
team to set all baseline values to zero and subtract the achievements of the first phase
from the initial target values of the performance indicators of the second phase. Therefore,
all baseline values of the indicators have been set to zero and the target values for some
indicators have been modified to reflect only the achievements of the second phase.
These indicators are: Students in Project area with improved access to education
facilities; People in Project area with improved access to health care facilities; People
with access to an improved water source; Households in Project area with better road
access to markets and social services; Improved community water points constructed in
rural areas served by the Project; Classrooms built and/or rehabilitated; Health facilities
                                              4
constructed, renovated, or equipped; and Roads rehabilitated, rural. From July 22, 2011,
the Project reported a zero baseline value and a net progress value based on progress
made under PNDP II. Thus, from Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) No. 6
to this ICR, all baseline values used are equal to zero to take into account only the results
associated with PNDP II. Table 2 shows the revised baseline and target values of
performance indicators. For this ICR, PNDP II results were compared against the revised
targets of the performance indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15.     The main beneficiaries were the communes and communities supported during
PNDP I (155) plus 170 new communes. In these communes, the Project interventions
contributed to empower rural communities in planning, implementing, and overseeing
priority activities defined in their development plans. Efforts were made to directly target
vulnerable groups, including women and indigenous communities (Pygmies). The
targeted populations benefited from improved basic social services (education, health,
water, and sanitation), and improved rural infrastructure (rural roads, bridges, rural
markets, storage facilities, and rural community centers).

In addition to providing assistance to communities for the development of local or CDPs,
the Project contributed financial resources to finance activities or subprojects contained
in these plans. Local plans were developed through broad consultations between
community stakeholders in accordance with sectoral priorities set at the national level.
Local service providers (LSPs) were hired by the Project to provide technical support to
communities in preparing development plans and subprojects. The process involved the
participation of NGOs, decentralized technical ministries, and communal staff.
Communal agents benefitted from capacity strengthening under the Project, which helped
them play a more active role in the local development processes by improving the
recovery of local taxes and overall budget preparation and execution.

1.5 Original Components

16.    The three main components of the Project were described as follows at appraisal:

Component 1: Local Development Support: Appraisal: US$65.57 million (IDA-
US$25.63 million; Government-US$32.94 million; Beneficiaries-US$7.00 million)
Actual: US$68.69 (IDA-US$26.75 million; Government-US$36.62 million;
Beneficiaries-US$5.32 million).
17.    Component 1 aimed to help improve the socioeconomic conditions, increase the
productivity of the natural resource base, and increase the incomes of the population in
the communes supported by the Project. Achieving these goals required putting in place
various infrastructures and socioeconomic investments. This component channeled grants
to communes to co-finance their proposed investments (subprojects): either a CDP
preparation activity or a CDP-subproject.

18.     PNDP II focused on communes. In contrast to PNDP I, under which communities
as well as communes prepared development plans, under PNDP II the CDP was the sole
local planning tool, and the priorities of grassroots community organizations were taken
into account in this document. Multidisciplinary teams composed of representatives of
seven decentralized units of technical ministries or LSPs helped communes prepare the
plans, using a participatory approach. The decentralized service units of the sectoral
ministries ensured that the CDPs and their subprojects complied with national standards
and policies. The municipal council in each commune examined and approved the CDP,
and then transmitted the plan to the Divisional Officer (a representative of the ministry
supervising the communes) for administrative validation.



                                             7
19.     To ensure equity, Project authorities allocated funds to communes annually, using
criteria agreed upon beforehand. The annual allocation was determined in accordance
with the following factors: the demographics of the population, the poverty level of the
commune (administrative account, Household Survey-ECAM-II, 2007), the existing local
fiscal system and the financing plan of the decentralized administration, and the size of
the commune. The allocation covered the following: (a) expenditures for CDP
preparation activities: (i) LSP contracts and the travel expenses of multidisciplinary
sectoral teams for the preparation of the CDP; (ii) technical and environmental studies
related to the design of feasibility studies for CDP subprojects (about 4 percent of the
estimated micro-project (MP) grants based on lessons learnt from PNDP I); (iii) payment
of salaries of select commune support staff on a gradually declining scale; and (iv) partial
payment for those meetings of the municipal council that examine and approve
development plans and subprojects, and for the sessions of the commune procurement
commissions (for a maximum period of two years); and (b) expenditures for
implementation of CDP-subprojects, including quality control (about 1 percent of the MP
grants). The commune was notified of its allocated amount well ahead of time to allow it
to be integrated into its budget. Depending on the allocation for the implementation of the
CDP-subprojects, the commune executive board prepared an annual investment plan in
accordance with the investment priorities of the commune (including the priority
subprojects to be financed under the grants).

20.    The allocation to communes was released in three steps. The first payment
covered 100 percent of (a) as described above, while the second and third payments
covered 60 percent and 40 percent of (b), respectively. Provision of the third payment
was subject to approval of the participatory monitoring of subprojects’ implementation
progress. The conditions for providing the grants and the eligibility criteria for
subprojects were described in detail in the Project Implementation Manual.

21.    PNDP II strived to make the funds transfer flow to communes easier than was the
case under PNDP I. The funds were henceforth transferred from the Project’s Designated
Account directly to a commune’s account, opened at a local bank for this purpose. This
account was operated jointly by the mayor of the commune, the “Receveur Municipal,”
and the PNDP regional coordinator, requiring the signatures of all three. To ensure
adequate financial management and disbursement arrangements were in place for the
communes, the commune designated/recruited a local accountant to maintain adequate
books of accounts and prepare reports needed to monitor the commune’s activities.
Transfers of the funds to a commune were not made until said accountant was identified
and trained. The commune’s budget summary, the technical and financial Project
execution reports, and the expenditure statements on the communal joint account were
posted on the commune’s information board and made available to the public for
transparency and good governance at the local level.

Component 2: Support to Communes within the decentralization framework:
Appraisal: US$18.83 million (IDA- US$7.51 million; Government - US$12.05
million). Actual: US$16.43 million (IDA- US$6.50 million; Government - US$9.93
million).
22.    This component aimed to strengthen institutional capacities in support of the
decentralization process. It also provided assistance for the implementation of capacity-
building activities for communes and other local stakeholders, such as LSPs and

                                             8
multidisciplinary teams of the sectoral ministries, to enable them to assume an effective
role as promoters of local development. The component was divided into two sub-
components:

Subcomponent 2.1: Institutional support to the decentralization process: Appraisal:
US$8.78million (IDA- US$3.37 million; Government- US$5.41 million).
23.    This subcomponent made it possible to: (a) improve the legal and regulatory
framework through specific studies and activities and improve implementation of the
Project at the commune and intercommunal levels; (b) help build the case for
decentralization (e.g., by using M&E data on land use planning proactively to inform the
public about the benefits of decentralization); and (c) improve budget management to
increase performance of local tax collection for a sustained decentralization funding
mechanism.

24.    The Project supported specific studies and the preparation of draft decrees for the
decentralization laws mentioned previously (paragraph 3) and finalization of the
Decentralization Charter. It also financed workshops for finalization of the decrees,
including relevant consultancy services for the workshops, and dissemination of the
enacted laws and decrees. Furthermore, the subcomponent financed the acquisition of
small cartography equipment and consultant services required for mapping of communes.
The Project also financed study tours on decentralization and local development for the
Technical Secretariat of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Local Services and the
Mayors’ Association. Finally, it assisted the Ministry of Territorial Administration and
Decentralization (MINATD) to develop and deploy financial and accounting
management software for communes.

Subcomponent 2.2: Capacity-building: Appraisal: US$10.78 million (IDA- US$4.14
million; Government – US$6.64 million).
25.     Strengthening the operational capacities of communes. Under this
subcomponent, several capacity-building activities for the communes were carried out,
such as: (a) financing of the development of an operations manual or guidelines for
communes to improve their fiduciary management capacities (including procurement and
financial control and reporting and the associated risk-mitigation measures); (b)
organization of training workshops and study tours for cross-learning and sharing of good
practices, through paired visits between high- and low-performing communes and study
tours to neighboring countries for elected local representatives, communal procurement
commissions, and community-based organizations; and (c) promotion of nationwide
competitions for local governments on best practices on CDPs and on enhancing good
governance and transparency.

26.     Capacity building for local stakeholders. This activity aimed at strengthening
and enhancing the skills of the participants other than those of the communal institutions
– that is, LSPs, multidisciplinary teams, and TSPs – to enable them to support communes
efficiently in the local development process. Workshops were organized to inform all
stakeholders about the objectives and strategy of the Project and to equip ordinary
citizens to participate in planning, implementing, and monitoring local development
actions. To facilitate such capacity building, the Project financed technical assistance for
training of LSPs and multidisciplinary teams to improve their quality of service.
Furthermore, the Project promoted cooperation among the Project Coordination Units,

                                             9
the decentralized offices of the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection (MINEP),
and other relevant sector ministries, and helped organize an environmental training
program for members of municipal councils, divisional administrative staff, and Project
staff.

27.     The Project funded: (a) acquisition of computer equipment for communes; (b)
training of communal development and finance staff; (c) publication and dissemination of
a participatory planning guide, as well as a guide for procurement procedures; (d)
environmental training for members of municipal councils, divisional administrative staff,
and Project staff; and (e) nine study tours and training on decentralization and local
development for LSPs, multidisciplinary teams, TSPs, and local stakeholders other than
commune authorities.

Component 3: Coordination, management, communication, monitoring and
evaluation: Appraisal: US$17.87 million (IDA US$6.86 million; Government -
US$11.01 million). Actual: US$14.60 million (IDA US$8.40 million; Government -
US$6.20 million).
28.     This component aimed to facilitate: (a) administrative, technical, and financial
management of the program; (b) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure
efficient support to communes for local development; (c) effective contractual
arrangements with communes, sectoral ministries, and TSP/private-sector operators,
NGOs (TSPs), including acquisition of the equipment necessary for implementing the
program; (d) M&E of the performance and the financial, environmental, and social
impacts of the program (including developing monitoring scorecards to assess
beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the services provided by communes); and (e) development
of communication activities to publicize and disseminate Project implementation tools
and local development potential and practices.

29.     The integrated financial management software was upgraded with additional tools
to enable permanent access to accounting system information in the regions for analysis
and to ensure timely synchronized consolidation of accounts.

30.     Under this component, the Project financed: (a) rehabilitation of office spaces; (b)
purchase of office equipment and vehicles; (c) training of the staff of the Project’s
National Coordination Unit (NCU) and the Regional Coordination Units (RCUs); (d)
consultant services, including for preparation and publication of manuals and
establishment of an electronic library; and (e) monitoring of the implementation of
environmental and social mitigation measures. It also helped pay for meetings of the
program’s statutory supervisory and coordination organs and for the operating costs of
the NCU and RCUs.

1.6 Revised Components
31.    The Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
32.    No changes were made to the Project design. The only change that occurred
during implementation was the reallocation of funds. The reallocation of the Credit was
necessary to reallocate funds among categories to take into account the stronger than
expected absorption of funds by Category 2 (Goods and services for CDP Preparation

                                            10
Grants). Indeed, this reallocation of funds was agreed with the GOC during the Mid-
Term Review (MTR) of the Project to account for changes in the costs of some goods and
services. This reallocation enabled an increase in resources allocated to Category 2 of the
financing agreement to finance the installments of grants (allocations) to 54 communes in
the Northwest, Littoral, South West, Adamaoua, and Far North regions, and the update of
CDPs for 10 communes included in PNDP I. The approval for level II was granted on
October 30, 2013. The reallocation of funds was approved by the Country Director.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
33.    The design of PNDP as a three-phase program demonstrated the Bank’s long-term
support to the GOC’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The World Bank’s CAS is aligned
with the GOC’s PRSP and with its goal of poverty reduction through delivery of basic
services, private sector-led growth, and improved local governance.

34.     The Project design drew on lessons from the previous phase of this program and
on similar ongoing and past operations in other countries in the region. In particular, the
experiences gained from the ongoing experience in Burkina Faso and Mali and from a
very similar project in Niger (completed in June 2008, and on which an intensive learning
ICR was prepared) provided guidance for preparation and pre-appraisal of this Project.
The MTR and the ICR of PNDP I concluded that the involvement of government
authorities and sectoral ministries does not by itself improve the quality of services. For a
program like PNDP to be truly effective, it must be accompanied by an improved legal
and regulatory framework for decentralization, including a clear definition of the
responsibilities of each participant (administration, communes, civil society, the Program
Management Unit) and adequate resources to help municipalities prepare technical
records, manage contracts, and monitor and control investment and other activities.

35.    Moreover, the relevance of the Project design was recognized by the French
Development Agency (AFD), which agreed to finance agricultural activities identified in
the CDPs developed through funding from the World Bank and to use the Bank
instrument to finance local development.

36.     During Project preparation, six main risks were identified for PNDP II, including:
(i) delays in completing the legal framework of decentralization, including laws and
decrees for: (a) local taxes and the financial regime of communes; (b) guidance and
supervision arrangements; (c) a Charter of Decentralization; and (d) the organizational
chart and staffing of communes; (ii) delays in budget preparation, poor commune budget
execution, and delays in procurement; (iii) poor financial capacity in rural communes;
(iv) poor quality of contracts and service delivery to communes; (v) corruption in
subproject implementation and hiring of local providers; and (vi) the potential reluctance
of MINEP in Yaoundé to delegate authority for the approval of: (a) MP environmental
impact assessments; and (b) environmental and social screening results to MINEP
representatives at the regional and/or the divisional levels.

37.   To mitigate these risks, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) successfully
implemented the following actions:


                                             11
 (i)    Encouraged creativity in decentralization practices through nationwide
        competition for local governance on best practices; developed publicity material
        for decentralization, for instance, by using M&E data to inform the public about
        the benefits of decentralization and ensuring that the data from M&E were used
        even outside the Project; made decentralization a nationwide issue as the basis for
        improved service delivery;
(ii)    Provided support to communes to improve budget planning, execution, and
        control; applied simplified procedures for procurement;
(iii)   Increased staffing and training in communes to improve collection of local taxes,
        mobilize other resources, and improve budgeting;
(iv)    Clarified the responsibilities of different participants supporting communes;
        focused the CDPs and included sectoral policies in them; and developed
        sustainable and effective capacity in communes to enable them fulfill their duties;
 (v)    Conducted periodic technical and financial audits of subproject implementation
        on a sample basis; built accountability mechanisms between stakeholders (budget
        publication); and
(vi)    Convinced MINEP that the screening of subprojects for potential adverse
        localized environmental and social impacts could be carried out at the
        regional/divisional levels; financed environmental impact studies for subprojects
        and relevant environmental training for all stakeholders at the national, regional,
        and communal levels; and supported the appointment of regional environmental
        focal points and development agents at the communal level.

38.     The design of PNDP II followed the same participatory process used in PNDP I.
Both the components and activities of PNDP II were developed on the basis of
recommendations from beneficiaries and environmental and impact studies, as well as
results from audit reports and feedback from partners. Participatory consultations were
held in all 10 regions with the strong involvement of municipalities, NGOs, and sectoral
ministries. These consultations were followed by validation workshops in each region to
identify the priorities and specific needs of municipalities. The draft PAD was also
validated in a national workshop involving all stakeholders before its approval by the
government. This participatory approach is also reflected in the Project’s Implementation
Steering Committees at the municipal, regional, and national levels.

2.2 Implementation

39.     The three main factors that influenced Project implementation were: the
accelerated preparation of municipal development plans, the Project’s MTR, and the
reallocation of funds. Table 3 summarizes the majors issues, their date of occurrence,
actions taken, and the results obtained.

12/18/2010  Poor performance of the Project. Given that MPs that should be financed by
            The implementation progress was the Project should be removed from the
            rated moderately unsatisfactory priority needs of populations identified in
            (MU). Indeed, in December 18, CDPs, the Bank team decided to change the
            2010, the Bank team found that the original preparation schedule and to
            progress status of the Project was accompany the Project team in the
            MU and that the disbursement rate preparation of the remaining 90 CDPs.
            was low (15.74 percent for the IDA Thus, in November 2011, 68 new CDPs
            credit). The main reason for the were developed. The financing of MPs
            poor performance of the Project was resulting from these new CDPs allowed for
            the delay in the preparation of a gradual increase in the disbursement rate
            CDPs.                                to 52.19 percent for IDA funds in January

12/28/2011- MTR of the Project.                  During the MTR, the issues limiting the
01/13/2012,                                      Project’s performance were identified and
                                                 recommendations made to accelerate
                                                 Project implementation.

                                                 the Bank to not only cover the category
                                                 overdraws proactively authorized by the
                                                 task team during the supervision mission,
                                                 but also and especially to significantly
                                                 improve the Project’s disbursement rate. As
                                                 of November 30, 2013, the closing date of
                                                 the Project, the disbursement rate of IDA
                                                 credit stood at 100 percent (according to
                                                 Client Connection data of November 30,
                                                 2013, 26.70 million were disbursed out of
                                                 SDR 26.70 million allocated).

40.    Moreover, multiple constraints/risks were encountered in the implementation of
the program, including: (i) delays in mobilizing communes’ contributions for
implementation of their MPs, thus slowing their start; and (ii) LSPs’ poor knowledge of
the socioeconomic environment of the MP sites. To mitigate these risks, the Project: (i)
conducted resource mobilization advocacy and outreach campaigns; and (ii) provided all
communes with special software (PRO-ADP or “Prologiciel d’Appui au Developpement
Participatif”) to collect and store communes’ socioeconomic data.

41.     Furthermore, another constraint encountered in implementation was the lack of an
effective grievance redress mechanism (GRM) in the PAD. Indeed, during
implementation, the Project experienced considerable delays in the treatment of six
complaints filed by beneficiaries. Without an inclusive and open GRM, the uptake,
tracking, follow-up, treatment, and feedback relied heavily on the willingness and
responsiveness of the Project team.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
(a) Monitoring and Evaluation Design
42.     The Project’s M&E was designed to capture the inputs, outputs, and outcomes of
increased access to basic social services as well as the Project’s institutional impacts.
Outcome and key performance indicators were clearly defined. Program M&E was
implemented at municipal, regional, and national levels. At the municipal level, a steering
committee comprising representatives of the municipality executive and sectoral
ministries was established to monitor the elaboration of the CDP process. At the end of
the CDP process, the committee was transformed into a body to monitor and evaluate
CDP implementation. A municipal officer provided by the program followed the
implementation of the commune’s Annual Investment Plan (AIP). This participatory
M&E mechanism was developed by the Project at the local level.

43.     Furthermore, the definition of the first PDO indicator (“Eligible communes (147)
which have implemented subprojects (295) have increased the rate of coverage of basic
social services by at least 5 percent in at least one of the following four sectors: health,
education, water and sanitation (number, %)”) created confusion and led to different
interpretations. To enable the different Project M&E actors to have the same
understanding, the Bank team explained this indicator to them and the proper
methodology for gathering information for this indicator.

(b) Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation
44.     Using GPS and the PRO-ADP software, the necessary information concerning
priority sectors and the preferences of the population to be supported was collected by a
LSP. These data were used to establish baseline of the CDP’s subsectors and a map was
produced to highlight priority infrastructures. The software identified the state of
communes’ needs by sector. These data were also available online in the form of
electronic maps (e-MAP). Municipal agents updated these data annually by evaluating
the AIP of year (n) to plan investments for year (n +1). The AIP itself is from the three-
year Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Municipal officials sent
information consolidated at both regional and national levels.

45.    Furthermore, the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) conducted an impact
assessment of the Project in 2013. This study helped to gather reliable data on the
Project’s overall performance and impacts.

(c) Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization
46.     The data from the M&E system were used by the municipalities themselves, as
well as by the PCU, MINEPAT, other sectoral ministries, and development partners. The
municipalities used these data to update their CDPs and priority investments, while the
PCU used the M&E system not only to assess progress towards the achievement of the
PDO, but also to warn regions regarding delays in the implementation of activities and
detection of problems in procurement activities and to make necessary corrective
measures. The PCU also informed MINEPAT on the state of the Project and of decisions
to be taken to address problems identified. Other sectors and development partners were
informed of Project achievements and ongoing investments in their sectors. Information
from the M&E system was also shared with the general public through the Project
website and a synthesis published in the widely disseminated Project newspaper, “Echo
du PNDP.”

                                            14
47.     The M&E system established will be used beyond the duration of IDA's funding.
Indeed, the program has received parallel funding from the AFD for agricultural activities
identified in CDPs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.     The results of the evaluation of the PNDP II’s socio-environmental performance
carried out in 2014 by an independent consultant demonstrated that the Project’s
environmental and social management was satisfactory. Four operational policies were
triggered, including the Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Indigenous People (OP
4.10), the Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12), and International Waters (OP 7.50). All
communal and communities’ MPs were systematically subjected to a socio-
environmental screening, which led to appropriate environmental measures that were
incorporated into the technical and financial documents of the concerned subprojects.
Subproject sites were carefully selected and sensitive areas and titled land were avoided.
All LSPs and Project consultants were trained in the use of the safeguards screening
forms. Neither involuntary resettlement nor intervention on international waters was
recorded during implementation.

49.     The OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment Safeguard was triggered due to the
construction of small infrastructures (water points, markets, classrooms, health care
centers, rural roads, rural electrification, latrines), as well as the generation of medical
waste at health care centers. The Project’s environmental category was rated as B. To
assess, mitigate, and monitor potential adverse environmental and social impacts, the
borrower prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The
ESMF outlines the institutional responsibilities for implementing the environmental and
social management process for subprojects as well as the provision of relevant
environmental training plans to ensure its effective implementation (for details, please
refer to Annex 10 of the PAD). A medical waste management plan for health care centers
was included in the ESMF. The ESMF was disclosed in Cameroon and at the Bank’s
Infoshop prior to appraisal.

50.     The Project triggered OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples, which led to
implementation of the Development Action Plan for Pygmies (DPP). PNDP II focused
on rural areas and thus affected the Pygmy population, an ethnic minority in the country.
To take the Pygmy population into consideration under the program, a Development
Action Plan for Pygmies (DPP) was formulated and published in 2003. The DPP was
worked out and finalized during appraisal to ensure that the dignity, rights, and culture of
the Cameroonian Pygmies would be respected and that they would benefit from the
Project. During implementation, more than 800 million CFAF was allocated to 31
communes in the Central, East, and South regions to finance actions in favor of the
Pygmy population.

51.     The Project support allowed: (i) production of additional official documents for
Pygmies (673 birth certificates, 415 National Identity Cards, 17 marriage certificates,
etc.); (ii) establishment of small Pygmy-led agricultural farms at Bandevouri and
Lokoundjé; and (iii) recognition of land rights to 15 Pygmy villages in the municipalities
of Niete and Lokoundjé. The program also identified and funded the training of 15

                                            15
Pygmy children in education and health careers, including: (i) eight caregivers (one year
training), of whom six graduated in August 2013; (ii) one nurse graduate at the state
nursing school (three years); (iii) two student teachers of technical education (three
years); and (iv) four student teachers of general education (three years).

52.     In summary, Project support empowered the Pygmy population by promoting the
legal existence of Pygmies and their citizenship rights, increasing their capacity to
participate in local political processes and governance, and thereby encouraging their
social inclusion in national activities.

53.      Fiduciary compliance. Special tools were developed to enable the effective
implementation of procurement policies and procedures under the Project. Annual
procurement plans were prepared regularly and submitted for World Bank approval. Key
stakeholders, including grassroots communities, municipal committees, and procurement
staff, received training in the approved procurement policies and procedures. However,
the procurement post review (PPR) conducted by the Bank identified some shortcomings
in the Borrower’s procurement processes, including: (i) some procurement complaints
were not handled in a timely manner by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU); (ii)
assistant accountants were recruited without the World Bank’s involvement and its non-
objection, if applicable; (iii) contractual deadlines for paying providers were sometimes
not respected by the PIU; and (iv) the execution of some procurement activities directly
managed by the PIU experienced important delays.

54.    With regard to financial management, Table 4 shows that at the time of Project
closing, the disbursement rate stood at 100 percent for IDA credit. Throughout
implementation, the Project was subject to annual technical and financial audits. No
major irregularities were noted.

55.     Despite the high rate of disbursement, the risk of ineligible expenditure is
important. In spite of the task team effort to alert the PIU on the Project’s closure process,
some activities were not delivered even after the grace period. About US$2 million
remained in the communes’ bank accounts at the end of March 2014. Per disbursement
rules, these outstanding balance needs to be refunded to allow proper closure of the
Project’s Designated Account. As of today, there is a misunderstanding with the PIU on
the refunding process, a situation that could lead the Bank to declare ineligible the US$2
million.

56.     Governance problem. Some cases of fraud were reported during the Project
implementation. The outstanding case is one reported by a service provider to Integrity
Vice Presidency (INT). As of the closing date, no feedback had been received from INT
on this case.

57.    Moreover, the GOC has obtained parallel financing for the PNDP from other
partners like KfW (the German Cooperation Bank) and AFD. To ensure and enhance
synergy and efficiency, only investments not supported by other projects (or development
partners) were eligible for IDA financing. Therefore, the results presented in this ICR are
only those obtained with IDA funds. Coordination of interventions of technical and
financial partners materialized through supervision missions of the Project, to which the
AFD and KfW were regularly invited.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

58.     PNDP mobilized additional financial resources from the AFD to continue to
support communes in the implementation of their CDPs. With regard to MPs financed by
the IDA resources (water, health centers, schools, warehouses, rural markets, electricity,
etc.), PNDP helped the beneficiary communities in setting up management committees to
ensure self-maintenance of these infrastructures. Moreover, a mechanism for collection of
savings at each beneficiary household was established to ensure the sustainability of
infrastructure financed by the Project. But some management committees for social
infrastructure did not work well in the Central, South, and North regions, where people
are accustomed to free public services.

59.    Given the institutional challenges of the decentralization reforms and the gradual
approach needed to capitalize on Project implementation experience, the GOC
formulated the Community Development Program to be implemented using an APL
instrument in three four-year phases.

60.     Phase I’s successful implementation defined the approach and methods and
allowed for their implementation in five of Cameroon’s 10 regions. In this phase, the
Project funded studies supervised by MINATD, which led to laws and regulations on the
decentralization process, including: Law 2009/011 of July 10, 2009, on financial regime
of decentralized territorial entities; (ii) Law 2009/019 of December 15, 2009, on the local
tax system; and (iii) Ministerial Order No.00136/A/MINATD/DCTD of August 24, 2009,
which made enforceable standard tables of municipal jobs and the organizational chart of
communes. The Project also supported the development of several planning tools,
including: (i) the first methodological guide for regional and communal planning; (ii) the
guide for stakeholders involved in the process and implementation of contracts financed
by PNDP in the communes; and (iii) the methodological guide for the preparation of land
                                             17
use and management plans for communes. Finally, 151 CDPs were prepared during this
phase.

61.     In PNDP II, local development responsibilities were gradually transferred from
Project entities to communes, where community investment decisions are made based on
priorities identified in the CDP. Phase II covered all 10 regions, but not all district
communes of Cameroon – 31 district communes were not taken into account in the
Project. During this phase, PNDP supported the recruitment of 262 financial agents,
responsible for tracking fiscal assets, and 259 development agents, responsible for M&E
for communes. These staff are operational and their personal contribution to the
improvement of communal management is already noticeable and appreciated by 91
percent of mayors surveyed. Moreover, 178 new CDPs were prepared by the
municipalities, revealing significant needs in basic social services (health, education,
water, and sanitation), productive infrastructures, and capacity building.

62.    The level of achievement of trigger indicators needed for the third phase is
encouraging. Of the four trigger indicators, three have already been fully met, including:
  (i) Draft laws and decrees on decentralization prepared during the first phase of the
       Project were adopted and promulgated: (a) Law No. 2009 of December 15, 2009,
       on local taxation and its decree; (b) Law No. 011 of July 10, 2009, on the
       financial regime of communes; and (c) Rule No. 00136/A/MINATD/DCTD of
       August 24, 2009, making enforceable standard tables of municipal employment;
 (ii) At least 90 percent of communes supported by the Project reflected priority
       investments in their CDP and budget. At this stage, all new 178 communes with a
       CDP also have an AIP; and
(iii) About 93 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied with PNDP services (CDPs,
       provision of communal agents, funding of MPs, capacity enhancement, and
       supply of equipment to communes).

63.    With regard to the fourth trigger indicator (preparation and approval by the
government of the Charter on Decentralization), the draft charter was prepared and is
awaiting government approval. Given the Project’s positive track record, the GOC
requested (by Letter No. 003356/MINEPAT/CAB of August 13, 2013) IDA funds to
finance the third phase of the program (APL3). The third phase will be built on the
success and lessons learned from the implementation of Phases I and II. It will
consolidate what has been achieved and prepare an exit strategy. Meanwhile, the
government has initiated discussions to transform the PNDP into a National Participatory
Development Agency to ensure its sustainability.

64.     Considering the diversity of actors involved in local development, PNDP
recognizes that the opportunities and local challenges are as varied as the actors
themselves. The first step toward the design of a third phase is to capitalize on its eight
years of experience to meet the many needs of beneficiaries, summarized as follows: (i)
development of the local economy of communes to help them mobilize fiscal resources to
meet their equipment, public or community infrastructure, and public service needs; (ii)
support for the government in the formulation of local development policies that will
guide sectoral programs on the priorities expressed by the population; and (iii)
development of a more diversified economic base for rural communities and an increased
stock of basic infrastructure (water and sanitation, education, health, rural electrification
infrastructure). In the new funding agreement with AFD, PNDP has integrated a new
                                             18
component on agriculture that will benefit municipalities that have integrated agricultural
activities in their MTEF.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

65.    The Project objectives, design, and implementation are highly relevant to
Cameroon’s development priorities. Indeed, the PDO and components remain consistent
with the GOC’s Growth and Employment Strategy Paper (GESP) and the Bank’s CAS.
By realizing socioeconomic infrastructures through local planning, PNDP II substantially
improved communities’ access to basic social services. Throughout the planning process,
all communes developed their CDPs, an innovative planning tool that addresses the
potential of communes in all 28 sectors identified by the GESP.

66.     PNDP II activities also supported the GOC’s decentralization strategy. They
contributed to strengthening the capacities of the different actors of decentralization in
Cameroon (mayors, municipal councils, LSPs, decentralized state services’ staff, and
local communities) and to establishing a mechanism for decentralized funding through
the allocation of funds to municipalities to finance their development activities.

67.     For successful implementation of the program, two structural participatory models
were developed, consisting of: (i) a diagnosis, including an institutional and landscaping
management diagnosis; and (ii) strategic planning, resource mobilization, and activity
implementation. In addition, incremental funding resources were provided for capacity
building of municipal councils on project planning, management, procurement, and
participative M&E.

68.    Overall, the approach of the PNDP II has been recognized and adopted by the
GOC. To ensure the effectiveness of public investment in rural areas, Circular No. 002
CAB/PR of July 9, 2012 of the President of the Republic of Cameroon, which relates to
the preparation of the state budget, included CDPs among the main instruments that
should guide the preparation of the Public Investment Budget (PIB) of the state for fiscal
years 2013 and 2014.

69.     Moreover, given the satisfactory results obtained by the Project in supporting
local development and decentralization, the government initiated, by Decision No.
022/SG/PM of March 28, 2014, a reflection to convert the PNDP into a National
Participatory Development Agency.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

70.    The achievement of the PDO is rated “Satisfactory.” Indeed, according to the
M&E data and the results of the independent impact assessment carried out at the end of
the Project by the NIS, almost all outcome and intermediate outcome indicators were
substantially achieved. The only exception was the intermediate outcome indicator on the
number of communes with public information and citizen control mechanism for grants.

                                            19
71.    The level of achievement of the outcome indicators can be summarized as
follows:

•Indicator 1: Eligible communes which have implemented subprojects have increased
the rate of coverage of basic social services by at least 5 percent in at least one of the
following four sectors: health, education, water, and sanitation. Objective: 50 percent of
eligible communes (147) which have implemented subprojects have improved their
coverage of basic social services by at least 5 percent in one of the four following areas:
health, education, water supply, and sanitation. Achievement: 45 percent of communes
(133) which have implemented subprojects improved their coverage of basic social
services by at least 5 percent in one of the sectors of health, education, water supply, and
sanitation (achievement rate: 90 percent).

• Indicator 2: Access to education facilities. Objective: the number of students with
better access to educational facilities in the Project area will be 20,100 at the end of the
Project. Achievement: 44,340 students have better access to school facilities
(achievement rate: 221 percent);

• Indicator 3: Access to health care facilities. Objective: the number of people with
better access to health care facilities will be 102,000 at the end of the Project.
Achievement: 428,925 people have better access to health care facilities (achievement
rate: 420 percent).

•Indicator 4: Access to improved water source. Objective: the number of people with
access to improved water source will be 70,000 at the end of the Project. Achievement:
437,100 people have better access to improved water points (achievement rate: 624
percent).

• Indicator 5: Access to roads and social services. Objective: the number of households
with better road access to markets and social services in the Project area will be 193,000
at the end of the Project. Achievement: 211,682 households have better road access to
markets and social services (achievement rate: 110 percent).

• Indicator 6: Preparation of CDPs by eligible communes in the new regions. Objective:
eligible communes (99) in the new regions have prepared a CDP of quality acceptable to
the Association. Achievement: 100 percent of eligible communes in the new regions
prepared CDPs of a quality acceptable to the Association (achievement rate: 100 percent).




                                            20
72.    The results of the impact assessment of the Project carried out by the NIS
(2013)1 at the end of the Project indicate that:

    • In the area of water and sanitation, the Project improved the living conditions of
    437,100 people through the construction of 1,457 water points. This intervention
    helped to reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases;

    • In the education sector, the Project improved the conditions for education of 44,340
    students through the construction of 739 classrooms and the provision of 13,710
    benches. Moreover, the rate of success of students in examinations in schools of
    beneficiary villages rose by 2.76 percent, to 82.4 percent versus 79.8 percent for non-
    beneficiary villages;

    • In the field of health, access to health care improved for 428,925 people through the
    construction and equipment of 28 health care centers. About 41 percent of households
    in beneficiary villages are now within 500 m of the nearest health center and 93
    percent of beneficiary villages are within 5 km of the first health center versus 87
    percent of non-beneficiary villages;

    • In the transport sector, 18 villages comprising 25,873 households benefited from
    better transport conditions and travel through the construction or rehabilitation of 306
    km of road and the construction of five culverts. The direct impact of the construction
    of rural roads in the communes was the reduction of transportation costs. Overall,
    these costs decreased from 400 CFAF to 200 CFAF per km by motorcycle in the
    Littoral region and from 200 CFAF to 100 CFAF per km by car in the centre region,
    based on the NIS (2013) survey results.

73.     The impacts described above are similar to those reported by Wong (2012) on
improving access to basic services, especially in health, education, and drinking water, in
a study of the impacts of World Bank community-driven development programs.

74.     Regarding support for decentralization, the actions of PNDP II strengthened
the technical and operational capacities of communes so that they can effectively promote
local development. Indeed, the Project supported:
  (i) Deployment of the financial and accounting management software (SIM_ba) in
        53 communes. Based on the results of the first wave of implementation, a
        deployment plan was prepared and will be implemented in other communes;

  This retrospective impact evaluation was performed at the end of the project by the NIS (2013) to
measure the Project's impact on the beneficiaries’ living conditions. The sampling strategy used in the
evaluation was both probabilistic and non-probabilistic. The probabilistic aspect was based on a stratified
three-stage sampling: (i) the sampling unit of the first degree or primary unit was communes in which the
PNDP operated since the launch of its second phase. The set of all communes identified at the time of the
evaluation formed the sampling frame of the first degree (178 communes) in 10 regions of Cameroon; (ii)
at the second degree, there were two types of statistical units: the subprojects of the communes drawn in the
first degree and the villages of said communes; (iii) at the third degree, the statistical unit was households
in villages selected at the second degree. The total sample size used for the evaluation consisted of 50
communes, 83 subprojects, 133 villages, and 1,405 households distributed in 10 regions of Cameroon. The
Project's impacts on the beneficiaries’ living conditions vis-à-vis education, health, water, and sanitation
were analyzed using the method of statistical matching (exact matching).

  (ii)     Training of 1,720 members of municipal procurement committees;
 (iii)     Training of the decentralized state services’ staff, municipal staff, and LSPs on
           the inclusion of social and environmental aspects in the preparation and
           implementation of CDPs and subprojects;
 (iv)      Preparation of 91 land use and management plans for communes;
  (v)      Production of additional official documents to Pygmies (673 birth certificates,
           415 National Identity Cards, 17 marriage certificates, etc.), which allowed them to
           become full citizens in Cameroon;
 (vi)      The equipment of 329 municipalities with computers and GPS and of 209
           communes with motorcycles, which improved data collection and working
           conditions in communes;
(vii)      Establishment of a mechanism for decentralized funding through the allocation of
           funds to municipalities to finance their development activities;
(viii)     Organization in April 2013 of a sub-regional seminar to exchange experiences on
           decentralization;
 (ix)      Development and production of 325 CDPs, used by mayors to prepare AIPs that
           reflect the priority needs of communities. The Minister of Economy, Planning,
           and Regional Development (MINEPAT) stated in the PNDP newspaper (“Echos
           du PNDP,” No. 2) that: “The PNDP's experience in planning has been spreading
           in Cameroon as evidenced by the numerous requests expressed by some urban
           communes to benefit from this important planning tool;”
     (x)   Recruitment of communal agents to enable local government to have access to
           qualified personnel. A total of 521 municipal employees, including 259
           technicians and 262 financial officers, are currently stationed. These staff are
           responsible for tracking fiscal assets and for M&E at the communal level. Their
           personal contribution to the improvement of communal management is already
           noticeable. The data collected show that the contribution of these staff is
           particularly visible in the improvement of tax revenues, budget execution,
           archiving, and monitoring the implementation of CDPs and MPs, as well as in the
           collection of communes’ socioeconomic data. The payroll of these new staff was
           supported by the Project during the first two years and later by communes
           themselves. According to the performance assessment of these communal staff,
           most communes concluded that their provision was a pertinent response to the
           recurrent lack of qualified human resources in numerous rural communes. 91
           percent of these staff had at least two years of experiences in community
           development-related issues, including local planning, project management, civil
           and rural engineering, accounting and management, banking, and insurance.
           Moreover, 91 percent of mayors interviewed were satisfied with the work done by
           communal staff made available by the Project. 2 Financial officers favored the

   A survey of beneficiaries' satisfaction with services provided by the Project was conducted in July 2013
 in the Project intervention zones by an independent consultant. On the methodological level, the study
 involved a sample survey with a representative sample of each statistical unit identified as beneficiaries of
 the Project (communes, state decentralized services, service providers, grassroots communities, and Project
 staff). In each statistical unit, a sample was randomly selected. Thus, the total sample consisted of 66
 municipalities, state decentralized services who work in the areas covered by the Project (education, health,
 water, and sanitation) in 30 selected departments, 198 communities distributed throughout the national
 territory, and project staff present in the survey areas. A survey guide was developed for each
 representative sample of beneficiaries. Conversational interviews and focus group discussion techniques
                                                     22
        increase in tax revenues of communes. Indeed, municipalities have broadened
        their tax base and increased the level of tax collection. Overall, the performance
        of technical officers and financial officers was rated satisfactory. Specifically:
           (a) In the municipality of Mfou, the financial officer helped to increase the
           fiscal revenue by 300 percent, from 100 million CFAF in 2008 (without the
           financial officer) to 300 million CFAF in 2013 (with the presence of the
           financial officer).
           (b) In the municipality of Figuil, the financial officer helped to increase the
           fiscal revenue by 245 percent, from 162 million CFAF in 2010 (without the
           financial officer) to 397 million CFAF in 2013 (with the presence of the
           financial officer).
           (c) In the municipality of Moyuka, the financial officer helped to increase the
           fiscal revenue by 150 percent, from 340 million CFAF in 2010 (without the
           financial officer) to 510 million CFAF in 2013 (with the presence of financial
           officer). The contribution of the technical officer is particularly visible in the
           improvement of M&E, the implementation of CPDs, and in the collection of
           social infrastructure data.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Satisfactory

75.     As stated in the PAD, the PNDP II did not lend itself readily to ex ante cost-
benefit analysis because: (i) all investments were demand-driven and their nature could
not be known beforehand; and (ii) most eligible subprojects would be nonproductive,
making the benefits difficult to quantify and value. Nonproductive subprojects aim to
deliver basic social services in sector such as education (and capacity development),
health, water and sanitation, and leisure and culture. Quantifying and valuing economic
benefits in social sectors is generally a difficult task. Therefore, the ex ante economic
analysis was not done at Project appraisal.

76.    For the same reasons that existed during appraisal, no economic or financial
analysis for the whole Project was done at completion. Also, because the appraisal
mission did not attempt to prepare new financial analyses based on the MP investments
observed under PNDP I, there was no basis for the ICR mission to repeat the
computations for comparison.

77.     Given the difficulties in quantifying the Project’s benefits, a cost-efficiency
analysis was performed. Indeed, cost efficiency can be analyzed in terms of the unit cost
of PNDP II infrastructure constructed versus the unit cost of similar infrastructure created
by other approaches and agencies in Cameroon. Furthermore, subprojects were screened
against a set of technical and economic criteria to ensure soundness with sectoral norms
and cost efficiency.

78.    The technical and financial audit of the Project, carried out on a random sample of
30 percent of communes by an independent auditor for the fiscal years 2010, 2011, and



were used by the consultant to gather information on beneficiaries’ perceptions regarding services delivery
by the Project. Moreover, descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis.

                                                   23
2012, revealed that the Project was cost effective. It generated cost efficiencies, with
savings on unit costs that were channeled into additional community infrastructure
initiatives. Indeed, the average unit costs of constructing the social infrastructure
subprojects were lower than those charged by government departments. For example, the
average Project cost of building a classroom with standard dimensions amounted to
7,213,829 CFAF versus 9,000,000 CFAF by state services and 11,165,000 CFAF by
FEICOM (Fonds Spécial d’Equipement et d’Intervention Intercommunale). In addition,
the audit found that overall, socioeconomic infrastructures were built according to
sectoral standards and the Project’s financial resources were used effectively and
efficiently. The prices of various goods and services provided as part of the
implementation of subprojects were generally determined by competition through
tendering.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

79.     The overall outcome of the Project is rated “Satisfactory.” According to the
results of both impact and beneficiaries’ satisfaction assessment studies, the Project’s
performance was very encouraging and its PDO remains relevant. Access of populations
to basic socioeconomic services is still one of the priorities of the GESP. One of the
Project innovations shared by all stakeholders was the preparation of CDPs, which reflect
the priority needs expressed by communities and their populations. Indeed, CDPs are the
main planning tools now guiding the development of both the MTEFs and AIPs of
Cameroon’s communes. In recognition of this high level of achievement, the President of
the Republic, in Circular No. 002 CAB/PR of July 9, 2012 included CDPs among the
main instruments that should guide the preparation of the PIB of the state for fiscal years
2013 and 2014.

80.     Almost all PDO indicators were substantially achieved and sometimes largely
exceeded. Furthermore, PNDP II made significant progress towards the completion of the
four APL triggers agreed between the GOC and the World Bank to move to the third
phase. In fact, three of the four triggers have been met, including: (i) draft laws and
decrees on decentralization prepared during the first phase of the Project will have been
adopted and promulgated to pave the way for the improved intergovernmental fiscal
transfer; (ii) at least 90 percent of communes supported by the Project (292) will have
reflected priority investments in their CDPs and budgets; and (iii) at least 80 percent
(260) of the beneficiary communes were satisfied with service delivery. Regarding the
trigger on the preparation and approval by the GOC of the Charter on Decentralization,
the draft Charter was prepared and is awaiting government approval.

81.     The Project efficiently used resources to achieve its results and goals. As of
November 30, 2013, the level of disbursement was satisfactory. The disbursement rate
was 100 percent for IDA funding (about SDR 26.70 million out of SDR 26.70 million
allocated). Throughout implementation, the Project was subject to annual technical and
financial audits. No major irregularities were noted.

82.    As noted above, the Project had a significant impact on improving the living
conditions of rural populations by facilitating access to basic social services in rural areas.


                                             24
83.   Based on the relevance of the Project’s objectives, the substantial achievement of
the PDO (efficacy), and the efficiency of Project-supported interventions, the overall
outcome rating for the Project is Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

84.     Poverty Impacts: According to the results of both the impact and beneficiaries’
satisfaction assessment studies, PNDP II activities contributed to job creation and the
fight against poverty in Cameroon. Indeed, PNDP II contributed to local empowerment.
The Project promoted the legal existence of Pygmies and their citizenship rights,
increased their capacity to participate in local political processes and governance, and
therefore encouraged their social inclusion in national activities. Moreover, during
implementation, communities were actively involved in the identification, planning,
selection, and control of priority investments financed by the Project. The participation of
rural populations allowed good targeting of the priority needs of grassroots communities,
and therefore improved resource allocation. In addition, the Project has contributed to the
creation of jobs in rural areas by using LSPs and local contractors in the construction of
some small-scale socioeconomic infrastructures. Moreover, the Project has created 521
direct jobs for municipal officials in communes covered. Furthermore, the participatory
process used in the villages was a catalyst to grassroots local savings mobilization of
about 2,363,317,444 CFAF (out of 3,139,304,253 CFAF planned), used as beneficiary
contributions for implementation of MPs. Finally, the Project facilitated access to basic
social services (health, education, water, and sanitation) at the local level; these non-
monetary aspects are very important in the fight against poverty and in promotion of
human development in rural areas.

85.     Gender Aspects: Although there were no gender-specific indicators in the
Project’s M&E systems, the Project benefited all segments of the population – men,
women, and youth. Most MPs worked in favor of rural women. In beneficiary households
of water and electricity MPs, women’s time spent in search of firewood and water
drastically reduced, and many women now use the extra time to increase their farm
productivity. In addition, access to water and modern energy paved the way for the
development of small agricultural processing activities led by women. In the majority of
beneficiary communes, rural women dominate the activities of agricultural production,
processing, and marketing. They are therefore the first recipients of MPs that improve
rural roads, agricultural markets, and warehouses.

86.     With regard to the personnel provided by the Project to communes, an effort was
made to recruit female staff. Out of the 259 communal development agents (technicians)
recruited, 21 percent of them were women. Also, all 30 social workers transferred to the
30 communes involved in the implementation of the DPP by the Ministry of Social
Affairs (MINAS) were women.

87.     In most communes surveyed, women also participated in decision-making bodies
and in the control of the local savings for maintenance of equipment and infrastructures.
Thanks to the sensitization campaign carried out by the Project and the training of
communes on gender issues, women now occupy positions of President and Treasurer in
both steering management committees, showing their leadership in the governance of
                                            25
MPs. Because of the dynamism of these women, all of the management committees of
MPs have established savings and credit schemes. During the closing supervision mission,
communities were advised to use the savings mobilized for the maintenance of
infrastructure and equipment as an opportunity to provide small amounts of credit to
women wishing to carry out income-generating activities.

88.     Social Development: Education, health, and water access are the core areas of the
social services promoted by PNDP. The implementation of MPs in the education sector
improved school enrollment in beneficiary communities. For example, in the East region,
the enrollment rate improved 15.26 percent in beneficiary households. Moreover, the
intervention of PNDP II in the water sector improved the living conditions of 437,100
people through the construction of 1,457 water points.

89.      Achievements of the program in the field of health increased the number of births
attended by skilled health personnel, from 15 deliveries per month before the Project to
17 deliveries per month afterwards. The PNDP also helped bring health facilities nearer
to households. Almost 41 percent of households in beneficiary villages are within 500 m
of the nearest clinic, and 93 percent of these households are less than 5 km from the
nearest clinic. In contrast, only 27.5 percent of households in non-beneficiary villages are
within 500 m of the first health facility and 87 percent of them are less than 5 km from
the first health center.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

90.     The Project strengthened organizational systems at all levels (local, regional, and
national) to ensure the sustainability of its investments. At the municipal level, three
types of committees including Project piloting (COPIL), monitoring-evaluation (CSE),
and management (COGE) were respectively established to: (i) support the elaboration of
CDPs; (ii) ensure the quality of CDPs and evaluate their rate of achievement; and (iii)
ensure the maintenance of infrastructure and equipment financed by the Project. The
Project promoted the establishment of Communal Procurement Management Committees
(CCPM) in all communes to ensure good governance of communal contracts. Each
municipality also established a Municipal Council Extended to Sector (COMES) that
approves CDPs, priority investment plans, and budget allocations. At both the regional
and national level, the Project organized knowledge-sharing and capacity-building
forums to enhance the capacity of mayors in managing communal contracts and fiscal
revenues.

91.     Moreover, the GOC initiated discussions to transform the PNDP into a National
Participatory Development Agency to ensure its sustainability. The draft decree was
prepared and submitted to the government for approval. If the text is approved by the
government, the PNDP will become a public administrative authority with greater
financial autonomy and an independent managerial system.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

92.    Other impacts are noticeable in some municipalities that use CDPs as a tool for
development. For example, the Commune of Bangangte mobilized foreign direct
investment totaling 300 million CFAF to finance its city sanitation and electrical network
expansion projects. The same commune received from FEICOM an award prize of 50

                                            26
million CFAF for the best project submitted for funding activities extracted from its
MTEF. Other communes are integrating in their AIPs innovative projects that will
promote local economic development, taking into account their comparative advantage in
terms of natural resources. Samples of projects include communal agricultural
mechanization parks (Commune of Batouri), a communal agricultural initiative
(Commune of Dibombari), and a communal timber park (Commune of Dimako).

93.     The establishment of management committees for the maintenance of water
infrastructure was a catalyst for the development of savings and credit unions in
beneficiary villages. In total, more than 1,700 savings and credit unions are operational
and women are playing a greater role in their management than before the Project. The
combination of these savings funds may result in a microfinance institution self-managed
by recipient villages.

94.    One aspect that should be further improved by the Project is the governance of
communal contracts. Indeed, with the arrival of the Ministry of Public Contracts
(MINMAP), the CCPMs established by the PNDP disappeared to make room for
departmental and regional commissions, managed by Divisional Officers and the regions’
governors. Many mayors deplore their lack of involvement in these committees, which
oversee their contracts. During the PNDP II closing mission, the Bank recommended that
the PNDP initiate a dialogue with MINMAP to address this critical issue.

95.     Moreover, the GOC obtained parallel financing for the PNDP from other partners
such as AFD and KfW. AFD provided 14.95 billion CFAF, intended to finance only
agricultural activities identified as priority needs of populations in their CDPs. Currently,
a study is underway to identify the crops and agricultural investment that will benefit
from this funding. Furthermore, KfW’s funding, 3 billion CFAF, was used to finance
only the activities of communes located in Cameroon’s extreme North region. KfW’s
funding was closed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

96.    The balance of services offered by the PNDP II, as perceived by respondent
beneficiaries, is encouraging and is characterized by:

 (i)    Excellent coverage of program interventions at the national level. In addition to
        the supply of equipment to communes, some of which is still being acquired
        (including motorcycles and completed computers), almost all targeted communes
        received four other services offered by the PNDP II, including: (a) development
        of their CDPs (100 percent); (b) funding and implementation of their MPs (94
        percent); (c) provision of communal agents (77 percent); and (d) training/capacity
        building of their staff (96 percent).
(ii)    Strong ownership by communes of the CDP development process. Today, nearly
        three out of four target communes have a CDP aligned to the GESP, and the
        CDPs is being updated to align them to the GESP with the support of the program
        in all communes that have a former CDP.
(iii)   A satisfactory level of budget absorption. The level of consumption of global
        resource allocations to municipalities in PNDP II is 100 percent for IDA resources.
        In addition, IDA resources allocated for funding and implementation of MPs,

                                             27
       totaling 8.7 billion CFAF (or about 57 percent of budget funds for this activity)
       are fully consumed.
(iv)   Strong ownership by communes of planning and management mechanisms.
       Thanks to the capacity enhancement/training program, 53 communes benefited
       from the installation of the SIM_ba software to improve their accounting. The
       pilot introduction of a mechanism for citizen control of public action in 10
       municipalities (one per region) is being duplicated in other municipalities. In
       addition, a database of service providers is available in all target communes and is
       generally available to the public.
(v)    The different categories of beneficiaries (communes, service providers, sectoral
       ministries and population) appear generally satisfied with the support received
       from the program. Overall, 93 percent of beneficiary communes are satisfied with
       the program’s services.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

97.     Each social infrastructure built with IDA funds has a management committee
responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M). These committees work well in
seven regions and support the recurring costs of maintenance and repair of the
infrastructure built. In these regions, the likelihood that the stream of benefits will be
sustained is high. In Central, South, and North regions, the management committees of
community infrastructure do not work well as their capacity for collective action is weak.
Indeed, communities in these areas have grown accustomed to receiving free benefits
from state services and are reluctant to contribute to the maintenance cost of
infrastructure. In these areas, the risk of losing these infrastructures is high because it
only takes one small glitch for these infrastructures to be abandoned, despite the
contribution of the communities to the investment costs and to the control of investment
choices.

98.     Following the municipal elections held in September 2013, significant overturn in
the municipal executives in all 10 regions of Cameroon was witnessed. Approximately 80
percent of municipal executive members are new and have not yet mastered the
participatory development approach and procedures for Project implementation. The low
capacity of these new mayors and municipal councilors could have a negative impact on
the short-, medium-, and long-term sustainability of the Project benefits in the
municipalities concerned.

99.    Moreover, given the high rate of replacement of mayors and members of
municipal councils in every municipal election, there is a substantial risk that the
development outcome in terms of organizational setup, budget, political will, and
environment will not be maintained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance




                                            28
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

100. During PNDP II, the Project maintained its support to communes from PNDP I,
targeted new eligible communes (110), and reached at least one community per commune.
The Project completed key institutional reforms on decentralization and local
development. Communes were targeted as the main beneficiaries of PNDP II services
since local development responsibilities were transferred to them. To ensure quality at
entry, the main components and their related activities were selected based on lessons
learned from PNDP I and the priority needs expressed by communes, as highlighted in
the various assessment studies, including beneficiaries’ satisfaction, environmental,
external audit, and impact evaluations.

101. Lessons taken into consideration and reflected in the Project design included the
need to: (i) continuously involve the public sector; (ii) ensure the quality of MPs; (iii)
focus on CDPs as a tool for planning, budgeting, and programming; (iv) streamline funds
transfers by directly channeling funds to the bank accounts of eligible communes; (iv)
develop local procurement capacity; and (v) enhance environmental management
capacity.

102.    Actions undertaken for Project readiness included the:

 (i)    Establishment of a favorable environment for a better coordination mechanism
        characterized by: (a) regular dialogue/consultation workshop with partners on
        decentralization issues; (b) oversight of the steering committee of decentralization
        led by the MINATD; (c) periodic meetings with MINEPAT, MINEP, communes,
        TSPs, the Project team, and joint supervision missions.
(ii)    Amendment of the new operational framework, which integrated the expansion of
        the Project’s geographic coverage.
(iii)   Update of the Project Implementation Manual, M&E manual, and financial
        management manual.
(iv)    Recruitment of two accountants in the new NCU, one accountant in each RCU,
        and one internal auditor.
 (v)    Recruitment of regional environmental focal points within each RCU.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

103. Following the implementation of the IDA Credit in January 2010, four joint
supervision missions were organized. These supervision missions were held respectively
from May 10-19, 2010; October 14-15, 2010; December 28, 2011 to January 13, 2012
(MTR); and from December 9-23, 2013 (closing the Project). These supervision missions
were effectively complemented by semi-monthly meetings held regularly to monitor the
Project’s implementation progress. Therefore, the Bank team did not need more
supervision missions.

104. The first two missions were considered as capacity enhancement supervision.
Emphasis was placed on the analysis of the main lessons learned from the
implementation of the first phase, monitoring the implementation of recommendations of
the last supervision mission, implementation of the financing strategy, and the state of
                                            29
implementation of PNDP II. Throughout these missions, new orientations and guidelines
were given to the Project team on aspects related to the: (i) development and financing of
CDPs; (ii) O&M of Project infrastructures and equipment; (iii) mechanisms for fund
transfers to communes; (iv) support for procurement of communal goods and services,
financial management, internal audits, and environmental aspects; as well as (v)
implementation of the DPP; and (vi) coordination of PNDP donors.

105. Through the implementation of recommendations from the two previous
supervision missions, the MTR concluded that the overall status of the Project was
satisfactory. In fact, at MTR, the Project had achieved the following results: (i) all 68
CDPs of PNDP I and 34 new CDPs out of 110 originally planned in four new areas were
developed; (ii) of the 20 Project indicators, 17 were informed by mid-term; and (iii)
Project performance was enhanced by the implementation of MPs inherited from the first
phase. The MTR noted that the whole implementation process of PNDP II was
progressing satisfactorily and suggested that the results of the program would be achieved
by the initial anticipated closing date of November 30, 2013.

106. After the MTR, several technical meetings to monitor the progress of Project
implementation were held periodically between the PCU and the Bank team under the
initiative of the Task Team Leader (TTL). Throughout these meetings, critical issues that
could limit the Project’s success were fully investigated by the mission, partners, and the
government. These included the: (i) reallocation of IDA credit; (ii) completion of the
Project’s impacts; (iii) collaboration between the Project and the administrative
authorities; (iv) blockages between certain mayors and communal treasurers regarding
the implementation of MPs; (v) implementation of Project activities in the Bakassi
Peninsula; (vi) relationship between the IDA Credit and the second generation C2D
(AFD) funds under investigation; (vii) finalization of the remaining CDPs by the end of
March 2012; and (viii) involvement of the decentralized services sector in program
implementation. Solving these various problems was instrumental to the achievement of
the Project’s objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

107. From the preparation of PNDP II until its implementation, the Bank’s leadership
was instrumental to the achievement of the Project’s satisfactory performance. With
regard to the design, both PDO outcome indicators and the choice of beneficiaries,
components, and their related activities were identified based on the needs expressed by
all stakeholders using a participatory approach. The Project design also reflected lessons
learned from the PNDP I and is aligned to both the GOC’s GESP and the Bank’s CAS.

108. Each supervision mission was an opportunity not only to advocate at the highest
level of government decision making (Prime Ministry, MINPAT, MINTAD, MINFI and
MINEP) for addressing the constraints hindering proper execution of the Project, but also
to enhance the ownership process of participatory local development by the beneficiary
communes. At the end of each mission, a debriefing was presented to key decision
makers from the government. These advocacy efforts accelerated the adoption and
promulgation of texts on decentralization and facilitated the mobilization of government
counterpart funding, as well as the direct transfer of funds to eligible communes to
finance their MPs.
                                            30
109. Technical meetings chaired by the Bank’s TTL were regularly held between the
Project team, partners, the government, and municipalities to monitor the state of the
Project. These were especially effective for researching corrective measures to address
critical aspects such as: (i) Project coordination, (ii) improvement of the planning,
budgeting, and programming process for communes’ priority investments and of the
quality of MPs; (iii) compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary and procurement procedures;
and (iv) inclusion of environmental measures in MPs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

110. For the GOC, PNDP is a success story in terms of local development in
Cameroon. Its success is evidenced by the satisfaction of beneficiaries with regard to the
quality of available basic social infrastructure and the impact of achievements on the
living conditions of people and communes. The Project’s positive results have reassured
both the GOC and development partners. Indeed, in its initial launch phase in 2004 with
Bank resources, including IDA funds and state counterpart funds, MINEPAT, which
oversees PNDP, advocated for an increase of PNDP resources in 2006 by mobilizing
additional parallel financing from KfW and the C2D funds (AFD).

111. In PNDP II, MINEPAT requested the Bank to double its funding and AFD to
triple the C2D funds. Motivated by the good performance of PNDP, MINEPAT also
raised counterpart funds from the state budget so that the total amount mobilized by
PNDP (11,074,315,900 CFAF) exceeded the amount originally planned (10,153,069,317
CFAF), achieving a mobilization rate of 109 percent. Thanks to the political will of the
state, MINATD also facilitated the adoption and promulgation of texts on
decentralization. Since 2012, the President of the Republic has, in its circular related to
the guidelines on the preparation of the budget, instructed the government to use, among
other planning documents, the CDP in the selection of projects to be retained as PIB. This
is a great recognition of the importance of CDPs as the main planning tool for communes.

112. In the day-to-day implementation process, sectoral ministers were involved in all
institutional frameworks established by the Project and in all supervision missions and
technical meetings. One illustrative example is the transfer of 30 social work officers in
30 selected communes by MINAS to help implement the DPP. Other examples are the
agreements signed between the Project and ANAFOR, FEICOM, CEFAM, ARMP, and
MINMAP for reforestation, infrastructure development, and capacity building in
procurement governance and management.

113. However, it should be noted that the counterpart funds were generally provided
by the GOC with considerable delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

114. Given the Project’s results, the implementation of Project activities by the PIU
was effective. However, the PPR conducted by the Bank identified some weaknesses,
including: (i) some procurement complaints were not handled in a timely manner by the
                                            31
PIU; (ii) assistant accountants were recruited without involvement of the World Bank and
its non-objection if applicable; (iii) contractual deadlines for paying service providers
were sometimes not respected by the PIU; and (iv) the execution of some procurement
activities directly managed by the PIU experienced significant delays.

115. Moreover, during the life of the Project, some cases of fraud were reported. The
outstanding case is the one reported by a service provider to INT. As of the closing date,
no feedback had been received from INT on this case. Therefore, the implementing
agency performance is rated “Moderately Satisfactory.”

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

116. The government has fulfilled all its obligations, including: (i) allocating
counterpart funds; (ii) mobilizing additional resources from other development partners;
and (iii) adopting legal texts of decentralization. In addition, the President of the Republic
has recognized the important role of PNDP in poverty alleviation and wealth creation and
instructed all sectoral ministries to use CDPs in preparation of the PIB. As an illustration,
in March 2014, MINEPAT organized consultative workshops in the 10 regions to
identify the needs of communes to be integrated in the PIB. These needs will be extracted
from the CDPs in each region and then consolidated at the national level to give rise to
the 2014 budgetary allocation on decentralization. However, it should be noted that the
counterpart funds were generally provided by the GOC with considerable delays.

117. On the operational side, the level of investment of PNDP II was satisfactory
according to the perception of beneficiary communes and the main target values of the
Results Framework were achieved. Communal agents transferred to communes by PNDP
generally improved management and collection of communal fiscal revenue.
Management committees were established in all beneficiary villages for the maintenance
and sustainability of infrastructure and equipment provided by the Project. A savings
scheme system involving rural women in management was widespread in these
management committees.

6. Lessons Learned

118.   Several lessons were learned during PNDP II, including:

119. The CDP can be considered as a reference tool for planning and dialogue to
support local development, but its level of ownership by line ministries remains
weak. Indeed, participatory planning has identified sectoral priorities for local
development but these need to be better taken into account in the PIB to consolidate and
sustain the financing of local development. In addition, the level of coordination of
support to local development is still insufficient.

120. Funding and implementation of multisectoral development priorities can
improve access to basic social services, but mobilization of beneficiaries'
contributions remains insufficient and the demand for economic investments very
important. The impact study showed that the Project improved access to basic social
services in different sectors (education, health, water, sanitation, and transport) and

                                             32
generated many temporary and permanent jobs. However, households’ access to basic
social services provided by the Project may still be limited by their low incomes.

121. The funding allocation system improves resource management by
municipalities. Indeed, given the competition in the procurement process, mayors were
able to achieve a greater number of MPs for their populations within their allocations.

122. The citizen control mechanism improves communes’ governance. The pilot
citizen control mechanism implemented in 10 communes allowed the communes to better
understand their populations’ perceptions of the services provided and to consider
improvements. This operation is considered an effective tool of governance through
which significant changes can be capitalized in communes. A computer application was
developed and put online. The pilot operation will be extended to other communes.

123. Governance remains an important challenge for the promotion of local
development in Cameroon. Despite IDA procedures, the participatory approach, and the
capacity building of stakeholders, the Project failed to prevent governance issues that
were raised during Project implementation. The Project focused on access to basic social
services and placed little effort on the prevention, treatment, and management of
complaints.

124. Decentralization is a very long-term process, exceeding Project deadlines
despite the use of an APL. This justified the limited objectives that the program set for
decentralization in PNDP II. Although Phases I and II helped to define the legislative and
regulatory framework for decentralization by supporting the preparation of several draft
laws and decrees, a lot still needs to be done to stimulate sustainable local development.
Indeed, the transfers of responsibilities and resources to the municipalities are not yet
being done optimally.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

125. The Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development noted the
impressive involvement of the population in the identification and implementation of
solutions for local development on the ground. This commitment was translated through
citizens’ effective participation in the planning process and their contribution in building
and maintaining their infrastructure. Increasing citizen control in the management of their
communes or communities may ultimately strengthen the process of decentralization and
its appropriation by the population.

126. PNDP’s experience in local planning is spreading in Cameroon. As attested by the
numerous requests expressed by some urban communes that also want PNDP assistance
in this process. The opportunity presented by the transition to PNDP III could lead the
government to reconsider PNDP’s scope, which is currently limited to rural communes.
The government has engaged in discussions in this direction.

(b) Cofinanciers (Embassy of France in Cameroon/French Development Agency)

127. PNDP represents two major financial commitments of AFD through the first and
second C2D. The first funding covered an amount of 13 billion CFAF. France decided to
support a second phase based on the strong success of the first funding. The assistance
granted by AFD through the second C2D amounted to 14.95 billion CFAF. Field
observations suggest that money is being well spent, evidenced by the close relationship
with the rural population. The funded MPs are well prepared and meet the needs of rural
populations.

128. Local development is an essential intervention of the French cooperation axis. If
PNDP is today a model for local development programs/development of territories, it is
because of its importance (financial volume and national coverage), but also because of
its achievements (number of CDPs prepared, investment infrastructures, MPs in service,
personnel trained and deployed in the rural communes, etc.). Its impacts on the
population, particularly in terms of improving living conditions, are effective.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

129. PNDP helped to improve living conditions in Cameroon. Two years ago, a
convention was signed between my municipality and the PNDP for the provision of
potable water infrastructure, including a tank of 20 m3. This helped to improve our living
conditions. We have also benefited from the construction of two classrooms and the
recruitment of communal agents. It is a great gesture for our population. The work done
by PNDP facilitates teaching and learning activities in our schools. Our area is known for
its rainy nature; we were uncomfortable and our pupils were regularly sick. The new
classrooms are a gift from PNDP now and for the future.

1.     Objective of Component 1: This component aims to help improve the
socioeconomic conditions, increase the productivity of the natural resource base, and
increase the incomes of the population in the communes supported by the Project.
Achieving these goals requires putting in place various infrastructures and socioeconomic
investments. This component will channel grants to communes to co-finance their
proposed investments (subprojects): either a CDP preparation activity or a CDP-
Subproject.

2.     Output of Component 1: This component is rated Satisfactory (S). Except for
the output related to the number of health facilities to be constructed, almost intermediate
outcome relating to this component were achieved or exceeded (Table 5).

Component 2: Decentralization Support for Communes

4.       Objective of Component 2: This component aims to strengthen institutional
capacities in support of the decentralization process. It will also provide assistance for the
implementation of capacity-building activities for communes and other local stakeholders,
such as LSPs, multidisciplinary teams of the sectoral ministries, and Technical Service
Providers (TSPs), to enable them to assume an effective role as promoters of local
development. It will be implemented through two subcomponents including: (i)
Institutional support to the decentralization process; and (ii) Capacity building. The
Project will also fund: (a) acquisition of computer equipment for communes; (b) training
of communal development and finance staff; (c) publication and dissemination of a
participatory planning guide, as well as a guide for procurement procedures; (d)
environmental training for members of municipal councils, divisional administrative staff,
and Project staff; and (e) study tours and training on decentralization and local
development for LSPs, multidisciplinary teams, TSPs, and local stakeholders other than
commune authorities.

5.      Ouputs of Component 2: Regarding the preparation of land use and management
plans, the process for preparing CDPs involves a mapping exercise to ensure that land use
plans are integrated into CDPs. Indeed, 91 out of 100 land use and management plans
were prepared (91 percent). With respect to capacity building, significant activities were
completed. In the 10 regions, mayors were trained on decentralization. Four regional
workshops were organized to disseminate the guide on regional and local planning
dissemination. Trainings on procurement were implemented to benefit regional
procurement commissions, and staffs of several ministries (land, social, and environment)
and mayors were trained in environmental and social safeguards. In total, 521 municipal
officials were recruited by the Project to strengthen the capacity of communes (two staff
for each commune). These staff are responsible for: (i) tracking fiscal assets; and (ii)
M&E at the communal level. These staff are operational and their personal contribution
to the improvement of communal management is already noticeable. The data collected

                                             37
on the ground show that the contribution of these staff is particularly visible in the
improvement of tax revenues, budget execution, archiving, monitoring the
implementation of the CDPs, and the collection of social infrastructure data. Moreover,
91 percent of mayors interviewed are satisfied with the work done by communal staff
made available by the Project. The payroll of these new staff was supported by the
Project during the first two years and later by communes themselves. The citizen control
mechanism was prudently tested in 10 communes. The pilot citizen control allowed
communes to better understand their populations’ perceptions of the services provided
and to consider improvements. This operation is considered an effective tool of
governance through which significant changes can be capitalized in communes. A
computer application was developed and put online. The pilot operation will be extended
to other communes.

Component 3: Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and
Communication

6.       Objective of Component 3: This component facilitates: (a) administrative,
technical, and financial management of the program; (b) coordination among all
institutional partners to ensure efficient support to communes for local development; (c)
effective contractual arrangements with communes, sectoral ministries, TSP/private-
sector operators, and NGOs (TSPs), including acquisition of the equipment necessary for
implementing the program; (d) M&E of the performance and the financial, environmental,
and social impacts of the program (including developing monitoring scorecards to assess
beneficiaries’ satisfaction with services provided by communes); and (e) development of
communication activities to publicize and disseminate Project implementation tools and
local development potential and practices. The integrated financial management software
will be upgraded with additional tools to enable permanent access to accounting system

information in the regions for analysis and ensure timely synchronized consolidation of
accounts.

7.      Output of Component 3: Four intermediate outcome indicators relating to this
component were achieved. Furthermore: (i) external financial audit reports are produced
on time and without any major reservations; (ii) a database on the quality of TSPs is in
place and available for public access; and (iii) biannual M&E reports are produced within
the agreed time frames. M&E work is performed at all levels (national, regional, local),
and the financial management software was upgraded. The financial management
function was rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS). Interim Financial Reports are
submitted in a timely manner and judged acceptable and are now prepared regularly, but:
(i) external auditor recommendations on internal control have not been implemented
fully; and (ii) delays have been experienced in the financial reporting process between
communes, the Regional Coordination Units, and the Project Coordination Unit. The
procurement function was rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS). Indeed, some
procurement complaints were not handled in a timely manner by the Project. The
execution of activities directly managed by the National Coordination Unit has fallen
behind schedule.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost Efficiency Analysis of Social Infrastructures


1.      As stated in the Project Appraisal Document, the PNDP II did not lend itself
readily to ex ante cost-benefit analysis because: (i) all investments were demand-driven
and their nature could not be known beforehand; (ii) most eligible subprojects would be
nonproductive, making the benefits difficult to quantify and value. Nonproductive
subprojects aim to deliver basic social services in sectors such as education (and capacity
development), health, water and sanitation, and leisure and culture. Quantifying and
valuing economic benefits in social sectors is generally a difficult task. Therefore, the ex
ante economic analysis was not done at Project appraisal.

2.     For the same reasons that existed during appraisal, no economic or financial
analysis for the whole Project was done at completion. Also, because the appraisal
mission did not attempt to prepare new financial analyses based on the MP investments
observed under PNDP I, there was no basis for the ICR mission to repeat the
computations for comparison.

3.      Given the difficulties in quantifying the benefits of the Project, a cost-efficiency
analysis was performed. Indeed, cost efficiency can be analyzed in terms of the unit cost
of PNDP II infrastructure constructed versus the unit cost of similar infrastructure created
by other approaches and agencies in Cameroon. Furthermore, subprojects were screened
against a set of technical and economic criteria to ensure soundness with sectoral norms
and cost efficiency.

4.      The technical and financial audit of the Project, carried out on a random sample of
30 percent of communes by an independent auditor for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012,
revealed that the Project was cost effective. It improved cost efficiency, with savings on
unit costs that were channeled into additional community infrastructure initiatives.
Indeed, the Project’s average unit costs of constructing social infrastructure subprojects
were lower than those charged by government departments. For example, the average
Project cost of building a classroom using standard dimensions amounted to 7,213,829
CFAF versus 9,000,000 CFAF using state services and 11,165,000 CFAF using FEICOM
(Fonds Spécial d’Equipement et d’Intervention Intercommunale). In addition, the audit
found that overall, socioeconomic infrastructures were built according to sectoral
standards. Table 9 compares the unit costs of social infrastructures associated with PNDP
II, government departments, and FEICOM

                         Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Beneficiaries’ Assessment of Services Provided by PNDP II (Summary Note)

1.      In January 2010, PNDP, a multi-donor program that supports the efforts of the
Government of Cameroon (GOC) in the decentralization process, particularly in the
financing of the development of Communal Development Plans (CDPs), micro-projects
(MPs), basic infrastructure, and institutional strengthening of communes, entered its
second phase. After four years of intervention during which PNDP expanded its
operations in all regions of Cameroon, the National Coordination Unit (NCU)
commissioned a study on beneficiaries’ evaluation of the services provided. Results from
this study will guide the third phase of the Project. The purpose of this study was to
determine the level of beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the activities of the program. More
specifically, the study’s specific objectives were to: (i) rate the overall assessment of the
beneficiaries on the implementation of the program; (ii) obtain the opinion of communes
and other beneficiaries on the implementation of activities; (iii) determine the percentage
of beneficiary communes and other beneficiaries who are satisfied with services provided
by the program; (iv) analyze the constraints faced by beneficiaries in the implementation
of the program (procedure, condition of funding, timely implementation, nature of the
achievements, areas of intervention, etc.); and (v) identify beneficiaries’ expectations in
terms of improving the implementation of the PNDP.

2.      Accordingly, this report presents the results of the survey administered to the
recipients of services provided by PNDP II. The survey was conducted using a
representative sample of 66 beneficiary communes spread over the national territory.
Twenty percent of the communes were randomly selected from among the 329
communes covered by PNDP II, using a stratified sample methodology. The
representativeness of each type of MP (education, health, water and sanitation,
transportation, electrification, etc.) was taken into account, as well as their degree of
implementation (not started, in progress, completed). The regional distribution was
proportional to the number of beneficiaries per commune area. Data were collected
mainly through interviews with the main beneficiaries of the program, namely: (i)
executive councils; (ii) devolved state services; (iii) service providers; (iv) communities;
and (v ) PNDP staff.

3.     Respondents’ perceptions of the outcome of services offered by PNDP II are
encouraging and indicate:
(iv) Excellent coverage of program interventions at the national level. In addition to
       the supply of equipment to the communes, some of which is still being acquired
       (including motorcycles and complete computers), almost all targeted communes
       received the other four services offered by PNDP II. Indeed, all targeted
       communes (100 percent) benefited from the support of the program to develop
       their CDPs; 94 percent received funding for the implementation of their MPs; 77
       percent were provided with communal staff; and 96 percent received
       training/capacity building of their staff.




                                             44
  (ii) Strong ownership of CDPs. Today, nearly three out of four targeted communes
          have a CDP aligned to the GESP, and CDPsis being updated with the support
          of the program in all those that have none now.
  (iii) A satisfactory level of consumption of allowances. The level of consumption by
          PNDP II of the global allocations to communes was 100 percent under IDA
          resources.
  (iv) Strong ownership of the planning mechanism and management by targeted
          communes. Indeed, thanks to PNDP II, 53 communes received the software
          SIM_ba to improve their accounting. The pilot introduction of a mechanism for
          citizen control of public action in 10 municipalities (one per region) already
          resonates with other communes. In addition, a database of service providers is
          available in all targets communes and is generally available to the public.

4. The different categories of beneficiaries (communes, providers, devolved state
   services, populations) appear generally satisfied with the support received from the
   program. Overall, 93 percent of beneficiary communes are satisfied with the
   program’s actions (supporting the development of CDPs, provision of municipal
   officials, funding and implementation of MPs, training/capacity building, provision of
   equipment). Indeed, 91 percent of beneficiary communes declared their satisfaction
   with the support for the development of CDPs. The provision of municipal employees
   was rated favorably in 93 percent of communes covered. The majority (94 percent) of
   communes were satisfied by the funding given to them to implement their MPs, and
   with the provision of equipment to improve their accounting system, while 95 percent
   were satisfied with the training and capacity-building programs received from PNDP.
   Most (96 percent) of the devolved state services beneficiaries were also satisfied with
   PNDP. Similarly, service providers were generally very satisfied with the PNDP.
   Overall, 92 percent of beneficiary communes were satisfied with PNDP support.

5.     However, multiple constraints were encountered in the implementation of the
program. These include: (i) delays in mobilizing the communes’ contribution for the
implementation of MPs, thus slowing their start; (ii) LSPs’ limited financial resources,
which lengthened the delivery of public orders; (iii ) insufficient monitoring of the work
of service providers by communes; and (iv) providers’ poor knowledge of the
socioeconomic environment of the sites.

6.     Given the diversity of actors involved in local development, PNDP must
recognize that opportunities and local challenges are as varied as the actors themselves.
Also, PNDP must capitalize on its eight years of experience to meet the multifaceted
needs of beneficiaries, which are as follows:
  (i) Development of communes’ local economies to help mobilize additional fiscal
       resources to meet their needs in terms of public or community infrastructure and
       public services;
 (ii)   Development of a more diversified economic base for rural communities and an
       increased stock of basic infrastructure (water and sanitation, education, health,
       and rural electrification infrastructure).

                       Rapport d’achèvement du Gouvernement

1. Description du Projet, Contexte et Objectif de développement

1. Depuis plus d’une décennie, le Gouvernement camerounais n’a cessé de déclarer que
le développement rural reposait principalement sur les services et les investissements des
collectivités locales (c.à.d. régionales et communales). La décentralisation de la structure
administrative est donc importante pour fournir de tels services et faciliter le financement
des projets et activités au niveau des collectivités.

2. Selon l’Article 1 de la Constitution de 1996, « La République du Cameroun est un
état unitaire décentralisé. La décentralisation de l’administration au niveau des
collectivités locales est représentée par les régions et les municipalités. » Quoique
longtemps retardé, le Gouvernement a démontré son engagement à la mise en œuvre de la
décentralisation administrative sur toute l’étendue du territoire. En juillet 2004, une loi-
cadre sur la décentralisation fût votée, posant les fondements réglementaires régissant les
communes et les régions. En novembre 2008, le Gouvernement a fait voter la loi portant
sur l’organisation et le fonctionnement d’une administration décentralisée en « régions,
préfectures et sous-préfectures. ». Un plan d’action (2005-2009) fût élaboré. De plus, un
plan comptable propre aux communes, fut adopté et disséminé en 2006. Des mesures
pour le renforcement des capacités des maires et cadres municipaux furent adoptées au
Colloque National des Maires sur les franges des Afri-cités de 2004.

3. En 2007, le Gouvernement est parvenu à organiser les élections municipales et en
janvier 2008, a adopté les lois qui créent le comité des services locaux et le comité
interministériel de la décentralisation. Une série de lois importantes visant à améliorer le
cadre légal et réglementaire sur la décentralisation ont été élaborées, quoique n’étant pas
encore adoptées et promulguées. Elles comportent les lois sur la taxation locale et le
régime financier des communes et le décret sur la chartre organisationnelle et le
recrutement du personnel des communes. La mise en œuvre de ces instruments légaux
sera accompagnée d’un transfert financier des ressources et des personnels d’appui aux
communes afin qu’elles puissent formuler et évaluer la mise en œuvre des microprojets
de développement local.

La Situation et la pauvreté du monde rural
4. En dépit des progrès enregistrés dans la lutte contre la pauvreté entre 2006 et 2008, la
pauvreté touche encore une grande partie de la population camerounaise et demeure un
souci majeur pour les autorités camerounaises. Selon l’enquête Camerounaise des
Ménages III (ECAM III, 2007), plus de 52.1% des Camerounais en zone rurale vivaient
dans la pauvreté en 2001. Ce chiffre a atteint 55% en 2007 reflétant une détérioration des
conditions de vie des populations des zones rurales. Par conséquent, le monde rural doit
être le point focal des efforts pour lutter contre la pauvreté. L’augmentation croissante
des prix des denrées alimentaires mondiales va certainement réduire la sécurité
alimentaire du Cameroun et avoir des conséquences néfastes comme : la baisse du
pouvoir d’achat et le manque d’accès aux denrées bon marché pour les groupes
vulnérables au vu de l’incidence élevé de la pauvreté en milieu rural dans le pays.
                                             47
5. Selon la revue du Gouvernement sur les programmes de réduction de la pauvreté en
2006, la croissance sur le plan macroéconomique peut être rapidement refléter sur la
pauvreté, si mesuré en termes monétaires (les autres unités de mesures de la pauvreté
incluent le logement, la nutrition, et les services sociaux). Dans ce cadre ci, cet indicateur
doit être utilisé pour d’abord mesurer le revenu par habitant (parce que la population est
croissante), et ensuite, démontrer l’effet relatif de la croissance sur ce type de pauvreté.
Par exemple en 2004, le taux de croissance de 3.7% du produit national brut
correspondait à une augmentation de 1.0% du revenu par habitant, parce que la
population avait augmenté à un taux de 2.7%. Par conséquent, le taux de 2.0% du PNB en
2005 a fortement diminué le revenu par habitant. En 2006, la situation était sensiblement
positive car le taux de croissance du PNB est passé à 3.5%, ceci, en partie grâce aux bons
résultats enregistrés des exportations pétrolières. En 2008, le taux de croissance du PNB
est de 3.9% ; Soit une hausse par rapport à 2007 (3.5%). Cependant, la croissance
économique d’une vue globale n’a pas considérablement contribué à la réduction de la
pauvreté en termes monétaires ces dernières années. La stratégie de « deuxième
génération » du gouvernement pour combattre la pauvreté a pour objectif d’identifier
d’autres moyens en dehors de la croissance économique, tels que l’amélioration des
services, pour assurer une distribution équitable des revenus et une diminution
significative de la pauvreté.

Objectif de développement
6. L’objectif de développement du PNDP-II est resté le même que celui du PNDP I qui
est d’appuyer le Gouvernement du Cameroun dans la mise en place d’un mécanisme
efficace de transfert des ressources aux collectivités afin d’améliorer l’accès aux services
sociaux de base (Santé, éducation, eau et assainissement) dans les communes cibles et
d’étendre l’appui au processus de décentralisation en cours dans les nouvelles régions.
7. Au regard du niveau persistant de pauvreté en milieu rural matérialisée par les
besoins en services sociaux de base et l’absence d’emploi stable et à la lumière des
avancées significatives réalisées dans le processus de décentralisation, notamment le
transfert progressif des compétences aux communes, cet objectif est resté pertinent tout
au long de la deuxième phase et pourra à la troisième, connaître une consolidation avec
un accent mis sur le développement de l’économie locale.
En outre, les résultats de l’audit technico-financier des allocations aux communes, de
l’évaluation par les bénéficiaires, menés par des consultants indépendants ainsi que ceux
de l’évaluation d’impact conduite par l’Institut National de la Statistique (INS), ont
démontré que l’objectif du programme est pertinent.
Le montage du projet axé sur trois composantes a permis de : (i) tester à travers le
système d’allocation budgétaire un mécanisme de transfert des fonds publics à 329
communes dans les 10 régions du Cameroun ; (ii) appuyer les réformes institutionnelles
nécessaires à la mise en œuvre du processus de décentralisation ; (iii) positionner le Plan
Communal de Développement comme un outil important de la programmation des
investissements au niveau local.

8. La responsabilisation de la commune à travers son organe délibérant assisté par les
sectoriels a assuré une coordination et une harmonisation des actions du Programme avec
les différentes stratégies sectorielles. Cette synergie d’action a ainsi permis de limiter les
risques de duplication et de gaspillage des ressources.


                                             48
Changement majeur survenu lors de la mise en œuvre
9. A la revue à mi-parcours, le changement majeur a été celui apporté à la forme du
Cadre de résultats. En effet, le cadre de résultat initial avait présentait une situation de
référence qui correspondait aux valeurs atteintes par le Programme à la fin de sa première
phase. Il a été convenu avec les partenaires de ramener les valeurs de la situation de
référence à Zéro et d’ajuster les valeurs cibles en conséquence.

2. Eléments clés ayant affecté l’exécution d Programme et l’atteinte des résultats

10. La qualité encore perfectible des microprojets. Dans le cadre de la phase 2
plusieurs mesures visant à améliorer la qualité des microprojets ont été prises notamment
(i) l’élaboration des plans type par secteur ; (ii) la réalisation de l’étude de faisabilité des
microprojets par les ingénieurs, (iii) l’adjonction d’un contrôleur à chaque microprojet et
(iv) le recrutement au sein des unités de mise en œuvre du Programme d’un ingénieur
chargé des infrastructures. Malgré toutes ces dispositions, la qualité des microprojets
réalisés dans le cadre du PNDP reste encore perfectible. La question mérite d’être
approfondie en vue des interventions futures.

11. La nécessité de promouvoir les activités de développement économique. Le
processus d’identification des microprojets procède d’une démarche participative et
démocratique. Cependant, avec la précarité du cadre de vie des populations en milieu
rural, les microprojets socio-collectifs l’emportent très aisément sur les microprojets de
développement économique lors du choix démocratique. Dans un tel contexte, le faible
niveau de revenu des ménages rend dans certains cas difficilement accessibles les
différents services sociaux de base mis à leurs dispositions par le PNDP. Ce qui justifie
davantage la nécessité d’encourager des activités pouvant permettre de relever le niveau
de revenu des ménages et l’assiette fiscale. Il apparaît donc indispensable d’envisager
plusieurs guichets de financement des microprojets des communes, dont l’un pour les
microprojets sociaux et l’autre pour les microprojets économiques.

12. La reconnaissance du PCD à améliorer. Malgré la prise de conscience de plus en
plus forte de l’importance des PCD, certains acteurs ne reconnaissent toujours pas en ce
document, le canal idéal de financement du développement au niveau local. Avec pour
conséquence des doublons et des actions non pertinentes sur le terrain. Le PCD devrait
revêtir un caractère obligatoire et s’imposer à tous. Un texte pourrait servir à lui attribuer
ce caractère impératif.

13. La nécessité de clarifier la notion de maître d’ouvrage avec l’arrivée du
MINMAP. La logique du processus de décentralisation voudrait que les maires,
moyennant un accompagnement adéquat soient de plus en plus responsabilisés quant à
leurs rôles de maîtrise d’ouvrage. Or dans le contexte actuel, cette maîtrise d’ouvrage se
trouve partagée entre plusieurs acteurs (Maire, MINMAP, sectoriels). Il importe donc de
clarifier davantage le rôle de chaque acteur.

Mécanisme de suivi évaluation
14. Le système de suivi et d’évaluation du PNDP II est destiné à consolider et à améliorer
le système utilisé pendant la première phase du programme. Il sera organisé à trois
niveaux : communal, régional, et national.


                                              49
15. Le niveau de la commune sera le niveau opérationnel du système. Les agents de
développement des communes seront formés à faire le suivi de la mise en œuvre des PDC
et à faire la collecte et la transmission des données au niveau régional. Ces données vont
servir de feedback aux communes sur la mise en œuvre du PNDP et des indicateurs de
suivi sur l’environnement, afin de déterminer l’efficacité des mesures d’allègements
environnementaux des microprojets et évaluer si les microprojets implantés ont été mis
en œuvre dans un cadre environnemental et social durable. Les données collectées au
niveau des communes seront consolidées au niveau régional par l’officier régional chargé
du suivi et de l’évaluation du projet. Les données ainsi collectées seront consolidées et
analysées dans chaque région et seront par la suite transmises au spécialiste du suivi et de
l’évaluation au niveau central.

16. Les rapports de suivi et d’évaluation, comprenant les résultats de suivi sur
l’environnement, seront publiés trimestriellement au niveau régional et des communes, et
tous les 6 mois au niveau central. Les rapports semi annuels seront mis à la disposition
des ministères sectoriels et des partenaires de développement. De plus, les ministères
sectoriels seront étroitement associés aux missions de suivi et de supervision internes et
externes, à travers lesquelles ils vont s’assurer que les activités entreprises sont en accord
avec les normes et politiques nationales. Le projet va aussi lancer des études spécifiques
et des évaluations d’impact indépendantes si cela est nécessaire ou au plus tard à mi-
parcours du projet.

17. Suivi de l’environnement. Au niveau du projet, le système de suivi et d’évaluation du
PNDP va intégrer les indicateurs environnementaux de suivi afin de déterminer (a)
l’efficacité des mesures d’atténuation environnementale, lors de la mise en œuvre des
microprojets, et (b) la durabilité sociale et environnementale des microprojets en
exécution.

18. Au niveau des microprojets, les indicateurs de suivi sur l’environnement vont mettre
l’accent sur (a) le nombre de microprojets entrepris d’une manière durable sur le plan
social et environnemental; (b) le nombre des centres de santé qui auront adoptés des
mesures de gestion des déchets; (c) le nombre de microprojets basés dans les marchés qui
auront adoptés des mesures de gestion des déchets; (d) le nombre de femmes participant à
la formulation des microprojets; et (e) le nombre de femmes qui gèrent des points d’eau
afin de déterminer si les critères de genre et les mesures d’atténuation sont incorporés
dans la formulation et la mise en œuvre des microprojets.

19. Comme il a été mentionné plus haut, les résultats de suivi sur l’environnement seront
inclus dans les rapports de progrès trimestriels du PNDP afin d’informer le personnel, des
éventuels manquements qui pourraient apparaître. A mi-parcours et à la fin du PNDP II,
les audits sur l’environnement seront menés afin de mesurer l’impact social et
environnemental des microprojets financés par le PNDP II.

Troisième phase
20. La 3ème phase sera la phase de consolidation. A ce titre, elle contribuera à financer
les priorités identifiées lors des phases précédentes avec un accent sur : (i) la
consolidation de la couverture nationale du Programme à travers la prise en compte des
communes d’arrondissement dont la plupart sont constituées à plus 60 % des zones


                                             50
rurales; (ii) l'appui institutionnel et le renforcement des capacités des communes, visant à
développer un mécanisme d’auto financement du développement local.

A. Objectif de développement du Programme
21. L’objectif de développement de la troisième phase sera d’améliorer l’accès aux
services sociaux de base (santé, éducation, eau et assainissement, voies d’accès de
meilleure qualité) et développer les opportunités de l’économie locale afin d’accroître le
revenu des populations à travers la consolidation des acquis en matière de
décentralisation dans les communes couvertes.

B. Zone d’intervention et bénéficiaires
22. La zone d’intervention du projet d’appui va couvrir les 10 régions du PNDP II et va
s’étendre aux communes d’arrondissement non encore couvertes. Le plan de couverture
sera élaboré sur la base de critères définis en collaboration avec les maires, les services
administratifs du Gouvernement, la société civile, et les partenaires de développement.
Les principaux bénéficiaires sont les populations des 329 communes ayant participé au
PNDP II et celles des 31 communes d’arrondissement.

C. Principale innovation
23. La principale innovation concerne la première composante qui a pour but d’améliorer
les conditions socio-économiques, d’accroître la productivité des ressources naturelles de
base, et d’augmenter les revenus des populations dans les communes cibles du
Programme. A ce titre, le financement des microprojets se fera en deux volets :
    - (i) un volet pour les équipements et infrastructures socio-collectifs, pour lequel
       chaque commune aura une allocation prédéfinie en fonction des critères
       préalablement négociés ;
    - (ii) un deuxième volet sur la valorisation de ressources naturelles permettant de
       dynamiser l’économie locale, pour lequel un guichet sera ouvert à toutes les
       communes sur une base compétitive. Le budget de chaque volet sera défini
       pendant la formulation du projet. Pour ce volet, il ne s’agira pas du financement
       direct des activités génératrices de revenu auprès des opérateurs économiques ou
       des organisations professionnelles (GIC, GIE, OP, etc.), mais d’aider les
       communes à mettre en place un environnement favorable au développement des
       activités économiques qui méritent un levier structurant en amont.

3. Evaluation des résultats atteints
24. Le niveau de réalisation des objectifs est surtout mesuré grâce à des indicateurs de
performance contenus dans le cadre des résultats du Programme et des indicateurs
déclencheurs. A ce sujet, il est important de souligner que le crédit IDA qui finance le
PNDP est un Prêt Programme Evolutif (APL) de trois phases, pouvant se dérouler
simultanément à condition que les critères de déclenchement préalablement définis au
début de chaque phase soient atteints.

Niveau de réalisation des indicateurs déclencheurs de la troisième phase.
Sur les quatre indicateurs déclencheurs, trois ont été entièrement atteints, notamment :
(i) les projets de lois et décrets sur la décentralisation préparés pendant la première phase
du projet ont été adoptés et promulgués. Il s’agit de (a) la loi 2009/019 du 15 décembre
2009 portant fiscalité locale des CTD et des Décrets sur les comités des impôts locaux ;
(b) la loi 2009/011 du 10 juillet 2009, portant régime financier des Collectivités

                                             51
Territoriales Décentralisées(CTD) et (c) l’Arrêté n°00136/A/MINATD/DCTD du 24 août
2009, rendant exécutoires les tableaux types des emplois communaux ;
(ii) Au moins 90% des communes appuyées par le projet ont reflété les investissements
prioritaires dans les plans communaux de développement et le budget. Au stade actuel,
toutes les 178 nouvelles communes qui ont élaboré un PCD contenant un plan
d’investissement annuel (PIA) représentant la partie investissement du budget de la
commune. Ce qui correspond à un taux de 100%.
(iii) Du niveau de satisfaction des bénéficiaires qui était fixé à 80%. L’évaluation par les
bénéficiaires montre que 93% des Communes bénéficiaires sont satisfaites des actions du
Programme (appui à l’élaboration des PCD, mise à disposition des agents communaux,
financement et mise en œuvre des Micro-Projets, formation/renforcement des capacités,
fourniture d’équipements).
(iv) De la préparation et de l’approbation par le Gouvernement de la Charte sur la
Décentralisation. Le projet de la Charte a été préparé et est en cours d’approbation par le
Gouvernement. Globalement le niveau de réalisation des déclencheurs est satisfaisant.

Indicateurs de performance
Les performances du Programme, tels que mesurées par le cadre des résultats joint en
annexe 1, sont globalement satisfaisantes.
S’agissant de l’objectif de développement, le pourcentage de communes ayant amélioré
l’accès aux services sociaux de base d’au moins 5% dans l’un des secteurs : éducation,
santé, eau-assainissement et transport, se situe à 80,3% selon l’évaluation indépendante
réalisée par l’INS.
En effet, au cours de la deuxième phase, le Programme a couvert 329 communes et
financé 1 864 microprojets (816 sur IDA) dont 939 sont achevés et fonctionnels (763 sur
IDA).
Dans le secteur « Eau et assainissement », le PNDP a amélioré les conditions de vie de
737 100 personnes à travers la construction de 1 457 points d’eau et 524 latrines. Cette
intervention du PNDP dans le domaine de l’hydraulique a ainsi permis d’amoindrir la
fréquence d’apparition des maladies hydriques. En effet, dans les localités où le PNDP a
intervenu, la prévalence des maladies d’origine hydrique est passée de 61,8% à 9,2%.
Dans le secteur de l’éducation, le PNDP a amélioré les conditions d’éducation de 44 340
personnes à travers la construction et l’équipement de 739 salles de classe et 13 710
tables-bancs.
Avec ces réalisations, les effectifs des élèves dans les écoles ayant bénéficié des apports
du PNDP se sont accru de 6 points et le taux d’admission dans ces écoles s’est accru de
2,76%.
Les taux d’admission dans les villages bénéficiaires des microprojets d’éducation est de
82,4% contre 79,8% pour les villages non bénéficiaires.
Dans le domaine de l’électrification, PNDP a amélioré les conditions de vie de plus de
40 000 ménages à travers l’extension du réseau électrique sur 40,37 Km dont 12,46 de
moyenne tension et 27,91 de basse tension.
Dans le domaine de la santé, l’accès aux soins de meilleure qualité a été amélioré pour
428 925 personnes à travers la construction et l’équipement de 28 Centres de santé.
Comme impact de ces interventions, près de 41% de ménages vivant dans les villages
bénéficiaires de microprojets sont à 500 m de la première formation sanitaire, et 93% de
ces villages sont à moins de 5 km de la première formation sanitaire. Au contraire, seuls
27,5% des ménages des villages non bénéficiaires sont à moins de 500 m de la première
formation sanitaire et 87% d’entre eux sont à moins de 5 km de la première formation
sanitaire.
                                             52
Dans le domaine des transports, 18 villages constitués de 25 873 ménages ont été
désenclavés à travers la l’aménagement ou la réhabilitation de 306,4 Km de route et la
construction de 5 ponceaux, 2 radiers et 3 dalots. L’impact direct de l’aménagement des
pistes rurales dans les communes a été la réduction des coûts de transport. Globalement,
ces coûts sont passés de 400 FCFA à 175 FCFA au km et à moto, et de 200 FCFA à 105
FCFA au km et en voiture
Dans le domaine des infrastructures marchandes, le PNDP a contribué à développer
l’économie locale à travers la construction de 26 hangars et 368 comptoirs, 144 boutiques,
15 magasins de stockage dans les marchés.
En vue de renforcer les capacités d’intervention des communes, le Programme a
accompagné les communes pour combler les postes d’agents communaux encore vacants.
Au total, 521 agents communaux dont 259 agents techniques et 262 agents financiers sont
actuellement en poste. Ces personnels des communes sont opérationnels et leur
contribution à l’amélioration de la gestion dans les communes concernées est déjà
perceptible. Des données collectées sur le terrain en rapport avec la présence de ces
agents, il ressort que la contribution de ces agents dans les communes est
particulièrement visible dans l’amélioration des recettes, le taux d’exécution budgétaire,
l’archivage, le suivi de la mise en œuvre des PCD, le suivi et la redynamisation des
comités de gestion des microprojets, la collecte des données sur les infrastructures socio-
collectives.
Quatre-vingt-onze pour cent des exécutifs municipaux interrogés affirment que le
recrutement des agents avec l’appui du PNDP a permis de résoudre au moins
partiellement le problème de ressources humaines dans leurs communes.
Les agents recrutés ont un niveau assez élevé sur le plan académique et professionnel. En
effet avant leur recrutement, plus de 90% des agents techniques justifiaient d’un niveau
au moins égal à BAC+3 et d’au moins 2 années d’expériences professionnelles dans des
domaines plus ou moins connexes au développement communautaire.
Les agents financiers recrutés quant à eux justifient à près de 73% d’un niveau d’étude
supérieur ou égale à BAC+2 avec une prédominance des agents spécialisés dans la
comptabilité et gestion, les sciences économiques et les sciences juridiques.
S’agissant de leur implication dans les communes, l’ensemble des agents communaux
s’attèlent à bien exécuter les missions qui leurs ont été assignées comme en témoigne
l’appréciation de leurs rendement par les exécutifs municipaux. En effet, 71% des
exécutifs interrogés jugent au moins bonne la performance de leurs agents techniques,
tandis que 67% jugent au moins bonne la performance de leurs agents financiers.
Par ailleurs, de l’avis des exécutifs municipaux, la présence des agents communaux
auraient ainsi permis d’améliorer la gestion et le fonctionnement des Communes. En effet,
dans 50% des cas les agents de développement auraient permis d’améliorer le niveau
d’exécution du budget des communes grâce à leur implication dans le suivi régulier de
l’exécution des activités et projets programmés, leur appui-conseil pour l’élaboration
d’un budget plus réaliste et leurs implications dans les activités de recherche de
financement. L’importance de la présence des agents est tout aussi perceptible au niveau
de la qualité du suivi de l’exécution et de l’entretien des ouvrages des communes. En
effet, près de 85% des agents de développement auraient ainsi permis aux communes
d’améliorer la qualité du suivi de l’exécution des ouvrages grâce à leurs descentes
régulières sur le terrain pour le suivi-contrôle de l’exécution des travaux. Tandis que,
75% auraient permis d’améliorer la qualité du suivi de l’entretien et de la maintenance
des ouvrages communaux grâce à la mobilisation courante des membres des COGES et la
recherche des solutions endogènes.

                                           53
Pour les agents financiers, l’impact de leur présence est perceptible dans les communes,
notamment à travers l’amélioration de la gestion comptable et la gestion financière. En
effet, près de 66% de communes déclarent une amélioration de leur gestion comptable
grâce au concours de leurs agents financiers. De plus, les différents documents
comptables sont désormais produits dans les délais recommandés dans près de 72% de
communes et un système d’archivage des documents a été mis en place dans 80% de
communes dotées en agents financiers. En ce qui concerne l’amélioration de la gestion
financière, 64% de communes ont connu une amélioration de leurs recettes.
En ce qui concerne l’appui à la décentralisation, les actions du PNDP II ont visé
essentiellement le renforcement des capacités opérationnelles des communes, afin
qu’elles puissent promouvoir efficacement le développement local. A ce titre le
Programme a appuyé :
    (i) La mise en application du nouveau plan comptable sectoriel des communes à
         travers le déploiement à titre pilote du logiciel Sim_ba dans 53 communes. Sur la
         base de l’évaluation de cette première vague de mise en œuvre, un plan de
         déploiement a été préparé et sera mis en œuvre dans 100 nouvelles communes en
         2014 ;
    (ii) La formation de 889 membres des commissions communales de passation des
         marchés. Avec l’avènement du MINMAP, le Programme a redéfini les cibles pour
         les formations qui ont été dispensées en collaboration avec l’ARMP sur le Code
         des marchés publics camerounais et sur les Directives simplifiées de la Banque
         mondiale consignées dans le Guide élaboré à cet effet à l’intention des acteurs
         intervenant dans le processus de la passation des marchés et de l’exécution des
         contrats par les maîtres d’ouvrage. A ce jour toutes les commissions régionales et
         départementales de passation des marchés ont déjà été formées à l’Extrême-nord,
         au Nord-ouest et au Sud-ouest.
    (iii)La formation de tous les délégués régionaux et départementaux, ainsi que le
         personnel communal sur la prise en compte des aspects socio-environnementaux
         dans l’élaboration des PCD et des microprojets.
    (iv)Le recrutement de 513 agents communaux (dont 257 financiers et 256 techniques).
         Ces agents ont contribué à renforcer les capacités des communes dans la mise en
         œuvre de leurs PCD et ainsi que dans la gestion communale.
    (v) La fourniture des équipements. Les 329 communes ont été équipées en
         ordinateurs et en GPS, leur permettant entre autres de collecter les données et
         d’améliorer les conditions de travail du personnel communal. Les motos ont été
         acquises et distribuées pour 209 communes. Pour les 120 communes ne disposant
         pas encore de ce matériel, une commande est en cours sur financement C2D ;

Aspects socio-environnementaux
Selon les conclusions de l’évaluation socio-environnementale réalisée en 2013 pour la
phase, la prise en compte des aspects socio – environnementaux dans le dispositif
institutionnel et structurel s’est renforcée depuis 3 ans au niveau de toutes les instances.
Tous les microprojets financés ont fait l’objet d’un screening socio-environnemental,
donnant lieu à des mesures environnementales appropriées qui ont été intégrées dans le
montage technique et financier du microprojet concerné. Les sites d’implantation des
microprojets ont été retenus avec le plus grand soin, évitant les zones sensibles et les
terrains titrés. Des actes de donation des sites ont été fournis.
Par ailleurs, au cours de la phase 2, la qualité du PCD s’est améliorée à la faveur de
l’approche sectorielle et la prise en compte systématique des compétences transférées aux
communes, y compris celles du décret n°2012/0882/PM du 27 mars 2012 en matière
                                              54
d’environnement. Outre la consolidation des acquis du PGDT clôturé en mars 2012, le
Programme a travaillé avec le partenaire GIZ à l’intégration des aspects changements
climatiques dans le PCD. De même, à la faveur des fonds du C2D, le Programme a
bénéficié d’un financement de 3 millions Euros pour la mise en œuvre d’environ 05
projets communaux/intercommunaux REDD, représentatifs des 05 zones agro
écologiques du Cameroun, en appui à la stratégie nationale pilotée par le MINEPDED.
L’étude de faisabilité vient d’être bouclée et l’opération va démarrer dans les prochains
jours. Compte tenu du fait que le temps imparti à la mise en œuvre du projet est
insuffisante pour garantir la certification des crédits carbones, le Programme compte
solliciter d’autres bailleurs pour la mobilisation des ressources additionnelles.
Pour ce qui est de la mise en œuvre du Plan de Développement des Peuples Pygmées
(PDPP), il avait été convenu que le dispositif de mise en œuvre s’appuie sur le personnel
du MINAS au niveau communal. Une convention entre le MINEPAT et le MINAS a été
signée à cet effet en 2012 et par décision n° 002/B du 09 avril 2013, le Ministre des
Affaires Sociales a désigné, à titre spécial, 31 Chefs Service d’Action sociale pour mettre
en œuvre l’opération dans les 31 communes bénéficiaires des 03 régions de l’Est, du
Centre et du Sud. Ceux-ci ont été formés en juillet 2013.
Parallèlement à la mise en place de ce dispositif, les activités du PDPP se sont
poursuivies et ont abouti à la production des pièces officielles supplémentaires (673 actes
de naissances, 415 CNI, 17 actes de mariage, etc.), la mise en place de 1,1 ha de champ
de banane-plantain et manioc à Bandévouri et de 1 ha de banane-plantain dans la
commune de Lokoundjé, la reconnaissance des droits d’usufruits pour 15 villages
pygmées dans les communes de Niété et de Lokoundjé, etc. Le Programme a également
identifié et subventionné la formation de 15 enfants pygmées aux métiers de l’éducation
et de la santé. Il s’agit de : (i) 08 aides-soignants (1 an de formation) parmi lesquels 6
sont diplômés depuis août 2013 et leur dossier d’intégration à la Fonction Publique est en
cours ; (ii) 01 Infirmier diplômé d’Etat (3 ans), (iii) 02 élèves instituteurs de
l’enseignement techniques (3 ans) et (iv) 04 élèves instituteurs de l’enseignement général
(3 ans).


Aspects fiduciaires
Le financement de la 2ème phase met en action outre les fonds IDA, Etat BIP /BFP et la
contribution des bénéficiaires, les fonds C2D de la coopération française et ceux de la
convention séparée de la coopération allemande. En dehors des fonds C2D dont le 1er
déblocage a été effectif en décembre 2012, les autres financements sont pris en compte à
partir de fin mars 2010, date de dépôt initial du crédit IDA. Pour ce qui est des fonds
KFW, il s’agit du reliquat de la convention séparée à fin mars 2010.
La contribution au financement et la mobilisation y relative s’établissent ainsi qu’il suit
par source de financement et globalement en francs CFA :

S’agissant en particulier du financement IDA ( Crédit N° 4593 CM ), l’on peut relever
qu’il a été complètement décaissé ; avec en prime un niveau de mobilisation de francs
CFA de 20 193 571 303 nettement supérieur au montant du crédit évalué à
19 560 000 000 suivant le cours de référence fixé par l’accord de crédit susvisé à 489
francs CFA pour un dollar Us.

Au 30 novembre 2013, la situation des soldes des comptes joints abritant les subventions
accordées par l’Etat du Cameroun aux communes sur Crédit IDA indiquait, comme le

                                          57
montre le tableau ci-dessous, qu’un montant total de 5 514 028 175 FCFA était encore
disponible dans les comptes joints au. Ce montant se compose de 4 647 799 124 FCFA
destinés aux règlements des prestations réceptionnées avant le 30 novembre 2013 et de
866 229 051 FCFA qui correspondent au solde des différents comptes joints en rapport
avec les activités non encore achevées au 30 novembre 2013 et dont plusieurs à date sont
déjà achevées. Il importe de préciser également que ces comptes contiennent outre les
contributions des bénéficiaires pour le cofinancement de leurs microprojets mais
également les retenues de garanties des prestataires.


Principaux impacts
Les principaux impacts des réalisations physiques du PNDP tels qu’ils ressortent dans les
rapports des évaluations indépendantes réalisées par les consultants et l’Institut National
de la Statistique se résument ainsi qu’il suit :
a. Selon l’évaluation par les bénéficiaires des services fournis par la phase II du
   Programme, les résultats se présentent comme suit :
       i. une excellente couverture des interventions du Programme au niveau
          national : En effet, toutes les Communes cibles, sans exception (soit 100%),
          ont bénéficié de l’appui du Programme ;
       ii. une bonne appropriation du processus de planification au niveau local :
           les 178 communes cibles de la phase 2 disposent actuellement d’un PCD
           élaboré suivant les dispositions du Guide de planification élaboré par le
           MINEPAT et ses partenaires et arrimé au Document de Stratégie pour la
           Croissance et l’Emploi (DSCE). Les 151 communes couvertes lors de la 1ère
           phase, disposant d’un PCD arrimé au DSRP, sont en cours d’actualisation. Ce
           document qui est devenu un document de référence dans la programmation
           des investissements publics au niveau communal, a permis à certains exécutifs
           municipaux à négocier des partenariats avec certains organismes publics et
           privés tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur du pays. Par ailleurs, depuis 2012 les
           circulaires du Chef de l’Etat relatives à la préparation du budget
           d’investissement public instruisent de se référer au PCD ;
       iii. un niveau satisfaisant de consommation des allocations : la dotation de
            fonds IDA alloués au financement des subventions aux communes, qui
            s’élevait à 8,7 milliards de FCFA, est à ce jour consommée à 100% ;
       iv. Les différentes catégories de bénéficiaires (Communes, Prestataires,
           Services Déconcentrés de l’Etat (SDE), Populations) apparaissent
           globalement satisfaites des appuis reçus du Programme. En ce qui
           concerne les Services Déconcentrés de l’Etat (SDE), 96% sont globalement
           satisfaits du PNDP. De même, les prestataires de services sont dans
           l’ensemble très satisfaits du PNDP. Quant aux communautés bénéficiaires des
           microprojets, 92% en sont satisfaites en raison de leur implication dans
           l’identification et la gestion.


                                            58
b. L’audit technico-financier de l’utilisation des allocations par les communes pour le
   compte des exercices 2010 et 2011 de la phase II du Programme a relevé que les
   fonds du PNDP alloués aux Communes ont été utilisés conformément aux accords de
   financement. Aucun cas de fraude et de corruption n’a été décelé. De manière
   spécifique l’audit relève que :
       i. Les exécutifs communaux sont dans l’ensemble unanimes sur l’apport positif
          des Agents Communaux recrutés par le programme et comptent renouveler
          leurs contrats. Une formation continue de ces agents est toutefois nécessaire ;
       ii. L’archivage s’est considérablement amélioré au niveau des communes.
       iii. Les travaux des microprojets sont bien exécutés en dépit de quelques cas
            isolés de malfaçons relevés dans certains microprojets. Tous les microprojets
            réceptionnés sont mis en exploitation au profit de la population bénéficiaire.
       iv. L’adhésion des maires a facilité la mise en œuvre des activités du programme.
           Toutefois, une plus grande implication du Secrétaire Général de la Commune
           dans le processus contribuerait à de meilleurs résultats.
       v. Les acquisitions des biens et services financées par cette allocation ont fait
          l’objet des marchés passés conformément aux dispositions des accords de
          financements applicables fondés sur les procédures simplifiées de passation
          des marchés de la Banque Mondiale ; toutes ces opérations ont été totalement
          enregistrées dans les livres comptables des communes ;
       vi. Les ressources du programme ont été utilisées dans un souci d’efficience.

4. Evaluation de la performance de la Banque mondiale
Les partenaires techniques et financiers ont apporté un appui dans la mise en œuvre du
PNDP II.
S’agissant de la Banque mondiale, les Chargés de projets qui se sont sucédées lors du
PNDP II ont apporté une assistance technique considérable. Ils ont participé, à la
définition d’une méthodologie d’élaboration des Plans Communaux de Développement
(PCD) arrimé à la Stratégie du Gouvernement pour la Croissance et l’Emploi. Par ailleurs,
l’équipe de la Banque a contribué efficacement à doter toutes les 178 nouvelles
communes d’un PCD avant la revue à mi-parcours.
En ce qui concerne l’AFD, en collaboration avec le STADE-C2D, elle a facilité la gestion
des fonds C2D en contribuant à l’harmonisation du manuel des procédures notamment
dans le domaine de passation des marchés à celles arrêtée avec la Banque mondiale. Cette
harmonisation a permis le décaissement rapide des ressources allouées au Programme au
titre du deuxième C2D.

5. Leçons apprises
Planification Locale. A travers une démarche pédagogique visant l’apprentissage du
processus aux Communes qu’il encadre, le PNDP a accompagné jusqu’à date 329
communes dans l’élaboration de leurs Plans Communal de Développement. Ce document
qui favorise la participation de tous les acteurs au niveau local, définit la vision à long
terme de développement social, économique, environnemental et culturel de la Commune.
De par son organisation en secteur, le PCD est un outil idéal pour l’identification des
                                           59
besoins sectoriels à consolider dans le cadre de l’élaboration du Budget d’Investissement
Public. Ainsi, l’élaboration des Plans d’Actions Prioritaires (PAP) de chaque ministère
pourrait s’inspirer de ces PCD sous la coordination du MINEPAT.
Base de données nationale sur les communes. Au cours de la mise en œuvre de sa
deuxième phase, le PNDP a conçu une base de données évolutive qui contient toutes les
données des infrastructures socio-collectives et marchandes des communes. Une interface
connexe à cette base de données permet de produire des cartes thématiques qui facilitent
la planification et l’aménagement au niveau local. Un mécanisme a été mis en place en
vue de s’assurer de la mise à jour continue de cette base de données dans chaque
commune. Ce mécanisme implique les délégués départementaux et régionaux du
MINEPAT et permettra à terme de disposer en temps réel des informations précises sur
chaque commune.

Contrôle Citoyen. Le PNDP a réalisé une expérience pilote de contrôle citoyen à travers
la méthode du «Scorecard» dans 10 communes. Cette expérience a permis aux
populations de donner un avis sur les services fournis par leurs collectivités et
d’envisager des améliorations. Cette opération a fait ses preuves comme un outil de
gouvernance efficace à travers lequel des changements considérables peuvent être
capitalisés dans la commune. Afin de pérenniser ce mécanisme, il est envisagé de
rattacher son opérationnalisation à une structure pérenne et de réfléchir sur le
financement de sa mise en œuvre.

Instance de coordination au niveau local. Au cours de la deuxième phase du PNDP, le
Conseil Municipal Elargi aux Sectoriels (COMES) a été l’instance de mise en cohérence
des actions de développement avec les politiques sectorielles dans le cadre du PNDP. Il
est donc important que cette instance soit consolidée et valorisée dans chaque commune
afin d’éviter des doublons et garantir la synergie et l’adéquation des actions de
développement au niveau communal. Cette instance devrait entre autres avoir pour
missions, la coordination des actions au niveau communal (BIP, ONG,
projets/programmes, etc.), la synergie des interventions de tous les acteurs et la
promotion de l’intercommunalité. La participation des sectoriels à cette instance pourrait
être supportée entre autres par la Dotation Générale de la Décentralisation dédiée au
fonctionnement.

Gestion des allocations budgétaires par les communes. Au cours de la 2ème phase, le
PNDP a procédé au financement des communes sur la base des allocations. Ce système a
permis de renforcer les capacités des maires en maîtrise d’ouvrage, les disposant ainsi à
exercer les compétences qui leur sont progressivement transférées par l’Etat central. Il a
également permis une plus grande efficience dans la gestion de ces ressources. En effet,
avec le jeu de la concurrence au cours du processus de passation des marchés, les maires
ont été en mesure de réaliser un plus grand nombre de microprojets et faire profiter un
maximum de populations.

La capitalisation des acquis du PNDP. Avec l’expérience satisfaisante des phases 1 et 2
de la mise en œuvre du PNDP, on note tout de même que l’appropriation des enjeux et
des mécanismes de maîtrise d’ouvrage demeure assez lente au niveau des communes. Cet
état de chose inhérent à toute mutation sociale, devrait pousser à réfléchir sur un moyen
d’accompagner le processus de décentralisation, afin d’en assurer le succès. A cet effet,
les résultats et expériences du PNDP pourraient être capitalisés dans le cadre d’une

                                           60
agence de développement local qui s’occuperait de l’appui à la Maîtrise d’ouvrage, étant
entendu que la configuration actuelle des structures d’accompagnement des communes
est déjà dotée d’organismes dédiés au financement des communes.
