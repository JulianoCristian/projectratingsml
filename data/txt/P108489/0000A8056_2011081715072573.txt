                         The objective of the proposed Statistical Strengthening Loan is to support the implementation of a GoI centrally sponsored scheme to strengthen state
                         statistical systems within a national framework. This loan is formally part of CAS outcome I, achieving rapid, inclusive growth, by improving the coverage and
                         quality of official statistics generally and by supporting the implementation of a reform program for the statistical system in the states it will also support the
                         other outcomes. In particular, by working directly to strengthen the results process in States and Union Territories it will also provide direct support to
                         monitoring and evaluation of all Bank operations.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.       Since the SSL became effective in August 2010, there has been significant progress in strengthening the Indian Statistical System, especially at the level of states and
                         below. The National Strategic Statistical Plan (2008) provides an overview of the system as a whole and its anticipated development. The update of the NSSP, which will be drafted
                         by the end of 2011, will be able to document a significant number of new developments. In addition to the ISSP, the Thirteenth Finance Commission award will provide a substantial
                         investment in statistical capacity in districts and the proposed BSLLD scheme will, if approved, carry this investment down to the local administrative level. This point to an increased
                         awareness of the importance of statistics at all levels in India. This is an important set of developments and one to which the Bank support through the SSL has been able to
                         contribute. Both ISSP and the Thirteenth Finance Commission grant will benefit from an increased interest in statistics at the state level and below and it will remain important to
                         ensure that both programs are well coordinated through the SSSP.
                         2.       By June 10, 2011 a total of 33 states/UTs had indicated their willingness to participate in ISSP through signing Letters of Participation (LOP). Out of these 33 states, 31
                         have set up High-Level Steering Committees to guide, direct, supervise and monitor the process of preparation of SSSPs and the implementation of MOUs. At the same time, 29
                         states/UTs have designated the Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DES), or its equivalent, as the nodal agency for statistical matters and for ISSP.
                         3.       The SSL Program Document indicated that over a period of between 12 and 18 months after effectiveness, it was expected that a majority of participating states would have

                         completed their SSSPs and would have then signed MOUs with MOSPI. By June 2011, the SSSPs of nine states; Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan,
                         Tamil Nadu, Sikkim and Mizoram had been approved by the various State High Level Steering Committees. Of these nine states, three - Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat # have

                         signed MOUs with MOSPI and are now implementing their strategic plans. It is anticipated that the other six states will sign MOUs by the end of July or soon thereafter. The targets
                         of having three MOUs signed and seven states with complete SSSPs by the end of December 2010 were not achieved, but considerable progress has been made since. By June
                         2011, the first tranche of funds due under the MOU had been disbursed to Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is anticipated therefore, that by February 2012, which will be 18
                         months after the SSL became effective, at least 60 per cent of states will have finalized their SSSPs.
                         4.         The signed MOUs for Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat include an action plan to develop key statistical activities and identify the results to be generated and the sequence
                         of activities that are needed to achieve these. For the rest of the states/UTs the action plans to develop the key statistical activities will be an integral part of their SSSPs. All the
                         states where SSSPs have been completed are now focusing on implementation and how to ensure the rapid disbursement and proper utilization of ISSP funds from MOSPI.
                         5.         Following the Aide Memoire of the February 2011 mission actions have been taken to strengthen the capacity of PSG based on the recommendations of the High-Level
                         Steering Committee at its meeting held on March 18, 2011. The PSG and the Technical Support Group (TSG) are working closely together and report jointly to the Additional Director
                         General, Coordination and Publication Department (CAP).
                         6.         The senior GOI statistical officers posted in the states (Deputy Director Generals # DDG) have been entrusted with the duty of coordinating with the Directors of the State
                         Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DES) and with providing regular feedback to MOSPI on the progress of ISSP. After a slow start, the role of these officers has been clarified
                         and it is felt that they are now playing an important part in maintaining links with the states and in helping to resolve problems.
                         7.         Positive features of the preparation of SSSP process have included: user needs workshops have been held; a considerable number of posts that have been vacant for years
                         have been filled and some states are creating additional posts, which may well reflect the increase in interest in statistics created by ISSP in states; the line departments in states
                         seem to have been included in the SSSP process; the SSSPs show considerable coverage and funding for the statistical activities of state line departments in addition to the DESs;
                         and regional and state-level training institutes are being proposed. Overall, at least in the first group of states where progress has been most advanced, evidence on the ground is of
                         considerable progress.
                         8.         It is expected that ISSP will be continued through the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. As the scheme rolls out it will be essential for MOSPI and the states to be able to
                         demonstrate real and effective results and outcomes. For the time being most of the results are focused on processes, such as the number of SSSPs prepared and MOUs signed. In
                         the short to medium term, however, it will be essential to be able to document improvements in the quality, coverage, timeliness, availability and use of statistics nationally and in the
                         states.
