The major lesson for similar operations is\n            that budget support for institutional reforms should only be\n            used with strong and mature country systems, and with\n            greater emphasis on knowledge transfer and strengthening\n            analytical capacity. Although the operation ensured resource\n            transfers and helped jump start the reform process,\n            knowledge transfer is becoming a bottleneck in the\n            implementation at the state level. Despite the lengthy and\n            comprehensive design period, the development of the State\n            Strategic Statistical Plan (SSSPs) has turned out to be a\n            more difficult task for most of the states and only a few of\n            the most advanced have managed to produce good quality\n            strategic documents. The implementation of the strategies is\n            also much more challenging task and even the most advanced\n            states will require support in how to do the changes,\n            particularly in terms of sharing good practices and lessons.\n            Given the experience gained so far, the design of the\n            program might also be strengthened by incorporating\n            intermediate steps between the actions and the final\n            outcomes in the policy matrix. Currently there is a big gap\n            in the matrix between the initial process steps, covered in\n            the loan period (2010), and the expected outcomes in 2015.\n            Setting out the trajectory of the delivery chain from the\n            start, including the intermediate milestones, could help\n            Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI)\n            better manage the pace and path of the reforms. By flexibly\n            managing the trajectory on an ongoing basis MOSPI might be\n            better equipped to adjust to delays, exogenous shocks and\n            other factors."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
