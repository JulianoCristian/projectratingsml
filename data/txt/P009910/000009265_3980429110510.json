The\n            project's overall objective was to improve quality and\n            access to family welfare services by improving state-wide\n            training systems and the environment in which the trained\n            worker would operate. The project's specific objectives\n            were to (a) improve the efficiency of the human resources\n            development (HRD) and training systems; (b) expand training\n            capacity to meet staffing requirements; (c) improve quality\n            of training; and (d) enhance the service delivery system in\n            which the trained worker would operate. Some lessons learned\n            are:  Strengthening stateside implementation systems in\n            three \"backward\" states and provided several\n            lessons for project design in states with weak institutional\n            and financial capacity. Bank support would be more effective\n            if designed as notional commitment to sustained medium term\n            support, with an explicitly articulated strategy for\n            incremental institutional strengthening, implemented through\n            successive, short duration projects with benchmarked\n            performance-based financing of subsequent projects.  This\n            project provided valuable experience on issues that needed\n            to be addressed to improve technical quality in civil works\n            and training. For quality improvement in scattered small\n            civil works, standardized model drawings with technical\n            specifications and adequate provision for supervision would\n            be critical. For training, it is important to adequate\n            provision for upgrading worker proficiency in all domains\n            that would be required for high quality service provision."}, "docdt": "1998-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
