                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its second phase of achieving its development objectives (PDO). The original objective was to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to
                         help at least 28,000 poorest households in a timely manner to reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food prices. The project was successfully implemented by FAO and its
                         total amount of US$5 million was fully disbursed in March 2009. The first phase had fully achieved its emergency objectives of providing inputs to 94,000 households (surpassing the

                         target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the project).

                         The progress towards achieving project development objectives remains satisfactory, and all PDO indicators are expected to be achieved prior to the Closing Date of May 1, 2013.
                         The implementation of Component D Community Production Groups (CPGs) continues to be successful with existing 1,095 CPGs and 183 new CPGs have been established out of
                         revolving seed/livestock funds) with a total of 20,527 beneficiaries of whom about 75% are women. For all crop CPGs that have completed their activities, seed has been returned in
                         the required quantities, properly stored and processed. All livestock (poultry and rabbit) groups have completed distributing the offspring to other members within their groups.
                         Significant progress has now been made under Component E (Agro-input Supply Market Development). Fertilizer (1,860 t) was distributed to 12 contracted agro-dealers in July and
                         sales are now underway. The fertilizer distribution has been coupled with an awareness campaign, workshops and training, and establishment of 12 plots to demonstrate the value of
                         using fertilizer under a contract with an NGO responsible for implementation.
