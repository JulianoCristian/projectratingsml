Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The objectives of the project are: (i) to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock 
to help at least 55,000 poorest households; (ii) to improve the ability of poor households to deal with seed 
shortages due to poor crops; and (iii) to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food 
production and diversification.

Restructuring Paper 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The proposed changes include: (i) adding a new activity, a temporary revolving fund for 
fertilizer imports, 
to Component E “Agro-Input Supply Market Development”; (ii) revision of 
the project’s institutional arrangements, specifically for the Project Management Unit to 
implement all activities under the project; and (iii) reallocation of funds in the amount of $1.815 
million under the Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid Response Trust Fund (TF095317-TJ) from 
Component A and C to Component E.  The proposed changes are requested by the Government 
to provide additional support to Component E in the face of unexpected events that constrain 
implementation of activities as originally planned.  The proposed changes would enable the full 
achievement of the Project Development Objectives, specifically part (iii) of the PDO.  
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2. 
Overall, the project has made significant progress toward achieving the PDOs, with some 
outcome indicator targets exceeded, and implementation progress is rated moderately 
satisfactory.  Thus, the Grant TF092337 in the amount of US$5 million was fully disbursed and 
around 12% of the Grant TF115953 in the amount US$6.25 million has been disbursed since the 
Effectiveness Date of April 9, 2010 and is expected to be fully disbursed by the current Closing 
Date of May 1, 2013. However, food security in the country remains fragile, with agricultural 
input distribution and cotton cultivation replacement for food crops remaining the biggest 
challenges in the country.  Financial management (FM) is rated moderately satisfactory and there 
are no overdue audits.
 
PROPOSED CHANGES 
 
·
Changes in Component E 
 
3. 
It is proposed to introduce a new activity–setting up a temporary Revolving Fund for 
fertilizer imports – to Component E to help private commercial farmers cope with the collapse of 
the existing fertilizer supply chain and allow continued progress towards meeting part (iii) of the 
PDO, “to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food production and 
diversification.”  The Project Management Unit (PMU) will set up the Revolving Fund into 
which Project funds will be deposited in order to pay international fertilizer suppliers and collect 
sales proceeds from local merchants.  Fertilizer will be procured according to World Bank 
guidelines and imported on a Cost, Insurance, Freight (CIF) basis.  The PMU will use existing 
storage sites to store fertilizers and purchase insurance for theft and wastage due to fire, flood 
and other natural events.  The PMU will also identify large fertilizer dealers who have the 
potential to build a large client base for the types of fertilizers needed by the Project and can 
Page  7

import on their own after the project’s support is removed.  The eligibility of merchants will be 
subject to the Bank’s No Objection. 
 
4. 
The revolving fund will stay in operation for three crop cycles to allow a maximum 
demonstration effect of benefits from the new types of fertilizers as well as to give time and 
space to local merchants to position their operations for non-cotton crop fertilizers.  After three 
crop cycles, the Revolving Fund will be dismantled and the remaining funds will be subject to 
provisions of the project’s legal agreement between the International Development Association 
(IDA) and the Government. 
 
·
Changes in Institutional arrangements 
 
5. 
Institutional Arrangements for Implementation:
The PMU will now implement all 
activities under the Project.  The FAO will discontinue carrying out Parts A and C of the project 
as per initial design, as the FAO had completed its emergency interventions by providing 94,000 
families (surpassing the target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the 
project) with quality wheat, potato, corn and alfalfa seeds and mineral fertilizer. 
 
·
Re-allocation 
 
6. 
It is proposed to re-allocate USD$1.815 million under the Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid 
Response Trust Fund (TF095317-TJ) from Components A and C to E in order to support the 
above changes.  Funds from Components A and C resulted from savings under these 
Components, the planned activities of which have been fully completed.
