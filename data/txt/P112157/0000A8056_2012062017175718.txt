                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the project are: (i) to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to help at least 55,000 poorest households; (ii) to improve the
                         ability of poor households to deal with seed shortages due to poor crops; and (iii) to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food production and
                         diversification.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its second phase of achieving its development objectives (PDO). The first phase had fully achieved its emergency objectives of providing inputs to 94,000
                         households (surpassing the target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the project). The second phase is being financed under the Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid
                         Response Trust Fund (TF). The proceeds of the TF have been reallocated to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food production and diversification.

                         The progress towards achieving project development objectives remains satisfactory, and all PDO indicators are expected to be achieved prior to the Closing Date of May 1, 2013.
                         The implementation of Component D (Community Production Groups) continues to be successful with existing 1,095 CPGs and 183 new CPGs (have been established out of
                         revolving seed/livestock funds) with a total of 20,768 beneficiaries of whom about 78% are women. For all crop CPGs that have completed their activities, seed has been returned in
                         the required quantities, properly stored and processed. All livestock (poultry and rabbit) groups have started distributing the offspring to other members within their groups.
                         Significant progress has now been achieved under Component E (Agro-input Supply Market Development), including the preparation of the Operational Manual for the Fertilizer
                         Revolving Fund and recruitment of an international company to implement the activity.
