                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the project are: (i) to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to help at least 55,000 poorest households; (ii) to
                         improve the ability of poor households to deal with seed shortages due to poor crops; and (iii) to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food
                         production and diversification.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its second phase of achieving its development objectives (PDO) that were revised after the project had undergone restructuring with an additional financing from the

                         Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid Response Trust Fund (TF). The first phase had fully achieved its emergency objectives of providing inputs to 94,000 households (surpassing the
                         target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the project). Under this current phase the project has continued making progress towards achieving its PDO. Key
                         achievements include the establishment of the targeted number of 1095 Community Production Groups (CPGs) in all project districts. About half of these CPGs are already
                         operational with seed and planting material distributed and planted whereas the remaining CPGs are about to begin their activities upon receiving necessary inputs. The grant
                         proceeds have been reallocated with the purpose of establishing a revolving fertilizer fund to further promote private commercial farming, and activities pertaining to agro-input supply
                         market development are about to start off.

                         An assessment of land allocation, land tenure and water arrangements needs to be carried out by the Project Management Unit (PMU) and assisting NGOs for each Community
                         Production Group so that the uneven land security and water access issues can be properly addressed.

                         The PMU in consultation with the NGOs needs to explore options for formalizing the CPG governance structures as the individual CPGs do not have a charter (by-laws) defining the
                         responsibilities and their governing structure, and there are no regional and national structures other than the NGOs and PMU to provide continued support and representation.
