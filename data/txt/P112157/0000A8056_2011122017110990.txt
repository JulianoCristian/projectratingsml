                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the project are: (i) to increase domestic food production and reduce the loss of livestock to help at least 55,000 poorest households; (ii) to
                         improve the ability of poor households to deal with seed shortages due to poor crops; and (iii) to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food
                         production and diversification.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its second phase of achieving its development objectives (PDO). The first phase had fully achieved its emergency objectives of providing inputs to 94,000
                         households (surpassing the target of 55,000 households initially planned to be covered by the project). The second phase is being financed under the Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid
                         Response Trust Fund (TF). The proceeds of the TF have been reallocated to promote private commercial farming in order to increase food production and diversification.

                         Under this current phase the project has continued making progress towards achieving its PDO. Component D (Community Production Groups-CPG) has made significant progress.
                         Key achievements include the establishment of all targeted 1,095 CPGs, including livestock groups, in the 24 project districts. For all 695 crop CPGs, seed has been returned in the
                         required quantities (equivalent to 125% of the initially provided amount for grain and forage crops and 115% for potatoes), properly stored and processed, and steps are underway to
                         redistribute seed and add new members and groups. The livestock (poultry and rabbit) groups have all been formed and have generally distributed or will shortly distribute the
                         offspring to other members. Yields are generally higher than the national averages; for example, wheat averaged 3.5 t /ha compared with the national average of 2.1 t/ha while maize
                         yielded 5.0 t/ha compared with 4.1 t/ha, and potatoes 25.7 t/ha compared with 19 t/ha. The additional net revenue of about TJS 815 per household as a result of the project far
                         exceeds the average income of TJS 87 per month before the project. For Component E (Agro-input Supply Market Development), good progress has now been made after initial
                         delays, including drafting the Operational Manual for the Fertilizer Revolving Fund and taking steps to contract an international consultancy to implement the activity.
