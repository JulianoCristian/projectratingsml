PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Bangladesh - Third Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 872-BD)
HIGHLIGHTS
The third technical assistance pruject of US$10 million achieved its
principal objective to prepare projects for possible external financing. As
a result, IDA has so far financed four credits prepared under this project,
amounting to US$227 million. The project also achieved greater sectoral
diversification in the composition of its subprojects (25% agriculture, 19%
energy and 19% transport) and gave greater emphasis to institution-building
and training than was done in the previous TA II project (12.7% as against
5%).
The overall performance of TA III shows improvements in the process-
ing and execution of TA subprojects, thanks to increased cooperation between
GOB and IDA TA coordinators in implementing a number of agreed administrative
steps. Only 25% of subprojects experienced delays, compared roughly to 40%
in the previous TA II, and a little less than 50% of the subprojects fully
achieved their objectives while a little more than 50% brought about partial
success. The pace of implementation has also accelerated considering that
project disbursements were 25% higher than in TA II, covering an additional
15 subprojects (including 4 cancellations) within the same closing period.
Improvements were also reflected in the institution-building and
training aspects of the projects, defined in terms of narrowly focussed
functions (e.g. accounting reform) and of informal on-the-job training. The
project lacked, however, an institutional and human resources development
strategy and no provisions were made in the project to pursue these goals.
Strengthening the project prepar&cion and implementation capabilities of
operating agencies and line ministries remained an undefined goal for which
there is no evidence of actualization through TA III.



IDA's and GOB's monitoring and supervision of the project were
increased, contributing to an overall good project performance. The more
recent TA IV and V are intended to continue improving the processing ane
execution capabilities of GOB agencies. Nevertheless, TA III points out the
need for fuller and more systematic reporting on the substantive aspects of
TA subprojects as well. Inception and, above all, brief completion reports
on each subproject would help IDA and the Borrower to maintain the focus on
TA objectives, delivery mechanisms, and on the factors that contribute to
effectiveness ar!d impact.
Paragraph 31 of this PCR draws other lessons from the experience of
TA III, in terms of both the processng of this type of multi-sectoral,
free-standing technical assistance, and in terms of its potential institu-
tional contributions.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH: THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 872-BD)
I. Introduction
1.      Credit 872-BD is the third in a series of five IDA-financed technical
assistance projects (TA) provided to-date to Bangladesh. The latest TA  -
Credit (1440-BD) of US$ 25.00 million, approved on 2/2/1984, brings the total
amount of "free-standing" TA Credits to Bangladesh to $ 62.5 million.
2.      Although Bangladesh continues to receive substantial technical assis-
tance from many sources, mostly bilateral, IDA has become the single largest
provider of TA funding. In addition to financing the above "free-standing"
credits, IDA has provided other substantial assistance through components of
investment projects, through non-reimbursable TA arrangements, and through
its own staff in the course of lending operations, and in country economic
and sector work.
3.      The goals of IDA financed TA are to alleviate the constraints on the
country's absorptive capacity, which was considerably weakened during the war
for independence in 1971. Given the scarcity of skilled human resources in
Bangladesh and limited institutional capabilities for the generation and
management of development projects, IDA's and government's (GOB) TA strategy
was focused on pre-investment planning and the preparation of projects for
external financing. This pattern of TA has helped GOB to formulate and
prepare priority projects and continues to serve this purpose for now and for
the near future. A number of investment projects, financed through IDA
credits and other external sources, have resulted from this type of TA which,
in this particular sense, has been highly successful. With varying emphasis
over the years, IDA and GOB have also paid attention to institutional and
training needs of implementing agencies, and TA credits have included sub-
projects devoted to these activities.
4.      IDA's and GOB's approach to TA has evolved over the years, not only
by increasing resources and efforts to institutional and training require-
ments but also by improving the organization, management, coordination, and
utilization of TA. It is as yet too early to evaluate the performance and
impact of the five credits in the TA series that began first with US$ 4.0
million, (Cr. 409-BD of June 1973), then continued with a second credit for
US$ 7.5 (622-BD of August 1976), a third for US$ 10 million (872-BD of Decem-
ber 1978) through the fourth TA Credit of February 1984 for US$ 16.00 million
and the fifth, referred to earlier. The Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) has produced a "Review of Bank Technical Assistance to Bangladesh"
(Report No. 4231) of December 23, 1982 which included a survey of a number
of subprojects under the earlier TA Credits and an analysis of Bangladesh TA
issues in general. In July 17, 1983, Project Completion Reports were issued
by OED (Report No. 4550) for the first and second TA credits. This Comple-
tion Report covers the third TA project, Credit 872-BD, and should be read as
a segment within a continuing process of strengthening Bangladesh's invest-
ment capabilities for development and the management of its project executing
agencies.



-2-
II. Objectives and Characteristics of TA III
5.      Like the previous two credits, TA III was basically intended to help
COB continue developing a pipeline of projects suitable for IDA and other
external financing, through the preparation of feasibility studies, design
and engineering work and other special sub-sectoral studies. The project,
which was processed quickly to maintain continuity in pre-investment
activities, was timed to support the-launching of GOB's second Five Year
Development Plan (1980/81 - 1984/85). More than in the previous credits, the
emphasis was thus on building a pipeline of prejicts and diversifyinp, its
sectoral composition, which was previously concentrated on agriculture. A
secondary but important objactive was to introduce or help institutionalise
improvements in line agencies' capacity for project preparation and implemen-
tation.
6.      A third, implicit objective of TA III was to use the credit as a
vehicle for introducing improvements in the processing, supervision and
management of TA by both GOB and IDA. Learning from prior experience, GOB
and IDA decided to take a number of administrative steps to improve the
performance of TA III. These steps, concerned mainly the roles of IDA and
COB. As to consultants, the third party in the TA process, the main concern
was to simplify GOB's procedures in their selection, recruitment and deploy-
ment. The consultants' role in enhancing delivery of technical assistance
and training was not seriously addressed at this stage. I/
7.      The principal administrative steps taken under TA III were as fol-
lows:
(a), setting up agreed criteria between IDA and COB on subproject
eligibility for financing under the credit;
(b) strengthening the role of the External Resources Division (ERD) of
the Ministry of Finance, which coordinates all foreign aid, by giving
it overall coordinating responsibility for the implementation of the
project. An officer of ERD was appointed as Project Cov.dinator to
review and coordinate TA requests from line ministries and operating
agencies and to monitor their implementation.
(c) in agreement with IDA, 2RD's Project Coordinator was also designated
to assist and review the preparation of TORs by the implementing
agencies and to accelerate the process of selecting consultants and
negotiating their contrActs.
(4) IDA promised to intensify its monitoring and supervisiun of project
implementation through its TA Coordinator in the South Asia Regional
Cffice at Headquarters and to generally assist ERD through its Resi-
dent Mission in Dhaka. Approval of subprojects by IDA would be

expected to be carried out soon under TA V.



-3-
shared between the TA Coordinator and project staff at headquarters.
IDA, moreover, offered further assistance to implementing agencies in
the preparation of TORs and in the selection of consultants.
8.      In addition to the above steps, COB and IDA reached broad agreement
on guidelines for processing TA subprojects, starting with a TA form to be
filled out by requesting agencies, and later introducing some standardization
of TA contracts for consulting services. Finally, both sides agreed on the
need to accelerate disbursements by centralizing all withdrawal applications
with ERD's Project Coordinator, through better monitoring of work progress,
and through seminars on the subject for user agencies.
9.      The Development Credit Agreement incorporated the agreed criteria
for sub-project eligibility (Schedule 1) and the main provisions upgrading
ERD's role in project execution. (Sections 4.01 and 4.02).
10.     To eliminate any appearance of possible discrimination in favor of
foreign consultancs, IDA agreed to finance 100% of the cost of all consult-
ants, foreign or local, on direct-hire or as subcontractors 'previously, the
second credit financed 100% of foreign exchange costs but only 70% of local
currency for consultants, which GOB construed to favor the use of foreign
consultant). TA III also financed 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment
and materials required to carry out the approved subprojects.
III. Overall Performance of TA III
11.     Credit 872 has achieved its basic objectives and, through it, both
IDA and GOB have improved the process of selecting and implementing TA sub-
projects.
12.     The Credit covered 39 subprojects, of which 4 were dropped or can-
celled, and another 15 were transferred for completion or continuation to TA
IV (Table I). The number of subprojects is higher than those absorbed by TA
I (18) and by TA II (24). Credit 872 was committed within about 2-1/2 years
and it was virtually fully disbursed by June 30, 1983, one year behind the
original closing date.l/ Although the time span between approval and comple-
tion of the project (4-1/2 years) and the time it: took to commit and disburse
the subprojects remained about the same as for TA II, the pace of implementa-
tion clearly accelerated in terms of amounts disbursed (US$ 10 million versus
USM 7.5 million) and the number of subprojects covered. The level of perfor-
mance achieved under Credit 872 permitted substantial increases in future
transfers of IDA TA resources to Bangladesh, as shown by the siza of the
subsequent TA IV and TA V.
13.     The credit led to four IDA-financed investments amounting to a total
of $227 million, and in several ways, supported another six investments for a
total of US$123 million. Four subprojects amounting to about US$ 3 million
1/ Only 49X of the credit had been disbursed by the original closing
date.



-4-
produced the $ 227 million investment (Table II). When one excludes institu-
tional and training-related subprojects as well as the large number of ongo-
ing subprojects transferred to TA IV, the investment-producing studies
account for 78% of the balance of the subprojects covered by the credit
(Tables I, II and III). 1/
14.     The project also fulfilled the expectation that its sectoral composi-
tion would be more diversified than in the two previous projects in which
agriculture was dominant (roughly 45% and 83% respectively). The portfolio
of TA III devoted 31% of disbursements to industry, with five subprojects
amounting to US$ 3,093,098 (as against $ 800,000 in TA II) 25% to agricul-
ture, 19% to tra4.sport and 19% to energy (Table IV) Institution building and
training hiave also received a much greater portion of the credit's disburse-
ments, 12.7% as against 5% in TA II (Table III).
15.     The start of project implementation was delayed in the case of nine
out of thirty five subprojects, (25%), three delays each for agriculture,
industry and transport. Of these nine, two subprojects experienced severe
delays of about three and half years, (subproject 8 and 39 in transport
(institution-building) and in industry respectively). Another industry
subproject (No. 7. Jutton Plant) continued to show delays which had begun
already in the previous TA II. The balance of subprojects had delays of
between one and two years. Four subprojects have been extended into TA IV
but were not delayed and two others are also ongoing under TA IV for a second
phase (Table IV).
16.     Delays here denote: (a) time elapsed between IDA and GOB approval of
the subproject and the beginning of contract execution 2/, and (b) the actual
time overrun in the fulfillment of the contract. Compared to TA II, where
40% of the subprojects took more than six months to reach a signed contract,
(para. 4.08 of PCR), performance of TA III at 25% is better. However, the
length of the delays was more severe in TA III. This suggests that in TA
III, GOB had fewer problems with the selection and deployment of consultants,
although several minor issues arose with regard to consultants' roles and
payments. Instead, GOB's major problems involved technical matters such as
plant operation in the Ashunganj Fertilizer Project (No. 39), institutional
issues such as the organizational location of the Road Research Laboratory
(No. 8) or the scope of accounting reform at the Bangladesh Agriculture
Development Corporation (BADC) (subproject 12). Three other institu-
tion-building subprojects were affected by delays, involving TORs about the
scope of work or the adaptability of consultants' recommendations to existing
systems.
1/ The balance is $(8,731,115-4,897,936) = $3,833,179
2/ Beginning with TA II, subpro1ject allocations were supposed to be made
only after a contract had been negotiated with the consultants, a
procedure that was adhered to in most TA III subprojects. This,
however, did not prevent implementation delays even after contract
signature.



17.     Achievqaent of objectives at the subproject level is difficult to
assess with any!precision. In this analysis (Table IV based on Annex data),
full attainment of objectives means that the subproject not only accomplished
its terms of reference satisfactorily but it also produced the expected
results (e.g. Justification for the investment). Partial achievement of
objectives covers those subprojects where:
(a) TORs were inadequate for the preparation of the expected investment
e.8. Public Administration Development, (subproject no.1) or were of
secondary importance to it, e.g. Oxbow Lakes Fisheries - Sedimenta-
tion Flood, (subproject no. 6).
(b) not all of the subproject's components were accomplished. Such cases
included the Pulse Breeding subproject (no. 10) where a good start
was made in the research program but no actual breeding took place,
the Investment Approval Procedure subproject (no.18) where procedures
were liberalized somewhat without, however, affecting the rate of
investment approval, and the Advisor to the Secretary in the Ministry
of Agriculture (no.3), where the advisor's services did not have an
impact on the functioning of the Office of the Secretary. Only
partial accomplishments were credited in this analysis even in the
case of three subprojects which resulted in IDA Credits (Telecom-
munications Accounting (no.16), Drainage and Flood Control II and II
(nos. 31 and 38). As to no. 16 (Telecommunications Accounting) it is
still unclear whether the telecommunications agency can sustain its
newly acquired ability to carry out commercial accounting independ-
ently as a result of TA III efforts. la the case of nos. 31
(Drainage and Flood Control II) and 38 (Drainage and Flood Control
III) the training aspect had failed to produce the desired team work
in the first instance and in the second, both training and transfer
of technology are yet to materialise.
18.     In terms of the above criteria, sixteen out of 35 subprojects were
fully successful (46%) while 19 (54%) had partial successes. Of these,
eleven are still ongoing and the final verdict will have to await their
completion although substantial progress has been made thus far. The remain-
ing eight subprojects that had a definitely limited achievement thus far
amount to only US$ 315,109.
a9.     GOB has complied with all the major covenants of the Credit agree-
ment, including the preparation of a draft project completion report. Some
difficulties continued to occur in the relationship between GOB's line agen-
cies and consultauts with regard to definition of scope of work, payments,
living arrangements and general support, which contributed to the delays
described earlier, However, in terms of strict legal undertakings, inade-
auate support of consultants was a serious problem in only two cases, the
Bangladesh Water Development Board with regard to Drainage and Flood Control
II and III (subprojects 31 and 38), and the Food Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture with regard to the Foodgrain Storage and Marketing Study (sub-
project 28).



-6-
IV. The Process of TA
20.     The processing, supervision and management of TA has improved on both
sides thanks to good cooperation between ERD's Project Coordinator and IDA's
Regional TA Unit, acting as a clearing house for TA requests by the line
agencies ERD has provided a smoother processing of subprojects screening and
selection, and assisted the requesting agencies in the drafting of TORs aud
in the identification of consultants. A revised TA request form served as a
useful instrument for clarifying the objectives of subprojects and for
simplifying procedures. FRD's Project Coordinator has also helped strengthen
the monitoring and supervision of implementation. Only limited frogress was
achieved, however, in developing cost structures and other guide,ines to
evaluate consultants' proposals and contracts 1/, although ERD Ias provided
much needed advice to the line agencies on contracting procedur'.s, along the
lines of IDA's standard consultants' guidelines.
21.     ERD has benefitted directly from the or&anization and management
assistance provided under ERD - Phase I, subproject no. 5, which is continu-
ing under TA IV and hrs since been supplemented with UNDP assistance. These
incremental improvements in COB's processing of TA have not yet produced a
clear and well established institutic al focus within GOB for the identifica-
tion, coordination and management of Lechnical assistance. The absence of a
central authority (for assessing TA needs, for TA planning for the management
of TA activities and for the administration of TA personnel) is due largely
to unresolved institutional jurisdictions within GOB (particularly with
regard to the respective roles in TA of the Planning Commission, Ministry of
Finance and the line agencies), and to GOB's continuing ambivalence about the
extent of TA financing that it needs. On the other hand, neither GOB nor IDA
thought it appropriate or realistic to give the question of TA management
the priority and resources in this project that could have produced new and
viable institutional arrangements.
22.     Even within the framework of incremental improvements, the monitoring
and reporting on the performance and effectiveness of the subprojects should
have been strengthened considerably. Both GOB and IDA have adequately super-
vised the procedural aspects of project implementation. IDA has, in fact,
devoted considerable resources to the supervision of TA III, from head-
quarters 2/ as well as through the resident mission. Nevertheless, it is
difficult to get from IDA files or from GOB a full picture of the dynamics of
subproject activities, particularly those that do not relate directly to
possible investments. The files tend to concentrate on important contractual
1/ This is being pursued under TA V. A draft ;'Guidelines for Consult-
ants' Selection" has been prepared by ERD and reviewed by IDA. ERD
also completed a draft "Standard Consultancy Contract" which was also
reviwed by IDA.
2/ IDA devoted seven full supervision missions entirely to TA III and
some ten partial supervisions which also included other projects.

and other procedural matters at the expense of the substance of the sub-
projects, i.e., the soundness of their objectives, how conflicts between IDA
and GOB over objectives have been resolved, the causes of inefficiencies in
implementation and the reasons for effectiveness or lack thereof. This is
not to say that IDA and GOB had dealt inadequately with TORs, or with design
and implementation issues. Many substantive reviews have probably taken
place between the TA Coordinators on both sides and between the TA Coor-
dinator and Project Officers within IDA. But these appear to have been for
the most part ad hoc reviews that were not reflected in formal reporting,
either during implementation or at subproject completion.
23.     With regard to consultants, significant progress was made in TA III
in speeding selection procedures and in reducing the number and duration of
disputes concerning rates, contractual obligations and local support by GOB
agencies. The project has also had some success with introducing local
consultants into IDA-financed TA on their own, (e.g., Sugar Project Prepara-
tion (no. 14) and Telecommunications Accounting (no. 16). Some joint ven-
tures were relatively less successful in producing an effective team as
demonstrated by the difficulties experienced with Drainage and Flood Control
II (no. 31) and Highway Maintenance, Phase II (no. 32). Other joint ventures
did seem to work (e.g. Preparation of Extension & Research Project II (no.
20) although individual consultants were far more successful, (e.g. Potato
Seed Specialist (no. 21) and Chittagong WASA (no. 23). As pointed out ear-
lier, there were also problems of delays in GOB acceptance of consultants'
recommendations, (e.g. BIWTC Dockyard Management, subproject no. 37), as well
as of consultants' work with complex TORs (e.g. BADC Accounting Improvement,
subproject no. 12). These are normal problerms that tend to characterize
multi-sectoral TA in Bangladesh and elsewhere. However, the consultants'
role in delivering TA can perhaps be strengthened during implementation by
holding joint reviews periodically between them and GOB and IDA. The purpose
of these tripartite reviews would be to assess progress against objectives,
to redefine objectives, if necessary, to foiaus on particularly difficult ones
such as institution building and training and to develop a common approach to
problem-solving.
V. Institution-building and Training
24.     This was a secondary but important objective of TA III which received
some emphasis during implementation and fared better generally than in the
previous credit. Out of a total of ten disbursed institution-building sub-
projects, three achieved their objectives fully and the remaining seven had
more or less partial successes. The least successful subprojects were no.
33, (Advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture), no. 1, (the Public Administra-
tion Curriculum Development), and no. 8, (the Road Research Laboratory). The
most successful were subprojects 23 ad 37, involving respectively, the intro-
duction of a commercial accounting system at the Water Supply Authority of
Chittagong and Dacca, and the management of the BIWTC Dockyard and Vessel
operations, where on-the-job training was also highly eCfective.  Subproject
29, (the Irrigation Management Study), accomplished its purpose of assessing
various modes of irrigation management, but it is not known what impact this
study will have on irrigation management in practice.



-8-
25.     The above mixed results suggests that the effectiveness of institu-
tion-building efforts depended very much on individual subprojects, the
strength of the implementing agency and the quality of consultants. There
are, however, several discernible characteristics that emerge from an
analysis of the institutional aspects of TA III:
(a) the more successful subprojects tended to be those dealing with
specific, known, "hard" disciplines, such as accounting and financial
management (BADC, Telecommunications Board Chittagong WASA and the
management of dockyard and vessel operations).
(b) except for BADC (subproject 12 which grew out of a larger organiza-
tional study by the Ministry of Agriculture) these institu-
tion-building subprojects do not appear to be the product of a
strategy for institutional development, either individually or as
a group.  Most of these subprojacts (e.g., public administration,
ERD, Road Research Laboratory, Investment Approval Procedure) would
have benefitted from a phased, longer term perspective to effectively
achieve their objective...
(c) institutional development, training, and strengthening the
capabilities of line agencies for project preparation and implementa-
tion were combined into a single broad objective, without differen-
tiating their resource and design requirements. Although, in prac-
tice, on-the-job training was emphasized in engineering as well as in
institutional subprojects, none of these provided sustained training
programs that could have led to a longer term impact on recipient
institutions.  Institutional development in terms of reorganization
of functions, systems and personnel took place on a very limited
scale, as mentioned earlier, in the area of accounting reform. But
the effective utilization of these accounting changes still remains
to be seen. As to strengthening the implementing agencies in the
area of project cycle processing and management, there is no evidence
that specific provisions were made to accomplish these objectives.
In May 1980, ERD proposed a long term effort to upgrade the
capabilities of key ministries, but disagreement between GOB and IDA
on the scope of the program and on the role of consultants, led to
the effort being dropped or postponed.
26.     Finally, as elsewhere, institution-building and training efforts can
be very much constrained by systemic problems in Bangladesh's development
administration. This is a principal reason for the considerable scaling down
of objectives that IDA felt obliged to do in a number of subprojects, of
which no. 12 (BADC financial management) is a prime example. Multi-sectoral
subprojects obviously do not provide the continuity required to even begin to
address complex, long term institutional issues.  However, institutional
components of similar TA Credits can be improved by taking full account of
broader constraints (through diagnostic studies of agency-specific institu-
tional problems; before drafting TORs, and by embarking, where necessary, on
well-planned, time-phased institutional programs that could be carried on
from one TA project to the next in a systematic, rather than ad hoc manner.
(The proportion of institution-building subprojects transferred from TA III



-9-
to TA IV is small but significant, representing in amounts disbursed 15 of
the total transfers to TA IV).
VI.     Conclusions and Lessons of Experience
27.     The third technical assistance project has achieved its primary
objective of helping Bangladesh develop a pipeline of projects suitable for
external financing. Four IDA credits have followed from Th III subprojects
which also supported, in small ways, another six credits. Project implemen-
tation reflected the sectoral diversification that was expected when the
credit was approved.
28.     TA III has also shown a definite improvement over TA I and II in the
processing of technical assistance, thanks to closer cooperation and better
supervision on the part of both GOB and IDA. A number of administrative
steps agreed upon during the negotiation of the credit contributed to reduc-
ing implementation delays, to speedier approval of subprojects and of selec-
tion of cu.sultants.  Severe delays continued to take place in a small number
of subprojects, but these were largely due to differences in technical
approach between GOB and IDA or GOB and consultants, and to unresolved inter-
nal institutional issues within GOB.
29.     Institution-building and training aspects received greater emphasis
in TA III and fared better than in the previous credits. The effectiveness
of training, however, depended entirely on the quality of consultants and the
strength of the imple&enting agency.  Institutional objectives were success-
fully achieved in discreet areas and well known disciplines, such as dockyard
management, irrigation management studies and accounting reform.
30.     There is no evidence that the broader goals of TA III have been
achieved, nor is there any evidence that specific measures were taken in the
project to address these goals. These goals were (a) to enhance the
capabilities of the Ministries and operating agencies in project preparation
and implementation and (b) to reduce Bangladesh's dependence on externally
financed TA for these purposes.
31.     The experience of TA III suggests a number of considerations for
improving future free-standing, multi-sectoral TA projects of this type:
The TA Process
(a) incremental improvements can be achieved (in streamlining TA requests,
accelerating disbursements and facilitating implementation) through
agreed, simple, administrative measures, effectively implemented by TA
coordinators on the part of donor and recipient. These measures
should, however, be consolidated into durable arrangements to provide
the borrower with a closer institutional focus on its TA needs, on the
coordination of available TA resources, and on the management of TA
implementation. Such institutional focus could significantly reduce
intra-bureaucratic conflicts over the scope of subprojects or over the
extent of consultancy services, and help speed implementation. It
would also help the borrower to align TA more closely to its own



-10-
development priorities.  COB has often stated its perspective on TA as
a vehicle for bringing about a transfer of technology and for training
its staff, so that ultimately its need for conventional TA is
eliminated. However, for lack of a clear authoritative focus for TA,
GOB has not been able to translate its perspective into effective
policies.
(b) the monitoring and reporting on TA subprojects can be further
strengthened by emphaai:ing their substantive aspects in supervision
reports as well as in periodic reporting. The present concentration
on the procedural aspects of TA tends to obscure the importance of the
objectives of each subproject, how they may change during implementa-
tion and their final results. Brief completion (as well as inception)
reports would probably produce a much clearer picture on the effec-
tiveness and impact of subprojects.
(c) except for financial and contractual arrangements, consultants (in the
experience of TA III) tend to assume a passive role, limited basically
to the implementstion of their TORs satisfactorily and efficiently.
The consultants' contribution can bc enhanced in two ways: first, by
considering various delivery systems for TA, through twinning arrange-
ments, professional exchanges between the recipient agency and the
consultants' headquarters, as well as joint ventares with local con-
sultant services; second, by involving the consultants in joint
GOB-IDA implementation reviews. For example, subproject 12, BADC
Accounting, could have benefitted from an early revision of the scope
of work had there been regular reviews with the consultants of their
diagnostic findings, in relation to the TORs, wotk plans and time
constraints.
Institutional Development, Training, and Capabilities for Managing the
Project Cycle.
TA III points to three lessons in this area:
(a) TA subprojects can contribute to limited and specific improvements in
the operational and management aspects of implementing organizations.
However, without complementary measures in longer term training, and,
in management capabilities, these improvements do not amount to
institutional change.
(b) institutional development and training subprojects would be greatly
enhanced if underpinned by an agreed strategy that can also address
long term systemic constraints. TA III contained an implicit
strategy to strengthen the financial management of selected agencies.
In the absence of an institution-building strategy, it is not clear
whether the newly introduced commercial accounting can be effectively
utilized in the agencies' financial operations, and whether the
latter can train sufficient staff to fully integrate the new systems.
An agreed strategy can also help to transfer successful technical
innovations to similar agencies and operations. In the case of
training, GOB's emphasis is well-taken since the long term viability



-11-
of institutional change is intrinsically tied to well prepared and
well focussed human resources development programs.
(c) the management of the project cycle is not necess&rily a byproduct of
experience in preparing one or more subprojects. This aspect of
building institutional capabilities requires specific provisions,
including new resources, policy and organizational changes, and staff
training to introduce the relevant concepts and techniques. Their
success depends critically on improvements in macroeconomic planning
and investment programming.

Subproject Description and Performance
Subproject No.: 1
Title: Public Administration Development
Government Implementing Agency: PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TRAINING COMPLEX (PATC)
Date IDA Approved              : 6/5/1979
Cortract Signed                : Began Implementation on 6/21/79
Project Completed                November, 1979
Original Allocation            : $20,000
Final Disbursement             : $15,063
Objectives: To help GOB identify training needs within the civil service, as
a step in the preparation of a Public Administration Training Project under
consideration by IDA.
Implementation: Two consultants (one local, the other expatriate) prepared a
report based on a survey of a number of ministries. A preliminary report was
submitted in September 1979 and completed in November, 1979.
Follow-up Activities: This subproject was an early step in the preparation of
the Public Administration Project financed by IDA credit 1349-BD.
Evaluation: The Terms of Reference of this study were accomplished, although
it is not clear to what extent they were adequate for the preparation of the
Credit that followed.

Title: Vocational Training Preparation
Government Implementing Agency: BUREAU OF MANPOWER EMPLOYMENT AND TRAININC
Date IDA Approved              : Originally on 4/18/1979 (under Cr. 622-BD)
and then                       : transferred to TA III (Cr. 872-BD)
Contract Signed                : June, 1979
Project Completed              : November, 1979
Original Allocation            : $70,000
Final Disbursement             : $1,813,34
Objectives:  To finance local consultants to prepare architectural design and
initiate project planning prior to effectiveness of Vocational Training
Project (Cr. 912-BD) approved on May 22, 1979.
Implementation: In June, this subproject was transferred to TA III (872-BD)
with the entire allocation. On November 2, 1979 the Vocational Training
Project, the main investment project (Cr. 912-BD) became tffective after
disbursement of only US$ 1,813,34 under this subproject. The balance of the
allocation was thus transferred to an un-allocated category. Originally, an
architect and a project manager were expected to join the project, but
appointment of the project manager was delayed. Some progress was made on
architectural aspects.
Follow-up Activities: Permitted an early start on architectural designs and
some project planning of Cr. 912-BD.
Evaluation: Since the objective of this subproject was to finance start-up
activities of the Vocational Training Project before it became effective, the
objective has been partially achieved.

Title: South-West Region Special Studies Phase - II.
Government Implementing Agency: BANGLADESH WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD.
Date IDA Approved               : May 31, 1979.
Contract Signed                 : July 31, 1979
Project Completed              : March, 1981
Original Allocation             : US$2.0 million (later it was revised to
US$1.399 million)
Final Disbursement              : US$1,299,204.78
Objectives:  To prepare overall programs for land and water development in
the Southwest region of Bangladesh and feasibility studies for two specific
projects in this region.
Following the diversion of the Ganges Water and Farakka by India GOB
was concerned that the whole of the south-west region and parts of Pabna and
Rajshahi Districts of the north-west region might be affected. A PC-II for
special studies in Bangladesh was approved by the Government in 1976 for
studying the adverse effects of withdrawal in the region and for suggesting
remedial measures. This subproject represents Phase II of the Southwest
Region Studies financed under 622-BD. It includes the southwest Regional
Planning Study and feasibility studies for the Gorai River Development and
Old River Resuscit&tion Projects. IDA agreed to finance these studies for
$3.20 million, out of which $1.2 million was provided under TA II (Cr.
622-BD) and the remaining $2.0 under this project.
Implementation: The International Engineering Co. (IECO) which carried out
phase I of these studies was selected to carry out phase II. Although there
were some delays in the processing, signing and payment of the consultants'
contract, the work was completed satisfactorily.
Follow-up: The consultants, IECO, recommended several projects for early
implementation, mainly the Gorai River Development Project and the Old River
Resuscitation Project. There are two other stages, i.e., short term and long
term stages of the plan. The implementation of these two stages is dependent
primarily on the construction of the Ganges Barrage in the vicinity of Hard-
ing Bridge and storage dams outside Bangladesh. The construction of the
Ganges Barrage in Bangladesh is a major structure under this plan. Implemen-
tation of the proposed investment projects was, however, postponed.
Evaluation: The consultants satisfactorily completed the report in full
compliance with the terms of reference within the prescribed time limit. The
quality of the work is acceptable. Information presented in the Southwest
Regional Plan is useful and has been used occasionally in planning and design
of components of other projects. The Gorai River Development Project and Old
River Resuscitation Project of which the feasibility studies were prepared by
the consultants have not yet been considered for implementation due to IDA's
current emphasis on small and quick-yielding projects.

Contract Signed                : December 17, 1979
Project Completed              : March, 1981
Original Allocation             : US$40,000 originally were allocated under
Cr. No.622-BD (TA-II) and $20,000 under
Cr. 872-BD (TA-111) on cLosure of TA-II,
the undisbursed balance of US410,498 was
transferred to TA-IIl and the allocation made
under TA-III was $31,000).
Final Disbursement             : US$23,255
Objectives:  To identify causes of siltation in the Pussur River which
affects the Port of Chalna, and to determine what can be done, if anything,
to maintain the channels to the Port. Partially financed under Credit
622-BD, subproject 22. Subprojects 13 and 24 under this credit are also
related to the siltation problem.
Implementation: Satisfactorily implemented. Minor dispute with consultant
on payments settled.
Follow-up: The survey stage of Pussur River component has been completed and
a formal report was prepared by the consultant. Subsequently, Pussur River
Study phase-II was undertaken on the basis of the report of phase-I.
However, most follow-up investments appear to be uneconomic, so far.
Evaluation: Phase-I objectives achieved satisfactorily. Report submitted on
December 2, 1980 and finalized in March, 1981.

Title: ERD - Phase-I
Government Implementing Agency: EXTERNAL RESOURCES DIVISION, Ministry of Finance
Date IDA Approved               : April 1, 1979.
Contract Signed                 : Not applicable
Project Completed               : Ongoing (Cr. 1124-BD)
Original Allocation             : US$35,000, later revised to US$60,000
Final Disbursement              : US$50,914.50
Objectives:  To finance (i) a program of familiarization visits for ERD staff
handling IDA projects, (ii) local consultants assistance to improve
efficiency of administration, monitoring and implementation of IDA TA
credits, (iii) a study tour on the cost structure of consultants and
trainees.
Implementation: This subproject evolved out of the objective of strengthening
ERD s role in the administration and coordination of TA credits. Phase I h^s
been partially achieved and a report on the structure of consultant and
training costs was received and reviewed in August, 1982. A familiarization
tour to IDA offices in Washington took place in August , 1983. The
strengthening of ERD is continuing under TA IV (Cr. 1124-BD). Phase II,
involving the creation of a preinvestment cell and a computerization program
has been dropped by IDA and transferred to UNDP for consideration.
Evaluation: This subproject has helped improve ERD's processing of TA-III,
through effective coordination with different implementing agencies. It also
envisages rationalizing consultant fees in order to promote efficiency and
cost effectiveness.

Title: Study on the Sedimentation and Flood Level Oxbow Lakes
Fisheries Project
Government Implementing Agency: DIRECTORATE OF FISHERIES
Date IDA Approved              : July 6, 1979.
Contract Signet                : June 15, 1979
Project Completed              : January, 1981
Original Allocation            : US$32,000
Final Disbursement             : US$30,143.10
Objectives: To carry out a study on the degree of sedimentation in the lakes
of the Oxbow Fisheries Projects.
This subproject initiated during negotiations of the Oxbow Fishery
Project, Credit (890-BD) was intended to provide a detailed investigation of
lake sedimentation and storage capacity, and to determine the 10-year flood
levels at each lake in connection with the detailed design of embankments.
Implementation: At the Government's request IDA, in July 6, 1979, allocated
US$ 32,000 from Credit 872-BD for this study. The entire amount was spent
on financing local consultancy services. The contract/agreement was signed
on June l3, iD9, between the Directorate of Fisheries & Bureau of Consulting
Engineers Ltd., Dhaka.   During implementation, the concept of lake embank-
ments as propesed in the study was abandoned. Such embankments would have
probably been adequate from a hydrological point of view, but not from a
fisheries point of view, which was central to the project. The studies
showed that the rate of sedimentation was practically negligible in the six
lakes ensuring that the storage capacity of the lakes will remain static for
some yri.ip to come.
Follow-up: This study supported the Oxbow Lakes Fisheries Project funded by
IDA under Credit to. 890-BD.
Evaluation: This study was completed satisfactorily within its terms of
reference but these were later proved to be of secondary importance to the
project.

Title: Jutton Pilot Plant
Govs.nment Implementing Agency: BANGLADESH COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND
INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH (BCSIR)
Date IDA Approved              : January 28, 1977 Under 622-BD (TA-II)
Contract Signed                : December 31, 1979 under 622-BD (TA-I)
Moved to (TA-III).
Project Completed              : Ongoing under Cr. 1124-BD
Original Allocation            : US$2,080,000
Final Disbursement             : US$1,304,572.45
Objectives: To design and set up model plant for jutton (cloth from yarn
made with a blend of jute and cotton fibres) where 10 to 20 kg of jute fibre
will be processed at a time. Resulting fibres would be subjected to sys-
tematic tests for fibre characteristics. The jutton would then be blended
in different proportions with cotton and resulting yarn and cloth charac-
teristics would be tested. If successful, the use of jutton in commercial
production could reduce Bangladeshi requirements for importing cotton.
In the early 1970s, the BCSIR was requested to study ways of diver-
sifying the use of Bangladesh' F major crop - jute. Under this program the
BCSIR considered various blends of jute and other fibres including cotton.
In 1972, BCSIR developed jutton which is made by physico-chemical treatment
of jute staples and its subsequent blending with cotton, from which yarn and
textile fabrics can be produced. In September, 1973, the Government set up a
committee to evaluate production of jutton. It decided that a pilot plant
study was required to measure production and marketing feasibility. A tenta-
tive allocation was made for about US$500,000. Early in 1979, an IDA Mission
for the Fifth Import Credit expressed interest in BCSIR's technology and
suggested that an application for assistance be sent to IDA. In October,
1977 the project proforma was submitted for approval and it was decided that
IDA would be asked for funds from credit 622-BD to provide expatriate exper-
tise.
In January 1977, at the Government's request, IDA allocated US$20,000
from 622-BD for investigatory trips, including a visit to the Shirely
Institute in Manchester (U.K.). The Project Manager's report, submitted in
June, 1977 included the Shirely Institute's estimates of costs for developing
a model jutton plant for US$60r,000.
In November, 1977 IDA allocated US$605,000 for the construction of a
model plant by Shirely Institutes. In October, 1979 IDA approved US$331,000
under 622-BD and US$1,000,000 under 872-BD to meet cost increases over the
original estimate. In September, 1980 IDA increased the allocation by
US$282,286 to cover increases in contract price by Associated Agencies. In
October, 1980, the allocation for the project was raised to US$2.08 million
(total from both 872-BD and 622-BD).

By January, 1981 US$436,497 had been disbursed under 622-BD and the
remaining allocation (US$1.7 million) was transferred to 872-BD. In March,
1981 the total allocation under 872-BD was increased to US$2.4 million to
cover the costs of equipment, training, other consultancy costs and currency
exchange fluctuation rates not included in the contract.
Thus, after a long delay, due to a difference of opinion between
BCSIR and the Science and Technology Division regarding the contract for
procurement of equipment and machinery the contract was finally awarded in
March, 1981.
The development of the Jutton Pilot Plant was divided into two phases
as follows:
Phase - I : Design, fabrication and installat.on of machinery for
physico-chemical modification of jute up to the stage of
blending the modified jute with cotton fibres.
Phase - II : Spinning of jutton at commercial efficiency.
Installation work has been completed and start-up activities are
continuing under TA IV.
Follow-up: The subproject is proceeding satisfactorily under TA IV.
Evaluation: Project implementation proceeded satisfactorily, albeit slowly
under Cr. 872-BD. About 15 contractors including civil constructors, elec-
tricians, etc. worked on the various phases of works. With the closure of
Cr. 872-BD, the outstanding amount of US$272,000 available for disbursement
was transferred to TA-IV (Credit No. 1124-BD) under which a full evaluation
will be undertaken.
The development of the jutton pilot plant has allowed the BCSIR to
successfully develop its laboratory processes for modifying jute fibre by
physico-chemical treatment and subsequent blending with cotton to produce
a blended jute/cotton fibre - 'jutton' with a ratio of 65:35. Some progress
has also been achieved in blending jute and cotton in a ratio of 35:65. This
new blending of jute/tetron 'patan' should have more consumer acceptance than
jutton. If so, it will be a revolutionary break-through in the textile
industry in Bangladesh.  This project was sched ,ed to run up to June, 1985
with the plant facilities, utilized for further research and development
based on the jutLon process.

Title:  Technical Assistance to Bangladesh Road Research Laboratory (BRRL)
Government Implementing Agency:  ROADS AND HIGHWAYS DEPT.
Date IDA Approved              : October 24, 1979
Contract Signed                : February 28, 1983
Project Completed              : Ongoing under Cr. 1124-BD
Original Allocation            : US$ 711.000 ( Cr. 872-BD)
US$ 1.08 million (Cr. 1124-BD)
Final Disbursement             : US$ 153,760.39
Objectives:  To strengthen soils and pavement testing capabilities of the
Roads and Highways Department.
The main objectives under this subproject were (i) to continue assis-
tance to Bangladesh Road Research Laboratory (BRRL) in carrying out a routine
program of testing for the design and construction of roads and bridges
including the expansion of its field investigation activities and the intro-
duction of quality control (ii) to continue and expand the training function
of the laboratory which was introduced under a previous British Technical
Cooperation Program (during 1979-1979); (iii) to undertake urgently needed
basic research to enable the most efficient and economic use to be made of
local materials in road and bridge construction.
A proposal for technical assistance to BRRL with an estimated amount of
US$ 1.40 million was made by the Ministry of Communications on July 31, 1979
to IDA under Credit 872-BD.
Implementation: IDA agreed in principle to allocate US$ 711.000 for consult-
ancy services to be financed from TA Credit No. 872-BD. This subproject
has, however, suffered a delay of over three years until a contract with
consultants (T.P.0' Sullivan of the U.K.) was finally signed in February
1983. The delay was due to
a) differences within GOB over the institutional location of the BRRL.
It was finally decided that the BRRL will remain within the Roads
and Highways Department
b) differences between GOB and IDA over the scope of TA to BRRL. GOB
initially wanted IDA financing mainly for equipment
c) protracted negotiations between GOB and the consultants over the
terms and rates of consultancy services.
By the end of 1982, contract differences were settled and the consult-
ants mobilized early 1983. In May 1983, IDA agreed to revise the equipment
requirements of DlML under this subproject. As a result a $1.5 million
allocation was made and the subproject was transferred to TA IV. Work has
been proceeding satisfactorily.
Evaluation: The evaluation will be done upon completion of the subproject
under Credit 1124-BD.

Original Allocation            : US $ 1,400,000
Final Disbursement             : US $ 825,286.04
Objectives: To prepare engineering studies for multi-purpose berths,
proposals for improving cargo handling and operation of mechanical handling
equipment, financing and accounting practices, as well as to improve port
training facilities.
Implementation: On March 25, 1980, a contract was signed between COB & M/S
Maunsell Consultants, Australia in association with a local firm M/S
Engineering Consultants & Associates Ltd, Dhaka. The contract covered
studies on multi purpose berth,(MPB) trial dredging, cargo handling equipment
& maintenance & training schonl, and a cost benefit analysis of MPB and the
bulk fertilizer handling project.  The Maunsell Consultants started their
work in May, 1980. Their contract was amended as per observations of GOB &
IDA.  With regard to the tariff structure, 1/S EWP Associates entered into
contract with Price Waterhouse and undertook the study in January, 1981,
completing it in April. Another contract was signed with Australian consult-
ants for the "Engineering Study of Back-up Facilities for Multipurpose

but in order to meet a small outstanding payment, a balance amount of SDR
34,000 has been transferred to TA-IY (Cr. No. 1124-BD) aiter closure of
TA-III (Cr. No. 872-BD).
Follow-up Activities:
This sub-project assisted in preparing the Chitt;gong Port Project
(Cr. No. 1247-BD) signed on May 21, 1982 amounting to SDR 54 million. A
second phase accounting and tariff studies is being implemented under TA-IV,
to develop an effective cost accounting system and to propose an appropriate
tariff structure for Chittagong Port.
Evaluation:
The consultants satisfactorily completed their report within the
prescribed time limit, thus achieving the objectives of the sub-project.

Title: Consultant in Pulse Breeder
Government Implementing Agency: Bangladesh Agricultural Research institute
(BARI)
Date IDA Approved               : November 16, 1979
Contract Signed                 : October 4, 1979
Project Completed               : June 1982
Original Allocation             : US$ 150,000
Final Disbursement              : US$ 130,195.17
Objectives: To assist Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute in develop-
ing its program in the field of pulse breeding and production.
Pulses are important food crops in Bangladesh and a major source of
vegetable protein.  But the country is highly deficient in pulses--a deficit
amounting to 60% of total requirementa.  Development of an effective program
required long term assistance in the breeding and management of these crops.
There was thus an urgent need for the services of a person with wide
experience in pulses research for about three years at the Bangladesh
Agricultural Research Institute (BARI).
The objectives of this subproject were:
(i)  to identify prioritier in pulse research with due regards
to problems of Bangladesh
(ii)  to formulate a plan of research based on such priorities
(iii)  to execute the short-term program and initiate long-term research.
Implementation and Evaluation: A qualified expatriate scientist, with long
experience in pulses agronomy and breeding was selected on March 23, 1979
and on October 3, 1979, a contract/agreement was signed between BARI and Dr.
Kaul, under the Third Technical Assistance Credit 872-BD. This subproject
was an experimental study conducted by BARI. It involved a mixed cropping
study between ARHAR, Groundnut and other crops as suggested by the consult-
ant. The work done was a reasonable start to a research program which was
not, however, carried out because it was not included in the ADP fo 1983. No
actual breeding program was implemented. On November 4, 1979 IDA agreed in
principal to allocate US$ 150,000 for Pulses Breeder from TA Credit 872-BD.

Title:  Financial Management of BADC.
Government Implementing Agency:  BANGLADESH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT CORP.
Date IDA Approved              : December 28, 1979
Contract Signed                : August 23, 1979 (amended Nov. 30, 1979)
Original Allocation             : US $ 350,000  (revised to US$592,225)
Final Disbursement              : $ 264,116.45
Objectives: To assist BADC in developing and implementing improved systems of
financial accounting budgetary control, stores accounting, internal audit and
management information systems.
This subproject stems from COB's and IDA's long standing efforts to
remove institutional constraints in the agriculture sector, particularly in
the area of minor irrigation. A Ministry of Agriculture/BADC Organization
and Management Study had identified BADC's accounting system as one of thc
key priorities for institutional strengthening. No audited accounts had been
prepared for seven years (since FY71), store records were not kept in
monetary terms and aADC's accounting methods were generally not sufficient to
permit reasonable financial control and management. In September 1978,
therefore, BADC invited tenders for consulting services to help improve its
financial management system. The terms of reference called for the design of
an elaborate financial system, including program/performance budgeting and
management auditing, v3 well as improved stores accounting.
Implementation: 1/ In reviewing these proposals, Bank staff commented that
the terms of reference were too broad, did not focus adequately on the main
problem areas, and did not set out priorities for tackling them. They sug-
gested a three- stage program of work, stretching over a period of about 21
months, with emphasis on the updating of accounts, improved but simple
accounting procedures and the introduction of stores accounting. Stage III
(detailed design, preparation of manuals, training and implementation) shou;d
only be embarked upon if a plan of action, satisfactory to the Association,
had been prepared under Stage II. The Bank stdff recommended the appointment
of an expcrienced accounting specialist in BADC to liaise with the consulting
firm and advise on the implementation of their proposals.
As a result of these comments, new terms of reference were drawn up
and a firm of consultants (a joint venture between Bangladeshi and foreign
consulting firms) was appointed in August 1979 and started work in February
1980. The contract provided for 128 man-months of local consultant services,
supplemented by 26 man-months of foreign consultants, and included provision

Review, Review of Bank technical Assistance to Bangladesh. The Supple-
ment, Selected Case Studies" December 23, 1982, pp. 40-41.

for overseas training for BADC accounting staff. The Association approved an
allocaition of $350,000 for the study under TA III (872-BD).
Even these TOR were found to be too ambitious to accomplish within
the planned time period. During the initial review stage (Stage I), the
consultants found the scope of work much greater and more complex than
expected. As a result, the contract has been revised. Some of the more
elaborate parts of the study - including management audit and performance
budgeting - have been eliminated.
As revised, the project was divided into 3 stages. The first stage
covered a broad review of the existing systems and procedures and the second
stage envisaged preparation of reports outlining the system to be imple-
mented. The third stage, covered implementation of the proposed system which
was divided into 2 phases. The first phase related to the preparation of
manuals on the recommended system and procedures to be implemented, iden-
tification of manpower requirements, and the preparation of an implementation
plan and a training program. The second phase would focus on training,
implementation and follow up.
The first and second stages and the first phase of the third stage
have been completed.
Follow-up Activities: Necessary steps are being taken by BADC for implementa-
tion of the recommendations submitted by the consultants and the second phase
of the third stage is continuing under TA IV (Cr. 1124-BD).
Evaluation: It is too early to assess the likely impact of this sub-project
with any confidence. While most of the recommendations of the consultants
have been accepted by BADC, there are some factors which may constrain theit
effective application particularly the lack of trained and qualified junior
staff, which a consultant could do little to relieve. While seven middle
level executives were sent on a training seminar under the sub-project, steps
have yet to be taken for upgrading the professional qualifications of junior
accounting staff. An action program has been agreed with IDA and it is being
implemented under TA IV.

and investigation of the Pussur River and the outer bar to determine the
causes of siltation and subsequently recommend remedial action to overcome
siltatior. problems at Chalna Port.
Implementation: The preliminary Hydraulic Investigation and Hydrographic
Survey of the Pussur River was completed by the consultant (Mr. Farleigh)
with the help of Chalna Port and Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority
(BIWTA). Investigations of the outer bar took place during September 1980
and the report on the project was finalized in November 1980. Hydraulic
surveys were carried out between January and April 1980 by BIWTA and com-
pleted under IDA supervision.
Follow-up Activities: Follow-up investment unlikely because uneconomical.
Evaluation: The study was satisfactorily completed in December 1980 and it
provided the necessary hydrographic charts and other useful date on silation.

Original Allocation             : US$ 15,000
Final Disbursement              : US$ 6,860.49
Objectives:
To assist in the preparation of a proposed Sugar Rehabilitation and
Itensification Project.
The project involved the rehabilitation of three sugar mills at
Rangpur (RSM), Thakurgaon (TSM) and Rajshahi (RJSM) and the intensification
of sugar cane cultivation in the associated mill zones. The project's objec-
tives were
(a)     to increase the rate of recovery of sugar from cane by mill
rehabilitation and improved transport, and,
(b)     to increase yields on mill farms and in the mill Zones by,
inter alia, increasing the supply of quality seed and by
strengthening the extension system.
Implementation:
At GOB's request, IDA, in April, 1980, allocated US$ 15,000 for
conducting two studies, namely (a) an economic and financial analysis of the
project and (b) a socio-economic survey of proposed project mill zones. A
a local consultant was appointed for the first study and the Centre for
Social Studies of the University of Dhaka conducted the Survey. The
sub-project was completed at a cost of only US$ 6,860.00 out of a $15,000
allocation.
Follow-up Activities:
The subproject assisted in the preparation of the Sugar Rehabilita-
tion and Intensification Project (Credit 1399-BD) approved in July 1983, for
US$ 20 million.
Evaluation:
The subproject accomplished its objectives within the time prescribed
and is particularly note-worthy for its successful utilization of local
consultants.

Final Disbursement              : US$ 55,480.33
Objectives:
To introduce a modern commercial system in BTTB and to train person-
nel for smooth transition from the existing system to the new one.
IDA had earlier financed, under the Second Telecommunications
Project, Credit 487-BD, the services of a local consulting firm (S.F. Ahmed
& Co.) which devised a commercial accounting system for BTTB. This sub-
project was intended to help introduce the system. The terms of reference
for the implementation of a modern commercial accounting system in T&T Board
included:
{ii Training of officers/staff.
(ii) Set-up and re-organization of Directorates, Zonal and Field
Offices under the proposed system.
(iii) Preparation of parallel run of the new system along with the
old one in approximately 72 offices throughout Bangladesh.
(iv) To prepare draft accounts of T&T Board for 1980 & 1981.
Implementation:
Substantial progress was achieved in the preparation of commercial
accounts for 1981-82, which were due to be completed by March, 1983 as
required by the IDA.  But it was necessary to extend the contract period,
of M/S. S. F. Ahmed 4 Co. for an estimated period of eight additional months
up to 15th June, 1983 in order to prepare the final accounts for 1981-82.
Follow-up Activities:
This subproject had originally supported Credit 487-BD. Final
activities are being financed under TA IV (Credit 1126-BD).
Evaluation:
Accounting revisions for 1981-82 have been completed and new 1982-83
accounts will be prepared independently by the T&T Board. If this is done
successfully, th'on the subproject's impact would have been very positive
indeed. Independent confirmation of this is not available yet and final

Government Implementing Agency: BANGLADESH POWER DEVELOPMENT BOARD (BPDB)
Date IDA Approved              : November 18, 1980
Contract Signed                : November 22, 1980.
Original Allocation            : US$500,000 in November (later it was raised
to US$712,000 on April 13, 1982, and finalLy

872-BD (TA-III).
Final Disbursement             : US$1,906,,318.10
Objectives: To verify the feasibility and clarify the relevant technical
and economic aspects of the intended installation.
As a condition of IDA Credit 1254-BD of June 1982, for the Ashuganj
Thermal Power, GOB and IDA agreed that a study would have to be carried out
to assess alternative ways of meeting the growing energy demands of
Bangladesh. Accordingly BPDB invited consultants in June 1980 to prepare a
"Feasibility Study for preparation of tender documents for 2x100-150 MW Power
Station" at Ashuganj and on 15th August, 1980 Messrs. Lahmeyer International
submitted an offer for consultancy service. An agreement was signed sub-
sequently on November 22, 1980 between Bangladesh Power Development Board and
Messrs. Lahmeyer International to perform the following works:
(a) to verify the technical and economical soundness of the installation
of 2(two)xlOO-150 MW thermal units as an extension of the existing 2x64 MW,
Ashuganj Power Station.
(b) to prepare, after the completion of feasibility study, tender
documents for the complete supply, erection and commissioning of plant and
equipment if that was found feasible.
Implementation: At the request of GOB, on November 18, 1980 IDA agreed in
principle to allocate US$500,000 from Credit 872-BD for subproject No. 17 -
Power II preparation (Ashuganj) to finance the feasibility study and prepara-
tion of bidding documents.
Allocations were further increased to cover the costs of consultant
services. Later, due to a year's delay in effectiveness of Credit 1254,
which the subproject helped prepare, allocations were increased to US$ 1.4
million.
Follow-up: The outcome of the feasibility study was the Ashuganj Thermal
Power Project (IDA Cr. No. 1254-BD) which was signed on June 30, 1982. In
addition, the subproject helped finance the consultants until the Credit
became effective.

Date IDA Approved              s December 11, 1980
Contract Signed                : 24th October, 1980
Original Allocation            : $ 20,500
Final Disbursement             : $ 15, 838.59
Objectives:
To develop proposals for improving Government procedures for review-
ing project planning in private sector industrial investments.
Implementation:
1.      During the appraisal of Credit 632-BD (Bangladesh Shilpa Bank I), a
review of the investment approval procedures applied by GOB and the financial
institutions showed that investment was delayed by relatively cumbersome and
intricate procedures for approving private investment applications. The
delays occurred in three ways (i) obtaining preliminary clearance from the
Department of Industries, (ii) obtaining approval from the Investment Board,
and (iii) during the internal review process of the financial institutions.
Each process required preparation of the same data in different formats and
presentation in different sequences. Each process had differing review
limits.
2.      Under Section 3.04 of the DCA for Credit 632-BD to the Bangladesh
Shilpa Bank, GOB agreed to carry out a review of its investment approval
procedures with the aim of (i) eliminating duplication in the approval
process, (ii) reducing the elapsed time for investment approval and (iii)
liberalising investment sanctioning limits at institutional and ministry
level. A committee was established by GOB to carry out the review, and the
findings were to be submitted to IDA in March 1977. In May 1977 a memorandum
was submitted to IDA in fulfillment of the covenant requirement. The submis-
sion proposed arbitrary reductions in processing time and reduction in some
duplication. No discussion was given on the analysis of existing procedures,
alternative policies on procedures or the impact of the recommendations.
Accordingly GOB was advised that IDA did not consider the covenant require-
ments fulfilled.
3.        After considerable delay, COB responded to IDA's concerns and
agreed to appoint an independent consultant to review the procedures. The
consultant war appointed in March 1980 but due to procedural problems, did
not coience the review until July 1981. The first draft of the study was
made available to GOB in February 1982, and the study with GOB's comments
was submitted to IDA in April 1982.

Page 23
Evaluation:
Despite considerable time and effort in the review of the investment
approval procedures, the end result was unsatisfactory. Some actions to
speed up the investment process were taken and GOB allowed some liberalisa-
tion in the sanctioning limits of the concerned agencies. However, the need
for more appropriate investment approval policies and procedures existed, and
these issues were taken up under the Trade and Industrial Policy (TIP) Reform
Program approved in December 1983.

The objectives of this subproject were to prepare the completion
report for the US$25 million credit, which had been approved in October 1972
and was closed on June 30th, 1980. The PCR was to cover the five main com-
ponents of the project i.e., cyclone shelters, primary roads, feeder roads,
telecommunication and coastal fisheries.
Implementation:
The consultancy services commenced from February 4, 1981 for a total
period of 5 months. The agreement was signed on March 6, 1981 between the
GOB (represented by the Reconstruction Board (Planning Commission) and
Development Design consultants Ltd.), a local consulting firm. The draft
report on all five components was completed in October 1981 and subsequently
reviewed by IDA.  Disbursement of funds, however, was delaxed until FY83,
because claims introduction was retarded.
Follow-up Activities: None
Evaluation:
The subproject was completed satisfactorily.

Contract Signed                : February 25, 1981
Original Allocation            : US $ 54,000
Final Disbursement             : US $ 45,610.50
Objectives:
(a) To prepare work plans in the priority research areas identified
in the National Agricultural Researzh Plan;
(b) to assist in periodic review of the National Agricultural Plan;
(c) prepare research plan for individual research institutes
(sugarcane research institute, tea research institute, jute research
institute);
(d) to develop recommendations for resource allocations in the
different subsectors of agricultural research.
The "Extension and Research project" (Cr. No. 72S.BD), phase 1 was
initiated in 1978 in five districts of the North-West region of Bangladesh.
It became effective in January 1978 and was due for completion by June, 1982.
It included a component for strengthening the agricultural research system,
supporting the on-going Covernment program of improving research facilities
in Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute and strengthening Bangladesh
Agricultural Research Council to fulfill its crucial role in planning, coor-
dinating and monitoring agricultural research on a national basis and estab-
lishing a viable research system.
Because of the success of Extension and Research project, Phase-I,
the GOB decided to extend the application of the system to a further 10
contiguous districts, including further support for research. To identify
the scope and activities of the Phase-11 research component, ERD made a
request to IDA to finance technical assistance for identification of
activities under the Extension and Research project from the proceeds of the
credit 729-BD. Later, COB and IDA agreed that the Extension and Research
Project would best be followed by separate extension and research projects.
Implementation:
The contract/agreement for this sub-project was made on February 25,
1981 between the GOB acting through the Bngladesh Agricultural Research
Council (BMC) and the International Agricultural Development Service of the
U.S. IADS provided BAIC with the services of a team of four consultants to
work in Bangladesh for a period of approximately four weeks beginning on
March 1, 1981.

Original Allocation            : US$ 92,000
Final Disbursement             : US$ 66,741.82
Objectives: To improve potato production, research and development efforts.
No factor is more critical to potato production than a regular
supply of quality seed for the adopted varieties to sustain the potato
yields. Bangladesh grows potatoes over an 120,000 hactare but it still
depends on imported seed. Between 1979 and 1981, the country could hardly
supply 4X of its total seed requirements. Realizing the importance of the
problem, a potato seed pilot project was proposed and approved as one of the
components of a phase II seed project, with IDA assistance. Pending the
implementation of the phase II, project, research activity was initiated
during 1981-82 at the Potato Research Centre, through a grant by BARC to
develop basic potato seed production technology, and to produce basic seed
that would be available for a possible multiplication program. The overall
objectives behind this research were as follows:
a) evaluation of Germplain from diverse source in order to develop
h.eat tolerant varieties.
b) raising potates from botanical seed.
c) development of seed production technology
d)  storage research to develop low cost non-refrigerated stG-es
both for warehouse and seed potatoes
e) in-service training of scientists and other officers with
intensive exposure to new research and tropical potato seed
production
f) assist in the transfer of improved potato technology to farmer
fields
COB requested IDA for the appointment of a consultant from the Potato
Researcher from the International Potato Center to strengthen the on-going
potato program. IDA agreed to finance the potato consultants services under
the technical assistance Credit 872-BD.
Implementation:
The contract/agreement was signed on January 4, 1982 between the GOB
acting through the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) and the
International Agricultural Development service of New York, USA. The con-
tract/agreement which was made between Central Institute of Potato (CIP) and
Potato consultant Mr. L.C. Sikka was completed on 6.30.82.

Follow-up Activities: None
Evaluation:
The research tackled a series of problems involved with the produc-
tion of seed potatoes, including storage, areas for production, rate of
reinfestation with virus, spread of aphids and use of cut tubers. The out-
come was a series of recommendations which were useful to the potato
producers in Bangladesh and avoided the need to import fresh seed potatoes
annually from Holland. The work on true seed was rather academic, but could
have had significant impact in the long term especially since the cost of
transporting tubers had become very high. Screening work on potato varieties
resulted in the identification of several potentially useful varieties. The
program was a good example of useful results produced by a dedicated
individual.

Final Disbursement             : $16,883.85
Objectives:   To prepare PCR for education pruject (Cr. 407-BD)
The subproject was intended to prepare completion reports for the two
major components i.e., Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) and the
conversion of five technical institutes into Polytechnics. The completion
report was to compare the assumptions, objectives and implementation plans as
conceived at the time of project appraisal with the results achieved high-
lighting any substantial deviation and explaining reasons for such devia-
tions. It was also intended to evaluate the projects' impact on the agricul-
tural and industrial sectors in accordance with the project objectives as
conceived at the time of project appraisal.
Implementation: On December 23, 1980 IDA agreed in principle to allocate
US$40,000 under Credit 872-BD for the preparation of the project completion
Report (PCR). Mr. John Gailer, an expatriate consultant was appointed by
the Ministry of Education to prepare the PCR for the technical training
component. He submitted his report in December, 1981. The Ministry of
Agriculture selected a local consultant (Dr. Fasihuddin Mahtab) to prepare
the PCR for the BAU component in November, 1982 and the contract/agreement
was signed on April 10, 1983 between Bangladesh Agricultural University and
Dr. Fasihuddin Mahtab, Director, Prokaushali Songsad Ltd. The consultant
started his work and submitted a draft report to IDA and BAU in the 2nd week
of June 1883.
Follow-up Activities: None
Evaluation: The project completion reports submitted by the consultants were
reviewed by IDA staff and the report for the technical education component
was accepted as submitted. The BAU component was duly revised by the con-
sultant concerned and accepted by the Government and the IDA in January,
1984.

Title: Chittagong Water and Sewage Authority (WASA) (Appointment of
Counterpart Compercial/Financial Manager for Second Chittagong
WASA Project and Dhaka WASA.
Government Implementing Agency: CHITTAGONG AND DHAKA WASA.
Date IDA Approved              : April 22, 1981
Contract Signed                : April 8, 1981 for Chittagong WASA,
Original Allocatibn            : US$130,000, later increased to US$165,000
Final Disbursement             : US$153,895.27
Objectives:
To provide consulting services to assist the Chittagong Water and
Sewage Authority with the introduction of a commercial accounting system.
This subproject financed the services of an expatriate advisor to be
designated as Counterpart Commercial Manager (CCM) for the Second Chittagong
Water Supply Project (Credit 1001-BD). His task wa; to help systematize
CWASA's billing and collection, provide management support and initiate staff
training to help improve the efficiency of the authority's operations, in
accordance with well defined Terms of Reference. GOB signed a co:-.tract on
April 8, 1981 with an advisor to provide about 14 months of services; this
contract was subsequently extended for a total of 25 months, of which about
18 months was devoted to CWASA and 7 months to provide similar services to
Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA).
The Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority completed its
First Water Supply Project under Credit 367-BD; the source of supply was
based on groundwater only. The Second Water Supply Project, involving a
major water production expansion from a surface source, was developed from a
feasibility study financed out of the First Project. IDA provided a US$20
million credit to help implement the Second Project. An additional Condition
of Effectiveness of the Second Project was that CWASA should engage an
expatriate Counterpart Commercial/Financial Manager to improve its financial,
accounting and management practices. IDA indicated that it was willing to
finance the cost of the proposed advisory services from the Third Technical
Assistance Credit. COB concluded arrangement with IDA to this effect.
Implementation:
GOB requested, on March 13, 1981 an IDA allocation from Credit
812-BD, of US$ 129,250 to finance the services of an advisor to assist CWASA
in undertaking necessary internal operational improvements; IDA agreed, on
April 22, 1981, to make available US$130,000 from the credit for this pur-
pose. A contract had already been signed on April 8, 1981 between CWASA and
Mr. John Spurr a UK consultant for the defined purpose. Mr. Spurr was
initially engagd for a period of 12 months s Counterpart Commercial Nazager
plus 2 moths of follow-up, at a revised estimated cost of US$114,000.  The



-50-
ANNU
Page 31
services were provided in a satisfactory manner and very substantial improve-
ments were made in CWASA's operational efficiencies, particularly on billing,
collection and its management practices. The financial viability of CWASA
improved noticeably and staff received valuable 'on the job' training.
Because of the effectiveness of the advisor's work in Chittagong,
DWASA, which was experiencing similar problems, requested the services of
the same advisor. This was duly agreed between COB and IDA and an additional
sum of US$19,000 was allocated for this purpose from the TA Credit; accord-
ingly, an amendment to the consultant's contract was signed July 1982.
In total, the advisor's services were provided in the following
pattern (i) 16 months exclusively for CWASA, (ii) 5 months exclusively for
DWASA, and (iii) 4 months shared equally between CWASA and DWASA. The con-
sultancy ran from May 5, 1981 to June 4, 1983 and was provided at a total
cost of US$153,895 compared with a budgeted amount of US$149,000 a cost
over-run of 3.3x.
Follow-up: None
Evaluation:
The appointment of the CCM proved useful in the field of development
of information and reporting systems, financial management, planning, budget-
ing, cost control and training of Commercial and Financial personnel in CIASA
and DWASA. The objectives of the task, for which the CCM was appointed, were
fully achieved and the operations of both agencies suitably strengthened.

the fisheries development program in the Chandpur project
development area.
Implementation:
At the request of GOB on March 28, 1981, IDA approved a sum of US$
270,000 on May 13, 1981. A contract was signed with the Snell Environmental
Group Inc. of USA. Consultants satisfactorily fulfilled their TOR and helped
001 prepare the Project Completion Report for Cr. 605-BD.
Follow-up Activities:
None.
Evaluation:
This subproject was designed to investigate and evaluate the poten-
tial effects of irrigation and flood control on the natural fishery in four
project areas, Chandpur, Muhuri, Malda and Ichamati. This was done and the
subproject activities helped train local government staff to operate the
fishery development program and perform evaluation and design work. The
subproject also contributed toward increasing protein availability and
achieving self-sufficiency in food production.

Original Allocation            : Total US$ 180,000 out of which US$135,000
was allocated to BARC under TA II. After
closure of TA II, an allocation of US$

for BALI and BARC
Final Disbursement             : US$ 37,294.18
Objectives:
To prepare site and building plans and tender documents for
facilities constructed under the Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 872-BD).
Subproject covers the additional cost of architectural fees for both BARC and
BARI.
The project was recommended by the IDA appraisal mission for Credit
No. 828-Agriculture Research, to enable architectural work to proceed on
the design of facilities to be constructed under that project. Originally
begun under TA II, this subproject was approved in order to get the building
specifications finished before project effectiveness. After disbursement of
US$82,959 under TA II, this subproject was transferred to TA III.
Implementation:
The architect, a local firm, attempted to design the building to take
advantage of climatic conditions, so that it could remain cool in the hot
season without air conditioning. This attempt was not very successful and
the BARC buildings were also criticized for not making best use of space and
for not making adequate use of the existing building at the research station.
Otherwise the BARC building is well constructed.
Follow-up Activities:
The subproject supported the IDA credit No. 828-BD for BARC and
BARI.
Evaluation:
(See PCR for TA II). The primary reason for this subproject was to
provide preliminary services that would speed implementation of the project.
This objective was only partly met. Because of delays in the appointment of
consultants, the investment credit was in fact approved before work started

on the subproject. However, some success was achieved in the sense that
project implementation might have been even longer, had the appointment of
the consultants not taken place under the TA subproject. This subproject was
particularly noteworthy for its successful utilization of local consultancy
services. The construction of BARC headquarter building has been positively
evaluated by a joint body consisting of consultants, construction firms and
representatives of BARC.

(c) to ascertain the requirement of public storage in the context of the
official policies of price support and foodgrain procurement, food security
plan and required grain reserves;
(d) to develop a time phase program for establishment of the optimum
network of public grain storage at various regional diversity in demand and
production possibilities.
Implementation:
In November, 1980, GOB proposed to IDA to finance the subproject
under the TA-III project. In December 1980 IDA gave its agreement in prin-
ciple. By May 1981 a shortlist of consultants and TOR were available and in
June 1981 IDA allocated US$430,000 for the study. Consultants were selected
in December 1981 and a contract negotiated in March 1982. Subsequent changes
to the contract terms introduced by the Ministry of Food led to disputes with
the selected consultants and to delays which finally caused IDA to cancel the
subproject in May 1983, with the understanding that the subproject could be
taken up again under the fourth Technical Assistance Project.
Evaluations
The subproject never got to the implementation stage due to the above
described delays and an evaluation is not possible.

Original Allocation            : US$240,000
Final Disbursement             : US$202,956.36
Objectives:
To improve management of BADC irrigation program particularly in respect of
repair, maintenance, inventory, procurement of large numbers of equipment,
spare parts and fuel.
The need for this was identified by the consultants under 409-BD,
subproject 14. Draft TOR were sent to the Bank from GOB in December 1978,
but it took a long time for final TOR and the scope of services of consult-
ants to be agreed. The Bank cabled initial comments on the TOR to RMB in
February 1979 and in May RMB notified headquarters that GOB was proposing to
invite tenders from consultants according to modified TOR. However, no
action seems to have been taken, and by December 1979 the Rank was starting
to have second thoughts about the previous TOR. It was not until January
1980 during the negotiations for the Low-Lift Pump Project, that terms of
reference were agreed.
The agreed TOR required the consultants to develop improved systems
of procurement and stores handling and to assist in their implementation, to
develop guidelines for maintenance procedures, to develop methodology for
comparing replacement and repair of equipment, to develop budgeting systems,
and to provide training for BADC personnel. A total of 45 manmonths of
consultant services were estimated to be required.
Implementation:
Consultants were short-listed in May 1980, but negotiations with the
top rated firm were protracted and it was not until February 16, 1981 that a
contract was signed. The total contract cost was about US$286,000 of which
IDA agreed to finance US$240,000.
Follow-up: None
Evaluation:
The consultants have worked to the satisfaction of BADC's management.
They have produced some 25 reports and a final report within the expected
time frame. They seem to have established an effective communication with



-58-

management. The subproject succeeded in evaluating the relative cost effec-
tiveness of various modes of irrigation in relation to capital costs as well
as operating costs. The joint venture work of the local and the expatriate
consultants provided a basis for future collaboration, thus strengthening the
capabilities of local firms.

Original Allocation            s US$168,210.02
Final Disbursement             : US$97,319.51
Objectives:
To finance consultants' services to prepare selected drainage and
flood control.
In its first five year plan in 1973 the Government emphasized the
goal of self-sufficiency through higher agricultural production. Priority
was given to implementation of short-term, quick-yielding water development
projects. Accordingly, a Special Project Preparation Cell in the Water
Development Board was established to update old feasibility reports to a
standard acceptable to IDA. Subproject 11 of the first TA project helped
finance this cell, which began to function in November 1976. The consult-
a-nts, NEDECO (The Netherlands) ccepleted work on four projects under the
first TA credit, subsequently appraised by IDA. This subproject under the
second TA credit took up preparation of a second series of subprojects
selected earlier by the Government and agreed to by the Bank. The project
concept was one of teamwork between consultants and BWDB engineers. The
results were to produce projects and simultaneously to train the BWDB
engineers to take on the major responsibility for preparing future projects.
Implementation:
Although US$1.5 million was available to this subproject in December
1978, the new contract with NEDECO was not signed until September, 1979. The
draft contract was approved in IDA headquarters in March 1979. In August
1979 the Bank inquired as to the reasons for the delay in signature of the
contract. The consultants were of the opinion that lack of cooperation
between WODB and the Directorate of Planning plus lack of adequate follow-up
pressure by 8WDB officials accounted for the dtelay.
The subproject faced some difficulties in the beginning from (a)
austere counterpart support stemming from frequent involvement in other
assignments; (b) slow reaction to reports, resulting in inadequate guidance
given to the consultant; and (e) insufficient number of vehicles. However,
SDS at the urging of Bank officials attempted to remedy most of these
problems. The feasibility studies were completed and although there was an



-61-ANE
Page 42
initial lag in disbursement, the total allocation was nearly disbursed by
work's end.
TA-II credit expired and the balance amount of US$168,000 was trans-
ferred to TA-III (Credit 872-BD). The completed feasibility report was also
updated and revised under TA-III. Yet, since an outstanding bill of SDR
21,700 could not be disbursed under TA-III before closing, the subproject was
transferred to TA-IV.
Follow-up:
Preparation led eventually to an appraisaL and an IDA credit was
approved October 27, 1981 for US$27.0 million. The completed feasibility
report was updated and revised under TA III (Cr.872). Preparation for
Drainage and Flood Control III has been proposed in TA IV, Cr. 1124-BD.
Evaluation: This subproject failed on the institution building level but
eventually succeeded in preparing a project. The teamwork concept did not
work. BWDB engineers preferred to work in the field to working in Dhaka;
therefore, the consultants attempted to prepare the projects largely by
themselves, often on the basis of inadequate data. Some of the subproject
areas were more deeply flooded than originally expected and probably were not
the best areas to have been selected for project preparation. Other areas
originally chosen proved not to need further drainage or flood control works
on a scale requiring IDA assistance. Consultants prepared proposed sub-
projects based upon average rainfall, but daily rainfall data were needed
to determine the adverse effects of individual intensive storms which may be
critical to a rice crop. The appraisal mission could not complete appraisal
and had to request additional data. A second appraisal mission of a revised
project took place leading eventually to Drainage and Flood Control II
assisted by IDA credit 1184 (US$27.0) approved October 27, 1981.

US$341,083 was transferred to Cr. 872-BD
for Phase-II studies.
Final Disbursement             : Nil
Objectives:
To identify and prepare investment requirements in the field of road
maintenance and rehabilitation.
The First and Second Highway Projects focused on building new roads.
In the view of IDA (which was shared with less enthusiasm by GOB) the main-
tenance of existing roads is an equally important objective.  As a first step
towards a possible third highway project with maintenance as a principal
objective, it was agreed to commission consultants to prepare a road main-
tenance, improvement and rehabilitation study.  This was financed under the
second TA credit (622-BD), and later transferred to TA-III (872-BD, when
completion of the sub-project was delayed.
The terms of reference, required the consultants: to review the road
sector to identify high-priority investment needs in road maintenance,
rehabilitation and improvement; from them to prepare a project suitable for
external funding; and to prepare the plans and documents required for execu-
tion of the selected projects. The assignment was divided into two phases.
Phase It involves a review of the road system (including highways' institu-
tions, especially RHD), together with the identification and economic evalua-
tion of priority projects. Phase II, based on IDA and COB review of the
Phase I report, would determine the elements likely to form the basis of an
externally-financed project. Phase II would focus on these elements and
involve the preparation of a five-year maintenance program, the probable
location of sections requiring rehabilitation, analysis of work methods,
equipment required, recommendations on ferries and workshops, and training,
and the refinement of the economic evaluation in Phase I.
Implementation:
The contract was awarded to a joint venture of a foreign firm and a
local firm. The contract was signed on November 19, 1978, and stated that
work should begin by December 20, 1978; in any event the team arrived in post
in January 1979. The Phase I report was due for submission in April 1979,
and this deadline was met.
While it was submitted on time, the report's quality has been
severely criticized. In a series of meetings, IDA staff expressed the view



-63-
ANNEX
Page 44
that the report displayed a basic lack of understanding of the issues and a
lack of a logical and analytical approach to them. The consultants explained
that the fault lay in the selection of the team. As a result, the consult-
ants' team was changed and they agreed to redraft the report. The revised
report was not submitted until the end of the year, and was reviewed by the
Bank and GOB in January 1980.
The project has made very little progress since then due to the
failure IDA of and GOB to reach agreement on details of the Phase II study.
There has been some disagreement between the IDA and GOB over the balance to
be struck between routine maintenance and rehabilitation. The GOB deferred a
decision on Phase II until the second five-year plan was published in 1980.
Then it argued that the plan had established the appropriate balance amount.
GOB wished Phase II to reflect this balance. IDA, in contrast, took the
position that the size of the required maintenance, rehabilitation and
implementation program (and hence the balance between maintenance and
improvement) can only be determined after all maintenance needs have been
identified and quantified. In May 1982, IDA agreed to cancel Phase II and
to collaborate instead with GOB in producing an indicative 5-year program
for rehabilitation, improvement and maintenance.

Completed.  Transferred from TA II subproject 17.  The Secretary,
of the Ministry of Agriculture has indicated that consultant's advice has
been useful in assisting his ministerial reorganization efforts.  The adviser
appears to have played a helpful role in assisting policymakers in reaching
their decisions.
GOB emphasises that the subproject provided a personal adviser to
the Secretary on ministerial reforms, without the adviser taking part in
design or implementation efforts.

Title: Barisal Patuakhali Irrigation Project
Government Implementing Agency: BANGLADESH WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD (BWDB)
Date IDA Approved             : July 25, 1980 IDA Cr. 622-BD later
revised on March 16, 1982 under IDA
Cr. 872-BD.
Contract Signed               : October 14, 1981.
Project Completed             : July, 1982
Original Allocation           : US$30,000 (initially allocated under
Cr. 622-BD subsequently converted to
Cr. 872-BD US$465,000.)
Final Disbursement            : US$190,972.27
Objectives:
(a) to provide equipment needed to collect data required by consultants
for detailed engineering and preparation of cost estimates for land and
water development proposal suitable for IDA financing;
(b) to finance the consultant services.
Implementation:
On June 20, 1980 ERD requested IDA for an allocation of US$49,500
from TA-III (Cr. 872-BD). IDA allocated an amount of US$30,000 on July 25,
1980 for procurement of equipment under TA-II (Cr. No. 622-BD). As the
main study was delayed because of protracted negotiations with consultants
(16 months), no funds were disbursed under TA-II and the subproject was
transferred to TA-III (Cr.872-BD). On Pebruary 22, 1982, IDA was further
requested for an additional allocation of US$433,944 to undertake feasibility
studies. Accordingly, IDA allocated the said amount raising total allocation
to US$465,000 under TA-III (Cr. No. 872-BD) and an agreement was signed
between BWDB & M/S Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, Australia on
October 14, 1981 for the preparation of "Proposed Engineering Works" required
for the feasibility study.
The engineering report, was a good report. Unfortunately, consult-
ants found that the proposed concept of gravity drainage was not feasible in
the project area. Peasibility of the irrigation component was also in doubt
in view of the disappointing results in the neighbouring Barisal Irrigation
Project. Therefore, FAO/CP did not prepare a full feasibility report, but
only a position paper (dated April 12, 1983), suggesting that activities in
the are should be limited, for the time being, to construction of two small
pilot projects, involving irrigation by pump/gravity facilities. The two
pilot projects are now under construction and should be operational in early
1986. Funding was not a problem but the feasibility of the original
proposals was very doubtful.

Title: Consultancy Services for Preparation of Portfolio of Projects in
Education Sector of the Planning Commission
Government Implementing Agency: PLANNING COMMISSION
Date IDA Approved              : Aug. 10, 81 (Jan 81, approval in principle)
Contract Signed                : August 13, 1981
Original Allocation             :   Provisional Allocation was US$ 60. 000
Final Disbursement             :   US$ 43,399.27
Objectives:
To prepare portfolio in the education sector by relating the project
activities and resources to the projects laid down in the Sectoral Second
Five-Year Plan.
The main purposes of the portfolio design activity were:
(a) identification of projects consistent with the plan objectives;
(b) identification of project inputs, outputs and time sequences;
(c) identification of cross-sectoral input and output linkages.
Implementation:
On August 13, 1981 the contract/agreement was signed between the
Planning Commission and Dr. Douglas M. Windham and Dr. Raymond Ellis. (The
British Council provided its services to the GOB in arranging a 7-day con-
sultancy of Dr. Raymond Ellis for the round up discussions on a project
portfolio for the Education and Training Sector under the Second Five Year
Plan.) Under the supervision of the Ministry of Planning (Education Section)
and in co-operation with the Ministry of Education, the consultants examined
the project objectives in the light of the overall sectoral objectives and
also prepared project outlines for each project to be included in the port-
folio. The duration of the consultancy services was for three months.
Two GOB officials along with the consultants visited Washington for
one week to finalize the Medium Term Education Project (MTEP) during January
- February, 1982.
Follow-up Activities:
GOB suggests that this subproject helped identify a number of
projects, of which two were eventually financed by IDA: Credit No. 1490-BD
of US$ 36 million "Technical Education" approved on 5/31/84 and Credit No.
1547-BD; "Second Primary Education" for US$ 80 million, approved on 3/28/85.
Evaluation:                 4<
The sub-project achieved its principal objectives, to prepare a
portfolio program for the education and training section of the Planning

Commission. The work of the consultants, who were joined by a task force
of local officials to prepare a medium term education plan, was satisfactory
The joint effort resulted in a considerable improvement of sector planning
in education.

Contract Signed                : March 2, 1982
Project Completed              : Summer, 1982
Original Allocation            : US $ 12,000
Final Disbursement             : US $ 12,038.69
Objectives:
To provide assistance during the pre-bid conference for the
Bangladesh Machine Tool Factory Project.
To prepare, organise and conduct a pre-bid conference for
pre-qualified bidders and to enable them to submit a meaningful service
contract, the BMTF proposed appointing a foreign consultant with enough
knowledge of the machinery requirements of BMTF and its functioning to carry
out a pre-bid conference.
Implementation:
On February 2, 1982, Ministry of Industries sent a proposal through
BED to IDA for technical assistance for this sub-project under credit 872-BD.
IDA allocated US $ 12,000 for this sub-project on March 22, 1982 for financ-
ing the services of an expert. An agreement for consultancy was made between
BNTF (Bangladesh Machines Tools Factory) and Mr. P. P. Colbane on March 2,
1982 for 5 weeks consultancy services.
Follow-up Activities:
On the basis of this conference a management contract has been
entered into by BMTF and Fabrique Nationale of Belgium.
Evaluation:
The objective of this sub-project was to prepare, organise and con-
duct pre-bid conference for prequalified bidders to enable them to submit
a meaningful bid. The consultant completed his assignment during mid 1982.
The first tender for the management contract was unsuccessful - The second
tender was selected as above. The objective of the subproject was satisfac-
torily achieved.

Title: BIWTC Dockyard Management and Vessel Operation
Government Implementing Agency: BANGLADESH INLAND WATER TRANSPGRT CORPORATION
Date IDA Approved              : September 4, 1981 (in principle)
Contract Signed                : June 28, 1982, (Ongoing under Cr. 1124-BD)
Original Allocation            : US$ 612,000
Final Disbursement             : US$ 326,675.88
Objectives:
To provide assistance in the rehabilitation of the port fleet and
in planning for replacement TA including on-the-job training.
The need for basic management and skill training in the dockyards
was evident from various studies undertaken under the Second Inland Water
Transort Project. IDA helped GOB improve the proposal for TA and a contract
was signed with Louis Berger International, Inc. (USA) on June 28, 1982.
Implementation:
Initially the program faced some problems and delays due to the
non-availability of some of the personnel originally selected for providing
the technical services, but after September 1982, the program made satisfac-
tory progress. Work is progressing under Credit TA IV Cr. 1124-BD.
Follow-up Activities:
The services rendered by the consultants were satisfactory and their
training of BIWT personnel has been very effective in improving their skills
in their respective fields. Twenty-six mechanics have been trained through
an initial course organized by the consultants. The training covered various
aspects of repair and maintenance of diesel engines. The consultants' serv-
ices for eliminating wastage and for reducing the consumption of fuel has
also been found to be very useful. COB was gratified to note that these
efforts resulted in substantial savings of fuel for BITWC compared to the
record for the previous year.

Original Allocation            : US$300,000
Final Disbursement             : US$161,432.25
Objectives:
Consultants to prepare two batches of full feasibility studies to
prepare the Third Drainage and Flood Control project covering a total of
500,000 acres, the first batch of 200,000 acres, and the second of 300,000
acres.
Implementation:
Funds were transferred from TA-IV to TA-III (Cr. 872-BD) to
accelerate disbursement. The feasibility studies were implemented satisfac-
torily by NEDECO consultants.
Follow-up:
DFC III - Credit 1591-BD, dated May 7, 1985.
Evaluation:
A DFC III project (Cr. 1591-BD) was appraised in July 1984 on the
basis of preparation/feasibility work made by NEDECO consultants. The
appraisal mission found that the consultant job was satisfactory despite the
very poor support they received from the BWDB unit - DPSI - supposed to back
up the expatriate consultants, collect the necessary data and provide the
office and field facilities, transportation and generally participate in the
technical study. The lack of interest and minimal participation by rPSI
explain why the transfer of technology did not materialize as it was hoped:
the expatriate consultants had to work in a vacuum instead of as part of a
team effort.

Title: Ashuganj Fertilizer Project
Government Implementing Agency: ZIA FERTILIZER AND CHEMICAL COMPANY LTD.
Date IDA Approved               : February 6,1983
Project Completed               : Ongoing under Cr.1124-BD
Contract Signed                 : May 28, 1979 under the main Credit
Original Allocation             : US$1,057,500, later increased to US$2,135,000
Final Disbursement              : US$1,753,790.02
Objectives: To continue consultancy services that would provide management
and operations assistance to fertilizer plants and would serve as bridge
financing until a proposed operation and maintenance credit is processed.
In mid-November, 1982 the GOB approached IDA for additional funds to
AFCC (ZFCL) vide IDA credit No. 527-BD for US$62 miLlion. Because of the
delays in project completion and technical problems during initial plant
operations, continued technical assistance by CORA Engineering who had been
working with AFCC since 1979 became necessary. To cover these technical
assistance costs, US$ 3,150,000 for the technical assistance subproject both
under TA-III and TA-IV (i.e. US$1,057,500 and SDR 2.00 million respectively
were allocated.
Implementation: This subproject is an extension of the existing contract
between ZFC and CORA which started from 28th May, 1979 and was due to expire
on 31 December, 1982. The project (AFCC) was due to start commercial produc-
tion from September, 1980, but for many reasons the commercial operation
could not be started. Therefore, the services (210 manmonths) of CORA
Engineering were required for a period of another one year (January 1983 to
December, 1983 with a contingent provision of 102 manmonths for 1984) in
order to maintain sustained operation and also for training of the personnel.
Follow-up: None.
Evaluation: Technical assistance by CORA Engineering has been fruitful in
helping AFCC staff to stabilize plant operations. AFCC staff has gained
confidence and improved their capabilities in plant operations. Technical
assistance by CORA Engineering is still being provided, although in a limited
manner, under the fourth T.A. credit.
