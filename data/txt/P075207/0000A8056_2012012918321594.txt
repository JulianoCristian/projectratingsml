                         To assist the Government of Serbia in reducing cost and improving safety for road users through: (a) improving the condition of selected road sections of the
                         main and regional road network; (b) improving the effectiveness of road maintenance through the introduction of performance-based contracting in two pilot
                         regions; and (c) introducing safe road design principles, road safety audits and targeted improvement measures.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Good implementation progress of the Project has continued despite the economic crisis. Work on five of nine sections undergoing rehabilitation and all agreed accident black spot
                         improvements have been completed; and work on a sixth road section is progressing well. Work has already started on a seventh section; and the review of the bidding documents
                         for the remaining two sections is currently underway. The contract award is expected by mid March, 2012, which will allow works to start at the beginning of the construction season
                         and to be completed by extended project closing date, June 15, 2012. The project's development objectives continue to be achievable within the extended closing date period.
