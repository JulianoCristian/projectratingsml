                         Implementation Status Overview
                           The implementation of the Transport Rehabilitation Project has continued the very good progress of the last twelve months. There has been good progress in all areas: all eight of
                         the rehabilitation contracts are now signed, with works either ongoing or awaiting the start of the 2011 construction season. One of the four smaller contracts to address accident
                         black spots on the network has been completed. Although, one unwelcome development has been the reemergence of similar weaknesses as earlier in the project in the detailed
                         design for the interventions, again leading to slight delay and additional costs. The Bank team has discussed this problem with counterparts and arrangements are being put in place

                         The good progress has been reflected in the disbursements under the project which have increased markedly. Disbursements as at March 14, 2011 amounted to 60 percent (US
                         $63.72 million) of the total loan and credit funds within the project. This figure is also expected to continue to rise markedly through to the end of June 2011, as activities increase in
                         the new construction season
