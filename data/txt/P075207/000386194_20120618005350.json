The\n            change, which was requested by the Government of the\n            Republic of Serbia by letter dated June 11, 2012, consists\n            of a three and a half month extension of the closing date of\n            the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            (IBRD) loan from June 15, 2012 to September 30, 2012. The\n            extension is necessary to complete the remaining civil works\n            and to ensure achievement of the project's development\n            objectives (PDO). This will be the third extension of the\n            IBRD loan closing date, which will cumulatively bring the\n            total extension period to three years and nine months and\n            the total implementation period to approximately seven and a\n            half years. No changes to the PDO or results framework are\n            needed. Implementation agencies remain the same, there are\n            no outstanding audits, financial management reports are\n            satisfactory, and the project is progressing satisfactorily.\n            The project's objectives continue to be achievable\n            within the extended closing date period; the performance of\n            the borrower and the project implementing agencies continues\n            to be satisfactory. The restructuring does not involve any\n            other changes. Disbursements from the loan as of June 13,\n            2012 amounted to EUR 25 million, and the loan will be fully\n            disbursed by the new loan closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
