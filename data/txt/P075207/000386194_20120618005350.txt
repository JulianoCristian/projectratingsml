                                      Proposed Changes


1.       The proposed change, which was requested by the Government of the Republic of Serbia
by letter dated June 11, 2012, consists of a three and a half month extension of the closing date of
the IBRD loan from June 15, 2012 to September 30, 2012. The proposed extension is necessary
to complete the remaining civil works and to ensure achievement of the project’s development
objectives.

2.        This will be the third extension of the IBRD loan closing date, which would cumulatively
bring the total extension period to three years and nine months and the total implementation
period to approximately seven and a half years. An IDA Credit in the amount of SDR 37.5
million (US$55 million equivalent) was approved by the Bank for the Transport Rehabilitation
Project on May 25, 2004. The original closing date for the IDA Credit was December 31, 2008.
On June 20, 2007, the Bank approved Additional Financing for the Project in the amount of
EUR 36.8 million (US$50 million equivalent) through an IBRD loan; the closing date for the
IBRD loan was June 30, 2011 and the closing date for the IDA Credit was also extended to June
30, 2011. The IDA Credit closed on June 30, 2011. The IBRD loan closing date was extended for
the first time in March 2010 to December 31, 2011, and subsequently a second time in November
2011 to June 15, 2012. The proposed restructuring would be the third extension.

3.       The additional three and a half month extension of the loan closing date is needed mainly
due to delays in project implementation resulting from the extremely harsh weather conditions
during the first six months of 2012. Firstly, the extremely cold weather in February and March
2012, which culminated in the declaration of an emergency by the government in February 2012,
hindered contractors’ preparation for the spring construction season. Secondly, heavy and
persistent rain during the spring of 2012 has prevented the contractors from performing works
within the agreed time frame. In particular, heavy rain has made completion of the asphalting
works impossible, component of the works that represents the highest costs under the contract (up
to 60-70 percent of the total value of remaining works). The interruptions forced by the weather
have been especially unfortunate given the strong performances of the project. More than 85
percent of the project has been disbursed, and the FY12 disbursement rate was just under 57
percent.

4.      No changes to the PDO or results framework are needed. Implementation agencies
remain the same, there are no outstanding audits, financial management reports are satisfactory,
and the project is progressing satisfactorily. The project’s objectives continue to be achievable
within the extended closing date period; the performance of the Borrower and the project
implementing agencies continues to be satisfactory.

5.      The proposed restructuring does not involve any other changes. Disbursements from the
loan as of June 13, 2012 amounted to EUR 25 million, and the loan will be fully disbursed by the
new loan closing date.
