I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      The Government continues tc view industrial expansion as an effec-
tive means of achieving Indonesia's development objectives, particularly
those relating to the growth of income and employment. The industrial sector
(comprising the mining,/l manufacturing and construction industries) has been
the fastest growing sector of the Indonesian economy since the late 1960s.
During 1972-77, and based upon 1976 constant prices, the rate of growth
of Indonesia's GDP averaged 7.8% p.a. Over this same period the industrial
sector grew by an average of 11% p.a. Between 1972 and 1977 the average
annual growth rates of the mining, mainufacturing and construction industries
were 10%, 13.1% and 12.9% respectively. These industries accounted for
an aggregate of 34.7% of GDP in 1977, /2 making it the largest sector of the
Indonesian economy, followed by services and agriculture. Statistical data
on employment within the industrial sector is inadequate for analysis;
according to a 1975 survey, however, the manufacturing sector alone accounted
for approximately 8% of the total labor force. The Government recognizes the
need to provide opportunities for gainful employment for the growing labor
force and is following an employment strategy which places greater emphasis
on the development of labor-intensive, export oriented and small- and
medium-scale industries.
1.02      Recent Performance.  The Indonesian economy seems to be recovering
from the 1974/75 world-wide recession and has successfully dealt with the
most acute problems associated with t:he Pertamina crisis, which adversely
affected growth from 1974 through 1975. Judged in terms of value-added, the
performance of the mining sector improved significantly in 1976-77, increas-
ing by an average of 13.6% after experiencing a 4% decline in 1975; value-
added in the manufacturing sector rose by 7% in 1976 and by 14.7% in 1977.
The value of Indonesia's exports, which were especially hard hit by the
1974/75 recession in the industrialized nations, totaled US$8.5 billion in
1976, an increase of 20% over the previous year. Overall export values
reached US$10.9 billion in 1977.  This 27% increase was achieved by:  a
continuing increase in the volume and price of oil exports; the first ship-
ments of liquefied natural gas; and general price increases for nearly all
nonoil exports.  While the value of nonoil exports rose by 40% in 1977, the
value of nonoil exports as a percentage of the value of total exports
increased by only 3% (from 30% to 33') between 1976 and 1977.
/1 Including the oil industry.
/2 Separately, mining (including oil) accounted for 19.8%, manufacturing
9.8% and construction 5.1% of GDP in 1977. *(The corresponding figures
for 1976 are 18.9%, 9.2% and 5.2%).

Structure of Industry

and composition of the manufacturing sector. The following table shows the
changes in the sectoral composition of the manufacturing sector between
1973 and 1975.

Source: Survey of Industry by Government for 1973 and 1975.
While traditional industries such as food processing, tobacco and textiles
are still predominant, accounting for nearly two thirds of manufacturing
value added, the structure of the manufacturing sector has changed substan-
tially over the past few years. Between 1973 and 1975, food processing and
textiles declined from 53% and 21% of total manufacturing value added to 47%
and 16% respectively. Estimates show that in 1975, these two industries
still accounted for 70% of manufacturing sector employment. Modern, usually
more capital-intensive industries have begun to displace the more traditional
activities with their share of manufacturing value added increasing from 25%



--3 -
in 1973 to about 37% in 1975. Chemicals and chemical products (including
coal, petroleum, rubber and plastic wares) have significantly increased their
share of total manufacturing value added, from 8% to 14%,. Metal products
and machinery accounted for 12% of total manufacturing value added in 1975,
compared to 9% in 1973 and the share of nonmetallic mineral products to
total manufacturing value added increased from 3% to 5%. It seems. clear
that a number of new large-scale investments have now gone into production
and it is likely that the trend indicated by the above figures will increase
in the coming years.
1.04      Information regarding the size and geographic distribution of
manufacturing enterprises is based upon a 1974-75 Industrial Census. At
that time, out of 55,273 manufacturing enterprises surveyed, 48,221 (88%)
were small-scale, /1 5,746 (10%) were medium-scale and 1,306 (2%) were
large-scale. Geographically, manufacturing activity is concentrated on Java
where 63% of the population is located. Seventy-two percent of all manufac-
turing enterprises are located on Java.
Industrialization Strategy
1.05      Indonesian manufacturing industries are essentially geared to
production for the domestic consumer market. This is the result of an
industrialization strategy which has placed emphasis on import substitution
mainly for consumer goods and to a lesser extent for intermediate goods. The
policy framework supporting this striategy aimed at protecting domestic
producers from competing imports through high import tariffs and direct
import controls. These protectionist policies have resulted in price dis-
tortions and inefficiencies, while tlhe combination of high production costs
and of a primarily domestic market orientation have effectively prevented
both locally and foreign-owned enterprises from developing their exports. In
1976, the Government introduced some limited policy changes aimed at encour-
aging exports of manufactured products but the impact of these measures has
been minimal.
1.06      The large-scale industrial projects undertaken by the Government in
the wake of the dramatic improvement in its oil revenues are capital intensive
by nature and contribute little to employment creation. Moreover, the
exemption of duties on imports of capital goods and the negative real interest
rates on long-term industrial loans which prevailed through 1975 may have
caused manufacturing investment to be unduly capital intensive. The Government
is increasingly aware of these shortcomings and emphasis is now being placed
on the need for the manufacturing sector to absorb a larger proportion of the
incremental labor force. It is expected that the Government's employment
strategy will encourage the promotion of small and medium-scale industries
and the development of labor-intensive export industries.
/1 Small-scale enterprises are defined as those employing 5-19 workers;
medium-scale enterprises employ 20-99 persons; large-scale enterprises
employ 100 or more workers.

Impact of the Devaluation of November 15, 1978
1.07      On November 15, 1978, the Indonesian Government announced the
devaluation of the Rupiah from Rp 415 to Rp 625 to the US dollar with a view
to increasing the competitiveness of Indonesian industrial and agricultural
products at home and abroad, spurring new economic activities and achieving a
more balanced structure of the economy by reducing its dependence on oil.
While the move could cause serious liquidity problems to many enterprises in
the short run, it is expected to have a favorable effect on export-oriented and
import substitution industries in the long run. Supplementary measures
announced by the Government include the reduction by 50% of customs duties
and sales taxes on imported raw materials for manufacturing industries. The
Government has also taken steps to manage inflationary pressures in the wake
of the devaluation, including direct intervention to restrain price increases
on basic commodities such as rice, salt, sugar, textiles, kerosene, etc. The
Government is aware that a rapid rate of inflation could undermine the econo-
mic conditions the devaluation intended to create for achieving the goals of
increasing investment and production, creating wider employment opportunities
and encouraging more equitable distribution of income. It is also aware that
close monitoring of price changes by the industries without taking actual
production cost increases into consideration would likely run the risk of
deterring additional investment in the industrial sector. While it is there-
fore premature to have a full assessment of the impact of the devaluation on
the industries, the postdevaluation liquidity squeeze suffered by industries
needs to be eased, and administrative bottlenecks need to be removed by the
Government, to facilitate the rapid growth of the industrial sector.
Industrial Policies and Incentives
1.08      Government policies on industrial investment are not always clearly
perceived by potential investors. They are partly reflected in the incentive
package, granted under the Domestic and Foreign Capital Investment Laws,
which are administered by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB). The
Government, through ICB, issue annual lists of industrial activities
classified in terms of priority. The list issued by ICB in February 1977
comprises four categories: (a) priority activities to which maximum incentives
are granted; (b) preferred industries with limited incentives; (c) industries
open but without incentives; and (d) activities closed to new investment.
The 1,114 activities currently listed will be periodically reviewed and the
classification amended as required. At present some 489 activities are
closed to foreign investment against 109 to domestic investment.
1.09      The order of priority is based on the capacity of each industrial
activity to: increase exports; substitute imports; utilize domestic raw
materials or intermediate goods; increase value added; have a multiplier
effect on other activities; etc. These activities must also satisfy the
Development Plan objectives of increasing employment opportunities, spreading
productive enterprises to all regions and equitably distributing the benefits of
growth. It is of particular interest to notice that export orientation now
ranks first in Government priorities; surprisingly, however, small-scale



- 5 -
activities do not seem to receive any particular financial incentives,
with the exception of the subsidized credit schemes (KIK/KMKP) mentioned in
para. 2.08.
1.10      The incentive package granted to priority and preferred industries
is summarized in the following table.

Manufacturing Investment
1.11      Information on the trend and volume of capital formation in the
manufacturing sector is limited to the volume of investment applications
approved by ICB and to an analysis of credits extended by banks.
ICB Approvals: While investment projects approved by ICB may not
necessarily result in actual investment, the magnitude of projects
considered for approval does reflect, to some extent, the overall
investment climate. With regard to domestic investments, 1973 was
the peak approval year with 550 projects approved for a total of
Rp 569 billion. In 1974, only 357 projects were approved with
an estimated total cost of Rp 234 billion. The number of projects
approved continued to decline through 1976 with only 183 approvals;
in terms of estimated project costs, however, there was a slight
increase to Rp 277 billion. In 1977 a sharp increase was regis-
tered with 208 prolects approved for a total domestic investment
cost of Rp 580.8 billion.  This trend toward significantly increasing



- 6 -
the number and value of domestic investment approvals appears to be
holding for 1978 as 167 projects with domestic investment value of
Rp 488 billion had been approved as of June 30, 1978. As for
foreign investment project approvals, the peak years were 1974-75.
In 1974, ICB approved some 92 projects involving total investment
of US$1.1 billion, while in 1975, 43 projects were approved for
US$1.0 billion. The high 1975 figure, however, includes two very
large projects, which if excluded, would decrease the cost of
foreign investments approved to about US$400 million, substantially
below the 1974 total. Foreign investment approvals have remained
relatively low since 1976, reaching US$424 million and US$458
million respectively in 1976 and 1977. For the first half of
1978, the value of approvals given for foreign investment stood at
US$130.1 million for 14 projects.
1.12      The above figures, taken as a whole, indicate that investment, while
slowly recovering from the 1974-75 world-wide recession which had adversely
affected private investment interest, is still slack. The Government, in an
effort to stimulate investments, has taken several measures: (a) ICB's
operations were restructured in late 1977 with a view toward speeding up the
approval process; (b) the list of industries qualifying for incentives
continues to be broadened; (c) In January 1978 term lending rates were reduced
from 15% p.a. to 13.5% p.a. and maturities increased from five to ten years
with grace periods increasing from two to four years for term loans under the
INVESTASI credit scheme, and (d) commercial bank reserve requirements were
also reduced.
1.13      Bank Credits.  Total bank credits outstanding, including foreign
exchange, were increased from Rp 1,574 billion in 1974, to Rp 3,942 billion
for 1977. While the total amount of credit outstanding has been steadily
increasing since 1974, the rate of expansion has slowed down consideraby (an
increase of 5% in 1977 compared to 18% in 1976). Credits extended to manufac-
turing industry have also been increasing over this period, both in absolute
terms and in terms of percentage of total credits, but also at a slower rate.
In 1974 credits for manufacturing industry amounted to Rp 359 billion, or 23%
of total credits; in 1975 the amount increased to Rp 719 billion representing
26% of total credits. For 1976 and 1977, credits extended to manufacturing
industry totaled Rp 990 billion and Rp 1,156 billion respectively, accounting
for 28% of total credits in 1976 and 29% in 1977.
1.14      The reason for the low level of new investment credits is difficult
to determine but the relatively slack investment climate and the more cau-
tious approach of commercial banks in approving new credits have been sug-
gested as possible causes.
Industrial Sector Issues and Proposals
1.15      An industrial mission visited Indonesia in November-December 1976
and its report "Problems and Prospects for Industrial Development in Indonesia"
was distributed in May 1977. The report reviews the growth of industry, the
characteristics of industrial investment, and policy issues concerning the



- 7 -
planning for future growth. The mission made the following observations and
recommendations:
(a) The responsibility of the Ministry of Industry to declare some
industries closed to further investment should be exercised in such
a way as not to support monopolistic positions, inefficient use of
resources, and noncompetitive industries. Pursuing a relatively
open-door policy on new investment applications may lead to posi-
tive social gains.
(b) Greater attention is required to the promotion of light industries
that offer opportunities for employment creation, dispersion to
locations other than urban centers, and expansion of exports.
(c) Further revisions of licensing procedures should be aimed at
decentralizing approvals of investment applications, and providing
adequate incentives to industries which can export a large percent-
age of their output and which will create additional employment
opportunities.
(d) The structure of customs duties which is causing distortions in the
use of resources in industry should be reformed and the delays and
costs of clearing imports through customs should be minimized.
(e) Debt arrears are already a problem in several credit programs in
Indonesia. The national private banks in Indonesia have a poten-
tially important role to play in the future in the provision of
banking facilities, for industry and other sectors. The develop-
ment of branch networks should be given more encouragement.
(f) Detailed and accurate information on the causes of low productivity
in many industries needs to be gathered on an industry by industry
basis so as to eliminate bottlenecks, thus increasing productivity.
(g) With a view to creating productive employment opportunities and
promoting an efficient industrial structure, some specific measures
to supplement the BIPIK and KIK/KMKP programs which assist small-scale
industry would include: (i) strengthening of P.T. ASKRINDO (an
insurance institution) and P.T. BAHANA (equity providing bank) so
they can function as originally intended; (ii) encouraging private
banks to undertake more lending to small enterprises; (iii) increas-
ing the resources of IDFC and PDFCI; (iv) providing better technical
extension services with respect to production planning, marketing
and management; and (v) initiating a program to investigate and
improve the health conditions of industrial workers.
1.16      A Bank mission for identification and preparation of an SSE Project
visited Indonesia from June 26 to JuLy 21, 1978. The general conclusion of
the mission was that there is scope for a Bank project to provide nonfinanacial



- 8 -
assistance to the SSE sector in Indonesia. This would include technical
assistance for the restructuring of BIPIK and establishment of the marketing
agencies; financing of physical facilities and equipment foL cerice  e
and clusters; a loan program for marketing of SSE products; and financing the
training of extension officers and entrepreneurship development.
1.17       Another Bank mission visited Indonesia in November 1978 to review
the SSI's growth performance (output, value added, employment, export
performance, investment, level of efficiency) with a view to identifying the
more dynamic and promising subsectors which can be used as vehicles to
promote gainful employment among the rural and urban poor. (Employment
creation through SSIs would be the central theme of the proposed sector
study). It also focused on the existing policy and incentives framework
as well as the effectiveness of financial and nonfinancial delivery systems,
with a view to making recommendations on action programs and active government
policies for promotion of SSIs. The findings of the mission will be available
in 1979.
1.18       The latest economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia: Growth Patterns,
Social Progress and Development Prospects" of February 20, 1979 (2093-IND)
also dealt in some detail with the problems and prospects of the industrial
sector in Indonesia. The report concluded that while the agricultural sector
will not be able to absorb the expected annual increment of about 1.14
million persons in the labor force, the industrial sector is the only goods-
producing sector capable of sustained high rates of growth for a long period.
The report also recommended that to generate a significant impact on the
growth rate of employment and manufactured exports, Indonesia should probably
aim at a pattern of rapid labor intensive industrial development, with value
added in manufacturing growing by not less than 15% annually, and manufactured
exports growing by not less than 20% annually. But achievement of these
targets will require significant changes in present policies and practices
which now constrain development of the sector. The Government should there-
fore accelerate its efforts to remove administrative bottlenecks, improve the
incentive framework, redress the imbalance in the regional distribution of
industrial investment, increase the institutional support services, particularly
in rural areas, and strengthen local banking institutions and the promotion of
their development orientation.
II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Institutional Setup
2.01       Indonesia's organized financial sector is comprised of the following
institutions: the National Treasury, as far as it exercises monetary functions,
Bank Indonesia (the Central Bank), and deposit money banks, all of which make
up what Bank Indonesia defines as the "monetary system;" and nonbank financial
institutions and other banking institutions not considered to be part of the
monetary system, such as savings banks, investment funds, etc. As of 1976,
the monetary system dominated the financial sector accounting for 96.9% of the
gross assets of the nation's financial institutions, leaving only 3.1% of
gross assets to be controlled by those institutions outside the monetary
system.



-9-
2.02      Bank Indonesia and Deposit Iloney Banks.  Bank Indonesia, as the
Central Bank, supervises the deposit money banks, and as of 1976, accounted
for 52.7% of the total gross assets of financial institutions. Deposit money
banks are those banking institutions whose liabilities consist chiefly of
demand deposits and for the most part may be considered to be commercial
banks. The following institutions comprise the deposit money banks:
(a)  State Banks.  The five large State-controlled commercial banks
reflect the Government's credit policy by channeling funds to the
priority sectors determined by the Government. Each of the banks
is permitted to conduct foreign exchange transactions and has been
assigned by Bank Indonesia one particular economic sector in which
to operate: Bank Rakyat Indonesia specializes in granting agricul-
tural, fishery, cooperative and rural development credits; Bank
Ekspor Impor Indonesia grants credit for production, processing and
marketing of export products; Bank Negara Indonesia grants indus-
trial credits; Bank Bumi Daya specializes in financing state
agriculture and forestry projects; and Bank Dagang Negara grants
mining credits. As of 1976 the State banks accounted for 36.2% of
the gross assets of financial institutions, making them the domi-
nant institutions of the financial sector after the Central Bank.
(b)  Private Foreign Exchange Banks.  There are currently nine foreign
exchange banks which, like the State banks, are authorized to
engage in foreign exchange transactions. Together with the State
banks, they comprise the network of national foreign exchange
banks. Because the private foreign exchange banks have relatively
small capital and resource (including technical expertise) bases,
they are limited in their ability to exert influence upon the
financial system as a whole.
(c)  Foreign Banks.  Currently, there are ten branches of foreign
banks and one joint venture bank authorized to do business in
Indonesia. The Government allows the foreign banks to operate only
one branch in Jakarta other than their respective head offices, and
restricts their lending tc enterprises whose main offices and oper-
ations are in the Jakarta area. These banks accounted for only 4%
of gross assets of financial institutions in 1976.
(d)  Private Nonforeign Exchange Banks.  About 76 of these commercial
banks presently operate in Indonesia. They are prohibited by Bank
Indonesia from conducting foreign exchange transactions and are
for the most part, small local banks which use few modern banking
techniques and restrict their lending to their immediate locali-
ties. Because these banks tend to be inefficient in their opera-
tions and often lack strong financial stability, Bank Indonesia has
been encouraging the merger of several of these institutions.
2.03      Banking institutions consi'dered to be outside Bank Indonesia's mone-
tary system and nonbank financial intermediaries comprise a very small part
of the financial sector, representing only 3.1% of the gross assets of



- 10 -
financial institutions in 1976./i Such banking institutions include: savings
banks, which are organized around Bank Tabungan Negara (National Savings
Bank); and secondary banks consisting of 3,563 village banks, 2,211 paddy
banks and 139 market banks. Although the secondary banks are well distrib-
uted throughout Indonesia, their role in the country's financial sector is
negligible due to their limited resources. Nonbank financial intermediaries
include development finance companies (DFCs) and investment banking
institutions.
(a) Development Finance Companies (DFCs). DFCs are primarily involved
in financing development projects and are principally engaged in
granting medium- and long-term credit and taking equity partici-
pations. BAPINDO, established in 1960, was reorganized in 1970
with Bank Group assistance, with a view to making it the predominant
source of medium-and long-term finance for industry. In 1972, the
Indonesian Development Finance Company (IDFC) was reorganized as a
joint venture between the Government (through Bank Indonesia) and
the Netherlands Finance Company for Developing Countries, in which
the Dutch Government has a majority interest. In 1973, again with
Bank Group assistance, the Government was instrumental in establish-
ing a third largely privately-owned development bank, P.T. Private
Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Apart from an
equity investment of US$0.5 million by IFC, PDFCI has received an
IDA credit of US$10 million and, early in 1977, a Bank loan of
US$15 million. In addition to BAPINDO, IDFC and PDFCI, there are
26 Regional Development Banks (RDBs) with 123 branch offices
providing finance for relatively small projects in industry,
agriculture fishing, trade and services.
(b) Investment Banking Institutions. Since the passage, in 1973, of a
law governing the establishment and operations of non-bank financial
intermediaries, nine investment banking institutions have been set
up as joint ventures between foreign and local banks. Operating as
investment banks, the financial institutions differ from DFCs in
that they provide a wide array of financial services, including
investment consultancy, underwriting, portfolio management and
engage in money market activities. The Government also set up in
1973 a specialized institution, P.T. Bahana, as a venture capital
finance company providing medium- and long-term loans and equity
finance and technical assistance to financially weak enterprises.
As of December 31, 1978, P.T. Bahana had made 13 investments for
about Rp 400 million, of which only Rp 130 million was for equity
financing, the rest going toward "bridge" financing loans for
investment and working capital needs.
/1 BAPINDO's assets are not included in this calculation because statisti-
cally BAPINDO is grouped together with the State-controlled commercial
banks.



Short-Term Credit
2.04       Short-term credit is available from any of the above-mentioned fi-
nancial institutions for periods up, to one year. Short-term credits rolled
over upon reaching maturity have mostly been utilized by Indonesian enter-
prises which lacked access to sufficient term financing due chiefly to the
pribumi /1 restrictions placed upon the use of Bank Indonesia's -ediscounting
facilities.
Medium- and Long-Term Credit
2.05       Term credit is available from most banks, though foreign banks
must obtain Bank Indonesia's approval to make loans with more than one year
maturity. A chief source of term credit is the Kredit Investasi Besar (KIB
or "INVESTASI") program, which was initiated by the Government in 1969.
As with the many other selective credit policies pursued by the Government,
"INVESTASI" lending is restricted to pribumi /1 enterprises and requires a
minimum 25% equity contribution from the project sponsor. As of January 1978,
term loans of up to ten year maturity /2 are extended by the State banks to
entrepreneurs in virtually all economic sectors, with Bank Indonesia refinanc-
ing 65-80% of the loan amounts. While there is effectively no floor or
ceiling on the size of individual loans, the percentage discounted by Bank
Indonesia decreases as loan size increases. "INVESTASI" loans finance
fixed assets, with interest rates of 10.5 to 13.5% p.a., depending upon the
loan amount, and working capital at: rates of 12-18% p.a. Bank Indonesia's
rediscount rate for "INVESTASI" credits ranges from 3 to 4%, depending upon
the size of the credit. Funding for the "INVESTASI" program originally came
from Bank Indonesia and the Government budget. Since 1971, no new budget
funds have been appropriated for this program, causing loan approvals to taper
off. As of year end 1977, outstandiLng INVESTASI credits amounted to Rp 276
billion, accounting for 9.8% of total banking credits outstanding to the
private sector.
2.06       The four development banking institutions in Indonesia are the
other sources of term finance for iLndustry. BAPINDO is by far the most
important and is the only State bank allowed to make term loans with matur-
ities of up to fifteen years. BAPINDO provides finance in the form of loans
or equity, to projects of all sizes in both the public and private sectors.
Apart from the manufacturing sector, it also finances shipping and tourism
projects. IDFC extends term loans, makes equity investments, and provides a
limited amount of technical assistance to its clients. So far, it has been
concentrating on financing relatively small projects because of its limited
financial resources and policy orientation. PDFCI is empowered to make
medium- and long-term loans, invest in equity, provide guarantees, underwrite
corporate equity and debt securities and provide technical, financial, and
/1  Pribumi enterprises are defined as those with at least 50% pribumi
(ethnic Indonesian) ownership and having predominantly pribumi management,
or 75% ownership if management is not pribumi.

- 12 -
managerial consultancy services.  One of its more important objectives is the
identification of new projects and the promotion of new enterprises. P.T.
Bahana's main focus has been the provision of equity financing to enterprises
with a weak capital structure.
Financing Small-Scale Industry
2.07      Small-scale industries have traditionally had difficulty in obtain-
ing financial assistance, due most often to their inability to provide ade-
quate collateral. In order to better provide for the needs of small entre-
preneurs, the Government and Bank Indonesia established P.T. Asransi Kredit
Indonesia (P.T. ASKRINDO). ASKRINDO's objective is to encourage term lending
by State banks to small and medium enterpreneurs by guaranteeing their loans
made to small businesses for up to 75% of the total risk, the intention being
that small firms which did not fulfill normal "bankability" criteria would be
able to obtain credit if supported by ASKRINDO.
2.08      To further increase the financial assistance available to small-
scale and economically weak enterprises, the Government initiated two credit
schemes in December 1973: Kredit Investasi Kecil (KIK), which finances fixed
assets, and Kredit Modal Kirja Penanaman (KMKP), which finances working capi-
tal. Both schemes are administered by the State banks (including BAPINDO)
and selected RDBs, with Bank Indonesia refinancing 75-80% of the loan amounts
disbursed. As revised in January 1978, the interest rates for borrowers of
KIK and KMKP resources are 10.5% p.a. and 12% p.a., respectively; the maximum
maturity for KIK loans is five years with two years grace, while for KMKP
loans it is three years with one year grace. The KIK and KMKP programs have
thus far shown reasonably favorable results. Although new approvals and
disbursements of bank credits have shown little growth since 1974, within the
total there has been a shift toward small-scale investment and permanent
working capital (KIK and KMKP) credits. For the KIK program, the number of
applications approved has risen from 9,554 in 1974 to 39,737 at year-end 1977;
in value terms the approvals increased from Rp 15,253 million in 1974 to Rp
74,186 million in 1977. Under the KMKP program, a total of 322,391 applications
with a value of Rp 114,990 million had been approved by the fourth quarter of
1977. Certain improvements in the provision and administration of KIK and
KMKP loans have been recently introduced. Effective February 1, 1977, the
maximum limit on KIK and KMKP loans was raised from Rp 5 million to Rp 10
million each, thus allowing a greater number of suitable projects to qualify
for financing. The procedures for processing KIK and KMKP loans have also
been simplified so that handling banks can obtain Bank Indonesia refinancing
more conveniently.
Capital market
2.09      Although there is currently no capital market in operation in
Indonesia, the Government has taken steps to encourage its development
through the establishment of the BAPEPAM (Securities and Exchange Commission)
in 1976. BAPEPAM is charged with preparing regulations and supervising the
activities of the stock exchange as well as defining offering and trading
procedures. In 1976 the Government also initiated P.T. Dana Reska, an
investment fund, which plans to buy shares from companies and



- 13 -
convert them into share certificates of relatively small denominations
(Rp 10,000) so as to enable small investors to participate in capital market
activities. The Government has also decided to grant certain tax allowances
to companies willing to go public, as well as to individuals who invest in
securities traded in the stock exchange.
Interest Rates
2.10      Interest rates applied by the State banks are set by Bank Indonesia.
Because the commercial banking sector is dominated by the five State banks,
they in turn determine the general 'Level of interest rates. Private banks,
however, are not legally bound to adhere to the interest rate structure
determined by Bank Indonesia./l The lending operations of the private banks
are important not so much in terms of their volume, but rather because they
provide an equilibrating service against the interest rate and credit policies
of the State banks. Foreign banks and private nonbank financial intermediaries
are not subject to the interest cei:Lings and portfolio composition directives
imposed by Bank Indonesia when using their own resources; these private
financial institutions are able to provide financing facilities to non-pribumi
borrowers who are ineligible for the services of the State banks.
2.11      Through the State banks, the Government is able to supply funds at
preferential rates to enterprises deemed to be of high economic and social
priority. Under this system of selective credit policies /2 interest rates
can play no major resource allocational role as neither the lending institu-
tion nor the borrower can change their supply of or demand for funds by price
(interest rate) discrimination. It is within this context that the interest
rate structure of the state banking system must be viewed.
2.12      Interest rate policies have been subject to review by the Govern-
ment in line with foreign rates and the steady reduction of inflation rates.
In January 1978, as a means of stimuLlating investment, Bank Indonesia reduced
interest rates on short- and long-term loans, lengthened the maximum matur-
ities of term loans under the "INVESTASI" program from 5 to 10 years and
increased the grace period from 2 to 4 years./3 Lending rates for short-term
credits range from 9-21% compared to the previous 9-24% range. For medium-
and long-term credits lending rates vary from 10.5% to 13.5% for fixed assets
financing, and 12% to 18% for permanent working capital loans. The rates on
small industry loans were also reduced from 12% to 10.5% for fixed asset
financing under KIK and from 15% to 12% for permanent working capital financ-
ing under KMKP. The new interest rate structure is given in Annex 1.
/1 Some private banks (such as PDFCI), however, make use of Bank Indonesia
resources and must apply the rates set by Bank Indonesia when lending
these resources.
/2 The preferential interest rate policy currently pursued by Bank Indonesia
provides for 22 distinctions.
/3 BAPINDO, however, is allowed to grant loans with a maximum term of
15 years and 6 years of grace.



- 14 -
2.13      The reduction in lending rates in early 1978 was justified in view
of the reduced rate of inflation. The rate of inflation which was 33% in
1974, 20% in 1975 and 14% in 1976, dropped to 12% in 1977 and an estimated 8%
in 1978. Given the new standard lending rates of 10.5-13.5% for medium- and
long-term credit and the relatively low level of inflation for 1978, positive
real rates had resulted. However, this may not continue if the inflation
rate reaches a higher level during the post-devaluation period. The Bank's
estimates indicate that the inflation rate in Indonesia could reach 20% in
1979, and then recede to 12% in 1980 and 10% in 1981. The Government's
estimates are lower. Published statistics show that for the 12-month period
ending March 31, 1979 the inflation rate was about 12% and the Government is
endeavoring to keep the inflation rate at a low level by adopting appropriate
measures.
2.14      Interest rates on term deposits have also been reduced.  Interest
rates on time deposits which ranged from 6% to 24% were reduced to 6-18% in
January 1977. In January 1978, a further reduction brought interest rates
down from 18% to 12% /1 on two-year deposits, from 15% to 12% on one-year
deposits and from 9% to 6% on six-month deposits. After all these revisions,
however, interest rates on term deposits (12-15%) still exceed interest rates
for term lending (10.5-13.5%) which would result in either a negative spread
or no spread at all accruing to the financial institutions. While State
banks are not adversely affected by this situation as they receive direct
interest subsidies from Bank Indonesia, private financial intermediaries are
prevented from mobilizing long-term resources from the market to finance
their term lending operations. Hence, the profitability of private banks and
their ability to compete with State banks for term deposits is adversely
affected. Deposit rates higher than borrowing rates also serve as a disincen-
tive for project sponsors to increase project financing with their own
funds.
2.15      The realignment of term lending and term deposit rates still does
not allow financial institutions a sufficiently positive interest spread to
cover their intermediation costs. The revision of the interest rate structure
by Bank Indonesia in early 1978 was clearly an important step in the right
direction. Future progress will depend on the Government's capacity to
effectively control the inflationary pressures in coming years. In conformity
with past practice, the Government is expected to keep the interest rates under
constant review and make the required adjustments.
3. RECENT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
A. Historical Perspective
3.01      The Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (BAPINDO) was established by the
Government in 1960 and served, until 1965, as a conduit for Government funds
to specified Government projects, lacking any degree of autonomy. By 1965
its resources were exhausted and its operations had virtually stopped.
Although BAPINDO was allowed to undertake commercial banking functions in
/1 Fifteen percent for the first Rp 2.5 million.



- 15 -
1966, its operations continued to be constrained by a shortage of financial
resources and organizational problems.. In 1969, the Bank began to work
with the Government towards improving BAPINDO by undertaking an examinatoio
ahich revealed operating inefficiency, poor management and financial diffi-
culties. In fact, by 1970 BAPINDO's financial position and organizational
problems were so critical that Bank Indonesia instructed BAPINDO to discon-
tinue making term loans to new clients. Bank Indonesia withdrew that res-
triction in December 1971. In order to address the problems highlighted by
the Bank's study, the Government, BAPCNDO and the Bank agreed in 1970 that
the following reorganization scheme would be implemented with a view to
improving BAPINDO's role as a major finaiu ia1 intermediary: (a) BAPINDO would
become a specialized institution providing term finance for industrial
development and would limit its commercial banking operations to those
necessary on behalf of its term loan clients; (b) a comprehensive "Policy
Statement" would be adopted to provide sound financial and operating guidelines
for BAPINDO's operations; (c) the Government would grant BAPINDO adequate
operational autonomy; (d) BAPINDO would strengthen its management and organi-
zation by appointment of a new President and enlargement of the Board of
Managing Directors, the reduction of surplus staff and of the branch network
and the regrouping of existing departments with a view to building up an
adequate capacity for appraisal and follow-up work; (e) BAPINDO's capital
structure and financial position would be improved through massive increases
in its share capital, the write-off of uncollectible loans, and relieving
BAPINDO of all financial liability with respect to its loans to 19 state
enterprises; and (f) BAPINDO's accounts would be audited by independent
qualified auditors. It was also agreed that a Technical Assistance Program
would be executed by the Bank and financed jointly by UNDP, the Bank and the
Governments of Australia and Japan.
3.02      BAPINDO's implementation of the reorganization scheme has resulted
in improvements of the following aspects during 1971-1976.
3.03      Organization, Management and Staff.  The Board of Managing Directors
was strengthened by the appointment of a new President, Mr. Kuntoadji, in
January 1971, and two additional Managing Directors in 1972. BAPINDO's manage-
ment has since 1971 regrouped BAPINDO's activities among its departments, and
in the process has created a number of new departments/units. BAPINDO reduced
the size of its staff by about 40% during 1972-73 to lessen overstaffing. It
has also curtailed its branch network, closing or downgrading those branches
which played an insignificant role. In February 1975, the M4inister of Finance
and and the Governor of Bank Indonesia delegated their authority within the
Supervisory Board to qualified alternates who could devote more time to
overseeing BAPINDO's operations. Since then the Supervisory Board has
been providing BAPINDO with active guidance and effective supervision, and
BAPINDO has been operating as a development finance institution with adequate
operational autonomy vis-a-vis the Government.
3.04      Financial Improvements.  BAPINDO's capital structure was strengthened
through additional cash subscriptions by the Government to BAPINDO's paid-in
capital of Rp 18.6 billion in 1974, Rp 4.5 billion in 1975 and Rp 10.3 billion
in 1976. Write-offs of bad debts totalled Rp 7 billion for the four-year



- 16 -
period 1973-76, which was equivalent to 10.6% of BAPINDO's outstanding term
loan portfolio as of December 31, 1976. BAPINDO's management also initiated
a study on the causes of high arrears in the portfolio.
3.05      Audit.  BAPINDO's books have been audited by Drs. Utomo, Mulia &
Co. since 1969. The auditors found that for 1969 and 1970, BAPINDO's books
and records were inadequate, and they were therefore unable to express an
opinion on BAPINDO's accounts for those years. The auditors made many
recommendations for improvng BAPINDO's accounting procedures, which BAPINDO
implemented. From 1971 onwards, the auditors have been able to certify
BAPINDO's accounts and their audit reports issued since 1973 without any
qualification.
3.06      Technical Assistance Program.  The Technical Assistance Program
(para. 3.01) providing BAPINDO with the services of six expatriate advisors
(four for development banking, and two for maritime operations) since 1971
has significantly contributed to BAPINDO's operational progress and staff
training.
B. Problems Facing BAPINDO at Time of Previous Appraisal
3.07      During its visit in Indonesia in October 1976, the Bank's appraisal
mission reviewed with both BAPINDO and the Government the progress made up to
that point in implementing the reorganization scheme of 1970 and other
measures initiated thereafter. While noting that considerable improvements
had been achieved, the mission concluded that BAPINDO continued to face a
number of problems of which the more serious ones, together with the remedies
proposed, are summarized below:
3.08      Staff Size and Allocation.  In spite of the 40% reduction in staff
size in 1972-73, BAPINDO's staff still remained too large in relation to the
volume of business at hand. There was a need for BAPINDO to reduce staff
surplus gradually by attrition, to limit recruitment of additional staff to
categories of specialists in which BAPINDO was under-staffed and to intensify
staff training in order to upgrade staff quality. There was staff misallocation,
reflected in staff shortage in some units and staff surplus in others. To
correct the situation, there was a need for BAPINDO to undertake a comprehensive
review of its staff deployment with a view to effecting appropriate staff
re-assignments.
3.09      Branch Network.  In spite of a reduction in 1972, BAPINDO's branch
network required further review. Some branch offices did not appear necessary
from the standpoint of the business at hand. Staff size in some branch
offices was excessive in relation to workload. Demarcation of functions was
unclear and there was duplication of work between headquarters and branch
offices.
3.10      High Administrative Cost and Low Profitability.  BAPINDO's profita-
bility has been low. In 1973-76, its net profit averaged 2.7% of net worth.
This low profitability was attributable mainly to BAPINDO's high administrative
expenses and large provisions for possible losses. The high administrative
cost, averaging 3.7% of average total assets in 1974-76, was in turn due to
the large staff size and the extensive branch network. There was a need for



- 17 -
BAPINDO to exert a tighter control over its expenditures and to reduce the
ratio of its administrative cost to total assets. This could be achieved
over time by reducing its staff surplus (by attrition) and by closing
down unnecessary branch offices.
3.11      Financial Liability in Public Sector Projects.  The Government in
1970 relieved BAPINDO of the financial liability pertaining to loans to 19
state enterprises (all of whom were then in some financial difficulty) with
the objective of strengthening BAPINDO's financial position. Since then,
however, BAPINDO has financed other state enterprise projects and some loans
were made at the Government's behest and without an independent appraisal by
BAPINDO. Certainly it was inappropriate for BAPINDO to assume the financial
liability for these loans and they should be segregated from BAPINDO's own
portfolio. The risk should have been assumed by the Government and BAPINDO
should have received a handling fee. Five "behest loans" totalling about Rp
11.6 billion were then under this category.
3.12      Appraisal Work.  Despite considerable improvements since BAPINDO
began to build up its capability for project appraisal in 1971, there was
still a need for further upgrading the standards and accelerating the speed
of BAPINDO's appraisal work. One serious weakness of BAPINDO's appraisal work
was its slowness. (A sample examination in 1976 indicated that an average of
360 days was required for loan processing from receipt of loan application to
approval.) If uncorrected, this would continue to affect the level of efficiency
of the entire institution. Other deficiencies were in economic evaluation and
market analysis. Partial economic indLicators of projects were not systematic-
ally analyzed in BAPINDO's appraisal reports and the quality of such reports
was uneven. To improve the situation, BAPINDO would need to accelerate the
appraisal process at every stage, expand the appraisal staff, eliminate
unnecessary overlapping between headquarters and the branches, make more
systematic use of partial economic indicators, compare actual economic
impact of projects with estimates, ancL undertake the calculation of economic
rate of return for relatively large projects.
3.13      Operating Policies.  The average size of BAPINDO-financed projects
has been showing an upward trend mainly due to BAPINDO's financing of Government-
sponsored projects (usually large-scale) which in the two-year period 1975-76
accounted for 60% (by amount) of BAPINDO's commitments but only for 12% by
number. While it was entirely justified for BAPINDO to finance large projects,
especially since PDFCI and IDFC, the t:wo other DFCs operating alongside
BAPINDO, have limited staff and financial resources for assisting such
projects, the mission felt that BAPINDO should seek to finance an increasing
number of medium-sized investment pro;jects requiring BAPINDO's financing for
US$1 million equivalent or less.
3.14      Loan Arrears.  A high level of arrears continuously plagued BAPINDO's
loan portfolio during the period 1971--76. Term loans affected by arrears repre-
sented one-third of the total term loan portfolio outstanding at December 31,
1976. Thirty eight percent of the arrears exceeded twelve months. The loan
collection rate (i.e. amounts actually collected as a percentage of amounts
due) for term loans dropped to 54.3% :Ln 1976. Write-offs of bad debts
totalled Rp 7 billion for 1973-76, accounting for 10.6% of BAPINDO's term



- 18 -
loan portfolio as of December 31, 1976. The unsatisfactory arrears situation
and poor loan collection performance were mainly attributable to the following
factors: (a) delays in the completion of projects; (b) BAPINDO's practice to
set unrealistically short repayment schedules with the objective of collecting
its loans as early as possible, (c) the severe credit restrictions imposed by
the Government since 1974 in order to control inflation, which compounded the
liquidity problems of borrowing companies; and (d) the inefficient performance
of PUPN, the Government collection agency through which all loan foreclosures
and legal actions by State banks, including BAPINDO, must be handled. In
addition, the loan repayment record of borrowers in Indonesia has generally
been unsatisfactory, owing partly to a legal system favoring borrowers vis-a-vis
lenders. As a short-term phenomemon, BAPINDO's low rate (9%) on interest in
arrears acted as an incentive for some delinquent borrowers not to repay.
The mission concluded that to adequately deal with the arrears problem,
BAPINDO would need to conduct a thorough review of the portfolio and to
strengthen its follow-up work. At the same time, the Government should make
arrangements to enable all state enterprises borrowing from BAPINDO to settle
their arrears with BAPINDO, relieve BAPINDO of all financial liability for
loans made at the Government's behest, compensate BAPINDO for its exposure in
raw cotton loans and take steps to improve the operation of PUPN.
C. Implementation of the Program of Action, 1977
3.15      During negotiations for the lastest Bank loan No. 1437-IND in early
1977, the Bank reached understandings with the Government and BAPINDO on a
comprehensive Program of Action (Annex 2) designed to remedy the short- and
long-term problems still facing BAPINDO and to achieve further and more
lasting improvements. BAPINDO agreed to take necessary steps to improve its
serious arrears situation, reduce its administrative costs, strengthen its
branch network, expand its appraisal and supervision staff, strengthen its
Project Promotion and Research Departments, shorten the time for project
appraisal, improve its economic analysis of projects, diversify its resources,
increase its provisions, and seek to finance more medium-sized projects. The
Government also agreed to take the following measures: (a) to relieve BAPINDO
of all financial liability pertaining to projects financed by BAPINDO at the
Government's behest; (b) to make arrangements to enable all State enterprises
to settle with BAPINDO their arrears over three months; (c) to compensate
BAPINDO for its losses on raw cotton financing (undertaken by BAPINDO as a
short-term commercial banking operation) amounting to Rp 7.5 billion; (d) to
streamline the operations of PUPN, the official collection agency, and to
require the agency to speed up collection of BAPINDO's delinquent loans.
3.16      Both the Government and BAPINDO have endeavored to implement
the Program of Action and the Bank has been kept informed of the progress
regularly. Considerable headway had been made by the time the appraisal
mission visited BAPINDO and reviewed the progress in August 1978.
3.17      On the part of the Government, concrete steps had been taken to
fulfill its commitments as follows:
(a) With the concurrence of the Central Bank, all loans, totalling
Rp 30.6 billion, made by BAPINDO during the past years at the



- 19 -
Government's behest were transferred to a "managed fund" as of
December 31, 1977;
(b)  P.T. Natour, the Government-owned hotel/tourist company, was the
only state enterprise which was in arrears in 1977. In January
1978, BAPINDO received cash from the Government for pa-t of the
arrears due and rescheduled the balance outstanding;
(c) The Government had completely compensated BAPINDO for its losses on
raw cotton loans totalling Rp 7.6 billion, and losses on shipping
loans to P.T. Pelni totalling Rp 652 million prior to March 31,
1978. BAPINDO also informed the Ministry of Finance of the total
amount (Rp 3.4 billion) owed by the Government to BAPINDO for crumb
rubber projects and proposed that the Ministry reimburse BAPINDO
Rp 1.7 billion in 1979 and a further Rp 1.7 billion in 1980.
(d)  In order to improve the capabilities of PUPN, the Government pro-
mulgated in September 1977 an Executive Regulation of Act No. 49
which clearly established the role of the collection agency in the
settlement or management of all kinds of State receivables including
uncollectible medium- and long-term loans. Also, a permanent
secretariat has been created, and qualified professional staff are
being recruited which is expected to lead to much improved PUPN
operations.
3.18      BAPINDO's management has assigned high priority to the implementa-
tion of the Program of Action agreed upon with the Bank in 1977. While the
implementation of some measures will require a longer time period, BAPINDO's
achievements thus far are quite satisfactory.  A summary of BAPINDO's
progress is given below.
3.19      Portfolio Improvement.  In line with the Program of Action, BAPINDO
initiated a comprehensive program to deal with arrears in July 1977.  Under
this program, detailed collection procedures were introduced, annual collec-
tion targets were set for each branch office and monitored closely by the
management, the Managing Directors became directly involved in speeding up
the collection process, and the portfolio situation began to be reviewed by
the Board at least monthly. Penalty interest on arrears of term loans has
been increased to 10.5-13.5% and that on working capital loans to 6.75%.
3.20      BAPINDO commissioned P.T. SGV-Utomo, a management consultant firm,
to undertake a portfolio audit on an account-by-account basis. The report
was completed in June 1978 and disclosed deficiencies of loan documentation,
collateral management and project supervision in a number of cases. Based on
these findings, the Board has immediately issued instructions to department
heads and branch managers to take corrective action within six months.
3.21      Organizational Reforms.  In the second half of 1977, BAPINDO
carried out a study of its organization aimed at rationalizing the depart-



- 20 -
ments and more evenly distributing the responsibilities amongst the Managing
Directors. Based on the results of the study, BAPINDO decided in January
1978 to restructure the units dealing with project appraisal and follow-up.
The original Credit and Follow Up Department and Maritime Credit Department
were replaced by two new Credit Departments, one responsible for industrial
project appraisal within Java and Bali and the other for appraisal in all
other areas (e.g. Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan) and for the maritime sector.
Each Credit Department has now six appraisal teams and two implementation
teams (responsible for project supervision prior to completion) with appraisal
staff permanently assigned to such teams. The original Engineering and Legal
Departments were reduced and renamed as Engineering and Legal Desks with the
majority of their staffs allocated to the appraisal and implementation teams
within the two new Credit Departments. The original Branch Supervision
Department has been expanded and renamed as Credit & Branch Supervision
Department, taking over the project supervision functions of the original
Credit and Follow Up Department, and retaining the old functions of super-
vising the branches.
3.22      BAPINDO also took action to upgrade the capabilities of several
branches by reassigning some experienced senior loan officers as branch
managers or deputy managers. All branch offices have now been delegated the
authority to make full appraisals of selected projects, subject to review by
the Head Office appraisal teams. They also have the authority to accept or
reject applications after a preliminary review of the basic data provided by
applicants. In the long run, the Board expects to be in a position to evaluate
the capabilities of the branch staff with a view toward eventually granting
increased responsibilities to them.
3.23      BAPINDO currently employs 778 persons with 484 working in the Head
Office and the remaining 294 in branches and representative offices. Of the
total number of persons employed by BAPINDO, 414 are professional staff of
which 295 work at the Head Office. Since the latter part of 1977 BAPINDO has
undertaken considerable reallocation of staff in accordance with recommenda-
tions of the Program of Action. In late 1978, the Project Promotion Department
was greatly strengthened by transferring the experienced Branch managers to
this Department. While most of BAPINDO's departments appear to be fairly
adequately staffed now, there is still a need to strengthen the Research
Department (particularly with regard to its economic work). Recruitment of
new staff is more or less limited to replacing only those staff retiring over
the next few years, but BAPINDO is prepared to make exceptions in adding
qualified new staff to strengthen its project promotion and sector studies.
BAPINDO's organization chart as of December 31, 1978 is included in Annex 3.
3.24      In June 1978, BAPINDO commissioned the SGV-Utomo group to carry out
a study of BAPINDO's organization, personnel procedures, reporting, accounting,
budgetary processes and administrative cost structure. This study when
completed in 1979 is expected to enable BAPINDO to further strengthen its
organizational set-up to simplify its operating procedures and to find effective
means to reduce its administrative costs, which remained at a high level of
3.7%, of average total assets in 1978.



- 21 -
3.25      BAPINDO's Efforts to Streamline Loan Processing Procedures.  BAPINDO
made an effort to shorten the loan processing cycle by initiating the system
of permanent appraisal and implementation teams (members of each team
are all under the supervision of one manager), and delegating authority to
the branches to make decisions after reviewing the basic data of a project as
to whether to Process or reject an application. Some tangible result has
been achieved. In 1977, the processing cycle for all types of loans averaged
163 days and in the first eight months of 1978, this was reduced to 109. For
new projects, the reduction was fronn 220 to 184 days. BAPINDO plans to
further shorten the processing cycle by adopting different procedures clearly
outlined in flow charts for repeater loans and new loans respectively. The
managers at different levels will tighten monitoring of the progress of
project appraisal, following the new flow charts.  Managing Directors have
been making regular visits to the branches and decision meetings held in the
field and chaired by a Managing Director can supersede investment committee
meetings in the Head Office. Signing of loan agreements is also facilitated
by such visits. In addition,BAPIND() plans to delegate more authority to the
branches. However, BAPINDO's management realizes the uneven capability and
efficiency of the branches, and will make a thorough review, together with
outside consultants, before further delegation of authority is granted.
3.26      While the Government has fulfilled almost all its commitments and
BAPINDO has made considerable progress in implementing the Program of Action,
it is essential that BAPINDO continue to make further improvements. A
special effort will be made by BAPINDO to: (a) accelerate project promotion
work and develop more labor-intensive projects; (b) strengthen sector studies;
(c) further shorten the project processing cycle; (d) improve monitoring of
problem projects; and (e) intensify training of its staff. These are discussed
below:
(i) Project Promotion and Development of More Labor-Intensive Projects
3.27      The environment in which BAPINDO is operating has become more
competitive especially after the Government decided in early 1978 to allow
other State banks to make term loans up to ten years. In order to meet this
competition and prevent a further downturn of its level of operations,
BAPINDO is planning to intensify its project promotion work, identifying and
developing projects especially the medium-sized and more labor-intensive
ones. It is realized that merely strengthening one department (the Project
Promotion Department) is not enough. The entire management team and staff of
BAPINDO will become more actively involved in project promotion. Local and
foreign consultants will be employecl to carry out that part of the work which
the existing staff is not presently trained to deal with. BAPINDO will also
have more frequent contacts with Kadins (Chambers of Commerce and Industry),
ICB, potential entrepreneurs in the provinces, local authorities and other
financial institutions. If the branch offices need any help, in the course of
project promotion, special promotion teams will be sent from the Head Office
to provide assistance. Special training of the staff in the field of project
identification and promotion will be initiated to help further increase their
capability of dealing with the promotional work. BAPINDO plans to employ an
expatriate expert on project promotion for about a year and send four or five



- 22 -
of its employees overseas within the next year for training in other DFCs in
Asia and Europe which have considerable experience in project promotion.
Under the proposed loan US$100,000 will be earmarked to finance the cost of this
program and the services of the project promotion specialist.
(ii) Sector Studies
3.28      BAPINDO's Research Department has conducted studies on such subsec-
tors as textiles, cement, tires, leather, timber, tourism, etc. However, the
sector work needs to be more systematically organized and more in-depth
studies should be conducted. Staff strength has been a problem and to solve
it, additional qualified staff will be assigned to this Department. In the
meantime, outside consultants could fill the gap. In carrying out the sector
work effectively, BAPINDO will maintain close contact with BAPPENAS.
Up to now, BAPINDO's reports on sector studies have been confined to internal
use only. In order to assure cooperation from the other institutions and to
benefit the potential investors, BAPINDO's sector reports will also be pre-
pared for outside circulation. Well-organized sector studies also contribute
to the promotion work to a large extent. Therefore, the sector studies could
be more operationally oriented than pure research studies.
(iii) Project Processing Cycle
3.29      While BAPINDO's management has been making efforts to shorten the
time required to complete the appraisal of a project, there is still consi-
derable room for improvement. Consideration will be given to delegation to
the branches the authority to approve projects below a certain size, working
capital loans and repeater loans to existing borrowers. Such delegation of
authority will be made after the staff strength of each branch has been
thoroughly reviewed. The authority could vary from branch to branch,
depending upon the past performance and competence of the staff in the
different branches. BAPINDO will make a constant review of the procedures
for the purpose of reducing the processing cycle.
(iv) Monitoring of Problem Projects
3.30      Apart from strengthening project supervision work, BAPINDO will
work out a set of guidelines for monitoring projects in difficulty. At
present, there is a tendency to rely on outside consultants to bail out
projects in serious trouble. Staff involvement will be increased even in
cases where outside consultants are playing the principal role. More staff
time will be allotted to the projects in difficulty, and the work will be
more systematically organized.
(v) Staff Training
3.31      In the course of reorganization that took place in late 1977,
involving the formation of permanent appraisal and implementation teams, a
number of staff who have had little experience in project appraisal or
supervision were assigned to some teams. As a result, the professional
competence varies widely between teams. In order to upgrade the weaker
teams, BAPINDO realized that intensive training of the staff is imperative.



- 23 -
Also, BAPINDO's economic staff need further training in order to adequately
strengthen the promotion and sector work. Training the existing staff with
potential appears to be the only way to achieve the objectives of increasing
the quality of project appraisal, strengthening project supervision, upgrad-
ing sector studies and accelerating project promotion work since recruitment
of a large number of new staff would contradict BAPINDO's policy of curtail-
ing administrative expenses. BAPINDO is expected to work out a comprehensive
staff training program and a budget to finance the program, to be reviewed and
revised, if necessary, each year.
D. Operations
3.32      Summary of Operations.  A summary of BAPINDO's operations for the
period from January 1, 1974 to December 31, 1978 is included in Annex 4. After
resuming term financing in 1972, BAPINDO's overall operations continued to
register sharp increases, peaking in 1976 when total loan and equity invest-
ment approvals reached Rp 58.9 billion (US$142 million equivalent), compared
with Rp 44.3 billion in 1974 and Rp 46.2 billion in 1975. Long-term loan
approvals (for both the industrial and shipping sectors) increased from
Rp 20.8 billion in 1974 to Rp 36.2 billion in 1975 and to Rp 48.5 billion
in 1976. In 1977, BAPINDO's operations declined dramatically with total
approvals dropping 45% to Rp 32.1 billion and long-term loan approvals
dropping 57% to Rp 21 billion. The downward trend was halted in 1978, with
total approvals and long-term loan approvals reaching Rp 36.3 billion and
Rp 21.7 billion, respectively. Short-term raw cotton loans were completely
discontinued in 1975 and the business was transferred to Bank Ekspor-Impor.
BAPINDO's raw cotton loan portfolio was converted into a "managed fund" in
1977 (para. 3.17).
3.33      While it is difficult to identify the main cause for the downturn
of BAPINDO's volume of business, there are a few contributing factors which,
if put together, help analyze the situation. Firstly, the general worldwide
economic slowdown in the world dampened industrial investment in a number of
countries, including Indonesia. Whlile this had a stronger impact on private
sector investment than public sector investment, a number of large projects
sponsored by the Government, such as paper and cement projects, were com-
pleted in 1974-76 and very few new or even expansion projects of large size
were initiated in 1977-78 in the public sector. The pribumi policy, initi-
ated in 1974, was more rigidly enforced starting in 1977. Given the fact
that it takes time to promote indigenous entrepreneurship, the level of
financing to pribumis would naturaLly remain low for some time. Furthermore,
since January 1978 the State commercial banks have been allowed to make loans
of ten year maturities, entering into direct competiton with BAPINDO, and
eroding BAPINDO's term lending to a degree. Finally, since late 1977,
BAPINDO has been undergoing some internal organizational changes involving a
large number of personnel reassignments (para. 3.23). This could have slowed
down, to a certain degree, the processing of new projects, and the undertak-
ing of necessary promotional work at least in the short run. It is impos-
sible to assign any weight to the above causes but the combined effect has
been clearly felt by the institution. BAPINDO shares the view that unless



- 24 -
more promotional efforts are made by its management and staff, BAPINDO's
operations would continue to remain at a low level, compared with the record
achieved in 1974-76.
Characteristics of Industrial Loans
3.34      The characteristics of BAPINDO's industrial loans committed for
1974-78 are shown in Annex 5. During 1974-77, the average size of BAPINDO's
industrial term loans (committed) increased 235% from Rp 370.4 million in
1974 to Rp 872.2 million in 1977. At the same time, the number of such loans
droped from 46 to 26. This is attributable to the fact that the public
sector industrial projects, for which 60% of BAPINDO's industrial financing
had been allocated during these four years, became larger and more capital
intensive. In 1978, BAPINDO financed more medium-sized projects and most of such
projects are in the private sector. As a result, the average loan size
dropped to Rp 379 million, and BAPINDO's industrial financing provided for
private sector projects increased to 58% (from 34% in 1977).
3.35      The sectoral distribution of BAPINDO's industrial financing (including
working capital loans) reflected the strong impact of large projects committed
each year, and therefore there was no clear trend for the subsectors except
textile, whose share declined from 29% in 1974 to 13% in 1975 and to 9% in
1976-77. The subsectors which absorbed a dominant part of BAPINDO's industrial
financing included metal works in 1974 (48%), cement in 1975 (40%), paper in
1976 (32%), cement again in 1977 (64%) and rubber processing in 1978 (26%).
As a result of the domination of certain large projects, the sectoral dis-
tribution was not well balanced in any particular year. Since the paper and
cement projects belonged to the public sector, around 60% of BAPINDO's
industrial loans were made to public sector enterprises during 1974-77. The
picture changed in 1978, with 58% of its industrial financing made available
to private sector projects.
3.36      BAPINDO's industrial financing continued to be heavily concentrated
in West, Central and East Java, which accounted for 86% in 1974, 79% in 1975,
and 80% in 1976. Some geographical diversification was achieved in 1977,
resulting in a decline of Java's share to 33%. However, in 1978, the percentage
went up to 85%, close to the highest record achieved in the past years. In
view of the relatively advanced stage of industrialization in Java, this
degree of geographical concentration is understandable, but BAPINDO's manage-
ment realizes the need for greater regional distribution of its financing.
3.37      During 1974-77, the average maturities of BAPINDO's industrial
term loans ranged between 6.4 to 8.1 years, and the percentage of the loans
with maturities of 10 years and above fluctuated from 13% to 37%.  In
1978, the average maturities was 7.8 years and the percentage of loans with
maturities of 10 years or longer increased to 37%. Since January 1, 1978,
the other State banks have been allowed to make loans up to 10 years (compared
to 5 years prior to that date) while BAPINDO was granted permission to make
loans of longer maturities, up to 15 years, compared to the previous 10 year
limit. The extension of BAPINDO's maturities is a welcome development as
BAPINDO's lending experience indicates that a number of arrears were the
direct result of insufficient grace and repayment periods granted in the
past.



- 25 -
Characteristics of Maritime Loans
3.38      Annex 6 gives the characteristics of BAPINDO's maritime loans
committed for the years 1974-1978. During this period, 11% of BAPINDO's
shipping loans were allocated for the rehabilitation of the existing inter-
island Regula- Liner Service (RLS), and 89% went for other shipping and
related activities such as dockyards, lighterage, ocean-going vessels, etc.
The loans for RLS were financed under IDA Credit No. 318-IND (US$8.5 million,
including US$1.5 million for technical assistance). After the credit was
fully committed in 1977, BAPINDO stopped making further loans for RLS
projects and further loans for such projects were financed under Bank Loan
1250-IND (US$54 million) which was handled by P.T. PANN. BAPINDO, however,
continued to make shipping loans for non-RLS projects under Bank Loans
1054-IND and 1437-IND.
3.39      The average size of shipping loans ranged from Rp 164 million to
Rp 558 million during 1974-77. The loans extended in 1978 are much larger
in size, averaging Rp 910 million.   In 1974-75, most shipping loans had
maturities of up to six years, while from 1976-1978, 78% of the loans
had maturities longer than six years. During the entire period from January
1, 1974 to December 31, 1978, 75% of the amount of BAPINDO's shipping finance
was received by private shipping firms and 25% by Government enterprises.
3.40      At the end of 1978, shipping loans accounted for around 19% of
BAPINDO's total loan portfolio.
Equity Investments
3.41      Annex 7 lists BAPINDO's equity investments as of December 31, 1978.
BAPINDO had made equity investments in fifteen companies, totalling Rp 2,980
million. The investment in P.T. PANN, the Government-owned shipping and
leasing company, amounts to Rp 800 million, accounting for 19% of BAPINDO's
equity portfolio. The remaining fourteen companies are all privately owned.
Six companies, including P.T. PANN, also received loans from BAPINDO, totalling
Rp 12 billion. In seven of the companies, BAPINDO's shareholding ranges
from 28% to 100% of their respectives share capital, exceeding in each case the
ceiling of 25% as specified in the Policy Statement. While four companies
have been operating profitably, no dividend has been paid by any of them.
BAPINDO intends to sell the shares whenever buyers are available, but so far
no turnover of its shares has taken place.
3.42      BAPINDO continued to manage the Capital Participation Fund set up
by Bank Indonesia in 1968. As of December 31, 1978, the outstanding amount of
the Fund was Rp 1.75 billion, invested in 14 companies.
Co-financing of Small Business with RDBs
3.43      Since early 1973, BAPINDO has been financing small business projects
in collaboration with selected Regional Development Banks (RDBs). Initially,
BAPINDO used its own resources to finance 80% of each subloan, with the RDB
financing the balance. Since the K-[K and KMKP schemes were initiated by the



- 26 -
Central Bank (BI) in December 1973, BAPINDO and the RDBs have been making use of
the BI facilities to the fullest extent. According to the current procedures
under these programs, BI finances 80% of each term loan, with BAPINDO and the
participating RDB contributing 10% each. The corresponding shares for
working capital loans are 75% by BI, 15% by BAPINDO, and 10% by RDB. In
January 1978, the limit for each borrower was raised by Rp 5 millin to
Rp 10 million, while the interest rate was reduced from 12% to 10.5% for term
loans and from 15% to 12% for working capital loans. Term loans have matu-
rities of five years and working capital loans three years. Loans to a group
of borrowers can have ten-year maturities. Seventy-five percent of the
amount of each loan is insured by P.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (ASKRINDO).
In all co-financing cases, the appraisal reports are submitted to ASKRINDO
through BAPINDO.
3.44      BAPINDO has been providing technical assistance to the RDBs asso-
ciated with it which has strengthened their organization and provided train-
ing for their staff. Such assistance is crucial to many weak RDBs.
3.45      As of December 31, 1978, BAPINDO's co-financing commitments reached
Rp 14,952 million, including Rp 8,308 million for term loans and Rp 6,644
million for working capital loans. The sectoral breakdown of the commitments
is shown in Annex 8.
3.46      It is BAPINDO's policy to discontinue co-financing operations with
any RDB which has sufficiently built up its appraisal capability and is able
to deal with BI directly without BAPINDO's assistance. Of the 20 RDBs which
have been associated with BAPINDO, 9 have begun to operate independently
under the KIK and KMKP Programs. While phasing out its co-financing oeprations
with the strong RDBs, BAPINDO feels that there is still a need to continue
its assistance to the other 11 relatively weak RDBs. It is now planning to
start providing assistance to three other RDBs operating in Jambi, Riau, and
Irian Jaya, respectively. In financial terms, BAPINDO's role in co-financing
small industry projects is expected to continue. BAPINDO's projections show
that approvals of co-financing with RDBs would increase at a rate of around
15% from Rp 3.5 billion in 1979 to Rp 4.6 billion in 1981 and to Rp 6.1 billion
in 1983.
E. Financial Position and Performance
Financial Position
3.47      Summarized audited balance sheets for the period 1974-1978 are given in
Annex 9.  During the two year period from the end of 1974 to the end of 1976,
BAPINDO's total assets increased from Rp 87 billion to Rp 125 billion, showing
an average annual rate of growth of 21%. During the following two years ended
December 31, 1978, the growth rate of the total assets slowed to an annual
rate of 8%, mainly due to transfer of the loans originally made at
the Government's behest into a "managed fund." As of December 31, 1978, the
term loan portfolio, including syndicated loans with other State Banks and
co-financing with Regional Development Banks, accounted for 66% of total



27 -
assets, the equity investment portfolio for 1.6%, and current assets for 31%.
At the end of 1976, the corresponding percentages were 50%, 1.4% and 48%,
respectively. The liquidation of raw cotton loans by transferring such loans
to the "managed fund" in 1977 has decreased the unusually high current assets
percentage. On the liability side BAPINDO's capital structure has been
further strengthened through additional cash contribution of Rp 6 billion as
paid-in capital and conversion of Bank Indonesia loans totalling Rp 9.5
billion into paid-in capital reserves in 1977. BAPINDO's long-term debt/
equity ratio as of December 31, 1978 was 0.8:1 (against the limit of 3:1 as
specified in the Loan Agreement), the ratio of total debt including demand
and time deposits to equity was 1.3:1, and the current ratio stood at 1.5:1.
3.48      During 1975-77, BAPINDO has allocated Rp 7.8 billion from its annual
profits as provisions for bad debts, in view of the deteriorating quality of
its loan portfolio, and additional provisions amounting to Rp 3.6 billion
were made for 1978 after BAPINDO's portfolio review was completed. As of
December 31, 1978, total reserves and provisions amounted to Rp 20.9 billion
representing 17.3% of BAPINDO's loan and equity portfolio, which is considered
adequate.
Financial Performance
3.49      Annex 10 presents BAPINDO's summarized audited income statements
for the period 1974-1978. BAPINDO's profitability has been very low, and the
past pattern very erratic. BAPINDO's return on average equity reached its
peak (5.7%) in 1973, and has declined since then to 4.3% in 1974, 2.2% in
1975 and 0.6% in 1976. Large annual provisions for possibLe losses, and a
build-up of equity, were the main causes for the decline. In 1976, although
the provisions made were smaller (about 64% of the provisions made in 1975),
the return went down sharply as BAPINDO stopped accruing interest on out-
standing raw cotton loans to two Government textile mills for which the
Government-'agreed to settle existing arrears.  In 1977, the downward trend
was reversed but the return (1.5%) was still very low. The rising cost of
BAPINDO's borrowings was another contriouting factor. BAPINDO's profit after
tax and provisions for 1978 amounted to Rp 1.1 billion, 39% higher than the
corresponding figure (Rp 0.79 billion) for 1977. BAPINDO's return on average
net worth in 1978 rose to 1.8%, the highest in the last three years.
3.50      BAPINDO's administrative expenses have remained at a high level
relative to total assets for a number of years. In 1974-77, the average
ratio of BAPINDO's administrative expenses to total assets was 3.7%, which
was much higher than most of the DFCs associated with the Bank. The ratio
calculated on the audited accounts for 1978 remained at the same level. The
large staff size and a very extensive branch network have been partially
responsible for the high level of administrative expenses. Since 1974,
BAPINDO has been reducing its staff size by attrition coupled with inter-
departmental transfer of personnel, but its staff still appears too large in
relation to volume of business. In 1978, BAPINDO commissioned a consulting
firm (P.T. SGV-Utomo) to make a study of the organization and personnel of
BAPINDO, with a view to finding ways to increase its operating efficiency,
and to realistically reduce its administrative costs. The study is scheduled
to be completed in mid-1979.



- 28 -
Quality of Portfolio
3.51      The findings of P.T. SGV-Utomo concerning BAPINDO's loan portfolio
as of December 31, 1977, indicate- that 42% -f the prcjec.s ie,-_  e
profitably, 12% were under construction and 46% were operating at a loss or
having financial and/or technical difficulties. In terms of amount of
outstanding loans, the percentages for the three categories were 26%, 21% and
53%, respectively. This means that more than half of BAPINDO's financing had
gone to companies operating with difficulties. However, the original
appraisal values of the collaterals put up by BAPINDO's borrowers represented
209% of the loan amounts, with the respective percentages of the three
categories of borrowers at 263%, 344% and 128% respectively. The collateral
values were recorded in the original appraisal reports and, in the opinion of
the auditors, were overstated particularly those collaterals such as build-
ings, machinery and equipment, vehicles and vessels which are subject to loss
in value due to depreciation. The current appraisal values were not available.
3.52      Annex 11 shows the arrears situation from 1976 through 1978.  At
the end of 1976, total arrears over three months on BAPINDO's term loans
reached Rp 6.2 billion, with one third of the term loan portfolio affected by
arrears. The arrears situation improved considerably at the end of 1977,
with total arrears going down to Rp 2.7 billion and the portion of the loan
portfolio affected by arrears reduced to 7.1%. This was resulted from the
rescheduling of a large number of loans in the course of 1977 (Annex 11). As
of December 31, 1978, however, the arrears increased to Rp 4.0 billion and
affected loans accounted for 12.3%, resuming the upward trend. For industrial
term loan portfolio alone, the arrears increased from Rp 2.4 billion at the
end of 1977 (after reaching the peak of Rp 4.4 billion at the end of 1976) to
Rp 2.8 billion as of December 31, 1978. Affected portfolio dropped from
36.7% at the end of 1976 to 6.4% at the end of 1977 and went back up again to
9.5% as of December 31, 1978.
3.53      In the wake of the devaluation of November 15, 1978, a number of
BAPINDO's borrowers have been facing liquidity problems. Although all of
them are protected against foreign exchange risk (which is borne by the
Government) on BAPINDO's foreign currency loans, most have to import raw
materials from abroad, which cost 50% higher than before. Therefore, they
need additional working capital to sustain their level of production. The
Government, in an effort to keep inflationary pressures under control, is
monitoring the prices very closely. Many enterprises have claimed that they
have not been able to increase their selling prices to a level which ade-
quately reflects increase in production cost caused by the devaluation. It
is clear that the debt servicing capability of some firms has been seriously
affected. BAPINDO is reviewing its portfolio and reassessing the situation
on a case-by-case basis. In a number of cases BAPINDO will have to make
timely additional working capital loans (to avoid production slow-down), or
to reschedule the existing loans or both. Under the circumstances, loan
arrears are also expected to rise. At least in the short run, the quality of
BAPINDO's loan portfolio is likely to deteriorate, before all the legitimate
demand for working capital has been adequately satisfied and the selling
prices can provide sufficient profit margin to the producers. BAPINDO
is aware of this problem and contemplating effective measures which
could include the provision of supplemental loans to enterprises affected by
devaluation-induced liquidity difficulties.



- 29 -
3.54      BAPINDO's management has been reviewing the portfolio more regularly
during the last two years and has been granting requests for loan rescheduling
whenever justified. However, monitoring of problem projects needs to be
further intensified in light of the postdevaluation conditions. The branches
should play a major role in this regard, since they are close to the scene and
are responsible for project supervision within their respective regions.
BAPINDO's management fully shared this view and is taking necessary steps to
improve the situation.
Resource Position
3.55      Local Currency Resources.  Details of BAPINDO's resource position
as of December 31, 1978 are provided in Annex 12. BAPINDO continues to rely
on the Government, Bank Indonesia and the other State banks, for its local
currency resources. During the past three years, BAPINDO's resources have
been further replenished by share capital increases of Rp 10.3 billion (in
1976), and Rp 6 billion (in 1977), a-nd the payment by the Government of the
arrears of Rp 7.6 billion on raw cotton loans and Rp 652 million on shipping
loans. In addition, some Government loans totalling Rp 10 billion have been
converted into "paid-in reserves". As a result, total long-term domestic
currency resources reached Rp 111.0 billion (equivalent to $268 million) as of
December 31, 1978. Against these resources, BAPINDO had, as of the same date,
outstanding assets of Rp 95.5 billion plus undisbursed approvals and commitments
of Rp 12.5 billion, leaving Rp 3 billion available for further approvals.
Short-term rupiah funds available for utilization amounted to only Rp 69 million
as of December 31, 1978.
3.56      Foreign Currency Resources.  BAPINDO has been successful in further
diversifying its foreign sources of borrowing. After a loan of DM 20 million
from KfW in 1976, BAPINDO obtained a loan of US $30 million from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) in late 1977. As of December 31, 1978, BAPINDO's
foreign resources totalled US$145.2 ;nillion. Loan approvals of US$117.4
million (81% of total foreign resources raised) have been granted against
these resources as of the same date, leaving a balance of US$27.8 million
available for further approvals. Of the approvals, US$77.9 million had been
disbursed.
4. BAPINDO's DEVELOPMENT IMPACT
BAPINDO's Share of Investment
4.01      While it is difficult to assess precisely BAPINDO's share in
industrial investment in Indonesia because of the insufficiency of reliable
data, its contribution to financing of industry can be roughly gauged by
analyzing the data which is available. BAPINDO's role in financing the
industrial sector has been expanding since it resumed term lending in 1972.
The volume of BAPINDO's industrial term loan and investment approvals in 1974
(Rp 24.8 billion) was equivalent to 14% of the amount of domestic industrial
investment approved by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB) during that
year. BAPINDO's share increased to 15.7% in 1975 and to 26.1% in 1976, as



- 30 -
its term loan and investment approvals increased to Rp 29.2 billion and
Rp 46.9 billion respectively. During 1977, BAPINDO's industrial financing
operations declined to Rp 23.7 billion, for reasons outlined in para. 3.33,
while approvals of ICB went up sharply, to Rp 411 billion compared with
Rp 179.4 billion in 1976.  As a result, BAPINDO's share dropped to around 6%.
This, however, should not be taken as a permanent shrinkage of BAPINDO's role
in financing industries as most, if not all, of the contributing factors are
of a temporary character (para. 3.33).  The fact that BAPINDO had to make
a number of personnel reassignments in 1977 may have contributed to the
temporary downturn of its operations, more than other factors. In terms of
disbursements, BAPINDO was able to sustain its share. Its disbursements for
projects in both industrial and maritime sectors in 1977, Rp 37.2 billion,
accounted for 10% of the country's actual total industrial investment (includ-
ing the maritime sector) estimated at around Rp 380 billion during the year.
Economic Benefits of Assisted Projects
4.02      Since late 1976, BAPINDO has generally carried out an economic
analysis of subprojects which required BAPINDO's financing of US$1 million
equivalent or more. The Economic Rates of Return (ERRs) on eight projects
calculated to date ranged from 18.7% to 47.8%, with an average of 30.6%. A
textile project had the highest ERR and a land transportation project had the
lowest within the group. The projects financed by BAPINDO are economically
viable and the economic merits of a project are being given more weight in
BAPINDO's decision making process.
4.03      Available data on the projects financed by BAPINDO since 1976
indicates that the projects are estimated to generate a total investment of
Rp 241.1 billion (US$581 million), with BAPINDO financing approximately 40%
of the total cost of projects. BAPINDO has also made cost-per-job analysis
for the projects approved since 1976. Data available for 39 projects financed
since early 1976 indicates investment costs per job ranging from US$1,160 to
US$741,554 equivalent, with an average of US$33,750, reflecting the capital
intensiveness of industrial investment taking place in Indonesia in recent
years. However, it is clear from what has been achieved so far that BAPINDO
can enlarge its role in assisting more labor intensive projects as it moves
toward financing more medium-sized ones.
Enhancement of BAPINDO's Develoment Impact
4.04      After detailed discussions with the Bank's appraisal mission in
late 1976, BAPINDO adopted in early 1977 a Statement of Development Strategy
outlining specific development objectives and activities it would initiate in
1977-78 to increase its development impact. These include giving due weight
to the economic merits of projects in taking investment decisions, financing
more medium-sized labor-intensive projects, playing a more active role in
project promotion, and increasing its technical assistance to its clients.
BAPINDO would also undertake studies on selected industrial activities (wood,
silica and cassava processing), provide input into Government policies concern-
ing industrial investments and assist the Regional Development Banks in
upgrading their operational capability and monitoring jointly financed projects.

4.05      Considerable progress has been made by BAPINDO in carrying out the
above, as well as implementing the Program of Action of 1977. BAPINDO is
expected to make further progress along these lines during the next two
years, 1979-80. Special effort will have to be made by BAPINDO to expand its
promotional activities and sector studies, to identify and develrp medium-
sized labor-intensive projects. While phasing out its role with respect to
more mature Regional Development Banks, BAPINDO will continue to provide
assistance to the weaker ones. In order to enable itself to play a larger
role in industrial development BAPINDO will further strengthen its organiza-
tion and speed up training of its staff.
5. BAPINDO'S PROSPECTS
The Environment
5.01      During the three-year period, 1974-76, domestic investment in the
industrial sector approved by the Investment Coordinating Board remained at
an annual level ranging from Rp 177 billion to Rp 186 billion. In 1977, the
approvals increased sharply, to Rp 411 billion, and the trend continued in the
first half of 1978, when the ICB approvals reached Rp 488 billion. The long-
term growth prospects for the manufacturing industries become brighter in
view of the devaluation which took effect on November 15, 1978. Stimulated
by the more favorable exchange rate, export-oriented industries are expected
to expand their capacity for production to increase their exports and the
factories which produce for the domestic market will also be encouraged to
boost their production since the competitiveness of their products will also
be improved. As long as inflationary pressures are under control, and the
price rises do not erode the effect of the devaluation, the original goals
of the devaluation to increase non-oil exports, particularly manufacturing
products, to achieve a more balanced economic structure can be realized over
time. However, the first postdevaluation year will be a period of adjustment
for the industries and it would be too optimistic to expect any dramatic
increase in industrial investment and production over the short term.
BAPINDO's role has become more significant following the Government's new
policies to spur domestic industrial production. It will contribute to the
easing of the current liquidity pro'blems of the industries created by devalu-
ation, by providing additional permanent working capital loans and BAPINDO's
long- and medium-term financing will be of vital importance to the industries
in implementing expansion and new projects in the industrial sector in the
wake of the devaluation. BAPINDO has taken its increasing role into account
in preparing its operations forecasts which are dealt with below.
Projected Operations
5.02      BAPINDO has revised its projections in light of the devaluation of
November 15, 1978. BAPINDO's projected volume of operations is presented in
Annex 13; its projected approvals are summarized below:

Total approvals              36.3    78.4    79.3    85.1   101.5   119.2
BAPINDO's term loans and equity approvals for the five-year period, 1979-83,
are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 13%. BAPINDO's projections
reflect BAPINDO's plan to maintain a larger share in industrial investment,
which is estimated by economic planners to increase at an annual rate of 11%.
The projected approvals for 1979, while appearing to be high, are attainable
since they are based substantially on the projects already in the pipeline as
of January 1979. Co-financing with the RDBs is expected to increase from Rp
3.5 billion in 1979 to Rp 6.1 billion in 1983, in view of BAPINDO's policy to
increase joint operations under the KIK/KMKP schemes with the RDBs outside
Java. Co-financing with other banks dropped from Rp 8.1 billion in 1977 to
0.4 billion in 1978. The level of co-financing reached in 1977 should be
considered exceptional because it was related to one telecommunications
project and no projects of the same size are expected to be brought forward
for consortium financing in the next five years. BAPINDO's projection that
the consortium loans would increase by 77% from Rp 3 billion to Rp 5.3
billion during the projected five-year period appears reasonable since more
large projects are expected to emerge during REPELITA III period, and such
projects call for joint financing by several financial institutions.
5.03      As a whole, BAPINDO's assumptions are realistic and the projected
level each year is achievable since its project promotion work will be
speeded up, coupled with a further strenghening of its organization and
upgrading of its appraisal staff.



-- 33 -
Resource Requirements
5.04      Local Currency Requirement:s.  Total projected local currency loan
and equity approvals for 1979-83 amount to Rp 297.5 billion. The available
balance as of December 31, 1978 amounted to Rp 3.1 billion. BAPINDO's
profits during '-he five-year period would amount to Rp 11.2 billion and net
collections Rp 48.1 billion, accounting for 4% and 16% of the resource
requirements respectively. BAPINDO and the Government are exploring the
possibility of a domestic bond issue. However,because of the inadequacy of
the existing capital market, BAPIND0 is not expected to succeed in this
endeavor. BAPINDO expects to receive special deposits from the State Pension
Fund totalling Rp 70 billion in 1979-83.  The remaining gap (Rp 165.1 billion
or 55%) will have to be met through refinancing from Bank Indonesia both
directly under the INVESTASI Scheme (under which BI is currently refinancing
65-80% of loans) and indirectly through consortium financing arrangements with
other State Banks. BAPINDO does not anticipate any difficulty in mobilizing
local currency resources to meet all the expected requirements.
5.05      Foreign Currency Requirements.  Projected foreign currency approvals
during the period 1979-83 total US$265.6 million. The unapproved balance of
US$27.8 million as of December 31, 1978 includes funds from IBRD (US$1.3 mil-
lion), KfW (US$5.4 million), and ADB (US$21.1 million). The entire balance
is expected to be fully committed in early 1980, with IBRD funds to be fully
utilized in the first half of 1979. For the two-year period from July 1,
1979 to June 30, 1981, BAPINDO's foreign currency approvals would amount to
US$80 million. Given the uncertainty about raising foreign funds from other
sources, BAPINDO expects to use the proposed Bank loan to fill the major part
of its resource requirement. It is estimated that BAPINDO would need from the
Bank US$50 million to finance its projects for the said two-year period.
This estimate, which has been made after careful review of the projects in
the pipeline and the forecast of investment demand in the industrial and
maritime sectors, is fully justifiable and a Bank loan of US$50 million is
therefore recommended. As the Bank funds will be used to fill a major
part (63%) of the foreign currency resource requirement, BAPINDO will con-
tinue its efforts to diversify its sources of foreign exchange.
Projected Financial Results
5.06      Projected income statements for 1979-83 are shown in Annex 14.
BAPINDO's low profitability is not expected to improve substantially in the
next few years. The net profit will increase from Rp 1.0 billion in 1979 to
Rp 2.0 billion in 1980 and it will remain within a narrow range of Rp 2.3-
3.4 billion in the following three years (1981-83).  Because of the share
capital increase and the conversion from certain loans to the Government into
capital reserves, BAPINDO's return oni average equity was only 1.5% in 1977.
It increased slightly to 1.8% in 1978 and is expected to increase to an average
of around 3% in the next five years. The fact that BAPINDO's return has been
low in the past and is not expected to go up sharply in the forecast period
is attributable to BAPINDO's relatively low spread, high administrative costs
and the continued allocation of a large part of the gross annual profits to
provisions for losses.



- 34 -
Projected Financial Position
5.07      Projected balance sheets for 1979-83 are shown in Annex 15, and
selected financial ratios in Annex 16. Based on its operational forecasts
BAPINDO's total assets are expected to increase from Rp 201.4 billion at
December 31, 1979 to Rp 413.5 billion at the end of 1983, showing an average
annual rate of growth of about 20%. Term loan and equity portfolio is
expected to increase from Rp 170.4 billion (85% of total assets) in 1979 to
Rp 365.6 billion (88% of total assets) in 1983. The gradual shifting of the
asset structure in favor of the portfolio would be a healthy development to
follow.
5.08      During the forecast period, the increase of BAPINDO's assets will
be financed mainly through additional long-term debts which will go up from
an estimated Rp 120 billion at the end of 1979 to Rp 320.6 billion at the end
of 1983. The projected long-term debt/equity ratio shows an increase from
1.9:1 in 1979 to 2.7:1 in 1980, 3.2:1 in 1981, and 4.5:1 in 1983. BAPINDO
should be prepared to increase its share capital before its debt/equity ratio
exceeds the 3:1 limit specified in the Loan Agreement, in 1981. The rate
of growth of BAPINDO's gross profit will continue to fall behind the rate of
growth of its total assets. Therefore, profit before tax and provisions as a
percentage of average total assets will fall from the range of 4.1-4.8% in
1979-80, to the range of 3.5%-3.7% in 1981-83. To improve its profitability,
BAPINDO should further increase the percentage of its earning assets within
its total assets base, increase the interest spread on domestic loans, and
decrease administrative expenses without undermining the morale and sacrificing
the quality of staff.
5.09      Projected cash flow statements are given in Annex 17.  In light of
past experience, the projected collection rate is conservative. Collection
rates for existing industrial term loans are assumed at 56% in 1979, increasing
by 4% per year during 1980-83, while the rates for new loans will be 60% for
the entire projection period. Debt service cover would fluctuate between 1
and 1.5 times, which could be improved by stretching the maturities of its
domestic currency borrowings.
6. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Recommendations and Justification
6.01      During the past decade, the Bank has continually provided BAPINDO
with advice and guidance, apart from financial assistance, and has closely
followed its improvements. The recent progress made by BAPINDO in implement-
ing the Program of Action, 1977, initiated as a result of the last loan
negotiations, was very impressive. However, given the long-term nature of a
number of the proposed reforms included in the Program of Action, much remains
to be done to gradually transform BAPINDO into an efficient and dynamic
development finance institution. BAPINDO, as the State bank entrusted with
the specific responsibility for assisting the industrial sector, is expected



- 35 -
to play an increasingly important role in the continued development of
Indonesian industry. The proposed Bank loan would enable the Bank to con-
tinue its ongoing institution- building role vis-a-vis BAPINDO. With the
Bank's assistance, BAPINDO is expected to make further headway in implement-
ing the Program of Action and other measures aimed at enhancing 'oth its
institutional capability and its develomental impact.
6.02      A Bank loan of US$50 million is recommended which is expected to
finance about 63% of BAPINDO's projected foreign currency approvals over
the two-year period from July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1981 (para. 5.05). In
the past, BAPINDO's subprojects have yielded satisfactory economic benefits;
ERRs on a sample of reasonable size of BAPINDO-financed subprojects ranged
from 18.7% to 47.8% with an average of 30.6% (para. 4.02). The subprojects
to be financed by BAPINDO under the proposed Bank loan are expected to yield
similar economic benefits.  The project does not entail any unusual risk.
Main Features of Proposed Loan
6.03      Form of Bank Loan.  As with other Bank loans to Indonesia, the loan
would be made to the Government for relending to BAPINDO, under a subsidiary
loan agreement acceptable to the Bank, the signing of which will be a condition
of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
6.04      Component for Financing Medium-Sized Labor-Intensive Projects.  In
implementing the 1977 Program of Action, and the Development Strategy for
1977-78, BAPINDO has begun to seek to finance an increasing number of medium-
sized (i.e. those requiring BAPINDO's financing not exceeding US$1 million
equivalent), labor-intensive investment projects from either the private or
public sector. The result to date has been encouraging. In 1977, only 8% of
the investment loans approved by BAPINDO were below US$1 million equivalent.
In the first half of 1978, the percentage increased to 28%. With respect to
employment generation of these projects, complete data is not available for
all the projects. However, the available data on 8 projects approved in the
first half of 1978 show an average investment cost per job of US$15,500
compared with the average investment cost per job of US$17,050 for 17 projects
in 1977 for which comparable data is available. This trend is in line with
both the Government's and the Bank's current emphasis on assisting medium- and
small-sized projects which are labor intensive. In order to encourage BAPINDO
to keep up the momentum toward assisting such type of projects it is recommended
that a component of US$15 million (or 30% of the proposed loan amount) be
earmarked for financing specifically: (a) enterprises with fixed assets not
exceeding US$1,000,000 equivalent; or (b) projects generating employment at a
fixed investment cost per job not greater than US$12,000 equivalent. Based on
an analysis of the available data on subprojects, BAPINDO is expected, with a
reasonable but not excessive effort on its part, to be able to fully utilize
the special component as described above.



- 36 -
6.05      Financing of Foreign Exchange Component of Domestic Equipment.
The proposed loan would finance, in addition to direct imports of machinery
and equipment, the foreign exchange component of domestically procured capital
goods estimated at 60% of the invoice price of such goods and that of
civil works estimated at 50% and locally procured vehicles at 40%.
6.06      Foreign Exchange Risk.  As under the previous loans and IDA credits
to BAPINDO and PDFCI, the Government would onlend the Bank loan to BAPINDO in
rupiah , thereby itself assuming the foreign exchange risk, for which it
would get a fee (para. 6.08). The Government's unwillingness to require
Indonesian subborrowers to bear the exchange risk is based on the considera-
tion that most domestic enterprises (especially the indigenous ones) are not
sophisticated enough to appreciate the complexities of multiple currency
exchange risks, whereas the better-established companies (mostly non-
indigenous and joint ventures) can borrow from the Singapore and Hongkong
capital markets at more favorable rates (with the exchange risk borne by the
borrower).
6.07      Relending Rates.  BAPINDO will relend the loan proceeds at interest
rates which would allow BAPINDO a spread of 4 percentage points for subloans
above Rp 75 million and 2.5 percentage points below Rp 75 million. The on-
going term lending rates are 13.5% p.a. for loans above Rp 200 million,
12% p.a. for loans between Rp 75 million and Rp 200 million and 10.5% p.a.
for loans below Rp 75 million. These rates will be specified in the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement to be signed between the Government and BAPINDO (para. 6.03).
6.08      Spread.  As with the previous Bank loan, the gross interest spread
on the proposed loan (the difference between the interest rate paid by the
end-users and IBRD lending rate) will be divided into two portions: one
portion to be allocated to BAPINDO and one portion to accrue to the Government
as a fee for its assuming the foreign exchange risk. BAPINDO's spread should
be sufficient to enable it to adequately cover its general expenses (para. 6.07).
6.09      Free Limit.  As stated in paras. 3.21 and 3.25, BAPINDO has reorga-
nized its appraisal staff and made tangible progress in upgrading its project
appraisal work and shortening its appraisal cycle. Further progress is
expected. It is therefore recommended that the free limit (US$1 million
under the previous Bank loan) be increased to US$1.2 million, with an
aggregate free limit of US$15 million. With this free limit, it is estimated
that subloans accounting for 70% of the proposed loan will require Bank
review prior to approval. This should be sufficient for the purpose of
effective subproject monitoring by the Bank.
6.10      Ceiling on Subloans.  To ensure that the proceeds of the proposed
loan would be spread out and over a relatively large number of medium-sized
projects, a ceiling of $3 million would be set on the size of individual
subloans.



- 37 -
6.11      Debt/Equity Limit.  Under the previous Bank loans a limit of three
times its equity was set on BAPINDO's debt maturing more than one year. I
is rcommended that this debt/equity limit of 3:1 be maintained under the
proposed loan.
6.12      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming substan-
tially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of BAPINDO's subloans, the
maximum term for which would be 15 years including the three years of
grace.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
6.13      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
matters:
(a) a component of US$15 million would be earmarked under the proposed
loan for financing enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding US$1
million equivalent, or projects that would generate additional
employment at a fixed investment cost per job not exceeding
US$12,000 equivalent (para. 6.04);
(b) the financing of 60% of domestically procured capital goods, 50% of
civil works and 40% of domestically procured vehicles representing the
estimated foreign exchange component of such items (para. 6.05);
(c)  the earmarking of US$100,000 under the proposed loan to finance
the services of an expatriate specialist on project promotion
and the cost of a staff training program on project promotion
(para. 3.27);
(d) a free limit of US$1.2 million on subprojects with an aggregate
free limit of US$15 million (para. 6.09); and
(e) a US$3 million ceiling on the size of individual subloans
(para. 6.10).
6.14      In addition to the above, agreement was reached with the Government
and BAPINDO on the proposal that thes Government would make the proceeds of
the proposed loan to BAPINDO at a rate to allow BAPINDO a spread of 4 percentage
points for subloans above Rp 75 million (US$120,000) and 2.5 percentage
points for subloans below Rp 75 million. The remainder of the gross spread
would accrue to the Government as a fee for its assuming the foreign exchange
risk (para. 6.08). These terms will be specified in the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement to be signed between the Government and BAPINDO prior to the
effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 6.03).

Program of Action
PART A
1.        BAPINDO will be relieved of the financial liability pertaining to
Government projects financed or to be financed by it at the Government's behest.
It will, however, continue to assume full financial liability for its i-nvest-
ments in those state enterprises which it finances on its own. initiative on the
basis of normal project evaluation and its usual lending criteria. The Govern-
ment will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a given project falls into the
forwrntr or latter category.  The projects financed at the Government's behest are
defined as those which the Ministyi of Finance and BAPPENAS consider to be of
national importance and instruct BAPINDO to finance even though if such projects
do not meet the normal standards of BAPINDO.  In its balance sheet, BAPINDO will
segregate these projects from BAPTNDO's own portfolio and will show them in a
special account belonging to the Government and called "managed funds".  For
such ".managed projects', BAPINDO will assume no financial liability and will
receive a handling fee determined by the Government.
2.        The Government will make financial arrangements to enable all state
enterprises borrowing from BAPINDO to repay to BAPINDO their existing arrears
of principal and interest of over three months as at the date of the Loan
Agreement of the proposed Bank Loan.
3.        The Government will com?ensate BAPINDO for any losses on the out-
standing raw cotton loans made to P.N. INSAN and PINDA SANDANG anounting to
about Rp. 7.5 billion, including the principal and interest accrued.  This
amount will be paid to BAPINDO in two installments, the first Rp 3.0 billicn
prior to effectiveness of the proposed Loan, the balance by Mf.arch 31, 1978.
4.        The Government will formulate and communicate to the Bank a specific
plan outlining steps for improving PUPN's operations with a view particularly to
accelerating the collection and/or foreclosure ot BAPINDO's deiinquent accounts
transferred to PUPN. One such step would be to require PUPN to take immediate
action on BAPINDO's delinquent accounts transferred by BAPINDO to PUPN without
waiting until the final maturity of these loans as has been the practice to date.
5.        BAPINDO will undertake a vigorous campaign, based on a comprehensive
program, to deal with the continuing serious situation of arrears.  This program
will include, inter alia:  (i) setting annual collection targets for each branch
office or collection unit; (ii) monthly review by Board of Managing Directors
with relevant staff of portfolio situation (e.g. evaluation of arrears;
reschedulings; write-offs; steps taken or contemplated to deal with overdue
accounts; collection performance in relation to targets; status of delinquent
loans transferred to PUPN); (iii) monthly reporting by BAPINDO to the Board
of Supervision on the portfolio situation as detailed abcve; and (iv) raising
penalty rate on interest in arrears, on a selective basis, to the prevailing
level of time deposit rates.
6.        BAPINDO will submit to the Bank a satisfactory plan, if necessary
to be prepared with the help of an outside consultant, to gradualiv reduce
over the next few years its adminis!rative costs in relation to total assets.
This plan would include inter alia reducing staff surpius by attrition over the
coming years and closing down some unnecessary branche offices.
Part A of the Program of Action will be implcmented prior to effectiveness of the
proposed loan.

Page 2
PART B.
1.        BAPINDO will entrust branch offices with greater responsibility
for follow-up work and dele-ate more authority to managers in selected
branch offices for making working capital loans up to a spec-ified amount.
2.        BAPINDO will undertake a study (to be completed prior to
October 31, 1977) of the existing network of branch offices with a view
to (i) closing down uneconomical and unnecess2ry Dranches; (ii) opening
new branclies where there is good potential for business development; ard
(iii) relating staff size to business volume in each branch office.
3.        BAPINDC w,ll expand the'size of the apprai-3l and supervision
staff by about one-third during 1977 (from the end--1976 level) and by
another one-third during 1978,  to the extent possible, by conversion of
its existing support staff into appraisal and supervision staff.
4.        BAPINDO will strengthen the Project Promotion Department to
become more effectively involved in project identification, development
and ptoinotion.
5.        BAPINDO will strengthen the Research Department by the appoint-
ment to the post of manager of an e-perienced econom-.ist, and the sub-
sequent assembling of a small group of qualified economists within the
Department, to enable it to undertake extensive economic and industrial
studies.  In the initial period, B.PINTDO will commission outside
consultants or experCs, as needed, to help its staff undertake these
studies.
6.        BAPINDO will create a suitably staffed Market Analysis Unit
wvithin the Research Departmert!L ir. crder to substantially improve this
particular aspect of BAPINDO's appraisal worlc.
7.        In order to sDeed up appraisal, BAPIPDO will. formulate and
adopt (prior to June 30, 1977) an appropriate "work flow chart" pre-
cribing a time limit for each stage of loan processing, in order to
complete the full processinrg cycle for an ordinary project within 150
days (from receipt of loan application to loan approval).
8.        In order to strengthen its appraisal work, BAPINDO will adopt
the following measures:  (a) more systematic collection and analysis of
partial economic indicators of projects (e.g. employment generation, value
added, degree of protection, foreign exchange earnings/Savings, geographical
dispersal); (b) introduction of a rechanisM for comparing the eccnomic!
financial costs and benefits of projects in operational stage with estimates
made during project appraisal; and (c) calculation of the economic rates
of return for projects requiring BAPINDO's financing of $1 mLillion or more.
9*      It is tli2 intention of the Government to provide pB,APTINDO with
adequate resources to sustain its fillarncing activities.  The Government
will explore for BAPINDO additional sources of foreign exchange other
than IBRD, such as ADB, K'f8, and bilateral sources.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       In view of the high level of arrears, BAPINDO (with the
Government's concurrence) will increase the total amount of provisions
for doubtful accounts to at least 5% of total outstanding port olio by
the cnd of the 1977 fiscal year.
II.       BAPINTDO wi'll seek to finance an increasing number of medium-sized
investment projects (i.e. those requiring BAPINTDO's financing not exceeding
$1 million) undertaken by either the public or private sector.
12.       BAPINDO will adopt a statement of "Development Strategy" out-
lining some specific developaciltal objectives/activities (in addition to
its normal lending activity) on which BAI?INDO intends to place special
emphasis, for the two years 1977-78. This shall iniclude studies on
selected industrial activities; increased teclnical assistance to clients
(for which further davelopment in staff capacity would be necessary);
active project identification. development and promotion; iihcreased
assistance to medium-sized labor intensive industries; input into Govern-
mc-nt policies concerning industrial investments; and assistance to the
regional development banks in upgrading their operational capability and
monitcring the percoimance of projects financed jointly by BAPINDO and
these banks.
13.       The Government, BAPINDO and the Bank will consult with each other
on specific measures for implementing the abo-ve Program of Action, and BAPIN'DO
shall inform the Bank, on a quarterly basis, of progress, and problems encountered,
toward implementing the said Program.
