7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The COOPERAR II project would support the efforts of the Government of Paraiba to reduce the incidence
of rural poverty by: (a) improving access to small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure and services; (b)
raising incomes and capital assets through investments in productive activities and facilitating linkages
between small producers and national and international markets; and (c) strengthening the capacity of
Municipal Councils (MC) and Community Associations (CA) to raise funding and harmonize policies and
institutional arrangements for delivery of public investments intended to benefit the rural poor.
COOPERAR II is a Repeater ooperation, using the highly participatory, community-driven development
approach which was piloted and proven successful under the recently-completed COOPERAR I project.
