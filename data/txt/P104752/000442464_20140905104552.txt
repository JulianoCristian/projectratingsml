F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The PDO as stated in the PAD and Loan Agreement was: "to support the efforts of the
Government of Paraiba to reduce the incidence of rural poverty by improving access to
small-scale socio-economic infrastructure and services; raising incomes and capital assets
through investments in productive activities while facilitating linkages between small
producers and national and international market; and, strengthening the capacity of
Municipal Councils (MC) and Community Associations (CA) to raise funding and
harmonize policies and institutional arrangements for delivery of public investments
intended to benefit the rural poor."

  NOTE:
  (a) During the Mid-term Review (MTR) of March 2012, the Bank and Borrower
informally agreed - and reflected the intention in the signed Aide Memoire - to
restructure the Project by: (i) reallocating resources among categories of expenditure;
and, (ii) reducing Results Indicator targets for subprojects financed and numbers of
beneficiary families from 800 and 35,000 respectively (as per PAD) to 500 and 21,000.
The reallocation was the subject of a formal restructuring dated September 24, 2012, but
the reduction in targets was not included. While the proposed change in targets was
mentioned in the signed Aide Memoire (in a footnote), the rationale for the proposed
reduction was not noted. Subsequent project documents state the causes as inflation in the
cost of labor, materials and equipment as well as exchange rate fluctuations reducing the
amount of project resources available for subprojects.

  Therefore, due to the lack of a formal restructuring of the targets, the ICR measures
progress against the original targets of 800 subprojects and 35,000 beneficiary families.
However, it should be noted that the Borrower based all subsequent project planning and
activities on the assumption that the targets had been changed via the signed MTR Aide
Memoire.

  (b) The PAD Results Framework states the PDO as to "support the State of Paraiba to
reduce the incidence of rural poverty" and lists the dependent clauses as Intermediate
Outcomes with their own Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The ICR's use of the
complete PDO as stated in the PAD Main Text and Loan Agreement implies that all
indicators in the Results Framework are technically Results Indicators. However, one
indicator, as noted in the PAD (page 43, footnote 31), "Types of productive subprojects
financed by the project" was intended as feedback to ensure that types of productive
subprojects were appropriate, and is included as an Intermediate Outcome Indicator in
Section (b) below. Also, a Core Indicator was added by the Mid-term Review and is
included in Section (a) below. See detailed presentation of Results Indicator Analysis in
Annex 5 with background data in WBDocs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Regional and sector background: At the time of project appraisal in 2008, despite
sustained reductions in poverty and inequality driven by almost two decades of sound macro-
economic policies as well as innovative, pro-poor investment initiatives, Brazil still faced major
challenges in reducing poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion. Nowhere was this more
evident than in the Northeast region and in its rural areas in particular where some 52% of all
Brazil’s poor resided.

1.1.2 State of Paraiba: Paraiba is among the smallest Brazilian states both in terms of
geographic area and population – 56,000 km2 and 3.4 million people, respectively. The state is
exceptionally poor, even by standards of the Northeast. At appraisal, some 55% of its population
was poor with 40% living on less than one-half of the minimum wage (one minimum wage was
R$380/month, equivalent to US$202) versus 22% nation-wide. About 29% of the state
population was living in rural areas, of which 56% of households survived on under
R$190/month. Rural indices of access to piped water (32%), sanitation (57%) and electricity
(64%) remained well below rural Brazil as a whole and urban Paraiba in particular (88%, 95%
and 99% respectively). This situation prevailed despite substantial contributions made by the
Bank-supported Rural Poverty Reduction Project (RPRP, 4251-BR) known as Cooperar I which
financed electricity access for 63,000 rural families, water supply for over 49,000 families and
other, basic socio-economic infrastructure/services for another 29,000 families. About one-fourth
of all rural families in Paraiba with electricity and one-third with water supply had received these
services through the RPRP.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank assistance: The Bank’s support for this repeater project (Cooperar
II) was based on the following: (i) continuous, long-term partnership/engagement with the
Federal Government and Northeast State Governments – including Paraiba - on rural poverty
reduction through a series of participatory, community-driven projects which had garnered strong
Borrower ownership as a result of their reach and achievements on the ground; (ii) the resulting
credibility of Bank-supported operations in rural areas among community associations, municipal
governments and Municipal Councils, as well as State and Federal agencies which to varying
degrees were adopting similar, decentralized institutional arrangements, decision-making and/or
delivery mechanisms; and, (iii) the Bank’s repository of transferable global knowledge based on
direct country experience in rural development combined with heavy investment in analytical and
advisory work – including in the Northeast region - directly relevant to rural poverty reduction.

1.1.4 Strategic contribution: The operation was aligned strategically with the FY04-07
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and with the new FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) approved in May 2008. The CAS clearly called for meeting basic needs in the rural
Northeast through the provision of socio-economic infrastructure and services, with follow-on
projects focusing increasingly on income-generating activities and on integrating the CDD
investments and institutional arrangements with other government programs present in
participating municipalities. The Project’s intention to link small farmers to markets to leverage
social inclusion gains reflected the CPS’ call for consolidating gains from the first generation
operations.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The Project Development Objective as stated in the PAD and Loan Agreement was: “to
support the Borrower to reduce the incidence of rural poverty in the Borrower’s territory by
improving access to small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure and services, raising incomes and
capital assets through investments in productive activities while facilitating linkages between
small producers and national and international markets, and strengthening the capacity of
Municipal Councils (MC) and Community Associations (CA) to raise funding and harmonize
policies and institutional arrangements for delivery of public investments intended to benefit the
rural poor.”

1.2.2    Results indicators (RI) as expressed in the PAD (Main Text) were as follows: 1

    •    Assets held by beneficiary families increase by 20% 2
    •    Productive subprojects represent 25% of total investment subprojects
    •    Ratio of project resources leveraged from other programs is 1:5
    •    800 socio-economic and productive investments financed
    •    35,000 families benefit from project-financed subproject investments

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO was not revised. However, the following indicators were upgraded to RI from
Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOI) in the Results Framework (RF) by the Mid-term Review
in order to align with the PDO as stated in the Loan Agreement (see footnote 3 and Data Sheet):

    •    75% of productive investments generating employment by end-project
    •    20% increase in value of assets of families benefiting from productive subprojects
    •    40% of productive investments with established commercial arrangements
    •    50% of project-related community associations with women, quilombola and/or
         indigenous people in leadership roles
    •    Proportion of resources applied by the Project in relation to additional resources
         leveraged by Municipal Councils from other state and federal programs for infrastructure,
         productive or social investments is 1:5
    •    20% of community associations with productive subprojects gain access to
         mainstream/other credit resources

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target group was about 35,000 poor rural families (approximately 175,000
people) in 222 municipalities with a Municipal Human Development Index ranging from 0.494 to
0.757. Most were smallholders, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers with income


1
    As noted in the Data Sheet, the ICR uses the PDO as stated in the PAD Main Text and Loan Agreement, whereas
the RF shows the PDO as the opening statement only and all dependent clauses as Intermediate Outcomes, each with its
own indicators. Based on the PDO in the PAD Main Text and Loan Agreement, all indicators in the RF are treated
technically as Results Indicators (with one exception) and measured accordingly. See Data Sheet and Annex 5.
2
      Two similar results indicators pertained to increased value of assets following MTR adjustments: (i) for
beneficiaries of productive investments and (ii) total beneficiaries (regardless of investment). As noted in the Data
Sheet, the project team focused on measuring the assets of the former. See para 1.3.1.

                                                         2
primarily from farming, wage labor, pensions and remittances. The inclusion of women,
quilombola and indigenous groups was specified although no investment targets were set for such
groups. Secondary beneficiaries through training were to be the participatory Municipal Councils
and the State Technical Unit (known as Cooperar, with the Project known as Cooperar II).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 Component 1: Community Subprojects (US$23.96 m, about 85% of total project cost,
with Bank contribution of US$18.0 m, 75%) would finance through matching grants to
community associations (CA) about 800 SPs for small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure and
services (water supply, sanitation, electricity, education and health, cultural and environmental
activities), as well as productive and market-oriented activities. The goal was to support both the
income and non-income dimensions of rural poverty, improving livelihoods and wellbeing of
about 175,000 people (35,000 families) in 800 rural communities and 222 municipalities. Funds
for approved SPs would be transferred directly to beneficiary associations.

1.5.2 Component 2: Institutional Development (US$1.95 m, about 7% of total project cost,
with Bank contribution of US$1.6 m, 82%) was to be executed by Cooperar and financed
technical assistance, training and/or capacity building for the following: (i) mobilization and
strengthening of the CAs to identify, prepare, operate and maintain SPs; (ii) enabling the
Municipal Councils (MC) to manage their responsibilities as defined in the Operational Manual
including assessment and supervision of CAs, participatory planning and allocation of resources,
and environmental oversight of SPs; (iii) the STU’s Regional Management Units (RMU). Also,
workshops and seminars would enable MCs and CAs to exchange experiences and facilitate
planned integration activities (leveraging from other Federal and State poverty programs).

1.5.3 Component 3: Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$2.25 m, about 8% of total project cost, with Bank contribution of US$1.3 m, 57.8%)
financed operational costs (excluding salaries) of project administration, supervision, monitoring
and impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 It was clear during the MTR that the target of 800 subprojects could not be fully
implemented due primarily to unforeseen escalation in average SP cost resulting from inflation
and exchange rate movements. There were indications to this effect in the MTR Aide Memoire
(as a footnote) and in the Implementation Supervision Report (ISR) following the mission. 3
However, the Bank neglected to formalize the target reductions in the restructuring dated
September 24, 2012 - which was limited to the reallocation of Loan funds – and only the ISR of
December 2013 compared actual achievement against these revised targets. 4 Even so, the
Borrower viewed the informal agreement in the signed MTR Aide Memoire as binding/valid and
based all subsequent project planning and activities on the reduced targets.




3
  The MTR proposed to reallocate Loan funds via restructuring. The signed Aide Memoire of March 23, 2012, footnote
1, states: “This restructuring will also effect a reduction in the values of the following performance indicators: (i)
number of subprojects executed (500); and (ii) number of families benefited (21,000).”
4
   The Key Issues and Actions for Management Attention section of the ISR mentioned that no more than 500 SPs
would be implemented by end-2013.

                                                          3
1.6.2 Other changes were as follows: (i) Loan Agreement, Schedule 2, Category 2 was
amended to include non-consultant services and goods primarily to provide flexibility to SPs to
lease vehicles for transportation. Date: November 12, 2010; (ii) US$497,500 of Loan proceeds
was reallocated from Category 6 Unallocated to Category 1 Community Subprojects
(US$147,750), Category 3a Administrative Costs (US$100,000), and 3b Supervision and
Monitoring (US$250,000). Unallocated Loan proceeds were used to finance escalating
community SP costs and incremental administrative expenses. Date: February 28, 2012; (iii)
Project closing date was extended one year to February 28, 2014 to enable completion of a large
number of SPs initiated late in the project implementation period but at various stages of
execution. Date: February 28, 2013; and (iv) US$700,000 of Loan proceeds was reallocated from
Category 1 Community Subprojects to Category 2 Training and TA (US$450,000), and Category
3b Supervision and Monitoring (US$250,000) to strengthen CAs’ administration of SP funds,
support SP execution and, strengthen the Borrower’s decentralized supervision. Date: August 1,
2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Background analysis and lessons learned: The Project was a repeater operation which
took its lead technically and operationally from 15 years of innovative, successful Bank-
supported CDD in the Northeast region and its predecessor project, Cooperar I. Cooperar I
financed electricity access, water supply, and other basic socioeconomic infrastructure and
services, including productive activities. Lessons from direct experience shaped project design.
First, since organized productive activities (dairy, handicrafts, honey and fruits) had a modest but
promising track record under the predecessor project, the design continued support to these
activities but premised on a lessons-based strategy. Second, mechanisms for scaling up poverty
impacts, attention to vulnerable groups, and social capital formation were incorporated. Third,
experience validated the Project’s technical strategy and viability: the use of standard subproject
designs for commonly-demanded investments had been shown to improve subproject quality,
sustainability and cost-effectiveness; training programs were included to familiarize communities
with inter alia, operation and maintenance (O&M) and environmental regulations; and, the
participation of women, indigenous and ethnic groups was built on social inclusion and respect
for cultural identity, while taking into account their legal status. Project design also reflected
evaluation studies of similar projects in the States of Bahia, Pernambuco, Ceara and Piaui and
ongoing research on social capital formation under the CDD model.

2.1.2 Quality at entry: Building on an already successful predecessor project, and
incorporating lessons from similar projects in other states, the Project focused specifically on the
two additional features embodied in the CAS: (i) productive SPs; and (ii) integration/leveraging
of resources from other government/non-government programs.

2.1.3 Productive SPs: It was assumed that communities which had acquired water supply and
electricity would be well-positioned to conduct more complex productive activities. The PAD
provided a sound framework, aggregating experiences and lessons from other Northeast states
with a track record, as well as wider Bank experiences, and adopted a strategic, supply-driven
approach. This may have been premature in Paraiba where 80% of all small farmers in Paraiba
were not, realistically, capable of engaging with such strategy, especially in agriculture, due to
resource endowment constraints. Project design could have adopted a two-pronged approach
reaching both the poorest and those with potential. Also, given such productive goals, more

                                                 4
thought was needed ex-ante regarding capacity in the STU, i.e., adequate technical, economic and
financial skills for feasibility and market analysis, as well as sources of appropriate and
continuous technical assistance.

2.1.4 The proposed targeting strategy by which 80% of Component 1 resources were to be
focused on the 150 poorest municipalities (out of the total eligible 222) as defined by the
Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M), as well as rainfall and population density, was
also counter-intuitive to promoting a larger portfolio of productive SPs. Given the ex-ante profile
of the rural poor and high level of unsatisfied demand for basic infrastructure in these
municipalities, it should have been apparent that the focus on providing basic services would
continue to be dominant.

2.1.5 Integration/resource leveraging: The Project anticipated leveraging complementary
resources from outside programs primarily through the Municipal Councils which were expected
to influence those programs to adopt the Councils’ democratic processes. However, most
government programs had their own distinct rules, targeting and operating criteria and were
unlikely to align their modus operandi. That said, several larger public poverty programs -
Credito Fundiario (land reform), Luz para Todos (electricity) and the Federal Family Agriculture
Program (PRONAF, subsidized micro-credit) - were already operating in participatory ways.
Also, a process of unifying/consolidating the project Municipal Councils with existing
PRONAF/other Municipal Councils into Municipal Councils for Sustainable Rural Development
(CMDRS) was already underway to strengthen their capacity and reach, and thus the prospects
for substantial additional/complementary funding flowing through the Councils were good.

2.1.6 Risk analysis: The risk analysis was adequate but partial and mitigation measures were
generic. Ratings in some cases were understated. In retrospect, and despite the lessons and
strategy mapped out in the PAD, the risk in regard to productive SPs was high. Elements such as
the technical and operational leadership and organization of this process, the multi-pronged effort
involved and the time which experience shows is needed in poor rural areas to develop,
consolidate and sustain such activities, were not well-considered. Further, given the pattern of
demand under the predecessor project and semi-arid conditions of the state, it was likely that
water supply investments would remain in high demand and that their O&M and overall
management – as shown in other Northeast states - posed moderate to high risk, especially in
dispersed rural areas. Despite this, water supply management was not mentioned in the risk
assessment. 5 A risk not foreseeable at appraisal was the impact of delayed project effectiveness
on project cost estimates which, following through on the project’s repeater role, were based on
state-specific historical cost data. It would have been prudent at appraisal to compare historical
costs with market trends for the labor, materials and equipment typical of such projects.

2.1.7 Participatory processes: Consultative, participatory processes are the cornerstone of the
CDD methodology in the Northeast states, the project “brand” is well-publicized and demand is
strong. Communities were afforded an opportunity to express their priorities through their
associations and in the open forum of the MCs. Consultations during preparation focused on
ensuring, through culturally sensitive messages, that indigenous and quilombola groups
understood project objectives and that the CDD subproject selection mechanisms allowed them to
participate in the Project.


5
  As it turned out, this risk was perceived during project implementation and Cooperar was, during the final stages of
the project, moving forward on introducing - in collaboration with state water resources agencies/firms, and the State of
Ceara - SISAR-PB (see 2.5.3), a positive development which the proposed new operation in Paraiba will support.

                                                           5
2.2 Implementation

Factors affecting project implementation and outcomes:

2.2.1     The long hiatus between Cooperar I and II caused a de-mobilization of the Cooperar
team and eroded the momentum generated by Cooperar I. Due to delayed approvals at the
Federal and State levels beyond Cooperar’s control, the hiatus between the closing of Cooperar I
and Effectiveness of Cooperar II was almost three years. Even then, despite effectiveness in April
2010, project activities did not start until a new State Government was installed in 2011, reducing
the available execution period by an additional year. Further, Cooperar, unlike other Northeast
State Technical Units such as Bahia, was not coordinating any other programs and was thus
dependent on the Bank loan to remain active. Added to this, Cooperar had four different Project
Coordinators from preparation through the end of its first year of execution - further affecting the
unit’s esprit de corps and sense of direction. The most recent proved engaged, effective and
galvanized project execution.

2.2.2 Cooperar operated under a series of internal constraints. Its status as a “project”,
without its own cadre of staff governed by regular public service policies, entailed repeated staff
rotation especially within the technical team, and consequent discontinuity of activities. This was
exacerbated by the incoming State Government’s urgent need to impose fiscal restraint on public
service expansion, affecting Cooperar’s access to sufficient technical professionals to lead a
systematic effort on more sophisticated productive activities, as well as consistent, continuous TA
and training to small-scale productive ventures and infrastructure SPs. Cooperar also tended to be
bureaucratic in its general approach to subproject processing and approvals, slowing the
subproject implementation pipeline (see footnote 9). Further, while Cooperar had the institutional
experience to manage the established environmental clearance processes required for all proposed
subprojects, the more formal environmental licensing needed for certain SP types imposed
bureaucratic, financial and/or temporal burdens on the CAs, which Cooperar was unable to fully
resolve on their behalf.

2.2.3 Delayed effectiveness and implementation affected SP cost and resources availability.
The Project was appraised in 2007 and by the time of effective execution in 2011, cost estimates
– which were based on historical (Cooperar I) costs - were no longer valid. There were
insufficient funds to finance the planned 800 investments. Cost inflation for construction
materials, equipment and labor in the Northeast region increased some 47% over the course of the
Project. Other factors impacted on costs. The integration of productive investments with the
State’s Aranjos Produtivos Locais (Local Productive Arrangements) program increased costs due
to the larger numbers of beneficiary families/SP, and the higher cost per beneficiary family. 6 In
some cases, bureaucratic delays associated with the CAs’ local procurement of goods and
services saw prices rise before the goods had been acquired and thus agreed resources fell short.
And, service charges levied by some banks holding the accounts of beneficiary CAs (funds
transferred for approved SPs) created difficulties for the CAs and Cooperar, suggesting the need
for special arrangements discussed with banks ex-ante.




6
  Involving the APL program - a financial collaboration between the BNDES’ Social Fund (National Bank for
Sustainable Economic Development) and Northeast State Governments - was a direct result of the Project’s late
effectiveness and inadequate budget resources given rising subproject costs. APL subprojects were generally higher
cost due to their regional reach, and characterization as “production units” expected over time and with maturation, to
attend an increasing number of beneficiaries.

                                                          6
2.2.4 Despite an intensive training program, many CAs encountered difficulties at various
stages of the subproject cycle. CAs were required to contribute a minimum 10% counterpart
contribution to their SP, usually provided in labor and/or materials. In some cases, associations
needed to borrow to fulfill this obligation (i.e., purchase materials) and were unable to obtain
credit in time to facilitate execution of their SP. CAs also had difficulty conducting local
procurement as provided for under Bank rules (usually three bids) due to remoteness, and/or to
submit their accounts for amounts spent in a timely manner. The accounts of a significant portion
of beneficiary CAs remained outstanding at project closing but were completed at the time of ICR
delivery (the Bank approved a two-month extension to August 28, 2914 to accommodate this
process).

2.2.5 The uneven capacity of the Municipal Councils became evident. This is attributed
primarily to the three-year hiatus between the two operations and was demonstrated in lack of
organization, the duplication of Councils at the local level and uneven capacity to fulfill their role.
This was resolved through a formal, planned process of unification designed to blend the project
Municipal Councils with the Municipal Sustainable Rural Development Councils (CMDRS) to
reduce duplication and consolidate public programs under one roof. Some 178 Municipal
Councils were unified over the course of the Project – of which 156 were directly engaged with
the Project - via a successful collaboration between Cooperar and the State Rural Extension
Service (EMATER), improving their performance and expanding the scope and scale of their
activities. This same process has been occurring in all states of the Northeast.

2.2.6      The worst drought in 45 years afflicted the Northeast region of Brazil, including
Paraiba, from 2012-2013. This had profound effects on productive subprojects in general given
the marked dependence on agriculture-based raw materials in many small-scale
productive/processing ventures, but particularly SPs directly related to agriculture. As most
productive SPs under Cooperar II started execution in that period, the performance of many of
them suffered a severe setback compared to years with a normal cycle of precipitation. The
drought also revealed yet again, the more general precariousness of much small-scale agriculture
in Paraiba.

2.2.7      Implementation of signed SP agreements did not start until 2011, and 65% of SP
agreements were signed in 2012 and 2013, requiring extension of the closing date. With the
Project finally gaining momentum and the pace of disbursements accelerating, the Bank agreed to
a one-year extension of the closing date to end-February 2014. The immense pressure to
physically complete SPs had repercussions: ex ante analysis was rushed, and the time available to
complete SPs and deliver TA/training was tight, extending well into the grace period; establishing
O&M practices, especially important for water supply, was also challenging; more importantly,
few SPs – especially productive - had adequate time to demonstrate measurable results.
Extension was merited and achieved its goals, but given the length of initial delays, and marked
acceleration of execution already underway, an extension of 18-24 months should have been
considered.

2.2.8   Project changes/restructuring: Project restructuring dealt mainly with administrative
aspects and reallocation of funds.

2.2.9 Mid-term Review (MTR): The March 2012 MTR assessed progress across a range of
aspects: physical performance in relation to targets, fiduciary including Safeguards, and issues
affecting the pace of implementation and disbursements. The Bank team included social and
environmental specialists and visited associations with productive investments under the APL
program to which the Project was linked. The MTR found that: (i) disbursements were just 15%,

                                                  7
explained by the complexity of the Project’s productive inclusion strategy and deficits in essential
technical skills; (ii) bureaucracy was affecting the flow of financing, e.g., releasing subproject
resources to associations in multiple instalments, although the underlying rationale in that case
was sound; 7 (iii) about 75% of all Municipal Councils had been unified (75%) and trained,
boosting their capacity and potential leveraging opportunities; and (iv) about 60 of the CAs with
productive subprojects had done the three-day immersion training under the ITOG methodology
whereby current and future income, asset and wellbeing goals are incorporated in an action plan
to be monitored online and to support impact evaluation. These “business” plans were highly-
valued by associations.

2.2.10 The key MTR recommendations were: (i) focus on pending infrastructure proposals and
to prioritize water supply and related investments because they already had standard designs; (ii)
based on revised cost estimates, reduce targeted subprojects from 800 to 500; (iii) contract
additional engineers to attend the many pending proposals; and (iv) restructure the relationship
between Cooperar headquarters technical staff and regional offices to improve the latter’s
capacity and leadership in field level monitoring. An MTR Action Plan incorporated these points
and was monitored by Bank supervision missions with satisfactory outcomes. Although it had
become clear that the SP target would have to be reduced to match available funding under
Component 1, this was not formally recommended or restructured.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: Analysis of the implementation of Cooperar II was to rely on an updated
Management Information System (MIS) already established under the earlier operation. It
included community entry (baseline) profiles and quantitative variables, and was considered
satisfactory for internal controls, monitoring and financial management. It had already been
migrated to an online format to permit real-time data entry and monitoring by the STU’s regional
offices. The PAD outlined an ambitious evaluation plan: (i) annual physical performance reviews
to assess the quality and sustainability of commonly-financed SPs, including reviews of
community-based procurement; (ii) implementation review at mid-term using beneficiary surveys
of project performance and impact; and, (iii) two comprehensive impact evaluations, one during
implementation and a repeat at completion. The design of the impact evaluation program was
already advanced at appraisal with TORs agreed with Cooperar for a quasi-experimental
methodology using control groups of non-beneficiary households. 8 Given Cooperar’s
comparatively weak track record on evaluation, this agenda was challenging and became more so
as the available implementation period was compressed by initial delays.

2.3.2 Implementation: The MIS, once operational and with adequate dedicated skills, tracked
quantitative variables and financial management. Performance of the evaluation agenda however,
was weak. Cooperar did not produce the planned MTR study or impact evaluation, but delivered
a Borrower Completion Report and several small studies (see Annex 2). The reasons are largely


7
    Phased release enabled better fiduciary control and has been used in similar Bank-supported projects. Flow was
improved without prejudicing oversight, by working with the Bank of Brazil under the following Action Plan: each
community association would have two accounts: one blocked (where the full value of the approved SP would be
deposited and released by authorization of Cooperar); and, the other operational to access the released instalments via
technical opinions (laudos) reflecting works and services contracted/completed.
8
     Evaluations were to study: poverty impact of productive SPs and integration activities; impact on household
welfare; cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments compared to traditional delivery mechanisms; and, cost-benefit
of productive investments. Also, community and municipal leaders would be surveyed for an analysis of project impact
on social capital and governance. No provision was made to measure the beneficiaries/benefits of MCs’ leveraging.

                                                           8
associated with pressured implementation but Cooperar had little experience with evaluation and
needed more consistent support. The Bank did not systematically inculcate the importance of
evaluation and Aide Memoires for this project do not mention evaluation until mid-2013. The
new operation in Paraiba – described further below - intends to focus on M&E and monitor
progress throughout.

2.3.3 To make up for lack of formal evaluation data, the Bank project team working with
Cooperar in the semester before closing, did the following: (i) designed and executed a Results
Framework Analysis using structured questionnaires, focus group discussions with randomly-
selected community associations, and meetings with randomly-sampled Municipal Councils.
Results were organized by indicator and include description of the methodology in each case with
background tables (see Data Sheet, Annex 5, and WBDocs for Excel sheets); and (ii) conducted a
structured evaluation workshop with report (see Annex 6). 9

2.3.4 Dissemination: The primary dissemination event was the participatory workshop (Annex
6). Dissemination as a discrete, ongoing activity was intermittent due to operational and time
pressures noted above. More recently, discussions between the Bank team and Cooperar on the
framework for a new operation have provided opportunity to review experiences, successes and
areas needing renewed effort and/or strategy.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards performance:

2.4.1 The Project was a Category B, and triggered Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01),
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP
4.11) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and
Indigenous Peoples’ Participation Plan (IP) were prepared. Cooperar contracted two
environmental specialists to ensure that the EMP remained current and to monitor compliance
through the MIS up to completion. Safeguards compliance was rated Satisfactory throughout for
environmental and social/other safeguards. Social safeguards supervision found that SPs
delivered economic and social benefits to relevant communities/groups. However, an
environmental safeguards assessment post-closing (conducted as the basis for the proposed new
operation) downgraded environmental performance to Unsatisfactory based on shortcomings in
SP management.

2.4.2 Environment: Of the total 487 SPs implemented, about 83% technically required an
environmental license (EL). Subprojects involving water (e.g., household water supply systems,
fish farming and irrigation) also needed an official grant/permit of water usage before they could
apply for the EL. However, due to severe drought conditions, the State Government decreed a
state of emergency which inter alia, exempted or dispensed with the need for environmental
licensing for over 80% of Cooperar II subprojects. Cooperar’s opinion following analysis of
environmental risk was considered sufficient, although specific dispensations still had to be
requested. Under pressure to recover lost time, Cooperar moved ahead with financing SPs not all
of which were properly assessed or had obtained environmental licenses. Environmental

   Significant effort is involved in such exercises.The Results Framework Analysis took several months, involving an
intensive dialogue between the Bank and Cooperar to prepare a strategy, a methodology for each indicator,
questionnaires, and time-bound action plans reported in Aide Memoires. The experience was valuable for the Bank
team but especially so for Cooperar, building a platform for improved M&E under the new operation.

                                                         9
monitoring of SP investments was not systematic. At project closing, while Cooperar had made
significant advances in ex-post regularization of completed SPs, 53 SPs remained unlicensed and
an additional 36 were awaiting dispensation. At the time of ICR finalization, the Bank team had
drafted and was discussing an Action Plan with Cooperar to resolve outstanding issues. This Plan
would be monitored throughout preparation of the new project. 10

2.4.3 Social Safeguards/Indigenous peoples: No significant issues were found by Bank social
safeguards specialists during normal supervision. However, some moderate deficiencies mostly in
documentation of consultations were detected during preparation of the new Paraiba project but
were not considered to have an impact on compliance with policy requirements. Four productive
SPs were implemented – reviewed in the field by the Bank specialist before approval to ensure
that local culture was preserved/recovered and that SPs were implemented in a manner which
preserved groups’ local environment and rights as determined by FUNAI.

2.4.4 Other: Bank Safeguards supervision encountered no issues associated with pesticide use
or contamination. No sites were adversely affected under the Natural Habitat or Physical Cultural
Resources Safeguards. In regard to Involuntary Resettlement, minor issues were detected related
to Cooperar follow-up of Bank requests for updated information on SPs’ demand for the use of
additional property areas.

Fiduciary performance:

2.4.5 Financial management and audit: There were seven formal Financial Management
supervision missions. Inherent, control and project risk was rated low until the final two
supervisions when the risk was rated moderate. ISRs accordingly rated FM Satisfactory or
Moderately Satisfactory throughout. The final FM mission post-closing identified minor
deficiencies but insufficient to compromise the quality of the management and monitoring of
project financial resources. Deficiencies noted by FM missions were adequately addressed. The
one issue continuing to reflect on FM performance was the slow submission of accounts
(prestacao de contas) by beneficiary CAs. The grace period was extended two months to end-
August 2014 to permit the finalization of all outstanding cases.

2.4.6 Audit performance on balance was Moderately Satisfactory, although the 2010 audit was
delivered late. All audit opinions were Unqualified and Cooperar responded promptly to all
issues raised by auditors. It was agreed that the final audit would cover 2013 and 2014 to the end
of the grace period (end-August).

2.4.7 Procurement: The Project received two ex-post Procurement Reviews, the first rated
Satisfactory and the second (conducted in preparation for the new project) Moderately
Satisfactory with a risk rating of Moderate. Procurement was found to be conducted with due
consideration of economy, efficiency and transparency. As guidance to the proposed follow-on,
the mission stressed the importance of building stronger capacity to efficiently manage selection
procedures for consulting services. It was noted in regard to community SPs, that associations had
innovated by using local radio to advertise procurement opportunities but that this had not
eliminated certain issues: difficulty in obtaining the required three price quotations, not
uncommon in more isolated rural settings, and some cases of local “monopolies” submitting
quotes and of conflicts of interest. Cooperar was also tardy in implementing some

  The Project Team was informed by the Borrower immediately prior to ICR delivery that all SPs have an
environmental license or dispensation based on ex-post regularization of environmental status/compliance.

                                                   10
recommendations of previous procurement supervision including selection procedures and risk
reduction. The Ex-Post Review reinstated these two issues as pending and their resolution is
being supervised by the Bank.

2.4.8 Project cost: Planned project financing comprised the Bank Loan (US$20.9 m),
Borrower counterpart (est. US$5.66 m) and beneficiary contribution (labor and/or materials, est.
US$2.32 m), totaling US$28.16 m. Actual project cost was US$28.88 m, about 102.5% of the
appraisal estimate of US$28.16 m. The Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA, Annex 3) shows
that the ex-ante estimate of subproject cost ranged from R$7,000 to R$65,000 with an average of
R$39,000, while ex-post actual data shows costs ranging from R$60,000 to R$286,000 with an
average of R$150,000 (about US$75,000). This is consistent with similar projects in other
Northeast states in the period and was the direct result of persistent inflation over the course of
the Project on the costs of construction materials, labor and equipment, as well as larger SPs with
higher numbers of families/SP and higher than estimated cost per family.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 All SP investments with few exceptions are formally under the control of the beneficiary
community associations, which are responsible for their operation and maintenance (O&M). The
status of O&M is as follows for the most commonly-demanded investments.

2.5.2 Water supply: Household water supply represented 50% of total SPs and 36% of the total
amount invested in SPs. O&M is managed by the CA which collects a monthly user fee. While
the installation of hydrometers was expanding rapidly, they were not uniformly included as part
of a SP’s design and thus the amounts collected in some communities did not necessarily reflect
the real cost of water used. Further, the dispersion of water supply investments under the demand-
based CDD approach created challenges to establishing a comprehensive, efficient management
system to ensure the sustainability of these systems. In the case of household systems with
hydrometer, families pay a progressive monthly tariff of R$10.00 for up to five cubic meters
consumed. If consumption exceeds this level, users pay another R$1.00 for each additional cubic
meter. The operator receives compensation in the form of a water “bonus”, i.e. is exempt from the
monthly tariff. In the case of a chafariz (large tank with communal standpipe), the values
charged, form of payment and operation of the system are generally not regulated. Contributions
are voluntary with no formal relationship to the amount of water used or its real cost. Water
system management is a priority for the proposed new operation.

2.5.3 The water management regime/model proposed by the State Government is that
introduced in the Northeast State of Ceara: Integrated Rural Sanitation System (SISAR), already
being piloted in three communities of the Itaporanga Municipality of Paraiba, and involving a
network of partnerships to upgrade existing systems: (i) CAGECE: Companhia de Agua e Esgoto
do Ceara (Ceara Water and Drainage Company) is coaching Paraiba authorities/agencies in the
model and methodology and supporting its implementation in areas under Cooperar’s jurisdiction,
with basic costs financed by the State Government; (ii) CAGEPA: Companhia de Agua e Esgoto
do Paraiba (Paraiba Water and Drainage Company) is developing O&M policies based on the
Ceara model, upgrading water supply systems implemented by the Project with installation of
hydrometers and water treatment regimes, has designated a specialized team, and is providing
training to beneficiary communities; (iii) Cooperar has initiated awareness campaigns, and will
provide technical and other support, and monitor implementation; (iv) Sao Jose III Project: has
designated professionals with experience in rural water supply; and (v) AESA: Executive Agency
for Water Management in the State of Paraiba is supporting the mobilization of water users, and

                                                11
providing technical support to implement SISAR-PB. The goal is to replicate the model in all
beneficiary communities and the longer-term goal is universal coverage of rural water supply in
Paraiba run on the SISAR model. The proposed new project will support this effort.

2.5.4 All-weather viaducts and improved access routes: In practice, the beneficiary community
either calls on the mayor to provide repairs or handles such jointly as a group using local labor.

2.5.5 Tractors and equipment: Cooperar financed 25 agricultural mechanization subprojects,
mostly on land reform settlements, partnering with SENAR to provide O&M training and
materials. 11 Technical assistance to ensure organized management was also delivered by publicly-
contracted extension workers. Generally, CAs use a differentiated set of charges depending on
whether the user is an association member/not, but always using rates which benefit the members.
Drought conditions can depress the usage of tractors but even then, usage is usually sufficient to
cover O&M and depreciation but not necessarily replacement of the investment. Under non-
drought conditions, tractors have repeatedly proven to be fully viable.

2.5.6 Productive subprojects: Cooperar financed an additional 131 subprojects (apart from
tractors) supporting a variety of mostly agricultural initiatives. Recurrent costs of these SPs fall
on the CAs or producer associations who manage them and their sustainability depends on
generating a positive cash flow once operating and replacement costs are covered. Field
evaluation of these SPs shows that most are likely to be successful though continued technical
assistance (including for access to finance) is required by most beneficiaries. Productive SPs are
vulnerable to price fluctuations, rainfall variability and drought.

2.5.7 Follow-on operation: Cooperar has submitted a Carta Consulta to SEAIN for a new
operation – Paraiba Rural Sustentavel - with a proposed Bank loan of around US$50.0 million.
The project would mark a shift away from the classic Northeast CDD approach, i.e., not
exclusively demand-driven, although it would still work with organized groups (cooperatives,
associations) and is likely to include a role for the Municipal Councils (CMDRS). The proposed
project is intended to support rural families currently “below the radar” of conventional financing
and would have two principal “streams”: (i) Productive Inclusion; and (ii) Water Resource
Security. Productive Inclusion means initiatives (agricultural and non-agricultural) defined on the
basis of market opportunities; use of financial and technical partnerships to leverage additional
resources and specialized skills; mapping of producers with possible buyers; prior analysis of
financial sustainability and competitiveness to assess feasibility; possibly out-sourcing
management; and, complementarity between Cooperar resources and those of participating
producers/partners. In the case of Water Resources Security, the project would fill significant
gaps in water supply coverage, focus on O&M and sustainability, consider retro-fitting existing
Bank-financed water systems, and explore the use and recycling of water to build resilience,
especially for existing ecological conditions. Cooperar would continue to finance investments in
small communities beyond the purview/responsibility of CAGEPE, using the SISAR
management model described earlier, and focus on rural sanitation (water, drainage, sewage
systems, solid waste management/recycling and water re-utilization) and on the recuperation of
water catchment areas. 12

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 Relevance of objectives: The overall relevance of the project objective is rated as high
based on the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2012-2015 (63731-BR). The support
for improved socio-economic infrastructure and services remains aligned with the CPS objective
to: “improve the quality of public services for low income households and expand their provision
through public and private channels”. The CPS objective accords with the Project’s training of
the MCs and CAs to build their resource leveraging capacity for further expansion of public
services beyond the Project. By supporting subprojects to foster improved incomes and capital
assets in a very poor Northeast state, the objective remains broadly consistent with the CPS’
objective of: “boosting growth capacity with job and income generation, especially in Brazil’s
poorer regions, with special emphasis on the Northeast”. Fostering linkages between small
producers and national/international markets also remains highly relevant to this CPS objective.

3.1.2 Relevance of design and implementation: Relevance of design and implementation is
also rated high. CDD mechanisms continue to be relevant in delivering socio-economic services –
especially those supporting household wellbeing - to the poorest groups in a cost-effective
manner. The approach has proven able to serve populations bypassed by mainstream water
programs, some of which have size criterion limitations. In regard to organized, market-driven
economic activities, as currently designed and implemented the methodology can be effective,
and indeed there are numerous examples region-wide of local productive activities linked to
national and even international markets, but these are emblematic cases and not necessarily easily
replicated. The participatory, community demand-driven model needs thoughtful adaptation to
markedly influence local economic development. This does not imply that localized benefits are
unimportant to poor families – quite the contrary - but more systematic employment and income
generation needs a shift to a market-driven approach and segmentation of the target population.
This is the direction of new rural operations.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 In presenting project results, the ICR acknowledges that the Project was not formally
evaluated - there is no before/after or with/without analysis. In terms of achievements under the
Results Framework, despite barely three years of effective implementation and a lower scale and
coverage of investments than estimated at appraisal, primarily due to cost escalation, 487
subprojects provided benefits to 26,815 families. These investments were crucial for those
families, supporting and helping build upon Government’s broader rural poverty efforts as well as
the achievements under Cooperar I. The Bank team organized a workshop (see Annex 6) and a
structured analysis of achievements under the Results Framework (Annex 5) which are the main
sources of information for this section, along with the Borrower Completion Report.

3.2.2   Theme: Support the efforts of the Government of Paraiba to reduce the incidence of
rural poverty. Moderately Satisfactory




                                               13
Through priority investments in poor rural communities, the Project supported the State
Government’s wider rural policy agenda, as follows: 13
   • The Project reached out to 26,815 poor rural families (77% of target) via 487 investments
       providing basic rural infrastructure and productive facilities essential to reducing poverty.
   • 43.2% of total SP resources were invested in productive ventures intended to reduce
       poverty of income and assets, benefiting 8,418 families, 96% of an estimated 8,750
       families expected at appraisal to be productive beneficiaries.
   • 331 household water supply, sanitation and other basic infrastructure SPs (including five
       trash recycling) were financed, reducing poverty of basic social services by benefiting
       18,397 families (about 70% of the appraisal estimate for this type).
   • Global analyses show that water supply and sanitation investments have immediate
       impacts on the health and wellbeing (and in the Northeast, drought resilience) of families
       with low/no ex-ante access.
   • R$306.0 m of complementary resources were leveraged by Cooperar and the Project-
       trained MCs from other Federal, State and local programs, further supporting
       Government’s efforts – over and above the Project – to reduce rural poverty. 14
   • Vulnerable populations were successfully included: women, quilombola and indigenous
       groups all obtained investments – infrastructure, productive and social.

3.2.3 Theme: Improving access to small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure and services
Moderately Satisfactory

     •    Access to small-scale socio-economic infrastructure and services consisted of: 326 basic
          infrastructure (mostly water supply/sanitation) benefiting 17,729 families; 156 productive
          (mostly fruit processing, fish farming, goat and sheep husbandry, handicrafts, cashew nut,
          honey) benefiting 8,418 families; and, five social SPs (mostly trash recycling, a hybrid
          social/economic venture) benefiting 668 families. See Annex 2 tables.
     •    Despite the reduced scale of investments - cost-related and not resolvable through direct
          project financing - the numbers of families reached in social service infrastructure and
          productive ventures were 70% and 96% respectively of inferred appraisal targets.
     •    Access to water supply (household piped, community tank with standpipe, and cisterns)
          exceeded the Core Indicator target: 245 SPs benefited 8,196 families (113%).
     •    The Project’s leveraging activities on behalf of the project’s eligible population of poor
          rural communities financed water resources, improved housing, product purchasing for
          the Federal Food Acquisition and related programs, and general agricultural development.

3.2.4 Theme: Raising incomes and capital assets through investments in productive activities
while facilitating linkages between small producers and national and international markets.
Moderately Satisfactory

     •    156 productive SPs (78% of inferred target of 200) benefited 8,148 families.
     •    Average families per SP was generally higher than estimated at appraisal, especially for
          productive ventures which were closely linked to Government’s APL program (ff #7).




13
    All stakeholders understood – it was implicit in the Project’s leveraging goals - that the Project was one of diverse
sources of financing for rural poverty reduction
14
    The number of beneficiary associations assisted by leveraging was not measured. No indicators were included.

                                                          14
     •    Financing for productive ventures increased from 5% utilizing 7% of total SP resources
          under Cooperar I, to 32% of the total absorbing over 43% of total SP resources under
          Cooperar II.
     •    A random sample of 54 productive SPs (34.6% of the universe) shows that 98%
          generated incremental employment by end-project vs. the targeted 75%.
     •    Capital and productive assets increased by 40% (target 20%), and analysis suggests on
          average, the investment would be recovered in 5.5 years (see Annex 3).
     •    Income data is preliminary: the Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) estimates the
          average Net Present Value (NPV) per beneficiary family of a productive investment was
          R$3,138, and R$4,858 when including only those SPs indicating financial viability. 15
     •    Headway was made, primarily via individual SPs, in facilitating linkages between rural
          associations and regional markets (but not international). See Annex 2.
     •    An estimated 32% of all productive SPs had established commercial arrangements by
          end-project (target 40%) of which two thirds were formal (Federal Food Acquisition
          Program, Brazilian School Nutrition Program, State Supply Center, National Food
          Supply Agency, Mayors and prefectures, local and regional markets).

3.2.5 The Project’s productive strategy was ambitious. Realistically, an estimated 10-20% of
small rural producers in Paraiba may have the potential to engage with more sophisticated
markets. The Project needed more human resources, time, and above all, the analytical foundation
and network-building needed to launch such activities. More innovative units such as trash
recycling showed clear advantages with the right support (see Boxes, Annex 2, illustrating such
cases, few of which are traditional, small agriculture products), but the viability of agro-
processing at small-scale for example, is hampered by competitive factors and the likely need for
ongoing public support. The determining factor should be market demand, and those with water,
electricity and a reasonable parcel of land potentially have the profile to succeed.

3.2.6 Theme: Strengthening the capacity of Municipal Councils (MC) and Community
Associations (CA) to raise funding and harmonize policies and institutional arrangements for
delivery of public investments intended to benefit the rural poor. Satisfactory

      •    MCs and CAs inter alia, received training in the concepts/practices of leveraging
           resources from other State and Federal programs, garnering through the participatory
           MCs a total R$249.0 m for complementary/parallel investments; Cooperar (in common
           with State Technical Units across the Northeast states), separately leveraged R$56.5 m.
      •    Cooperar II helped to “harmonize policies and institutional arrangements” by overseeing
           the unification of 178 Municipal Councils as CMDRS (156 of which directly involved in
           the Project), mainstreaming and standardizing their role and procedures, improving
           efficiency and broadening the range of programs coming within their purview. 16
      •    Field research showed Cooperar II was an effective catalyst in attracting complementary
           funding: beneficiaries of Project-financed water supply were more likely to obtain
           additional benefits from other programs such as school buildings and health posts, as
           well as credit from AgroAmigo/Bank of the Northeast (BCR, 2014).



15
   These values represent the present net income by family after family labor used for subproject execution was
compensated at the local daily rate for unskilled labor.
16
     The transparency/otherwise of their operating rules, and their actual role - whether implementing socio-economic
equalization policies and/or ensuring access to basic resources - is still evolving but their performance clearly improved
with unification. Their relationship with municipal governments is still consolidating in some cases.

                                                           15
      •    Social capital/capacity of CAs showed growth, e.g., 20% of associations with productive
           investments independently accessed other sources of financing afterwards totaling
           R$1.363 million (Bank of Brazil Foundation, Empreender/PB).
      •    Participating CAs testified to specific capacity gains from Cooperar II at the Workshop
           (Annex 6).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The ex-post Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) conducted by FAO presents the
main financial/economic viability indicators (Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, and
Benefit Cost Ratio) for infrastructure and productive SPs, comparing them to the ex-ante analysis
at appraisal. Two factors affected the definition of the methodology/sampling universe and its
results: (i) delayed project execution which meant that many SPs started their implementation in
near the closing date; and, (ii) climatic events, i.e., the acute drought in 2012-2013 affecting the
entire Northeast region. Efficiency is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3.2 Methodology: For infrastructure SPs, 34 SPs (22.5%) were randomly selected from a
universe of 151 with at least one year of effective operation. The productive SPs’ universe
comprised 57 SPs with a minimum of one production/marketing cycle, from which 17 were
randomly-selected (30%). Overall, the sampling universe represented 43% of all financed SPs
and the actual sample, about 10%. Participatory workshops conducted by the EFA team with
sampled beneficiary communities assessed O&M status as part of the analysis.

3.3.3 Results: (i) Infrastructure: For Cisterns, the aggregated average economic NPV was
R$143,000, the weighted average E-IRR was 46% and the benefit cost ratio 2.43. Further,
comparing the cost-effectiveness of Cooperar II-financed household cisterns with other public
programs, the cost of the former was substantially lower in two of three cases for same volume
and similar or higher quality: (Cooperar II R$2,650 vs. Agua para Todos R$5,499 and INCRA
R$3,945). For Water Supply Systems, the average NPV was about R$46,000, aggregated E-IRR
30% and B/C ratio 1.66. For All-weather Viaducts and Rural Access SPs, all were economically
viable with E-IRRs ranging from 18% to 202%, due to the economic benefits accruing to other,
surrounding communities which also used this infrastructure; (ii) Productive investments:
Comprising 10 types of productive chains or investment types, 17 13 of the 17 evaluated
investments were financially viable, with an F-IRR higher than the discount rate of 10% and NPV
lower than zero. F-IRRs for the financially viable SPs ranged from 15% to over 50%, an average
of 17% compared to the appraisal estimate of 25%. The average NPV/family was R$3,138 when
including all 17 samples SPs and R$4,858 when only the 13 financially viable investments were
included. The weighted, average ERR for the cisterns and water supply SPs exceeded the
appraisal estimate. There was no assessment of rural access SPs (viaducts and access roads) at
appraisal; the inclusion of this type boosted the actual ERR considerably. Although the overall
project ERR was not computed, this is likely to exceed the appraisal estimate of 30%. Sensitivity
analysis demonstrated that SPs are fairly vulnerable to variations in costs and revenues (prices
and/or sales). See Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

      Irrigated agriculture, beekeeping/honey, handicrafts, poultry-raising, goats, tractors, small-scale sewing, fish
farming, solid waste recycling, fruit pulp processing.

3.4.1 The overall outcome rating balances the following factors. First, the relevance of the
PDO remains High when assessed against specific strategic elements of the current CPS.
Similarly, project design and implementation using CDD approaches remain highly relevant for
satisfying the basic socio-economic needs of poor and dispersed rural communities, including
vulnerable groups. Incremental income generation is a proven strength of this approach but some
adaptation may be needed to address more sophisticated, market-driven income generation.
Second, achievements under the PDO’s component themes were strong - with the reservations
noted - and in aggregate are rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Project both directly and
indirectly supported Government’s rural poverty reduction efforts providing infrastructure,
services, income and asset generation opportunities and training, as well as upgrading
institutional forums for voicing demand and expanding access to programs, in 156 municipalities.
Third, efficiency is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on solid economic and financial rates of
return for most of the infrastructure and productive investments sampled. Even though the ERR
for the overall Project is likely to have exceeded the appraisal estimate, over half of all SPs (at the
time of the EFA) had not yet completed one year of the production/marketing cycle or operational
stage, justifying a more conservative rating. Ex-post efforts planned or already underway by the
Bank and Government to boost the sustainability of productive and water supply investments,
have been taken into account. Extension of the closing date by one year was critical to project
completion/achievements and is not considered a negative factor in the outcome rating given that
the aggregate project period was still barely three years.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Gender: Of the 487 SPs, 178 were led by women. Some 205 women occupied leadership
positions as presidents of associations, Cooperatives and Municipal Councils. Of these, 178 were
presidents of associations (36.5% of total) and 33 were presidents or held other positions on the
boards of Municipal Councils (21.20%); six female presidents of associations were also
presidents of Councils. Some 130 associations with infrastructure subprojects were female-led,
a participation rate of 40% based on 326 subprojects of this type. Further, 30% of all productive
investments were female-led and 40% of social. (See experiences with female-led subprojects,
Boxes, Annex 2).

3.5.2 Quilombolas: Quilombola communities obtained nine SPs, primarily water supply and
productive, in eight municipalities with a value of about R$1.030 m. Cooperar also trained
quilombola communities using the ITOG methodology, as well as how to manage procurement
and submission of accounts. Female-headed households were quite common among the
quilombola beneficiaries due to male members emigrating to find work. The Project also financed
a census of the quilombola population in Paraiba to support public policy-making, under contract
to the Association of Afro-descendent Communities and Settlements (AACADE). The study
sought to determine family income, food production and nutritional status of children under five
years, and communities’ access to social services. The defined population is 7,095 individuals of
which about 15% are urban and 85% rural. Poverty rates are high – about 25% live in extreme
poverty - as is illiteracy. Average monthly income per capita is R$70.0 (about US$35.00).

3.5.3 Indigenous peoples: Cooperar financed four productive SPs for indigenous groups -
poultry-raising, beekeeping/honey production and irrigated agriculture – benefiting 65 families.
Training in agricultural practices and accounts was provided by SEBRAE. See also Section 2.4.


                                                  17
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4   Assessment of the Project’s three core institutions shows the following:

(a)      Cooperar: Cooperar is an experienced, committed coordination unit but its ability to
evolve and prevail was hampered by institutional/other factors over which it had little control,
along with specific capacity gaps which need modernization and mentoring. Important factors
affecting its evolution are outlined in Section 2.2. Evaluation capacity remains limited for which
the Bank must accept partial responsibility as a knowledge leader. But, Cooperar’s latent capacity
to handle sound evaluation was demonstrated by its successful work – under Bank guidance - to
analyze and document achievement of the Results Indicators. The take-away messages are that:
(i) the Bank can and should systematically mentor Cooperar in M&E; and, (ii) even in the final
stages of a project or post-closing, stronger evaluation can be promoted and dialogue established.

(b)      Municipal Councils: Duplication and inefficiencies resulting from the existence of
diverse/multiple MCs in each municipality were eliminated through a formal process of
unification to strengthen the representation of the rural communities in the Councils, and overall
decision-making processes. Municipal authorities are represented in these Councils which have
been mainstreamed and are no longer viewed as “parallel structures”. Unification was a major
effort and Cooperar recruited the support of EMATER and other agencies. By closing, some 178
of a total 222 Councils had become CMDRS, with 156 engaged with the Project.
(c)       Community Associations: The Project sought to strengthen diverse community
organizations: associations, cooperatives, rural integration groups, fishing colonies, indigenous
peoples’ villages, quilombola associations, and land reform settlements, all of which fall within
its rural poverty purview. Technical assistance was provided by Cooperar’s Regional Offices and
by contracted specialists to support productive activities. The associations showed variable
capacity to handle specific aspects of their SP cycle including procurement, financial
management and/or meeting their required counterpart contribution. Some obstacles encountered
were beyond their control and are outlined in Section 2.2. However, institutional growth is
suggested by CAs’ success in accessing other sources of funding after their subproject, amounting
to around R$1.4 million. The ex-post Workshop (see Annex 6) illustrates associations’ own
perceptions of their growth and potential.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.5 Recycling ventures: The pilot project working with local “catadores” who sort and
recycle trash/waste in the town of Bonito de Santa Fe in the far western corner of Paraiba, to
strengthen their public-private partnership in waste management with the Municipal Government,
was a valuable, relevant and replicable experience. The Cooperar-supported pilot won a national
prize awarded by the General Secretariat of the Office of the President of Brazil, in recognition of
its achievements in establishing good practices for inclusive recycling. The process, outcomes
and lessons are described in the Annex 2 Box.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 A Stakeholder Workshop in April 2014 defined strengths and challenges associated with
the Project (detailed in Annex 6). Key findings included: (i) organization, cohesion and
leadership of beneficiaries are key determinants of strong outcomes, enabling them to leverage
other resources and partnerships beyond Cooperar; (ii) subprojects permit CAs to learn new skills

                                                18
and their capacity has grown, despite difficulties; (iii) partnerships - both public and private -
were a factor in the Project’s success and allowed communities to satisfy needs beyond what
Cooperar was able to deliver; (iv) technical assistance and training are crucial and must be
systematic and sustained beyond the completion of the investment; (v) market and/or feasibility
studies are essential for all types of subprojects; (vi) diversification of productive activities is
essential in rural Paraiba to increase sources of income, improve economic viability, and generate
new types of jobs; and, (vii) SPs must take into account the specific social nature and culture of
targeted groups, e.g. quilombola communities, trash recycling associations.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1      Among the main concerns affecting risk to development outcome are the following: (i)
late-stage completion of about 25% of all SPs due to extremely pressured implementation in the
final year; (ii) management issues affecting some household water supply and sanitation systems;
and (iii) uneven quality and supply of technical assistance and training, noted by Cooperar itself,
and which could affect O&M. However, the proposed new and much larger project will have a
large water supply component and this is likely to provide the needed impetus to implement and
rapidly expand the coverage of SISAR-PB, as well as “retrofit” Cooperar II water supply
investments (hydrometers, TA and management). Technical assistance for viable productive
initiatives may also be reinforced in the new operation.

4.2      Critical sustainability issues arising from this project which will be taken up by the new
operation include: (i) institutional development as the essential “partner” to water supply
investments, and established up-front (before the investment): creation of water user associations,
definition of tariffs (including surveys of willingness to pay), and O&M orientation; and (ii)
critical considerations for productive ventures include the size of the capital investment in
relation to market demand and producer endowments, and access to financing beyond the project
to sustain operational and reserve requirements. The key questions of sustainability include
whether the productive system itself is sustainable in terms of resource use, drought resilience,
and access to needed inputs and machinery; whether the collective arrangements for production
and marketing are appropriate; and, whether there is demonstrated market demand, i.e. there are
dynamic buyers for the product.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 Positive aspects: (i) soundly-designed project with rational PDO and linked, measurable
indicators; (ii) experience-based roadmap for market-driven productive SPs; (iii) attention to
vulnerable groups; (iv) effort to ensure that a relatively modest loan was complemented by other
sources of funding to increase impact; (v) design based closely on results and lessons learned
from the previous project; and (vi) design in accordance with Bank and State Government
policies and strategy for the sector. Minor shortcomings include over-estimation of Cooperar’s
institutional capacity, including for more advanced productive activities (but acknowledging that
Cooperar’s strong overall performance under the previous operation boded well for such
assumptions/approach and the Bank team had little reason at that time to doubt Cooperar’s ability


                                                19
to build on that experience). Also, a fresh analysis/estimate of costs would have been prudent
rather than using historical costs under a repeater model.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 5.1.2 Positive aspects: (i) regular supervision and clear reporting; (ii) regular FM supervision
and strong follow-up; (iii) support to innovative productive activities which showed potential and
replicability; (iv) effort to ensure that results were measured – even in the final stages and using
less than full evaluation - and that Cooperar was prepared methodologically to conduct this; (iv)
well-designed/managed ex-post stakeholder workshop to support the overall results assessment;
and (v) action by Bank management to allow a project with multiple difficulties the additional
time to complete its activities and disburse the Loan; balanced by, (vi) loss of the opportunity to
formally restructure subproject/beneficiary targets, obligating the ICR to use the PAD originals
for performance comparators despite the Borrower’s understanding that such reductions had been
effected; (vii) inadequate focus until the final months on how Cooperar would manage M&E;
(viii) weakness of Safeguards oversight/supervision the latter prompting a downgrade of the
rating to Unsatisfactory, mitigated by an Action Plan under discussion and to be closely
supervised by the Bank; (ix) two ex-post Procurement reviews following effectiveness, one of
which in the grace period supporting preparation of the new project; (x) lack of a Water Specialist
on the Bank team when 66% of all investments were water-related; and (xi) correct decision to
extend the project closing date but a longer extension was justified.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 This rating reflects the Bank’s role in designing a rational, experience-based project
which was initially de-railed by events not easily controlled. The supervision shortcomings -
especially where the Bank has a leadership role and responsibility – are important, and
downgraded the rating accordingly, but the quality at entry rating sustains the overall
performance rating in the positive range.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 The State Government’s provision of counterpart funding was satisfactory but repeatedly
changing the Project Coordinator position in the initial period was disruptive and caused delays.
Rules governing Cooperar’s status as a project execution unit, i.e., not in the institutional/public
service mainstream, caused it to have difficulty retaining adequate technical staff but this was/is a
wider policy issue not likely to be resolved at the project level. State environmental licensing
requirements were burdensome and costly, creating hardship for beneficiary CAs, but
Government recognized this through its drought-related state of emergency ruling granting
exemptions from and easing of environmental licensing on cost and timing grounds. Government
supported the restructuring of the MCs - acknowledging their important role in decentralized
governance - and is supporting the state-wide introduction of the SISAR-PB framework for water
supply management. Government has shown strong support for the proposed new operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                                 20
5.2.2 Cooperar had just three years to implement the Project due to circumstances beyond its
control and many constraints. An institutional analysis was merited after effectiveness when an
agreed dialogue and action plan could have provided greater support. The pressure to gain
momentum sidelined such issues. Similarly, project evaluation was overshadowed by the intense
completion effort still ongoing through the extended grace period. Cooperar’s performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory for the following reasons: receptiveness to the closing stage
evaluation framework/activities and good performance in their completion, laying a framework
for the new project; consistent promotion of the Project’s objectives and benefits to stakeholders
and, despite constraints, diligent efforts to deliver training and technical assistance; and, strong
performance in unification and training of the MCs, equipping them to independently leverage
significant complementary resources. Cooperar needs modernization institutionally and
technically. Bank proactivity on Cooperar’s strengthening is essential and will have a major pay-
off for the proposed new project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 This rating reflects moderate shortcomings on the part of Government and Cooperar
respectively, balanced by specific, demonstrated strengths which enabled a troubled project to
conclude with many achievements, and build a positive foundation for the new operation.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1      The following lessons are among the more important:
            The Bank needs to be alert to the potentially de-mobilizing impacts of prolonged
delay between operations and disruptive changes in leadership and staffing, especially
technical. Restructuring and intensive training of a coordination unit should be considered and
pursued proactively through dialogue and, if necessary, higher level consultations. An increase in
the supervision quotient may be needed. The Bank needs to ensure that new leadership and
personnel are swiftly inducted into the Project’s objectives and methodology. The repercussions
of protracted delay should be taken into account when justifying extension of the closing date
         Related to the above, Cooperar is an experienced and committed project unit which
needs specific forms of institutional support to enable it to perform to potential. The Bank can
help in various ways: establishing a dialogue with its parent secretariat and an action plan to
consolidate and strengthen Cooperar’s role, political standing and autonomy within SEPLAN and
among sector agencies; establish a roadmap for strengthening its technical capacity including at
the regional level, which could include outsourcing and/or contracting specialized entities for,
inter alia, ex ante evaluation of productive subprojects, institution building for water resources
management, and systematic M&E.
         The institutionalization of M&E is essential and successive projects should update and
reinforce M&E capacity and utilization. The fact that a project is focused on making headway
should not preclude its systematic measurement/evaluation. As demonstrated, the Bank can work
effectively with the counterpart, using various analytical tools, to establish a dialogue and
measure results. The evaluation of household water supply and productive investments needs
differentiated evaluation methodologies/streams. With productive SPs, profitability is the basis of
sustainability; but a range of factors are also essential, including organizational quality and
market relationships. With household water supply, the criteria are social and environmental and
these can, and should, be quantified. It is essential that adequate baselines be in place
opportunely.


                                                21
         The CDD methodology remains a cost-effective avenue to basic social infrastructure
acquisition and to social capital formation but more systematic employment and income
generation requires significant changes. Differentiation of targeted groups by capacity and
potential, i.e., intensifying focus on market opportunities and demand are essential. Such choices
go beyond CDD by focusing on opportunity rather than need, and informed market demand rather
than equalization of access to basic services. CAs require training in phytosanitary, licensing and
certification requirements per market requirements. The public sector’s potential role needs
analysis and should be focused on compensating for market failures due to scale, dispersion,
distance and information. The institutional end-points for productive and infrastructure
subprojects diverge, requiring different expertise and selection criteria, and entailing different
risks for governance and sustainability.
         Productive activities in semi-arid zones with water difficulties are increasingly
unsustainable: The combination of scarce water, poor soils, land fragmentation and over-
exploitation is unsustainable. Bank teams need to acknowledge this and find alternative avenues
for income generation combined with a strategy for improving land management and resilience.
Global experiences in land and water conservation are readily available, adaptable and critical for
semi-arid regions.
         Rural water supply requires an institutional intervention to help sustain the physical
intervention. The management, operation and maintenence of dispersed water supply systems in
rural areas are challenging. As a general principle, the framework for water payment and
management of systems needs upstream attention. For future operations involving water supply
(and other O&M-intensive subprojects), municipalities/associations seeking additional
subprojects should have to demonstrate sustained O&M of the investments they already have,
even if not Bank-financed. The Project showed that institutional development is the essential
“partner” to water supply investments and should be conducted in advance: creation of water user
associations, definition of tariffs, and O&M orientation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1      Component 1: Community Subprojects (US$23.96 m, about 85% of total project cost,
with Bank contribution of US$18.0 m, 75%) would support through matching grants to
community associations (CA) the financing of about 800 SPs for small-scale socioeconomic
infrastructure and services (water supply, sanitation, electricity, education and health, cultural and
environmental activities), as well as productive and market-oriented activities. The goal was to
support both the income and non-income dimensions of rural poverty, improving livelihoods and
wellbeing of about 175,000 people in 900 communities and 222 municipalities. A detailed
strategy for linking small producers to markets was included in the PAD.

2.2       Outputs:

      •   The Project financed 487 subprojects, 61% of the original target, benefiting 26,815 rural
          families, 76% the original target.
      •   Out of demand totaling 985 proposals, the project financed 52% of infrastructure, 44% of
          productive and 27% of social demand. Subprojects not financed by Cooperar have been
          passed to other programs.
      •   Of total SPs financed, 326 (67.6%) were basic socioeconomic infrastructure, 156 (31.3%)
          were productive, and 5 (1.0%) were in the social typology (although trash recycling for
          example, has commercial goals as well).
      •   SP cost averaged R$76,482 (around US$38,000) with an average cost per family of
          around R$1,750.
      •   Demand was heterogeneous reflecting both basic needs and diversification.
      •   Infrastructure: Household water supply including piped systems and cisterns
          represented over 50% of all infrastructure investments. 19




      •   Productive: Among the 156 productive investments (32% of total) were 26
          beekeeping/hone (17.2%), 26 agricultural mechanization (17.2%), 17 goat-raising
          (11.2%) and 14 fish farming (9.3%) corresponding to about 55% of total productive
          investments, which were overall, quite diverse.


19
  Note in the graph above on infrastructure that the bar for “passagem molhada” or all-weather viaducts indicates the
number of families benefited, not relative number of subprojects. The red line signifies number of investments.

                                                        24
•   Government’s emphasis on productive activities saw their percentage of total investments
    increase from 5% utilizing just 7% of total resources under Cooperar I, to 32% of the
    total absorbing 43% of resources under Cooperar II.
•   Average cost of productive subprojects was R$131,533 (about US$65,766) and average
    cost per beneficiary family was R$2,437 (about US$1,218).




•   Social: This type represented a small slice of total investments, with a comparatively
    high average cost of R$285,496 (about US$142,750) and average cost per beneficiary
    family of R$2,136 (US$1,068).
•   This typology included the three successful “catadores” or solid waste recycling
    investments which represented 60% of total social investments, although an important
    lesson is that for success they need to be treated as business not overtly social ventures.

2.3     Partnerships, integration and leveraging: Combined resources leveraged from State,
Federal and other programs by Cooperar and the Municipal Councils were R$306.0 m (See
Annex 5), resulting in a ratio of 1 : 6.5. Leveraging by Cooperar through formal partnerships was
about R$56.5 m, more than doubling the amount of funds available to the Project under
Component 1. The number of associations/families benefited was not measured; no indicators
were included. Cooperar’s main financial partners were: Ministry of Integration; Paraiba Fund to
Combat Poverty (FUNCEP); EMPREENDER-PB; and the National Development Bank
(BNDES). Technical partnerships also played an important role: SEBRAE (Brazilian Service for
Support to Small Business); SENAR (National Apprenticeship Service); and the Federal
University of Campina Grande were fundamental in providing technical assistance, principally to
the beneficiaries of productive investments (see 2.5 below).

2.4 The table below (and its ratio calculation) is based on a random sample of 32 out of 156
unified Municipal Councils (CMDRSs) through which funds were leveraged by Cooperar itself
(as distinct from independent leveraging by the full 156 Councils trained by the Project under

   Component 2). Resources leveraged on behalf of poor rural families with the same eligibility
   profile by the project-trained MCs totaled R$249.0 m (see Appendix B).

   2.5     The following partnerships were established by Cooperar for diverse forms of project
   support using Termos de Cooperacao:

                             support for poultry subprojects in indigenous areas.


   2.6     Productive Subprojects: The Project financed 156 productive subprojects, just over
   31% of the total. Protracted drought affected many of them, especially those directly concerned
   with agriculture, except for those located in the Litoral (coastal) region. Drought resulted in the
   inclusion of investment with technical specifications related to drought resistance. Market studies
   were conducted in the following: rustic/informal poultry production; red rice; beekeeping/honey

                                                         27
production; fish farming; dairying and milk processing. Business plans were prepared for poultry-
raising. An important experience with solid waste recycling is detailed in the Box below.




 Box: Os Catadores de Bonito de Santa Fe - Good Practice Investments in Solid Waste Recycling
 The term “catador de lixo” means trash scavenger, of which there are about 1.0 million in Brazil with
 30,000 organized. About 90% of all recycling in Brazil is handled by catadores. It is mostly an under-
 capitalized, subsistence activity, but each catador collects about three tons per month. Federal, State and
 local laws (Federal Sanitation Policy, National Solid Waste Management Policy) introduced since 2005
 support such activities. Solid waste management is a municipal responsibility and priority is given to the
 selective collection and economic inclusion of catadores within inter-municipal management plans.
 The Project worked with local catadores who sort and recycle waste in the town of Bonito de Santa Fe in
 the far western corner of Paraiba, to strengthen their public-private partnership in waste management with
 the Municipal Government. The Associacao dos Catadores de Material Reciclado (ASCAMAR),
 comprises 112 families and manages recycling in the municipality as well as having a contract with the
 Municipal Government for street sweeping and cleaning of public buildings valued at $27,000/month.
 Some 33 families work with selective collection and recycling. The project formalized the work of
 ASCAMAR, improving working conditions and creating sustainable livelihood opportunities. The project
 won a national prize awarded by the General Secretariat of the Office of the President of Brazil, in
 recognition of its achievements in establishing good practices for inclusive recycling in Brazil.

 The process:
     • Catadores were organized and trained (market analysis, business plan/subproject design)
     • Definition of infrastructure needed for the selective collection (land, sorting facility, other plant
        and equipment (capital
     • Public awareness campaign (collection schedule, voluntary collection points)
     • Follow-up, monitoring and evaluation
     • FUNASA financed a Sanitary Landfill area (investment R$600,000)
     • Cooperar (project) financed the Collection and Sorting Center, Equipment (press, scale, truck
        and packaging – investment R$400,000)
     • Partnerships: Municipal Government Contract (R$27,000 or US$13,500/month); Federal
        Fovernment (FUNASA and MDS/ProCatador); State Government (Cooperar, universities,
        technical service providers)

 Impact is assessed via ITOG: Investment, Technology, Organization, Management (Gerenciamento)
 using an income-based approach whch looks at actual vs desired income.
     • Built on consumption
     • Clear path to attribution of interventions
 Results:
     • Recycling system operational with about seven tons per month recycled
     • Formalization and livelihood development for 112 families
     • Education campaigns, street sweeping and housekeeping services
     • Actual income: total R$22,744 and average per beneficiary (33) R$668
     • Target income: total R$36,510 and average $1,073
 Lessons:
     • Public policy can promote economic inclusion and sound environmental stewardship
     • Organization and skills training: fundamental for success
     • Business, not charity

2.7     Targeting: Targeting applied a hybrid version of the HDI-M-based approach used in
many Northeast states, using pre-established criteria, classifying municipalities via a weighted
average based on low HDI-M, level of annual rainfall, and number of rural residents. Targeting
was successfully applied and there is no evidence that subproject investments “leaked” to the
non-poor. Targeting of vulnerable groups – primarily women, quilombola and indigenous groups
- was well-managed and documented. The planned system of bidding events to obtain proposals
was not adopted. Rather, project objectives and procedures were widely promoted and publicized
in all 222 municipalities, starting with the poorest 50 of which 49 obtained a subproject, then
moving on to the remaining municipalities in a more general push to obtain proposals.

2.8      Component 2: Institutional Development (US$1.95 m, about 7% of total project cost,
with Bank contribution of US$1.6 m, 82%) was to be executed by Cooperar and financed: (i)
technical assistance (TA) and training to mobilize and strengthen the CAs for their role in
identifying, preparing, operating and maintaining SPs; (ii) capacity-building for the participatory
Municipal Councils (MC) to manage their responsibilities as defined in the Operational Manual
including assessment and supervision of CAs, participatory planning, financial management of
community SPs, and environmental management of SPs; (iii) training and TA for the STU’s
Regional Management Units (RMU); and (iv) workshops and seminars allowing MCs and CAs to
exchange experiences and facilitate planned integration activities involving other federal and state
poverty programs.

2.9       Outputs: This component financed the following:

      •   Systematic training throughout project execution to unify, restructure and supervise the
          Municipal Councils (MC) and specialized technical assistance to improve their overall
          performance;
      •   Technical assistance and training for the community associations (CA): mobilization,
          organization, SP preparation, environmental and social aspects, and management,
          operation and maintenance of investments;
      •   Training for the STU to improve technical and managerial skills; and,
      •   Seminars, workshops and fairs to permit the exchange of experiences between the MCs,
          CAs and stakeholders;
      •   Numerous thematic seminars were conducted for technical staff, partner agencies and
          community leaders including on desertification, agro-ecology and sustainability;
      •   Launched an annual “Ana Primavesi Agro-ecology Prize” for internationally recognized
          leaders in this field;
      •   Cooperar also signed cooperative partnerships with EMBRAPA – Petrolina, the Federal
          University of Paraiba (UFPB), Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Bank of
          the Northeast, EMATER, SENAR, IBAMA, SEBRAE and the Federal Ministry of
          Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock (MAPA).
      •   Beneficiaries of Agricultural Mechanization subprojects were trained by SENAR
      •   Multi-media folders and other publicity instruments were developed and distributed.

2.10     ITOG: Cooperar introduced the Investment, Technology, Organization and Management
(ITOG) methodology starting in 2011 as a mechanism for joint planning of productive
subprojects under which beneficiaries analyzed the behaviors they needed to adopt to reach their
income objectives, i.e., what they needed to do to ensure that their subproject was viable.
Numerous local workshops were conducted with the help of contracted specialists both to
transmit the methodology and train 60 of Cooperar’s regional technicians. Some 195 workshops
also engaged about 3,700 small producers in subproject management with a focus on financial
growth and measurement. The participatory ITOG methodology also demonstrated promise in
“recruiting” talented young leaders, many of them women.

2.11    Municipal Councils: In order to reduce the duplication and inefficiencies of having
multiple Municipal Councils, a formal process of unification was conducted to strengthen the
representation of the rural communities in the Councils, and overall decision-making processes.
Unification was a major effort which encountered some resistance, and Cooperar recruited the
support of EMATER. By closing some 196 Councils had been unified as CMDRS out of an

                                           Cooperar for approval/financing

2.12     Community associations: The Project targeted diverse community organizations:
associations, cooperatives, rural integration groups, fishing colonies, indigenous peoples’ villages,
quilombola associations, and land reform settlements with training and technical assistance.
Cooperar sought to supply TA principally from its Regional Offices but also contracted
specialists to support productive activities. Evidence suggests quality and supply were not
consistent, although Cooperar fully understood the importance of training and made a mjor effort.
This was complicated by the variable/evolving capacity of the community associations to handle
specific aspects of their subproject cycle including procurement and financial anagement, and
meeting their required counterpart contribution. Some obstacles encountered were beyond their
control, e.g., environmental licensing and water usage grants, and are mentioned in Main Text
Section 2.2.

2.13    Component 3: Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
(US$2.25 m, about 8% of total project cost, with Bank contribution of US$1.3 m, 57.8%)
financed operational costs (excluding salaries) of project administration, supervision, monitoring
and impact evaluation

2.14  Outputs: This component financed the operational costs of project coordination and
management, which included:
    • organizational restructuring of Cooperar at its headquarters and Regional Offices;
    • implementation, updating and operationof the MIS;
    • supervision/field oversight and technical support to beneficiaries, associations and
      Municipal Councils

                                                30
    •   research for and production of the Results Framework Analysis;
    •   organization and implementation of the Evaluation Workshop
    •   financial management of the Project
    •   procurement of goods, works and services

2.15     Cooperar prepared a Borrower Completion Report, and seven studies (e.g., market
identification, census of quilombola populations in the State of Paraiba, agro-ecological
technologies for family agriculture, and ITOG), but was unable to prepare the planned MTR
study or impact evaluation. The reasons are associated above all with pressured implementation
but issues of efficiency, bureaucracy, and lack of understanding of the importance of evaluation
were also relevant. Fault lies partially with the Bank for not inculcating its importance over the
course of several projects. Aide Memoires for this project do not mention evaluation until mid-
2013. The new operation in Paraiba intends to focus on M&E and monitor progress throughout.

Appendix A: Experiences with Productive Investments led by Women

2.15  The following box summarizes five promising productive investments implemented and
managed by women’s associations and cooperatives under Cooperar II.

 1: Floriculture: Cooperativa dos Floricultores do Estado de Paraiba, Piloes Municipality

 Failure of a local sugar mill in 1999 saw many local families unemployed. At the suggestion of
 a new community resident, and based on the suitability of the local climate, a group of women
 approached the Bank of the Northeast and Bank of Brazil for financing to produce flowers, to no
 avail. But Cooperar I granted the association R$65,000 to start a floriculture venture which has
 seen much success.

 Starting with wooden greenhouses, an irrigation “kit”, inputs and seedlings, the group then
 brought in partners: SEBRAE, the Bank of Brazil Foundation, Bank of Northeast Brazil and
 Municipal authorities which provided training, technical assistance, support for travel, publicity
 and events.

 Under Cooperar II, the cooperative doubled the number of greenhouses to 116 and diversified
 production by purchasing with their own resources another four hectares of land to cultivate
 roses. This expansion enabled the cooperative to increase membership to 16. Floriculture has
 become a primary source of income in this municipality and five additional associations are now
 exploiting this activity producing native flowers, tropical flowers, vased flowers and foliage
 plants. Several have expanded into a neighboring municipality.

 The cooperative has a store in the city of Guarabira and sells to 16 municipalities in the State of
 Paraiba, 7 municipalities in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, and one in Pernambuco. The
 average income ranges between R$680 to R$800 per month/member, depending on demand.
 Piloes has become known as the “City of Flowers” and the women are recognized widely for
 their success.

 2: Artesanal Coconut Confectionary: Associacao Maos que se Ajudam, Lucena
 Municipality

 The Municipality of Lucena on the north coast of Paraiba is known both for its wonderful
 beaches which attract tourism, and high rates of poverty due to the seasonal nature of the local


                                                31
economy. Driven by the need to generate income, a group of 20 women in 2003 decided to
produce artisanal coconut candy, based on the region’s natural advantage in coconut production.
The candy is packaged in the shell, an innovation which has been a market success and won the
association prizes, extensive publicity and sales.

The association obtained R$176,600 in Cooperar II funding to improve their physical production
facilities and to support their social activities with children and youth. The support of Cooperar
II and BNDES has helped the women produce over 8,000 “cocadas” per month, as well as
bonbons and coconut fiber handicrafts. The association benefited from ITOG training and is
determined to grow and improve the living conditions of members. Sales remain vigorous.

3: Clothes-making: Associacao de Costureiras de Santa Luzia, Santa Luzia Municipality,
and Associacao dos Moradores Rurais do Sitio Pai Domingos e Adjacencias, Puxinana
Municipality.

(a) The Santa Luzia Association of Seamstresses started a small-scale clothes-making enterprise
benefiting 16 members comprising 13 who sew and 3 young members responsible for design
and graphics.

Prior to their investment, members performed similar work but in a precarious manner, without
organization or relationships among themselves. Today, the group is well-known and sells both
in Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte. Their production has been modernized and standardized,
and demand is strong. Clients work with the association on design, pricing and delivery dates.
Payment is 50% upon order and 50% on delivery. Each member receives on average R$800 to
R$1,000/month. Members also provide free sewing classes to needy members of their
municipality.

(b) The Puxinana association comprises 20 women who, with Cooperar I and II financing, are
producing dish and floor cloths, increasingly more standardized for markets and using updated
production techniques. Beneficiaries are paid by the day worked and production. A portion of
the gross income is deducted for production costs and part goes into a Reserve Fund. The
balance is divided among members. Working on average 3 hours per day, monthly income per
member averages R$220 depending on sales.

4. Fruit Pulp Production: Associacao de Agropecuaristas do Assentamento Sao Joao,
Municipality of Pombal

The land reform settlement of Sao Joao consists of 15 families, 13 of which are actively
involved in producing fruit pulp which has created 13 full-time jobs and other indirect
employment. Agro-industrial activity emerged as a potentially strong alternative taking into
account the settlement’s proximity to the municipal capital and access to water.

Activities started in 2006 with a grant of R$79,000 from Cooperar I to establish the processing
unit, and a second subproject under Cooperar II for equipment and a truck to transport product.
The association has all relevant certification (SIM, SIE, SIF) and is registered under the brand
name “Fonte de Sabor” (Flavor Source) with INPI. With an installed capacity of 2,500 kg/hour,
the unit is absorbing total production of members and local non-members, processing 60,864
kg/year and selling via formal contract to the National School Food Program (PAA), and to the
Pombal and other municipalities. The association needed an appropriate location to store the
pulp of native fruits which have one annual harvest (mango, cashew etc), and a vehicle, both of
which were acquired from Cooperar II in 2013. The association has plans to diversify

                                              32
production and develop new lines, and demand for its products is strong.

Box 5: Handicrafts: Associacao of Artesaos e Urbanos do Municipios de Lagoa Seca,
Municipality of Lagoa Seca

The association of 40 members was established in 2009 and received Cooperar support to
design, manufacture and sell pillows, towels, bed and table linens, as well as figurines and dolls
typical of the Northeast region. Prior to organizing, members produced and sold similar items
individually and lacked any capital to invest. Most were dependent on federal support payments
and the income of family members. Today, the women have taken many specialized courses
including design, production and business management. Cooperar II funds enabled the
association to acquire sewing machines, storage units, a computer, printer, refrigerator, and
production-related furniture permitting members to produce high quality items and diversify
production. They also provide classes for persons interested in taking up the same activities.
They now have a marketing unit centrally located in the city of Lagoa Seca.

Each member is making an income of around R$200 – 300/month through sales at the
association’s marketing center. Some 20% of the total monthly revenue is deposited in a rotating
reserve fund to pay for raw materials, operating costs and maintenance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.         The Paraiba Second Rural Poverty Reduction Project (COOPERAR II) aimed to
support the Government of the State of Paraiba in its efforts to reduce rural poverty and its
consequences, by co-financing small-scale infrastructure productive and social investments
(i.e. subprojects). The operating strategy of the Project sought to: (a) expand access to small-
scale socioeconomic infrastructure and services; (b) increase income and capital assets
through investment in productive activities and facilitate the link between small-scale
producers and markets; and (c) strengthen the capacity of the Municipal Councils for
Sustainable Rural Development (CMDRS) and Community Membership Organizations to
raise funding and harmonize policies and institutional arrangements for receiving public
investments to benefit poor rural families.

2.         This Annex provides the context and methodological framework for the ex-post
financial and economic evaluation, and presents and discusses the main financial/economic
feasibility indicators 20, comparing them to those obtained at project appraisal. The Annex
focuses on the evaluation of small-infrastructure investments at the community level (e.g.
water access systems and cisterns for water supply, and all-weather viaducts), and of
productive investments supporting market-driven productive activities through matching
grants for capital goods, working capital, technical assistance and training, to organizations
of small-scale rural producers. In the case of the small infrastructure investments, an
economic cost-benefit analysis was undertaken, while in the case of the productive
investments the cost-benefit analysis was of a financial nature. In the particular case of
cistern subprojects their cost-effectiveness was also evaluated.

3.        In essence, the methodology and the assumptions used for this ex–post economic
and financial evaluation are fundamentally the same ones used for the ex-ante analysis
presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Some minor exceptions are explicitly
stated and explained in this Annex.


      I.        Methodological Approach to the Financial/Economic Cost-Benefit
                Analysis

4.       There are two important elements which must be highlighted before describing the
methodology used and presenting the results of the economic/financial analysis, as they had
an impact on the definition of the methodology itself and the results thereof. These are:

              (i)       Delayed project implementation. Due to: (i) delays in Project effectiveness
                        at the State and Federal levels that were beyond the control of the project;
                        and (ii) early, frequent turnover in project management by the State of
                        Paraiba, initial subproject agreements were signed and began
                        implementation as of 2011, with most of them (65%) signed in 2012 and


20
     Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit cost Ratio (B/C).

                                                           37
                     2013 (see Table 1 below), the last two years of project implementation.
                     Delayed project implementation and its consequences in the subproject
                     cycle, postponed the effective start of implementation of most subprojects
                     to close to the closing date of COOPERAR II; and,

          (ii)       Climatic events. During 2012 and 2013, the last two years of project
                     implementation, the worst drought in 45 years affected the entire Northeast
                     region of Brazil, including Paraiba. This event had a profound negative
                     effect on the implementation of most productive subprojects, particularly
                     those related directly to agriculture. Therefore, as most productive
                     subprojects initiated their implementation in that period, the performance of
                     many of them suffered a setback compared to years with a normal cycle of
                     precipitation.

Sample Selection for Analysis

5.        Few subprojects had more than one year of effective operation at the time of this
evaluation, due to the aforementioned delays in project implementation, coupled with the
impact of the drought on agricultural activities. This situation had to be taken into account
during the definition of the methodology to be used, particularly with respect to the sampling
universe. As such, the analysis focused on those subprojects that had completed at least one
production/marketing cycle or had at least one year of implementation, thereby reducing the
universe for the analysis to 208 subprojects.

6.        Most of the data required to undertake incremental financial and economic cost-
benefit analyses were unavailable at the central level during the ex-post evaluation, and thus
collection of primary data at the subproject site was required. Given time and other resource
constraints it was not considered feasible to collect, systematize and analyze information for
a sample large enough to yield a high degree of statistical confidence. The sample size
decision became a matter of what was considered feasible to achieve, given the
aforementioned constraints.

7.       The approach followed separated the infrastructure subprojects and the productive
subprojects into distinct sub-universes. The sample in each sub-universe was stratified
according to subproject type, and the observations were selected randomly.


                                                 38
8.        In the case of infrastructure subprojects, the sampling sub-universe included 151
subprojects. The sample consisted of 22.5 percent from this sub-universe (i.e. 34
subprojects). For productive subprojects, the sampling sub-universe included 57 subprojects,
and a random sample of 30 percent of the universe (i.e. 17 subprojects) was selected. Taking
into account both infrastructure and productive subprojects, the sampling universe
represented 43 percent of all financed subprojects, and the overall sample represented nearly
10 percent of the all financed subprojects.

Information Gathering and Systematization

9.        To fill the aforementioned information gaps, participatory workshops were held
with beneficiary communities and producer groups. For this purpose, project staff were
trained and guided to obtain the missing information through participatory methods. A guide
and a model questionnaire were prepared for each type of subproject. All 51 subprojects
from both samples were visited, and workshops were held with participation of members of
the community and/or the producer organizations, and their corresponding directorates.

10.      As mentioned before, most subprojects did not have much more than one year of
implementation. Thus, the data collected in the participatory workshops were not sufficient to
undertake the financial and economic cost-benefit analyses without defining a set of working
assumptions.

11.       For most years of the analysis, it was necessary to make projections of costs and
revenues and their underlying factors. These were made using a “most-likely” approach,
based on the perceived likelihood of improvements in productivity, added value,
marketing/other, taking into account the situation found during the workshops and field
visits. The projections also benefited from local technical advice, and took into account
information available at COOPERAR II, and other State agencies and partners. The
projections assume regular weather conditions and factors of production, leaving aside overly
optimistic or pessimistic forecasts or events of an exceptional occurrence (e.g., the persistent
drought mentioned earlier).


   II.     Financial Analysis of Productive Subprojects

12.       Productive subprojects originated from a demand-driven process during project
implementation, and thus they are different in nature and scope than the likely subproject-
types that were evaluated during the project’s ex-ante cost-benefit analysis at appraisal. As
in the case of the ex-ante analysis, productive subprojects were subjected to a financial cost-
benefit analysis from the perspective of the whole “business venture”. As such, the results
show whether the ventures were financially feasible as a standalone investments.

13.       The randomly selected subprojects were geographically dispersed throughout the
State of Paraiba, as shown on Table 2.

14.       There were 10 types of productive chains or investments types represented in the
sample. Table 3 shows the types of productive subprojects, the total number of beneficiary
families per type, and the number and share of families represented by the sample.

implementation, and a 10% discount rate. Using the flows of incremental net revenues, the
Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Benefit-Cost Ratio (B/C) were
calculated and are presented in Table 4.

16.       Total investments for subprojects evaluated in the ex–ante analysis at project
appraisal ranged from R$ 7,000 to R$ 65,000, with an average of R$ 39,000. On the other
hand, as seen on Table 4, total investment for ex-post subprojects ranged from R$ 60,000 to
R$ 286,000, with an average of R$ 150,000. Although average investment of ex-post

subprojects is close to three times the average for the ex-ante subprojects, the average ex-post
NPV is significantly lower (about 23%) than the NPV for the ex-ante subprojects.

17.     As shown in Table 4, all but 4 of the 17 evaluated subprojects of the ex-post analysis
were financially viable (i.e. they had an IRR higher than the discount rate of 10%, and a NPV
greater than zero). The IRR for the financially viable subprojects ranged from 11% to 33%,
while that for the subprojects used for the ex-ante analysis, ranged from 15% to 50%. The
NPV for ex–post subprojects ranged from R$ 4,400 to R$ 238,000. In comparison, the ex-
ante NPV ranged from R$. 1,800 to R$. 328,000.

18.      The average NPV per family was estimated at R$ 3,138 when including all
subprojects from the ex-post sample, and R$ 4,858, when including only those which
returned financially feasible indicators. These values represent the present net income by a
family, after family labor used for project implementation was compensated at the local daily
rate for unskilled labor.

19.     On average, subprojects of the ex–post evaluation would recuperate their investments
in around 5.5 years. Only in one case (i.e., handicrafts) would the period to recuperate the
investment be longer than the 10-year period used for analysis purposes. The repayment
period for the financially viable subprojects ranged from around 3-6 years.

20.     The above differences in subproject size and indicators between the COOPERAR I
subprojects used as reference for the ex- ante analysis at appraisal, and the sample of ex-post
subprojects of COOPERAR II, is largely explained by the difference in nature and scope of
subprojects financed by the two projects. COOPERAR I responded with smaller-size
investments to community needs through a Community Driven Development approach, while
COOPERAR II initiated a gradual transition towards responding to market opportunities, and
this implied a significant increase in subproject size and type of subproject. Also, there is no
doubt that subproject maturity was lower under COOPERAR II, due to the short time of
subproject implementation at the time of analysis; only 6 of the 17 sampled subprojects were
fully functioning and had completed a full production-to-marketing cycle. Also the severe
drought conditions generally experienced during early subproject implementation had a
negative impact in subproject performance at an early stage.

21.       When subjected to a sensitivity analysis, by simultaneously increasing incremental
costs and decreasing incremental revenues, by 20% 23 each, the financial feasibility indicators
were affected as shown in Table 5. The results show that only the two beekeeping
subprojects were able to withstand the combined effect of reducing revenues and increasing
costs by 20%. Also shown in Table 5 are the estimated switching values, or equilibrium
points, with respect to increases in recurring costs or reductions in revenue, independently,
for each subproject. The values represent the maximum percentage increase in recurrent
costs, or the maximum decrease in revenue, that the subprojects can withstand to remain
viable. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that subprojects are susceptible to variations in
costs and revenues (i.e. prices and/or sales). This is expected to certain extent, as these are
business ventures and market dynamics play a major role in their continued success.

     This is the same sensitivity analysis conducted in the ex–ante financial feasibility analysis.

      III. Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Subprojects

22.      Infrastructure subprojects were also demand driven; as such the location-specific
investment requirements and operational costs could not be determined at project appraisal.
Hence, the sampled subprojects of the ex–post evaluation do not strictly reflect the
subprojects evaluated at the time of appraisal.

23.     Investment cost information for the analysis came from the Project’s MIS and
maintenance and operation costs from the participatory workshops held with beneficiary

      With respect to base scenario shown in Table 4.

communities. With respect to the economic benefits, only the main benefits identified and
quantified during the participatory workshops, as corresponding to each evaluated subproject,
were accounted for in the economic analysis The types of benefits included were:

           a. For water supply systems and cisterns: (i) family-time saved in water
              collection; (ii) savings for the non-use of water tanker-trucks (carros-pipa) to
              complement water supply in the dry season; (iii) time savings and reductions
              in costs related to medical attention, transport to medical facilities and
              savings in medications as a result of reduced incidence of water-borne
              diseases, due to improved water quality; (iv) water consumption fees; and (v)
              association fees for maintenance and operation;

           b. For all-weather viaducts: (i) foregone household travel time; (ii) increased
              sales derived from reduction in post-harvest to market losses of perishable
              products; and (iii) increase in price due to better access to market places.
              These benefits were included in the analysis accruing to all communities
              benefiting from (i.e. using) the all-weather viaducts, and not only the one
              community that implemented the subproject.

24.       As in the ex-ante analysis at appraisal, the ex-post analysis assumed that foregone
household travel time was allocated to productive activities using the local daily wage for
unskilled labor as a measure of the opportunity cost of labor. The analysis also excluded the
Tax of Circulation of Goods and Services- ICMS (18%) – as smallholders are typically
exempt from this tax - and used a 10% discount rate and a 10-year horizon of analysis.
Furthermore, also as in the case of the ex–ante analysis, market prices were used in the ex-
post analysis, considering that references of analyses of previous water access investments in
Northeastern Brazil used shadow price conversion factors below 1.0.

27.     As shown in Table 8, investments in Cistern subprojects averaged around R$ 78,000
each. Although with an ample range of results between individual subprojects, all
observations in the sample proved economically viable. In other words, their benefits to
society as a whole outweigh their costs. When aggregated, the average Economic NPV per
subproject was around R$ 143,000, the weighted average of the IRR was estimated at 46%,
and the Benefit Cost Ratio at 2.43, meaning that for every R$ spent, the net benefits for
society were equivalent to R$ 2.43.

28.    In addition to the cost-benefit analysis, the cost-effectiveness of the cistern
subprojects was tested by comparing the cost of those financed by COOPERAR II to similar
investments by other programs in Paraiba. In essence, as shown on Table 9, COOPERAR II
costs were amongst the lowest, with similar or possibly higher quality standards.

30.     In the case of all-weather viaducts, all subprojects proved to be economically viable.
The relatively stronger economic indicators with respect to other infrastructure subprojects
are explained by the composition of the direct beneficiaries taken into account for the
analysis. While for the cisterns and the water supply systems the direct beneficiaries were
families from those communities that implemented the subproject, for the all-weather
viaducts, due to their public-good nature, their economic benefits also extend to surrounding
communities.

      IV.       Final Remarks and Conclusions

31.     Conventional ex-post financial and economic cost-benefit analyses were undertaken
for a randomly selected sample of productive and infrastructure investments, respectively.
Given data availability limitations at the time of the analyses, and the resource-intensive and

                                                     47
time-consuming nature of the effort required for data reconstruction, the sample size for both
the productive and infrastructure subprojects could not be large enough to assert with a high
degree of statistical confidence that the observations are representative of the sampling
universe. Table 12 presents aggregate financial or economic feasibility indicators for
productive or infrastructure subproject types, respectively.
        Table 12: Aggregate Financial/Economic Feasibility Indicators for Sample, by
                                     Subproject Type
      Subproject Type                              IRR                NPV (R.$)               B/C
                                                                                  30

      Infrastructure 31                            65%                 6,614,548             3.63


32.     Aggregate indicators for the infrastructure subprojects were all positive, implying that
their contribution to society as a whole outweighs the investment and operating costs borne
by the State of Paraiba through COOPERAR II, the beneficiary communities through their
counterpart contributions, and other partners. This is not surprising, as the cost-benefit
relationship for these types of infrastructure investments is well documented and understood.
Moreover, though, when comparing the average costs of similar investments financed by
Federal Programs in Paraiba, particularly in the case of cisterns, those financed by
COOPERAR II were amongst the lowest, with equal or superior quality. In other words, the
decision to finance these investments appears to have been sound from an economic
efficiency perspective. 32

33.     Similarly in the case of productive subprojects, aggregate financial indicators were
positive and thus conveyed a message of sound investing in this type of subproject. Actual
“business” data to conduct the financial feasibility analysis were scarce, largely due to the
short period of actual subproject implementation. This makes the financial cost-benefit
analysis of the productive investments a hybrid between an ex–ante and an ex-post analysis.
As such, the conclusion that could be reached at this stage, is that productive investments of
the nature of those evaluated have the potential to develop and consolidate into financially
feasible ventures in their own right, if they were to continue to receive capacity
strengthening, technical assistance and other related support. The State of Paraiba may want
to consider providing support to these ventures during their consolidation phase to improve
their sustainability.

     Expected benefits for actual infrastructure investments are projected to be larger than for the subproject
types originally accounted for at appraisal. This is largely due to the increased number of beneficiaries
projected to accrue the economic benefits of all-weather viaducts and improved rural access roads,
compared to subproject types included in the ex-ante analysis. Therefore, the larger expected benefits
reflects to a certain extent the type of subproject demanded and is not necessarily limited to whether the
project was more efficient per se (compared to ex-ante calculation).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     The Project did not finance a formal impact evaluation. To improve data available
for project assessment, the Bank team agreed with Cooperar on a methodology for
analyzing achievements of each of the indicators in the Results Framework. The
methodology included random sampling, field interviews and focus groups to drill down
into each indicator (with some exceptions where the indicator represents a simple output).
The work was conducted post-closing and results are summarized in the Data Sheet and
presented as received, below. The background Excel files and a series of Annexes
associated with each indicator are archived in WB Docs.

                      Meetings were conducted in communities benefiting from productive
                      subprojects, registering/recording the final status of assets held at end-
Field Work            project (Exit Profile) for those beneficiaries who participated in the
                      Immersion Training/ITOG and who had filled out the Entry Profile
                      (Initial Assets).
                      An individualized analysis was conducted for each asset category
                      (Land,       Construction/Structures,    Equipment       and     Animal
                      Herds/Livestock). Initial assets were consolidated via the ITOG
                      system 34, with values transferred to Excel tables for data analysis.
                      The following procedures were applied:
Tabulation of         1) For each beneficiary family, incremental increase in their assets
Data                      was calculated determined by the difference between final and
                          initial assets (%).
                      2) Then, the average of the incremental increases in assets of families
                          benefited by each subproject were obtained
                      3) Then, an average was calculated of the increases in assets of
                          subprojects in each typology covered by the study

33
   This is a methodology developed by the Pedagogue JOCAFI - João Carlos Filho, with the support of
  ASSOCENE, and constitutes an immersion of all interlocutors within the socio-economic universe of the
  beneficiaries, and which was adapted by the Cinturão Verde team (Mayor’s Office of João Pessoa
  Municipality – PB) for the circumstances within which the Project was executed.
34
   The ITOG System was developed with the objective of generating, among other indicators, the
   monitoring of the evolution of assets (patrimony) based on data collected by/in the Entry Profiles or
   Baseline (Immersion Training/ITOG).

                                                  51
                       4) Lastly, the increase in assets of beneficiary families was measured
                          using the average of the typologies considered

NOTE: The PAD Results Framework (RF) shows two indicators for assets held: one
referring specifically to beneficiaries of productive SPs (Intermediate Outcome Indicator
- IOI) and the other to all beneficiaries (Results Indicator - RI). The Project MTR
upgraded the IOI (productive) to an RI and measured only that version.

Result
                    leveraged from other programs was 1 : 3.4.


NOTE:
   (a) Cooperar used a sampling methodology based on 32 MCs out of 156 unified MCs
         directly associated with the Project (total unified MCs at the time were 178), and
         Project funds/partnerships related directly to these 32 MCs.
   (b) “Project resources” in this case means only those related directly to the SP
         activities of the 32 sampled MCs, not total SP activities processed by the 156
         unified MCs associated directly with the Project.
   (c) As estimated by Cooperar and shown in Table 2 below: Cooperar (1) (R$16.48 m)
         represents project resources (Bank loan, Borrower counterpart); Partner (2)
         (R$2.598 m) represents the counterpart contribution of beneficiaries as required
         under the Project, for SPs processed through the sampled 32 MCs; and Other

         Associations related directly to the activity financed, and processed through the
         32 sampled MCs.
   (d) However, as designed at appraisal, total project cost for SPs under Component 1
         (see Annex 1) would be the numerator and total resources leveraged (via
         Cooperar’s partnerships plus direct leveraging by the MCs) the denominator.

            Estimated in this manner, the numerator of the ratio would be total resources
            invested in Component 1 Community Subprojects (US$23.22 m or about R$ 47.0
            m) and the denominator R$306.0 m (Cooperar and MC leveraging).
       (e) R$47.0 as a ratio of R$306.0 m = 1 : 6.5

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

INTRODUCTION
As part of the process of project closure, an evaluation seminar was organized to evaluate/analyze
activities under the Cooperar operation. Around 30 participants representing beneficiary
associations, Municipal Councils for Sustainable Rural Development, partner agencies, the
Cooperar team and World Bank representatives participated.
SYNTHESIS OF PRESENTATIONS AND COMMENTS:
Important points and achievements revealed in the presentations:
     In all cases presented it was evident that the issue of the organization of beneficiaries,
      and degree of cohesion within groups and with their leaders was a determining factor
      and indispensable to achieving results. These factors allowed communities to confront
      challenges to implementation and management and in many cases to go beyond Cooperar
      support, leveraging other partnerships and resources.
     Subproject implementation promoted learning of various skills/subjects up till then
      unknown to beneficiaries. In particular, presenting final accounts, procurement and the
      management of a relatively large amount of funds compared to what these associations
      generally utilize/manage. Consequently, despite the difficulties mentioned, associations
      strengthened their capacity and felt that they were more able to act independently and get
      results.
     The issue of partnerships was something mentioned frequently as a success factor
      which expanded the results of Cooperar. As much with public entities and projects, as
      well as private organizations, the leveraging of new partnerships, in many cases with
      Cooperar support, was highly relevant in enabling beneficiary associations to increase the
      provision of necessities which were not/could not be provided by the Cooperar project.
     Support and technical assistance (including training) were stated as a key element in
      achieving positive results. Many participants discussed the need for this support and
      TA to not be once-off but be accessed/supplied continuously including after the
      subprojects were completed. It was unanimously recommended that future support and
      TA activities be strengthened and more systematic.
     Also noted by participants was the theme of identification and preparation of subprojects.
      It was evident that the feasibility and market studies conducted were highly
      pertinent and necessary. It was suggested that in future these tools for identification and
      management be generalized to all types of subprojects.
     Some presentations showed that the diversification of productive activities is
      important in the rural context in Paraíba, to diversify sources of income and improve
      economic viability, as well as to generate new types of occupations.
     Finally, social themes such as quilombola communities, or trash recyclers showed the
      importance and relevance of implementing subprojects which took into account the
      specific circumstances of these groups.
Weaknesses and challenges noted by participants:
     In various cases, but not in all, the issue of the weight/burden and the complexity of
      administrative procedures (bureaucracy involved in procurement, obtaining licenses,
      presentation of final accounts) were mentioned as elements slowing things down and
      having a high cost for beneficiaries: financial and logistical costs in handling all these

                                               60
         matters/steps. Support from the project team was mentioned favorably but it was not
         sufficient. Support directed to specific beneficiaries would be a positive advance.
      In the case of processing units (fruit pulp, honey, chicken slaughter units), the increasing
       difficulty of addressing legal aspects/laws pertaining to construction/infrastructure
       were mentioned. Information and guidance provided to beneficiaries were sometimes
       unclear and above all, depended a lot on the persons responsible for supervising the
       works. On the other hand, access to markets is increasingly based on requirements for
       certificates of inspection (municipal, state and/or federal). Based on the testimony from
       project beneficiaries, it was clear that these aspects need to be considered with greater
       care, and support and assistance strengthened.
      The functioning of the CMDRSs was greatly improved and is providing “space” in
       which the processes of identifying and selecting subprojects are being upgraded,
       improving transparency and the degree of participation. The functioning, rules and
       criteria for selection and prioritization of subprojects need further strengthening.
      In the cases of productive subprojects, many of which have had little time to function
         since completion, the main challenges are still to come: guaranteeing sustainability and
         good management, and ensuring that these investments really become productive
         and are within the parameters initially defined.
Group 1 - Relevance: Concept of the Project

1.What should be done differently, during the concept phase, in a similar, future project?
• Establish clearer eligibility criteria to select beneficiaries;
• Ensure the participation of beneficiaries in the concept stage of the project;
• Recommend under the productive component, the identification of productive chains with
  potential and with economic occupations which can be supported, including preparation of
  business plans with participation of beneficiaries;
• Mobilize, build awareness and train beneficiaries from the concept stage of the community
  subprojects;
• Provide support, assist and conduct periodic evaluations of subprojects implemented
  previously by Cooperar, in order to give continuity and ensure the sustainability of activities
  conducted.

2. Was there awareness of and flexibility to make changes during execution?
• Expansion of the types of subprojects to include certain types of mining activities and solid
   waste management;
• Strengthening of water resources activities (cisterns and water supply) to confront the major
   drought which assailed the semi-arid region;
• Expansion of the value financed for beneficiaries of productive subprojects;
• Direct administration of the execution of medium-sized subprojects.

4. Could the scope, governance and monitoring and evaluation system be improved?
• Create a multi-disciplinary group to monitor, evaluate and guide activities;
• Keep strengthening the CMDRSs, creating instruments which further increase their autonomy
   and establish greater flow of information and interactions, including with project actors;
• Create a communication channel between the Cooperar Project and Society through a system
   of listening/hearing;

                                                61
• Improve the MIS, incorporating new tools for M&E including providing the conditions for
  mass-use of the system by Cooperar technicians, as well as for beneficiary access;
• Promote training in information technology for the Cooperar team, mainly Regional
  Management Offices, in respect to the utilization of the tool available in the MIS.

5. Could the project’s documentation system be modified?
• Use Information Technology to the extent possible, minimizing the utilization of printed
   documents;
• Physical processes should remain at Head Office and be computerized, speeding up processes
   and reducing the stages involved in handling documents, with resulting acceleration of
   subproject implementation.

6. What were the contributions of the principal actors during the Concept Phase? Could
   they be improved?

   a) Implementing Agencies (COOPERAR – Secretariat of Planning and Management):
   • Providing data and information and contributing to and approving proposals presented by
       Cooperar.

   Territorial actors and their organizations (Municipal Governments, Municipal Councils,
     and Community Associations):
   • Restructuring the Municipal Councils and attending to different types of subprojects;
   • Improvement could be made, better identifying the real problems whch need to be
     addressed and indicating technologies already known and utilized by some and which
     could be disseminated widely.

   World Bank:
    • Providing data on the evaluation of the previous project;
   • Providing support to the contracting of specialized consultants;
   • Expanding the margin of State autonomy in the definition of project norms and operational
      procedures;
   • Supporting policies and activities to add value to human resources in operationalizing the
      Project;
   • Maintaining direct contact with beneficiaries, and getting to know their socio-economic
      reality;
   • Identifying success stories in similar projects in other states and/or countries and which
      could be incorporated into Cooperar projects.

Group 2 - Implementation: Benefts and Sustainability

1. What were the principal benefits obtained from the Project?

Changes:
• Quality of life improved, sociability/companionship, and strengthening of family links/ties,
  restoring the self-esteem of project participants.
• Confidence in the capacity to manage on the part of association members and in acquiring and
  maintaining the investments.

                                              62
• Strengthening the CMDRS and continuity in the actual management model of COOPERAR.
• Stimulating and/or strengthening new partnerships, management capacity and socialization of
  people.
• Generated among direct and indirect beneficiaries of the organizations, a more critical
  conscience/awareness and planning by members.
• Increase and continuity in the production cycle (in productive subprojects, employment and
  income).
• Capacity to participate politically, socially and economically in these ventures based on the
  activity developed.
• Improved capacity of the public to demand and complain, and new leaders have sprung up,
  notably the effective participation of women in various types of subprojects.
• See Link with testimony of Luciana Balbino, leader of the Chã de Jardim sommunity:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIsYy0U1jcY

Contributing Factors:
• Courage, determination, perseverance, vision of the future, unity, solidarity
• Participation in meetings, conferences, seminars.
• Linkages made to find new partners;
• Training for the agents involved.
• The posture of government people and managers which ensured that the CMDRSs prioritize
  the demands of associative entities.

2. What were the critical factors and problems which affected project implementation?

• Bureaucracy in Procurement when its execution is decentralized and then the submission of
   accounts.
• Fragility of some CMDRS and organizations
• Problems in land administration/ownership
• Difficulties with environmental licensing
• Individualism in the management of subprojects/ventures
• Difficulty accessing certification required by enforcement agencies, for marketing the
  products of ventures financed by COOPERAR;
• Low educational level of some communities which complicates the management of their
  subprojects
• Party political intervention/interference.
• Fragility in the ability of some partners to carry out their signed commitments.

Measures taken to mitigate and/or correct the above criticisms:
• Technical assistance and training is continuing, aimed at improving the performance in
  executing subprojects and submitting accounts.

Future Mitigation:
• Organization and strengthening of associations, cooperatives and CMDRSs.
• Democratization and flexibility in the Laws governing these projects/subprojects.

                                              63
• Agrarian reform and accelerating the process of land reform/regularization.
• Technical, legal and financial support of partners such as: SUDEMA, INCRA, INTERPA and
  others to ensure that benefits are delivered faster.
• Awareness-building about the importance of education of beneficiaries, which will influence
  the development of a critical and political vision as a full citizen of their own community, and
  respecting the autonomy of partner institutions.

3. Is it likely that the benefits obtained will be maintained beyond project conclusion?

Risks:
• Lack of planning for the management and sustainability of the project;
• Lack of management training;
• Difficulty in accessing new investments;
• Lack of markets/consumers for productive subprojects.
• Political influences generated by leaders of companies;
• Internal conflict within social institutions;

Mechanisms for ensuring sustainability:
• Continuous training of beneficiaries and new leaders, including young people, in the dynamics
   of processes, preservation and conservation of these ventures, and financial management.
• Market studies, strategic planning, maintaining quality standards so that the client is always
   satisfied.
• Sign and carry out agreements and commitments, respect the rules and regulation for using the
  subprojects.
• To have a financial return for producers.
• To have clarity concerning the importance of COOPERAR in accompanying future works.
• To anticipate/foresee the maintenance and replacement of parts and equipment for these
    ventures.
• Maintain good, permanent relationships with partners.
• Success with these projects with mean the continuity of the process and future agreements.
• Build awareness in agents involved in the entire process about the preservation and
    conservation of the environment.
• COOPERAR to continue providing support and guidance for the management of productive
  subprojects and those types of infrastructure which require this action to ensure their
  sustainability.
• Strengthen the associations, cooperatives and partners through their members to provide
  continuity of these ventures now and in the future.

Group 3: Institutional Development and Collaboration


1. What were the improvements in the institutions benefited (Municipal Councils and
Associations), in terms of their capacity to obtain financing, carry out activities for the
benefit of the poor rural population (investment and O&M), and present accounts?


                                               64
Institutional Improvements:

•   Fewer fragile Councils, because with unification now done a majority of the Councils are
    able to exercise their real role in prioritizing subproject proposals brought by the associations,
    as well as monitoring the implementation of subprojects.
• Subprojects previously little known have gained transparency and speed.
• Groups formerly excluded are not only not excluded but now have priority (quilombolas,
    women and indigenous groups etc).
• The unified Councils (CMDRS) which are able to remain independent of some local political
 influences have come to develop more activities beneficial to their target population, acquiring
 greater credibility in public opinion.

Accounting to stakeholders:
• In presenting an account of actions and activities of Councils and associations to the people,
  some experiences are creative, with greater participation in Council meetings and inviting more
  civil society institutions.
• There are publications on social networks, local radio broadcasts/programs, religious events,
  official sites, but we still lack systematic information from COOPERAR.
• The Fruit Pulp Project in Chã do Jardim could not expand its production due to lack of cold
  storage capacity. With the Cooperar II subproject, production increased, absorbing idle manual
  labor in its production unit and expanding the range for fruit purchasing in the localities,
  increasing the amount of labor used in the fruit production activity.
• The all-weather viaduct (ford) of Pedra D'água - Ingá provided mobility year-round, not just for
  the beneficiary community, but also for all surrounding communities, increasing their self-
  esteem and reducing the time expended to access the municipal capital.

Factors which contributed to obtaining benefits:
• Credibility and visibility pf social works, events, fairs etc
• Technical knowledge of the Manager in relation to potential state projects.
• Permanent participation of the communities in the Municipal Councils
• A majority of CMDRS are now de-linked from party politics that is, they act independently.

2. What was most notable (positive or otherwise) about the performance of the principal
actors involved in the Project and how can it be improved for a similar Project in the
future?

a) Implementing agencies: (COOPERAR – Secretariat of Planning and Management)
• Mobilization for inclusion of other segments of society: indígenous peoples, trash recyclers,
  quilombolas, women, land reform settlements
• Posture of the Manager in respecting the priorities of the Councils in order to formalize
  agreements.
• Visibility of the State of Paraíba within the country.
• Revitalization of COOPERAR in the past four years;
• The guidance provided by COOPERAR in productive chains.



                                                 65
• Partnerships with other institutions: SEBRAE, BNB, Embrapa, UFCG, UFPB, SENAR,
  EMATER.
• Training as an instrument whch permeates COOPERAR’s activities at every stage.

Problems:
• Reduced cadre of personnel and lack of permanent staff dedicated to the project
• Insufficient capillarity;
• Institutional disarticulation – need for restructuring;
• Deficient technical assistance for some categories of productive investments;
• Numerous cases of subprojects with less than desirable technical quality.

Suggestions:
• Train Council members.
• Systematically monitor subprojects;
• The personnel team needs strengthening by contracting trained technicians and/or outsourcing
  these services.
• Ensure the provision of permanent, good quality technical assistance.
• Etsablish strong linkages between firms in the agro-livestock sector of the State with the
  COOPERAR projects (EMATER, EMEPA, EMPASA and INTERPA);
• Promote exchanges so that beneficiaries can learn about successful experiences.

b) Territorial actors and their organizations (municipal governments, Municipal Councils,
community associations).

Noteworthy:
• 178 Municipal Councils unified;
• Emergence of an appropriate space to discuss problems and advances in the municipalities.
• Emergence of new leaders in the rural communities committed to seeking activities which will
  improve living conditions.

Problems:
• Interference in the Councils by some municipal managers and other political entities.
• Lack of interest and/or lack of information of associations regarding the activities of the
  Municipal Councils and the benefits they can deliver.
• Weak linkages between local actors in municipal development.

Suggestions:
• Strengthen the Councils and associations by training their members
• Build awareness in the Councils about the importance of their presence in discussions of the
  associations;
• Provide the Councils with functionality and operational capacity, for example, intervening in
  and monitoring the execution of public policies.




                                               66
c) World Bank

Noteworthy:
• The interest of the World Bank in signing a new Loan with the State.

Problems:
• The role of the World Bank is not visible to the beneficiaries as financier of these subprojects,
  and as regulator of activities (FM, Procurement etc).
• Unification of the 10% counterpart contribution
• Lack of discussion on the Operational Manual with the Municipal Councils and associations.

Suggestions:
• Provide information to beneficiaries on the World Bank as financier of subprojects.
• Flexibility in the percentage share of counterpart.
• Discussions about the viability/feasibility and full analysis of the subproject should start at the
  base with the associations and Municipal Councils.
• Financial resources should be allocated for implemented subprojects until they reach their full
  sustainability.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Executive Summary of Borrower Completion Report:

7.1     The Paraíba Second Rural Poverty Reduction Project, known as COOPERAR II, is part
of a broader program executed in eight northeastern states since the early nineties, in partnership
with the World Bank. The main feature of this program is the adoption of a decentralized and
participatory approach to development, with decisions made by poor rural communities. The
methodology is known as "CDD - Community-Driven Development". The adoption of this
approach was a very profound change in relation to what had been utilized until then, in which
investments were defined, prioritized and executed by government agencies ("Supply-Driven
Development"), with little or no participation of local actors.

7.2      In the other states of the Northeast region of Brazil, the program began in 1993, but in the
state of Paraíba the first operation with the World Bank occurred in 1998, with the signing of the
Loan Agreement 4252-BR to finance the "Project Rural Poverty Alleviation ", known as “Project
COOPERAR I". At the same time it adopted the CDD approach, COOPERAR I also represented
the first step in a comprehensive program of the State Government aimed at reducing poverty
indicators in rural areas, which would be continued with the implementation of the Second Rural
Poverty Reduction Project ( COOPERAR II), the subject of this report.

7.3     In strategic terms COOPERAR II was intended to contribute to Government’s
overarching goal, expressed in the Pluriannual Investment Plan (PPA 2004-2007), of raising the
HDI of 0.058 to 0.766 by 2020, with productive investments for income and employment
generation in rural areas and to promote access of smallholders to markets. Additionally,
continuity was to be given to funding socioeconomic infrastructure, as funded by the previous
operation, mainly in water supply. To broaden the impact on economic development in general,
the new project was to integrate its investments with those of other public policies, to attract
additional resources for beneficiary communities and thereby achieve positive synergies.

7.4      In addition to the above guidelines, the future project was to incorporate and refine the
CDD methodology, through the implementation of strategies of self-selection of beneficiaries,
prioritization of investments and execution by communities and their associations, having as the
central focus motivatiing producers to increase their demands for productive, market-oriented
activities, and supporting vulnerable groups including women, indigenous and quilombolas.

Results:

7.5    Demand: In the early years, the priority actions were Institutional Development, with a
wide dissemination of the project and community mobilization activities working with the
community associations and representative Municipal Councils.
7.6      In the projected period for the implementation of COOPERAR II, 985 proposals were
submitted, a distribution averaging close to 200 proposals per year. With the application of the
total funds provided for the period 2011 - 2013 and other resources committed by partners, 487
subprojects were approved, comprising 53% of all infrastructure proposals received, 45% of
productive and 28% of social.

7.7     Cost increase: During the execution of COOPERAR II there was an increase in the costs
of materials, equipment, supplies and labor, resulting in a substantial increase in the average cost
of subprojects in relation to what was estimated at the time of project design. The original

                                                 68
average estimated value of a subproject was around R$ 52,000 but actual cost reached R$ 96,000
during execution, a percentage increase of over 83%. Given available financing, this increase
implied a reduction in the number of approved COOPERAR II subprojects, which was 487
subprojects, or 60% of the 800 planned.

7.8     Productive subprojects had an average value of R$130,000, pushing up the average;
while the average cost of an infrastructure subproject reached R$ 77,000. Social subprojects were
on average R$ 216,000 due to the high value of subprojects for solid waste recycling financed in
three municipalities. The processing units of various products, such as fruit pulp, manioc flour,
dairy and pasta cost on average R$128,000. About one-third of all proposals for support centers,
processing, handicraft production and marketing were financed, with an average value of
R$102,000.

7.9     The implementation of 487 subprojects, even though less than the 800 planned at
appraisal, does not imply low performance. It was due to the increase in the average cost of
investments approved in relation to what was estimated during the project design, which
prevented the approval and financing of a higher number given the limit on available resources. If
on one hand the number of subprojects, benefited families and municipalities was lower than
planned, the goals were exceeded or satisfactory in terms of the number of associations and
assisted communities, and in the number of monitoring visits to subprojects and Municipal
Councils, among others.

7.10    Resources utilized/mobilized: Loan funds were fully disbursed and taking into account
two reallocations among categories/components. However, the amount invested in the project
was $28.89 million, slightly higher than the UC$28.16 million planned at appraisal. This small
difference, apparently, is represented by the slightly higher counterpart contributions of the State
and beneficiaries. It is important to highlight that the Government of Paraíba mobilized additional
resources in the amount of R$ 13 million. These funds were invested in staff costs (77%);
operating costs of the Technical Unit (9%); additional funding for Community Subprojects (8%);
and the Institutional Development component (6%).

7.11     Vulnerable populations: The participation of women in the organizations and Municipal
Councils was significant. About 205 women held prominent positions, including as Presidents of
associations, cooperatives and Municipal Councils: and 178 presided or held positions of
influence on the board of Associations and 33 are Presidents of Municipal Councils. Most
associations tended to elect women as treasurers on the basis of their trustworthiness in the
custody of the resources. In six municipalities, six female presidents of associations are also
chairmen of the Municipal Council boards. Women also have the lead management role for a
significant part of the infrastructure and social subprojects. With regard to productive subprojects,
female participation in the management of investments is approximately 30% of all productive
subproject agreements.

7.12    Quilombolas: The COOPERAR II Project supported the implementation of a Quilombo
Population Census Study of the State of Paraíba, intended to support public policies for this
segment of society. The work was done in partnership with the Association for the Support of
African Descent Communities and Settlements - AACADE. The survey was conducted in
“quilombola” communities, regardless of whether they had had collective ownership of land
issued by INCRA official or state agencies. Altogether there are 38 “quilombola” communities,
with 36 formally recognized and 2 in the process of obtaining formal recognition process from
the Palmares Cultural Foundation. The census showed that their population had reached 7,095
people, of which 1,075 (15.2%) with households situated in urban areas and 6,020 (84.8%) in

                                                 69
situated in rural areas. The population distribution between the regions occurs predominantly in
the sertao (semi-arid hinterland), with 2,112 inhabitants, representing 29.8% of the population
defined by this census.

7.13    Indigenous groups: COOPERAR II allocated resources for 4 productive subprojects in
indigenous areas, two of which were for poultry raising and one for beekeeping/honey production
in the Municipality of Baía de Traição, and one irrigated agriculture investment in Rio Tinto.
These investments benefited in the villages Forte, Cumaru, Galego, São Francisco, São Miguel,
Tracoeira, Forte, Lagoa do Mato and Silva de Belém. All financed subprojects received training
through the ITOG Office of Equalization where’re the management of subproject was discussed
and an Action Plan drafted for each investment, including income generation projections.

Lessons Learned

Operational Arrangements:

     •   The decentralized and participatory work of COOPERAR II, through the active
         participation of beneficiaries in decision-making and project control activities, promotes
         a sense of ownership that ensures sustainability and commitment to project results.

     •   The unification of the Municipal Councils (into CMDRS), by merging similar programs,
         decision-making processes and standards in the same Municipality, promoted an
         expansion of the capacity to mobilize resources and strengthened the unified Councils
         themselves, to the extent that they began to discuss various public policies and seek
         complementarities among them, avoiding waste and duplication.

     •   The Management Committees set up to monitor the implementation of each subproject
         had a significant role in the efficiency of resource use by the community associations
         and cooperatives and monitoring of the implementation of subprojects.

     •   The modern technological resources currently available (GPS, tablets, laptops) proved to
         be essential tools in supervision and monitoring activities enabling instant
         communication with beneficiaries and those with COOPERAR, and thus facilitating
         social control of actions.

     •   The identification and activities of partner organizations to support service areas in
         which COOPERAR does not have in-house expertise, helped to generate greater
         effectiveness of programmed activities. However, partnerships should no longer be
         informal but rather be formal contracts, including he definition of responsibilities and
         resources to be contributed by the participating partners.

     •   Investments in the Training subcomponent resulted in effective empowerment of
         beneficiaries and increase of the "sense of ownership" in the case of subprojects
         implemented.




                                               70
Environment:

   •   It is important to continue expanding the focus on environmental issues for all types of
       subprojects financed, with an emphasis on agro-ecology, and a committment to provide
       healthier living standards to beneficiaries and consumers, in addition to preserving
       natural resources.

   •   The fact that the release of resources is conditioned on the presentation of environmental
       permits - as was the case - contributed to the building awareness of the need for
       environmental preservation.

   •   The institutionalization of the Ana Primavesi Agro-ecology Award, sponsored by
       COOPERAR, will involve publicly calling for annual proposals. The Award is intended
       for farmers and professionals who excel in activities related to environmental
       conservation and impacts on improving the quality of life of the communities, in addition
       to providing greater visibility to the project, and could contribute to the dissemination of
       agro-ecological practices.

Social aspects:

   •   Compliance with productive subprojects and infrastructure to the segments of gender and
       ethnic groups historically disenfranchised from the strategies for promoting rural
       development was a successful and relevant activity that deserves to be expanded and
       enhanced in any new operation.

Productive investments:

   •   The occurrence of prolonged drought adversely affected a majority of the productive
       subprojects, except those located in the coastal region. Hence the need to include in any
       future project financing for subprojects designed to increase water security through the
       use of technology (available) for dealing with drought in the sem-iarid region.

   •   Conducting market research for products that are relevant to small producers (rustic
       chicken, red rice, honey, fish, dairy products), was of fundamental importance to
       ensuring that subprojects were consistent with market requirements and disseminate this
       policy to beneficiaries. Pecialist advice to beneficiaries in marketing was crucial for a
       successful outcome of productive subprojects.

   •   Safe, potable drinking water and improvement in the health/sanitary conditions of
       households/residences are crucial so that they can commercialize the production of foods
       for supermarkets (milk products, sweets etc.) due to the hygiene an dpackaging
       requirements for such products.

   •   The formal preparation of business plans, following the standards of the micro-businesses
       assisted by SEBRAE, is an indispensable tool for the good management and success of
       productive subprojects, being an integral part of the participatory ITOG methodology,
       widely and successfully adopted by COOPERAR II.

                SECRETARIA DE PLANEJAMENTO E GESTÃO
                         PROJETO COOPERAR

      Ofício no 643/14-CG             Cabedelo (PB), 25 de Agosto de 2014.


      Prezado David,


       With cordial greeting, I come across this inform you of the followinpoints:

             After analyzing the content of the preliminary ICR that was
     forwarded to us and carrying out a reading with our team, the document
     has been fully understood.
        We identified the following positive points:
        • Recognition by the Bank of the adjustments made to the results
          indicators and the intermediate indicators of the MOP;
        • Understanding of the problems faced by the state of Paraíba that
          influenced project implementation, especially with respect to the socio-
          political-economic context.
        • A bilateral relationship that provides a space for shared construction of
          the RCM content;
        • Recognition of the Cooperar team effort and commitment to obtaining
          the achieved results;
        The negative points we identified are as follows:
        • Insufficient internalizing of the PAD content;
        • Changes in Project Managers (3) and to the State Coordination (4)
          from the period between signing the contract, and the start and ending

      The state government, which was sworn in on 01/01/2011,
encountered the contract/project in a completely paralyzed state, due to
a complete lack of proactivity related assumptions of financial
management of the contract. For that reason formal strategies were
implemented within Cooperar to implement the actions within the
previously established timeframes. This allowed Cooperar to unclog
historical bottlenecks and present the present evaluated results.
However, we expect a better evaluation from the financial sector.
     In the last 44 months, the government of Paraíba has invested
R$6.6 billion in social and economic infrastructure in the state, while
maintaining a strong and powerful structural apparatus for sustainable
development, and creating a highly favourable ambiance for obtaining
resources and investments for activities that focuss on sustainability in a
way that minimizes vulnerability and risks to agriculture.
     This new proposed operation, which differentiates from the PCPRs
that adopted primarily “demand driven” strategies, will be guided by a
more “supply driven” strategy. In this regard, the project will offer
potential beneficiaries a group of goods and services with a focus on
supporting agricultural and non-agricultural productive chains previously
given priority by COOPERAR, using local potentiality and vocational
analyses, in addition to the identified economic opportunities, as a
baseline.
         Nevertheless, the “demand driven” strategy will be adopted at a
smaller scale, to attend to the beneficiary needs expressed in the
individual or association investment management plans that were
identified in meetings and discussions with producers. Demands may
include the types of necessary productive assets, types of technical
assistance, and schedules and flows of financial resources among other
important needs such as infrastructure projects (water supply and
sanitation) required for successful investments requested by
beneficiaries and their organizations.
