                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project assists GOB in the implementation of its SIP, 2003-2010, for the HNPSP. It will do so in cooperation with a large group of DP through a SWAp. The
                         main purpose of Strategic Investment Plan (2003-2010) is to increase availability and utilization of user-centered, effective, efficient, equitable, affordable and
                         accessible quality services be it the Essential Services Package, improved hospital services, nutritional services or other selected services. To achieve these
                         objectives, the program will focus on three major reform areas: (i) Strengthening Public Health Sector Management and Stewardship Capacity, through
                         development of pro-poor targeting measures as well as strengthening sector-wide governance mechanisms; (ii) Health Sector Diversification, through the
                         development of new delivery channels for publicly and non-publicly financed services; (iii) Stimulating Demand for essential services by poor households
                         through health advocacy and demand-side financing options.

                         Overall, there has been good progress on the implementation of the program, particularly in service delivery. Efforts by the Ministry of Health and Family
                         Welfare (MOHFW) to improve program implementation are having an impact. The Annual Joint Review held in August 2010 acknowledged the progress made in areas of maternal,

                         neonatal and child health. Some of the initiatives, which are now being successfully implemented, include expansion of emergency obstetric care services, increase in the number of
                         birth attendants, and expansion of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Program.

                         In recognition of the accelerated reduction in child mortality, Bangladesh has been awarded the United Nations Millennium Development Goal Award 2010.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This ISR documents two changes to the Program: (i) reallocation of available funds between the disbursement categories; and (ii) increasing the amount of signed Grant Agreement
                         from USD 335 million to USD 387.98 million based on contributions received from the pooling partners. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Grant Agreement have
                         been amended to accommodate these changes. The reallocation of funds is necessary to ensure full utilization of available funds for priority items like vaccines, contraceptives, and
                         NGO contracts for Nutrition Services and High Risk intervention packages for HIV/AIDS services.
