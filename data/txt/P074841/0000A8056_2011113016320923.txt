                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project assists GOB in the implementation of its SIP, 2003-2010, for the HNPSP. It will do so in cooperation with a large group of DP through a SWAp. The
                         main purpose of Strategic Investment Plan (2003-2010) is to increase availability and utilization of user-centered, effective, efficient, equitable, affordable and
                         accessible quality services be it the Essential Services Package, improved hospital services, nutritional services or other selected services. To achieve these
                         objectives, the program will focus on three major reform areas: (i) Strengthening Public Health Sector Management and Stewardship Capacity, through
                         development of pro-poor targeting measures as well as strengthening sector-wide governance mechanisms; (ii) Health Sector Diversification, through the
                         development of new delivery channels for publicly and non-publicly financed services; (iii) Stimulating Demand for essential services by poor households
                         through health advocacy and demand-side financing options.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the project activities ended in June 2011. Overall, the project has made considerable contributions in improving service delivery, monitoring and evaluation and the
                         health information system. For the progress made in reducing child and infant mortality rates, Bangladesh was awarded the United Nations Millennium Development Goal Award
                         2010. Despite fiscal constraints, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has increased allocation of the health sector budget by 3% to USD 364.6 million in FY 2010-11 as compared

                         to FY 2009-10.The Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Government has completed an end line evaluation to assess the overall impact of the program.
                         Building on the lessons learned of this program, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has prepared a follow-on health sector program which will continue to provide
                         services to the poor and vulnerable population.

                         Satisfactory progress was made in achieving the project development objective. Bangladesh has made significant strides in improving health outcomes. Over the program period,
                         infant and child mortality declined significantly. Between 2004 and 2007, infant mortality has declined by 20 percent while child mortality rate has declined by almost 42 percent.
                         Maternal mortality ratio has declined impressively from 320 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 194 deaths in 2011, thus setting Bangladesh on track to meet MDG 5 target of no
                         more than 143 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015. After having stabilized in the 1990s, fertility is once again on the decline and, at the current pace, the replacement rate target of
                         2.2 children per woman of reproductive age is on pace to be met by 2014.

                         Between 2004 and 2010, impressive gains have also been made in the coverage of vertical programs: 82 percentage of children under 2 years of age received all basic vaccinations
                         in 2010 up from 73.1 percent in 2004; 82.6 percentage of children aged 9-59 months were given vitamin A supplements in 2010; and, 82.7 percentage of children under 5 years of
                         age with symptoms of acute respiratory infection sought care from a trained provider in 2010 up from 74.6 percentage in 2004. The progress in vitamin A supplementation and full
                         immunization coverage were equitable with less than 10% difference between the poorest and the richest wealth quintiles. Nutrition indicators, however, have not progressed much.
                         Child underweight rates fell just 2 percentage points between 2000 and 2007.
