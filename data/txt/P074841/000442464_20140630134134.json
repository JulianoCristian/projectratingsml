        follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            complex challenges, such as child nutrition, is beyond the\n            scope of the health sector by itself and requires a\n            multi-sectoral approach. The World Bank can play a role in\n            convening development partners and to ensure that the\n            evidence is shared across different sectors, in much the\n            same way that was done with human immunodeficiency virus\n            (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the\n            three ones approach. Not having a clear development\n            objective can impact negatively on implementation and\n            results. The lack of intervention-level evaluations limits\n            the program\u0092s flexibility and responsiveness. While\n            monitoring and evaluation is important for accountability,\n            it can also help to understand what works well in the\n            program and what needs to be modified. Having a\n            well-designed results framework is important for planning\n            and monitoring. Without a structure for partners and the\n            government to design, debate, and evaluate new policy, it\n            seems unlikely that there will be structural reform in the\n            future. It also requires development partners to strengthen\n            their understanding of political economy and to develop\n            strategies to gradually expand their dialogue. At the same\n            time, the government needs to identify its priorities and\n            openly discuss its political limitations."}, "docdt": "2014-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
