"Ratings for the Decentralized Planning\n            and Financing Project for Mozambique were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: intensive supervision of the project by\n            the Bank helped in identifying and addressing issues quickly\n            and therefore to keep the implementation on track and\n            focused on its broad goals. The Bank team continuously\n            followed the impact of various approaches to training and\n            found that institutionalizing training courses in the\n            national training institutions was the most effective and\n            sustainable approach. Unfortunately, the lack of a training\n            plan for development of province and district level staff\n            left many without the necessary knowledge and skills to\n            consistently apply Bank procedures, such as the environment\n            and social safeguards. Preparation before the start of the\n            project of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system,\n            including baseline and target values, enabled project\n            implementers to start tracking project performance soon\n            after effectiveness. Consistent reporting on progress with\n            the indicators helped in ensuring that project was\n            successfully completed with only a slight delay. Including\n            an indicator on application of the environmental and social\n            management framework will help ensure that project\n            implementers and their supervisors pay adequate attention to\n            the issue."}, "docdt": "2009-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
