Planning and Financing\n            Project for Mozambique aims to improve the institutional\n            capacity of District Administrations, and to plan and manage\n            small infrastructure investments in response to community\n            demand. Continued commitment by Government to fiscal and\n            administrative decentralization, particularly from\n            Ministries of State Administration and Planning and Finance;\n            as well as continued Government commitment to community\n            participation and empowerment. Sustained political and\n            budgetary commitment to the provision of basic\n            infrastructure and social services, and to the progress of\n            the public sector reform program. The project has the\n            following five components: Component 1) The Participatory\n            District Planning will develop a District-level\n            participatory planning system based on civil society\n            consultation, and participation. It will deepen and expand\n            the experience of a decentralized planning, and finance\n            pilot in Nampula province. Component 2) provides Financing\n            for small rural infrastructure in the annual plans that will\n            be made available to eligible districts as local investment\n            grants, up to a certain threshold and according to a set of\n            qualification criteria. Component 3) capacity building will\n            strengthen the training system to increase the capacity of\n            local administration officials to undertake key local\n            government functions more effectively. Component 4) Policy\n            Reform will consist of technical assistance to the\n            Government of Mozambique (GOM) to improve decision-making\n            through policy analysis and for the further development of\n            the institutional and policy framework for decentralization.\n            Component 5) will consist of a small core team of project\n            coordination staff at central and provincial level who will\n            fulfill some World Bank-specific fiduciary functions and\n            provide technical assistance to the government officials\n            responsible for project implementation and GOM fiduciary functions."}, "docdt": "2003-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
