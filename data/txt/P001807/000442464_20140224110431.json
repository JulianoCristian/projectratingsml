Mozambique were as follows: outcome\n            was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was modest,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            for countries at an early stage in the decentralization\n            process, a learning-by-doing approach can be effective using\n            iterative adaptation, where the focus is on solving locally\n            nominated and defined problems, encouraging experimentation\n            and experiential learning, and engaging a broad set of\n            agents so that development efforts are viable, legitimate,\n            relevant, and supportable. A well-designed monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) framework can help to inform the work\n            of planning and finance units, and to inform revisions in\n            operational programs and training manuals. In political\n            settings without democratically elected subnational\n            authorities, a process of controlled or limited\n            participation within a de-concentrated framework can be\n            politically feasible, and help to ensure accountability and\n            efficient use of resources. While managing small scale,\n            public infrastructure investments is useful for building\n            subnational administrative capacity, managing lines of\n            credit for private investments that are vulnerable to\n            manipulation, and not well monitored or regulated, can\n            weaken legitimacy and the good will built up through\n            participatory processes."}, "docdt": "2014-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
