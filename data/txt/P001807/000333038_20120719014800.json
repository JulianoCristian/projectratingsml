        diagnostic elements to assist in the design of the\n            participation and downward accountability system of the\n            District Planning and Financing Program that the World Bank\n            and the Government of Mozambique are negotiating for\n            implementation in four provinces of the center region of the\n            country. Specific objectives of the study are: 1) to review\n            the current rules, regulations and institutional\n            arrangements for community participation and accountability\n            in Mozambique; 2) to propose institutional arrangements and\n            mechanisms that will improve people's participation in\n            decision making during the district planning process and\n            during the implementation of the resulting district plans\n            and projects; 3) to review and propose ways (e.g.\n            communication strategy, flow of information) in which the\n            district administration or others handling public resources\n            could report faithfully to beneficiaries on the intended and\n            actual use of resources at the local level; 4) to assess and\n            propose institutional mechanisms through which local\n            communities can regulate the behavior of district officials\n            involved in the management of public resources and the\n            provision of public services; and 5) to propose capacity\n            building needs and institutional arrangements to improve\n            participation, transparency and accountability at community\n            and district levels. The report is organized in six\n            sections: section two, defines a framework of the key\n            dimensions that affect the quality of a participatory and\n            accountable district planning process; section three\n            analyzes the institutional context that exists in Mozambique\n            for rural local governance; section four describes the main\n            features of the Nampula Project and analyzes its main\n            strengths and limitations in terms of participation and\n            downward accountability; section five presents options and\n            mechanisms for addressing the limitations of the Nampula\n            Project; and section six summarizes the main conclusions and recommendations."}, "docdt": "2002-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
