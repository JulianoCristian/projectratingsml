to effectively participate in\n            district planning and ensure local administration\n            accountability for plan implementation. The following\n            summarizes potential environmental impacts of civil works.\n            The monitoring plans encompass the following categories:\n            surface water drainage; Sewerage and sanitation; water\n            supply and management; small-scale irrigation; waste\n            disposal; electrification; road works and bridges\n            (construction and rehabilitation of feeder tertiary roads\n            only). Some of the mitigating measures will include to\n            ensure that drain gradients are created to optimize water\n            flow velocity to avoid ponding and water velocity-driven\n            erosion; keep drains clear of debris; promote awareness\n            campaigns focusing on adverse health impacts; design a waste\n            management strategy; cover waste and burns as soon as\n            possible after dumping; establish a routine maintenance and\n            cleaning service; install water reservoirs with enough\n            capacity; and regulate the use of wastewater for irrigation."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
