improving access to and increasing the quality and\n            efficiency of the basic education system, and will consist\n            of the following components:  (1) institutional development\n            which contributes to the establishment within the Ministry\n            of Education (MOE) the capacity to collect, process and\n            analyze performance data for the sector, and for\n            strengthening its managerial capacity.  In particular, a\n            management training program and a comprehensive educational\n            management information system to address deficiencies in\n            planning, management and policy analysis.  (2) In-service\n            teacher training which focuses on developing new training\n            methods and enhancing MOE's capacity to upgrade the\n            skills and teaching practices of existing teachers as a step\n            towards enhancing instructional quality.  In particular, the\n            component will help establish the capability within MOE to\n            design, produce and effectively use high quality teacher\n            training materials.  (3) School construction and\n            rehabilitation which will support:  (a) the construction and\n            equipping of approximately 130 primary and 110 preparatory\n            schools in 7 target governorates; (b) the establishment of a\n            maintenance program for schools, including training for\n            about 350 supervisors and technicians; and (c) equipment and\n            technical assistance for planning and supervising\n            construction work. (4) Related policy-oriented studies to\n            provide clear guidance to the government on policy,\n            structural and regulatory measures related to two topics of\n            high priority: (a) teacher preparation policies and\n            programs, including structure, operation and effectiveness\n            of both the in-service training systems; and (b) the\n            identification of additional means of mobilizing public and\n            private sector resources to finance basic education."}, "docdt": "1993-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
