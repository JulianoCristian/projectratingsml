sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the United\n            Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Grant in the amount of\n            US$700,000 was an important element in jump starting the\n            necessary activities to launch the project into its\n            implementation phase. The project used the existing Ministry\n            of Education (MOE) implementing agencies (General Authority\n            for Educational Buildings (GAEB), Central Directorate for\n            Educational Planning and Information (CDEPI), National\n            Center for Examinations and Educational Evaluation (NCEEE),\n            etc.) to carry out its activities. The project's use of\n            the National Investment Bank (NIB) for construction\n            supervision, oversight and review of the GAEB's work\n            was a valuable experience, validating the fiduciary aspects\n            as well. This project only had a monitoring and assessment\n            system only two of its components: the teacher training and\n            the institutional development components. It should have\n            been designed with a formal monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) program for all of its components."}, "docdt": "2004-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
