outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank performance was satisfactory; and the\n            performance of the Borrower was rated as moderately\n            satisfactory. The ratings for the Education Enhancement\n            Program Project of Egypt are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development was moderate;\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            performance of the Borrower was also rated as moderately\n            satisfactory. The main lessons from the experience of these\n            two projects are as follows: 1) governments may carry out\n            project activities as expected in lending documents but\n            hesitate to implement policies at the agreed pace. Donors\n            who finance hardware activities in expectations of policy\n            changes may face difficult decisions. The donor community\n            may use study results and other information to invite wider\n            public debate on necessary policy changes; 2) in all\n            sectors, a line of reasoning is necessary for linking\n            expected outcomes with activities undertaken during\n            implementation. A clear line of reasoning and attribution of\n            causality is critical in complex projects with multiple\n            components. Efforts must be made to measure intermediate\n            outcomes (such as instructional time use or reading fluency\n            in education) in order to test hypotheses and determine\n            which activities contribute the most to development\n            outcomes; 3) during appraisal and implementation, emphasis\n            is often on the big picture and on global indicators of\n            development objectives. To achieve the expected effects,\n            however, the Bank should pay closer attention to execution\n            of the details, the pixels which constitute the big picture.\n            State-of the art sectoral knowledge and local language\n            knowledge are important in monitoring the degree to which\n            basic skills are achieved; 4) targeted awareness campaigns\n            make it possible to increase female enrollments even in\n            areas that are hard to reach. However, mere enrollments may\n            not be sufficient to help girls' labor market outcomes.\n            Quality education is necessary to increase educational\n            attainment among the poor and disadvantaged; and 5) donor\n            coordination is important in the financing of activities\n            that are to benefit the poor. Complementary skills among\n            donor staff can result in improved project performance in\n            ways that can benefit large and complex countries, like Egypt."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
