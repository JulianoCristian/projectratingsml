Introduction   
 
Different countries show different attitudes toward the cultural and natural environment. 
Since the World Bank (herein and after WB or the Bank) is financing projects in more than 
100 countries it established a safeguard system, stipulating minimum requirements, for 
assessing impacts of the project on the environment, for implementing mitigation measures 
and monitoring plan and for disclosing the document. Environmental management plan 
(herein and after EMP) is one of the safeguard instruments, applicable to this project, defined 
by the Operational Policy (here and after OP) 4.01. The project has been classified as a 
category B project since the project might have potential adverse environmental impacts on 
human populations and/or environmentally important areas. 
The project is being prepared under the Danube-Black Sea Strategic Partnership Program-
Nutrient Reduction Investment Fund under which riparian countries are eligible for Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) Grants for projects that help control or mitigate nutrient 
discharges into the Danube River and Black Sea.  Activities under the GEF project will 
complement those under the IBRD-financed Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) 
that aims to strengthen Croatia’s capacity and readiness to absorb EU pre- and post-accession 
funds. The project will build on the policy and legislative work of the EU 2003 CARDS 
financed: “Approximation of Croatian Water Management Legislation with the EU Water 
Acquis”. 
The purpose of this EMP is to review environmental issues specific to investments that will 
be carried out under the Agricultural Pollution Protection Project, and to present project 
specific mitigation measures and monitoring plans that describe actions to mitigate potential 
environmental impacts. This document will also review impacts to cultural heritage.  
Expected environmental impacts, specific to this project, are related to spatial interventions, 
i.e. construction works and they present following pressures to the environment: waste 
generation, noise pollution, air pollution, habitat disturbance, water pollution, hazardous 
material generation. All these pressures imply relatively common mitigation measures and 
monitoring plan.  
 
Project description and identification of activities 
impacting environment 
Objective of the project 
The overall development objective 
of the project
 is to increase significantly the use of 
environmentally friendly agricultural practices by farmers in Croatia’s Pannonian plain in 
order to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to surface and ground water 
bodies. The global environmental objective of the project is to reduce the discharge of 
nutrients into surface and groundwater in watersheds draining into the Danube River and 
Black Sea.   
Project components 
 
Project comprises three components. 
Page  7
  
page 
7/31 
  
Component 1. Promotion of Mitigating Measures for Reducing Nutrient Loads to Water 
Bodies
.
This component will assist the government of Croatia to promote improved 
watershed management practices with the objective of reducing nutrient loads to the surface 
and ground water bodies of Croatia from agricultural sources.  Activities under this 
component will assist Croatia to implement the EU Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC concerning 
the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. The 
project will provide grants for 75 percent of the cost of remedial interventions, such as 
management of livestock waste, including manure storage, composting, and its application on 
crop land, as well as support for the application of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices 
(CGAP) such as integrated cropping management, nutrient management, conservation tillage, 
buffer strips, etc. in potential Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ). Beneficiaries of these 
investments will include commercial, private farmers with dairy herds of 10
—100
cows as 
well as commercial small- to medium- sized pig and poultry farms that are sources of nutrient 
pollution.  
Component 2.
 
Public Awareness and Replication Strategy.
 A local and nationwide public 
information campaign will be undertaken to disseminate the benefits of proposed project 
activities and achieve replicability of the same. The project will finance the organization of 
regional and national workshops, field trips, visits, training, publication in international 
agriculture and environmental journals and other activities to promote the replication of 
project activities in other similar areas of Croatia as well as Black Sea riparian countries. The 
project will benefit from ongoing similar efforts in Georgia, Bulgaria, Poland, Moldova, 
Romania, and Turkey, and the exchange of experiences will help in contributing significant 
reductions in the nutrient loads entering the Danube River and Black Sea.  
Component 3.
 
Project Management
.
The AACP Project Implementation Unit (PIU) 
established within the MAFWM Department for Policy, EU and International Relations will 
implement the proposed GEF-supported APCP, with the support of one additional technical 
specialist. The project will also provide two incremental staff to Department of Agriculture, 
Department for Market and Structural Support in Agriculture (future Payment Agency) to 
support the processing of grant applications. 
 
Identification of works 
 
Physical investments that might have impact on the environment are identified in the 
Component 1. These investments are: 
·
Construction of manure management platform/ waste collection sites 
·
Implementation of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices such as tree planting as 
protection buffers, riparian buffers, erosion control, grazing management and nutrient 
management plans 
·
Expansion of groundwater monitoring wells 
Beneficiaries of these investments will include commercial, private farmers with dairy herds 
of 10—100 cows as well as commercial small- to medium- sized pig and poultry farms that 
are sources of nutrient pollution. 
Choice of sites 
During the preparation of the APCP, the consultant work has been done to:  
·
assess the current institutional settings and policy efforts made by the Croatian 
authorities for reducing nutrient load deriving from agricultural practices into water  
Page  8
  
page 
8/31 
  
·
make an assessment of the current situation in regard to water pollution from nutrients 
deriving from agriculture 
·
propose pilot regions and a set of activities demonstrating good agricultural practices 
in regard to nutrient management and water protection.  
The nitrogen content of the major rivers of the Danube basin, which is also Croatia’s most 
intensive agricultural area, fails to meet the prescribed MAC for rivers. The eutrophication 
process has been enhanced in most Croatian lakes and their phosphorus content is far above 
the prescribed parameters. In 2000 only 30 percent of Croatian spring water (largely reflecting 
the quality of the ground water) met prescribed nutrient content standards. In the period 2000-
2003, drinkable water at 87 percent of monitored locations exceeded the MAC for nutrients. 
In the period 2000-2006, one out of every three analyzed samples from private wells exceeded 
the MAC for nitrates.  
Osijek-
Baranja, Vara din and Vukovar
-Srijem County have been selected as the three pilot 
regions suitable to take part in the project for its high agricultural production and high nitrate 
load in waters. All three regions are mostly flat and have fertile alluvial soils. The total UAA 
is 343,684 ha, accounting for nearly one third of the entire UAA and 26 percent of all LU in 
Croatia. Intensive arable farming run by small to medium scale family farms prevails and 
family farms occupy 63 percent of the total UAA. Cereals are by far the most important crops, 
using about two-thirds of the entire arable land. In Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Sirmium 
Counties, cattle and pigs account for more than 85 percent of all LU. In Vara din County 
poultry is the most predominant, accounting for 39 percent of all LU. In all three regions 
nutrient supply is out of balance with crop requirements. The biggest problem is nitrogen 
whose drastic reduction (40-90 percent) should be made in order to meet actual crop 
requirements. In Osijek- Baranja and Vukovar-Sirmium Counties, fertilizers account for 80-
85 percent of all N supplied by fertilizers and manure, while in Vara din County due to 
intensive livestock farming, notably poultry production, fertilizers and manure make up an 
approximately equal share in terms of N load.  
A
significant part of the land in all three regions is situated above underground water reserves 
and three major Croatian rivers pass here (Danube, Sava, Drava). The available evidence 
suggests that the situation regarding nitrate content in both surface water and water supplying 
private wells is worrying. In the last years 71 percent of all examined surface water and 49 
percent of all water samples taken from private wells have exceeded the prescribed MAC for 
nitrates.

Scope of the EMP 
The report for the preparation of EMP covers: 
(i) 
An overview of project components and identification physical investments / actions 
envisaged under the project which might have significant impact to environment;  
(ii) 
the policy, legal and administrative framework, including the role and responsibilities 
of the 
MAFWM
 and other agencies in this project related to environmental issues; the 
environmental and construction permitting process of Croatia applicable to the 
proposed works; and  
Page  11
  
page 
11/31 
  
(iii) 
in line with identified potential impacts and effects, suggested mitigation measures, 
including possible changes to environmental impact assessment and mitigation 
procedures, preparation of guidelines and practical suggestions, and related training.  
 
Three types of investments/activities have been identified as ones which might have potential 
impact on the environment: 
·
Construction of manure management platform/ waste collection sites 
·
Implementation of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices such as tree planting as 
protection buffers, riparian buffers, erosion control, grazing management and nutrient 
management plans 
·
Expansion of groundwater monitoring wells 
The mitigation measures and monitoring will be identified for construction of manure 
platforms/ waste collection sites. The CGAP based on EU good practices, by it self presents 
environmentally friendly measures and will require additional measures. The farmers will be 
educated on CGAP, to avoid any misinterpretation and malpractice of the same. The network 
of monitoring wells, financed from the grant component 1 will be established on each farm 
where manure management platform will be constructed, therefore will serve by itself as 
monitoring tool. A special consultant who will work together with Croatian Waters, PIU and 
Paying agency will agree on siting of the wells depending on hydro geological profile. 
Monitoring of groundwater will be the responsibility of Croatian Waters. Results should show 
the impacts on the nitrate level in the vicinity of farms. 
The project investments will trigger the following WB policies: OP/BP 4.01 Environmental 
Assessment and OP 17.50 Disclosure Policy. 
 
Policy, legal, and administrative framework 
WB policies related to project investments 
APCP requires preparation of environmental assessment (EA) to help ensure that reconstruction / 
construction of facilities are environmentally sound and sustainable based on OP/BP 4.01 
Environmental Assessment . The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project 
to determine the appropriate extent and type of EA. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one 
of four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature 
and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. In this way risks associated with project actions 
can be effectively anticipated in advance before project implementation, and addressed by direct 
mitigation activities in the design, planning and construction supervision process as well as during the 
operation of the facilities.  
The project has been classified as a category B project since the project might have potential adverse 
environmental impacts on human populations and/or environmentally important areas. For all 
Category B projects an Environmental Management Plan needs to be prepared.

roatian policies related to project investments 
By analyzing the investments envisaged under the APCP, that might have significant impacts 
on the environment, procedures for legal actions have been determined, according to Croatian 
legislation. 
For the construction of manure management platform/ waste collection sites, procurement of 
location permit, construction permit and operation permit is required. 
For the Expansion of groundwater monitoring wells, neither location, nor construction permit 
is necessary. 
Procedures preceding construction in Croatian legislative are: 
land acquisition,
 
environmental impact assessment (EIA)
,
location permit
 procurement, 
construction 
permit
 procurement and 
operation permit
.
For the type of activities envisaged under APCP 
Project  EIA is neither required nor suggested. 
Location permit 
The Location permit is an administrative document defined by the Law on Physical Planning 
(Off. Gazette no. 30/94, 68/98, 35/99, 61/00 and 32/02). It is issued based on Physical 
Planning document  and on special related laws and regulations. 
The Location permit defines important characteristics of planned intervention like: form and 
size of construction lot, purpose, size (height, number of floors) and area of the constructed 
object, auxiliary objects on construction site (storages, septic tanks, etc.), architectural form of 
the object (roof, materials and other factors depending on surroundings), site organization, 
methods and conditions of connection of the object to public traffic surface (including parking 
lots) and communal infrastructure, mitigation measures related to environment (if intervention 
notably effect environment by its operation) and other elements important for spatial 
intervention.  Location permit needs to be issued for every spatial intervention, except for 
cases specially defined under regulations (The Ordinance on Spatial Intervention that do not 
Require Procurement of Location Permit -  Off. Gazette no. 86/04 and 138/04).     
If construction works are performed on an object protected as cultural monument, prior to any 
kind of works (for spatial intervention that do not require location permit) it is necessary to 
obtain an official approval from the regional authorized body (Regional Office for Monument 
Protection).  
Construction permit  
The Construction permit is an administrative document defined by the Law on Construction 
(Off. Gazette no. 175/03 and 100/04). After verification and issuance of this permit 
construction may start. Construction permit confirms that the Main project is in compliance 
with Location permit and all special conditions issued by authorized bodies and obtained in 
the Location permit procurement procedure. In addition, Main project conformity to 
important construction regulations defined in the Law on Construction are evaluated. For 
instance: mechanical resistance, stability of building, fire protection, sanitary health and 
environmental conditions, operational safety, energy efficiency, thermal insulation, access 
and mobility in the object. The ownership and the construction rights on the parcel are as well 
defined.  
For attaining Construction permit it is necessary to submit an evidence that legal or physical 
entity submitting the request for permit has a right to build on the parcel in question.  
Page  13
  
page 
13/31 
  
Croatian parliament is currently assessing the newly proposed Construction law. This implies 
that the procedure in recent time might change and EMP on this section will need to be 
revised. 
Operational permit 
Operation permit is issued after the technical assessment of the constructed object, if proven that the 
object has been constructed in compliance with Construction permit requirements and the Main 
project.  
Water-administrative permit for monitoring wells 
Unless the well is intended solely for the use of the household, issuance of the water 
administrative conditions is needed.  The conditions are issued by Croatian waters. They 
ensure protection from water, pollution protection of water, legal usage and water 
management. They are issued based on technical specifications proposed by geologist who 
based it on the geological analysis, location, borehole geological analysis, etc. Monitoring 
well construction can only be done by registered geologist.   
 
EMP and administrative procedures preceding construction 
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) comprises procedures to recognize and control the quality 
of environment and to identify and implement measures in the process of realization of investment, 
aiming at mitigation of negative environmental impacts and environmental protection. 
EMP is not a requirement in Croatian laws and acts, i.e. EMP as an obligatory or binding 
document does not exist in the preparation of any investment projects, however some 
elements usually found in EMP are prescribed in permits and documents preceding 
construction, whose supervision is under the jurisdiction of different Ministries and agencies 
(annex 2). 
 
Environmental aspects 
Identification of possible environmental issues  
The activities supported by the project comprise as described in the scope of the project, the 
construction of manure management platform/ waste collection sites, implementation of the Code of 
Good Agricultural Practices and expansion of groundwater monitoring wells. 
According to Croatian Laws, for the construction of proposed type of facilities and envisaged actions, 
the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not necessary, which indicates that the impacts on the 
environment by this type of projects are limited.   
Possible environmental issues for building manure management platforms and monitoring 
wells can be clearly separated in two categories, one related to construction and other related 
to operation.  
The main type of environmental issues that derive from the actions during construction / 
reconstruction are following: 
Page  14
  
page 
14/31 
  
·
Dust and noise due to the demolition and construction 
·
Disposal of construction waste 
·
Sediment loads in waterways in case of necessary stream crossing or during 
construction of wells 
·
Possible negative impacts on cultural finds 
while the one related to operation are: 
·
Risk associated with handling wastes during operation (municipal, hazardous, etc.), 
which includes mixing of other waste with organic 
·
Leakages from the manure storage facilities (if construction is not made according to 
specifications); 
·
Improper cleaning of the individual manure storage tanks and large manure 
platforms; 
·
Inappropriate manure spreading in the fields if code of good agricultural practices are 
not followed properly 
·
Poor siting and use of existing storage facilities; and 
·
Methane venting and odor related issues 
·
Improper closing of the wells 
Extension of monitoring network will have positive impacts on the environment and will 
enable tracking of the nutrient pollution in pilot farms. 
All these risks can be effectively dealt with, if they are recognized through this EMP in pre-
design phase. In this project, implementation 
of mitigation measures can be advised at the 
stages of: design, construction/reconstruction and operation
.
These measures should be 
feasible, and cost effective aiming at eliminating, offsetting and reducing adverse 
environmental impacts. The measure should not only deal with recognized risks, but should as 
well be used as guidance to make facilities more environmentally friendly and sustainable. 
Environmental Guidelines 
The Environmental Guidelines address environmental and ecological/biologic concept, design 
and planning of new waste platforms and guideline for construction. The guidelines cover the 
handling of construction debris generated, selection of construction materials and construction 
methods with limited impact on the environment, energy saving methods as well as the 
handling of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and storage of hazardous materials under 
project supported activities. The guidelines are a base for design, training, research, 
discussions and workshops.  
Design phase  
In the design phase many important issues could be approached, investigated and best choices 
incorporated into design. The location of waste platforms will be on farm. Special attention should be 
given to sitting of the waste platform. It should not be close to open waterways, to minimize potential 
pollution of surface waters and should be on a certain distance from households to minimize odors. 
Sizing of the waste platforms have to be done in a way to store manure in quantity for min of 6 
months. At this time, a feasibility study has been done for waste platforms in all three counties. Within 
this study, two types of manure storing structures have been preliminary designed, calculated and 
price estimated. Structure 1 is an above ground manure storage facility with an underground storage 
tank/pit for seepage of liquid manure/effluents and rainfall. Structure type 2 is an underground 
basement/pit for storing slurry. The recommendation for technical requirements for materials are 
Page  15
  
page 
15/31 
  
given in annex 3. The expert staff from the MAFWM should participate in a design phase of the 
project to ensure that the design and construction will be done in accordance to Croatian standards 
and norms. All the documentation for the platforms will be done by the farmer’s contractor and to 
ensure quality the whole process will be supervised by the Paying Agency. During the process of 
applications farmers will have to prepare all the documentation mentioned in chapter 3.2. if 
applicable.  
Monitoring wells should be designed based on geological profiles. In annex 4, some usual practices 
are shown for monitoring wells construction. To avoid hazards during operation, casing cap with lock 
should be mandatory.  
Construction / reconstruction phase 
In the construction phase the emphasis is on possible environmental impacts that follow 
construction works. Issues that could be addressed are: construction and other waste 
management, minimization of dust and noise, top soil management, procurement of 
construction material, site restoration, temporary storage of the material, storage of hazardous 
materials, archeological and cultural finds, traffic management plan, working hours, 
encroachment into the neighbor territory.  
Noise reduction
Before any beginning of the work it is recommended to inform neighbors either directly or through 
local bulletins or newspapers on the construction of new objects and reconstruction. The noise should 
be limited by using good management practice and limiting works on regular daily shift. The 
equipment and machinery used should be calibrated according to the Ordinance on Highest Permitted 
Levels of Noise in Working and Living Environment (Off. gazette 145/04) and the Law on Noise 
Protection (Off. gazette 20/03). 
Dust minimization
Temporary technical solutions and measures for dust minimization during construction should be 
used. For the transportation of earthlike or any other dusty material to the construction site or of the 
construction site watering or covering of the cargo should be implemented. Reduction of dust on 
construction / reconstruction site during dry season of the year can be accomplish by watering the 
ground surface. Water should not be wasted. Reducing speed can be another applicable measure.  
Preventing sediment loads in waterways
Preventing sediment lads in waterways can be prevented by proper siting of waste platforms 
and construction site. All earthy material should be managed in a way to prevent washing out 
into existing surface waters. 
Construction waste
When waste is separated as advised in the Law on Waste (Off. Gazette no. 178/04, 115/06) it 
is more manageable. For non recyclable wastes, in arrangement with municipality waste will 
de deposited on legal landfills. Open burning and illegal dumping of any waste is strictly 
prohibited.  
Page  16
  
page 
16/31 
  
In addition to solid waste, some amounts of hazardous wastes will be produced on the site: 
like the remaining from paints, oiled packaging, oils, material contaminated with oil etc. The 
procedure on handling this type of waste is defined in the By-law on Hazardous Waste 
Management (Off. Gazette no. 123/97) and the Ordinance on Categories, Types and 
Classification of Waste (Off. Gazette no. 50/05). All waste has to be collected and handed 
over to the company authorized for collection and transportation of hazardous waste. 
Top soil management
Stripped top soil should not be thrown, but kept on the site for restoration after completion of 
works. Any prevailing trees and valuable vegetation should as well be stored and used later 
for restoration. 
Site organization and restoration
Construction sites should be fenced off in order to prevent entry of public, and general safety 
measures would be imposed. Temporary inconveniences (traffic or other) due to construction 
works should be minimized through planning and coordination with contractors, neighbors 
and authorities. After completion of works the site should be restored as planned in the 
design. All wastes and machinery should be removed from the location. 
Temporary storage of material (including hazardous materials)
Stockpiling of construction material should be avoided if possible. If not, construction material should 
be stored on the construction site, and protected from weathering. Hazardous materials like paints, 
oils, additives and others should be kept on impermeable surface, and adsorbents like sand or 
sawdust should be kept for handling small spillage. Handling with the material should be consistent 
with the instructions on Material Safety Data Sheets. 
Encroachment into neighboring territory
Encroachment into neighboring territory should be avoided if possible. In case where 
maneuvering surface is too small, approval for the encroachment should be asked. Any 
accidental damages of the neighboring properties should be recovered and brought in the 
condition as it was prior to the construction.  
Archeological and cultural finds
If encountering archaeological finds during preparation of the site for the construction, the 
contractor should stop the works, respond immediately and notify the municipal authorities, 
the Regional Institute for Protection of Cultural and Historical Heritage and the project team 
in the MAFWA.  
Working hours
To avoid noise and disturbance of neighbors the works should be conducted in a daily shift, 
meaning from 7 am to 5 pm. For other working hours special permits are required. 
Operation 
During the operation the main emphasis should be on proper maintenance. 
Maintenance
All farmers should be educated in good practices related to maintenance of waste platforms. 
This training should include actions related to accumulation of liquid fractions due to the 
Page  17
  
page 
17/31 
  
heavy rains, proper waste management, proper handling of manure to minimize odor and 
methane venting, proper cleaning of platforms, and proper application / spreading of manure.  
Monitoring 
The consultants have prepared the Water quality monitoring program for 3 selected counties. 
This report serves as preliminary study for the extension of monitoring wells network. It 
provides the review of performance of current monitoring of both surface and groundwater 
and gives recommendations for improving the existing program by installing additional 
monitoring wells. The report envisages a set of three monitoring wells installed  (depth 5, 10 
and 15 m) on each farm where program will be implemented for tracking point source 
pollutions. Frequency of sampling should be 1 in 2 months. For tracking diffuse source 
pollution several lysiometers are envisaged  to measure water percolation from the soil 
surface through the root zone to deep horizons, i.e. leaching of the nutrient and toxic 
substances.

EMP Implementation Responsibilities 
The MoF as a recipient of the grant  will make sure that PIU at MAFWM is qualitatively 
staffed to carry on jobs of supervision of mitigation measures and monitoring as described in 
EMP. Members of the SAPARD Paying Agency (under MAFWM) formed under AACP will 
work closely with the PIU. The PIU will make sure that all the necessary licenses and/or 
permits are obtained from related environmental agencies prior to and during construction 
phase. The AACP Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will serve as the Project Preparation 
Unit (PPU) and then as the PIU for the proposed GEF project, with the PIU Project Manager 
expected to oversee implementation of the GEF-supported activities. A Project Steering 
Committee has already been established comprising representatives from the MAFWM, 
Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction (MEPPPC), and 
Public Water Management Enterprises to provide guidance and advice on effective and 
efficient implementation of the proposed activities. 
The MAFWM is responsible for proper implementation of the EMP that covers both the 
construction and operational phase. During the construction phase, with assistance from 
consultants, PIU and members of the MAFWM SAPARD Paying Agency will carry out the 
supervision of the works carried out by the contractor and ensure that the EMP is followed 
properly. During the operational phase, the MAFWM will be responsible to follow the EMP 
in a satisfactory manner. The PIU will report to the Bank and MAFWM about the condition 
of compliance with the environment within the scope of project at regular intervals on 
biannual basis. The compliance with EMP will be described in regular Progress reports as it 
will be requested by Project/Loan Agreement. The monitoring prescribed in EMP comes from 
the Croatian environmental legislation and therefore will also be supervised by the inspection 
of Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction and Croatian 
Waters.   
MAFWM will implement the overall project, and oversee environmental compliance of the 
project during design phase, construction and operation phase and ensure that monitoring and 
mitigation plan of EMPs is being implemented. Environmental Inspectors within the Ministry 
of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction, together with 
environmental specialists from the PIU and the Bank (during the missions) will provide 
supervision based on unannounced site visits during construction and operation of related to 
construction conditions and  environmental protection.  
The disbursement of the matching grant funds for investments under Component 1 will be 
established through a Competitive Grants Scheme (CGS) implemented by the MAFWM 
SAPARD Paying Agency.  The Agency is already receiving capacity building support from 
the AACP Loan for such efforts.  Subject to a satisfactory fiduciary review by the World 
Bank, the Paying Agency would apply EC accredited IPARD payment systems and 
procedures for the disbursement of GEF payments for manure storage.  
Capacity development, training and proposed project organization 
Related to conclusions originating from comparing permits procurement procedures and EMP 
and bearing in mind administrative organizations and jurisdiction of administrative bodies 
participating in the process of issuance of permits, integrating existing institutional 
organization of environmental protection, it is necessary to arrange activities in accordance to 
jurisdiction of state and regional bodies, but as well arrange some new activities for which 
organization has to be made up.  
·
Potentially the weakest link and most influential part related to proper construction of 
the facility is in a design phase and for that reason a special attention and supervision 
Page  23
 page 
23/31 
during that stage is recommended. A team of representatives of MAFWM and designer 
should be formed and measures recommended in EMP incorporated. 
·
Most of the potential environmental impacts will come from poor management, i.e. not 
following in a proper way good agricultural practices, therefore a special attention 
should be given to training of the farmers. 
·
Making EMP part of the contract to Constructor and making it binding condition 
is strongly recommended. If not, all recommendation on construction, mitigation 
and monitoring conditions related to design and construction should be specified in 
the contract and assigned to contractor and/or farmer. 
The project will finance two additional staff members to support the application, processing, 
payment and control of GEF to Payment Agency management. 
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE 
The draft EMP will be available to public for comments, questions and suggestions through 
the website of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management in Zagreb for 3 
weeks starting with July 30, 2007. All received comments will be attached to the final 
document. Varazdinska, Osijek -Baranja and Vukovar
–sirmium county will display the note 
at their information board on the publication of the EMP on the MAFWM’s website and the 
requested comments on the future constructions.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUTHORITIES  
 
MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND WATER MANAGEMENT 
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (MAFWG) is responsible for a 
wide range of issues related to agriculture, rural development, fisheries, forestry, hunting and 
water management. The MAFWM is the main government body responsible for the 
protection of agricultural land from pollution by harmful substances and integrated water 
management. Besides making strategic planning and legislation, the Ministry is also in charge 
of inspection, preparation and issuing permits for (among others): Mineral fertilizers and 
veterinary medicines, Import and trade of plant protection agents, Water management permits 
and permit ordinance, Water utilization and waste water discharge. 
The MAFWG has a major role in assuring integrated water management at the national level, 
water quality management legislation and related policy development. These tasks are carried 
out by the Directorate for Water Management which has a major role in protecting water from 
pollution caused by adverse agricultural practices. The Directorate has about fifty staff 
working in five departments: Department on Water Management Inspection,  
Department 
on Water Protection, Department on Water Use, Department on Protection from Adverse 
Effects on Water and Department on Water Policy and International Projects. 
The Directorate for Agriculture is responsible for coordinating various ministry efforts on 
good agricultural practices. Since recently it has also been in charge of agri-environment 
related legislation. Protection of agricultural land from pollution by harmful substances makes 
also an important task of this unit. The Directorate also plays a key role in developing policies 
on direct payments for crop and livestock production and various aspects having a far 
reaching consequence for sustainable soil (nutrient) management.  
Policy development regarding rural areas and co-ordination of the EU SAPARD/IPARD 
program are the main tasks of the Directorate for Rural Development and SAPARD. This 
Directorate is also in charge of organic farming and agri-environment measures.  
 
MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, PHYSICAL PLANNING AND 
CONSTRUCTION 
The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction (MEPPPC) is 
responsible for legislative development, strategic planning, permitting, monitoring and 
inspection in the field of environmental protection.  It is in charge of protection of air, soil, 
climate change and ozone layer protection, coastal zone, sea, waste management and 
environmental impact assessments. The ministry is responsible for the overall policy and the 
administrative tasks regarding environmental protection, but its involvement in water 
protection policy is limited. However, as the main government organization responsible for 
environmental protection it is involved in various national steering committees, task forces 
and expert panels on water. It closely cooperates with MAFWG, Croatian Waters and other 
water-related organizations.  
 
CROATIAN WATERS 
Croatian Waters is a public company in charge of water management. It collects water-related 
taxes which make the main organization revenue.  Croatian Waters are responsible for the 
preparation of water management plans, maintenance of water-related infrastructure and 
protection from the detrimental effects of water. Besides, the organization deals with various 
water use and water pollution control issues and carries on permitting and inspection. 
Croatian Waters are also responsible for monitoring (data collection, processing and 
Page  27
 page 
27/31 
evaluation) of the quality of (primarily surface). It does not deal with marine water. Formally, 
Croatian Waters submit the yearly plans for approval to the MAFWG but in practice the 
Managing Board make autonomous decisions and creates policies. The organization has 
county offices which carry water management in the field. 
 
CROATIAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
The Croatian Environment Agency (CEA) is in charge of collecting and processing various 
gathered data on environment. It is also responsible for monitoring of environmental 
pollution, maintaining databases with environmental information and for providing the 
statistics needed for the reports on the national state of the environment. Since 2003, the CEA 
has been cooperating with the European Environment Agency (EEA) and submitting data to 
the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET). The 
organization is soon expected to become a full member of the EEA.  
 
CROATIAN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICE INSTITUTE 
The Croatian Agricultural Extension Service Institute (CAESI) is the main agricultural farm 
advisory service in Croatia. The organization is independent legal entity, but has to implement 
policy of the MAFWG. Currently the organization employs some 180 people and has regional 
offices in each county. The CAESI provides technical recommendations, instructions and 
practical examples of new technologies and management practices. It has also been active in 
publishing and production of various other extension materials. The rendered services are free 
of charge to all family farms. 
 
CROATIAN SOIL INSTITUTE 
The Croatian Soil Institute (CSL) performs a wide range of activities. It monitors the state of 
agricultural soils and assesses the degree of their pollution with undesirable, notably 
hazardous substances. The CSL also provides various expert advice services on soil, manure 
and fertilizer analysis, nutrient pollution control and integrated nutrient management. The 
organization has some fifteen staff and runs the laboratory for soil testing.   
 
UNIVERSITIES 
Both Faculties of Agriculture- in Osijek and Zagreb have departments dealing with various 
aspects of soil and water protection. This topic is also an integral part of their undergraduate 
and postgraduate curricula. There are several on-going research projects studying the 
relationship between agricultural production and soil and water pollution. Both faculties run 
own laboratories capable of performing various soil and water tests.

Technical requirements for materials 
 
For both manure basement and above ground manure storage with a tank for liquid manure 
and rainfall preliminary calculations and design have been conducted according to the 
following legal existing and in force laws, regulations and standards as follows: 
 
Technical regulations for concrete constructions (TPBK; NN 101/05) 
 
Standard HRN ENV 1991 for the calculations and loads basis 
 
Standard HRN ENV 1992 for designing concrete constructions 
 
Standard HRN EN 206-1 for specifications, production and compatibility of concrete 
 
Standard HRN ENV 13670-1 for construction process of concrete structures. 
 
Standard nHRN EN 10080-1 for steel for reinforcing concrete. 
 
According to listed regulations and standards, concrete to be used in described constructions 
has to be of minimum strength class C30/37 with minimum cement content of 300-320 
kg/m3, maximum water cement ratio of 0,6; exposure classes: XC4, XF3, XA1 (50 year life 
expectancy of the structure). Concrete has to be waterproof and if needed (according to 
estimated sulfate concentration) sulfate resistant cement has to be used.  Maximum aggregate 
size shall be 20 mm (otherwise known as 3 fractional concrete in Croatia). 
Testing, compaction and curing of concrete should be done following listed regulations and 
standards. 
Joints between upright walls and concrete slab must be constructed to ensure no leakage of 
manure and rainfall and to ensure requested durability. Sealing masses and sealing tapes are 
to be used. 
 
Polypropylene fibers may be added into concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete. 
Only fibers that comply with the existing standards and regulations in Croatia may be used. 
Use of such fibers helps prevents and reduces plastic cracking and improves surface durability 
but they are not a substitute for structural reinforcement only possible regular concrete 
properties enhancement. This is an option that should be looked into with much care and in 
details and in strict compliance with standards and manufacturers if considered for using. 
Regarding Croatia, this still is not such a common technology and is not being used as much 
as regular concrete in the most of the constructing performed. 
 
Reinforcement steel has to fulfill requirements listed earlier in this point. Reinforcement steel 
to be used is B500B Q (mesh reinforcement) and B500B R (bar reinforcement). 
 
Concrete slab must be designed in such manner to bear loads from machinery loading and 
unloading manure. 
 
Inclined wooden barrier described by the structure type 1 has to be properly impregnated with 
protection layer coating before installed in the construction. 
Sample of the type1 manure storage for 20 cows is given on the following figure.

Construction guidelines for monitoring wells 
Monitoring wells are usually constructed to observe conditions at defined or required 
locations. Locations are usually selected on the basis of known or expected hydrologic, 
geologic, and water quality conditions and the location of pollutant or contaminant sources.

30/31 
Monitoring wells frequently need to be located close to or within areas of pollution or 
contamination. 
 
Monitoring wells should be located in areas protected from flooding, if possible and should be 
located an adequate distance from buildings and other structures to allow access for well 
maintenance, modification, repair, and destruction. The annular space should be sealed from 
the top of the filter pack or monitoring zone to ground surface. If a permanent conductor 
casing is to be installed, the monitoring well borehole diameter should be at least 4 inches 
greater than the outside diameter of the conductor casing. The inner diameter of the 
permanent conductor casing should in turn be at least 4 inches greater than the outside 
diameter of the well casing. Sealing material should consist of neat cement, sand- cement, or 
bentonite clay. Sealing material should be selected based on required structural, handling, and 
sealing properties, and the chemical environment into which it is placed.  
The top of a monitoring well should be protected by a locking cover or equivalent level of 
protection to prevent unauthorized access and a casing should be fitted with a cap or "sanitary 
seal" to prevent surface water, pollutants, or contaminants from entering the well bore. A 
concrete base or pad should be constructed around the top of a monitoring well casing at 
ground surface and contact the annular seal. Protective casing serves to prevent accidental or 
intentional damage to a well. Protective casing normally consists of heavy gauge metallic pipe 
placed over the portion of the well casing that extends above ground surface. Special 
considerations that apply to monitoring well casing are: Casing Material, Multiple Screens, 
Bottom Plugs, Casing Installation.  
Monitoring well development, redevelopment, and reconditioning should be performed with 
care so as to prevent damage to the well and any strata surrounding the well that serve to 
restrict the movement of poor-quality water, pollutants, and contaminants.  
A
monitoring well or exploration hole subject to these requirements that is no longer useful, 
permanently inactive or "abandoned" must be properly destroyed to: (1) Ensure the quality of 
groundwater is protected, and, (2) Eliminate a possible physical hazard to humans and 
animals.
