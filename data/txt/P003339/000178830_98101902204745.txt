INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$16.7
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure of the Burma Railway Corporation (BRC). The
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the BRC for 20 years, including
4 years grace, with interest at 6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Burma is discussed in paragraphs 2-16 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed credit to the Union of
Burma for an Inland Water Transport Project (Report No. P 1277-BA). A
country data sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.        Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952 and of IDA in 1962.
Between 1956 and 1961, the Bank made three loans for transportation projects
totalling $33.1 million. All three projects were satisfactorily completed,
and the loans were fully disbursed by FY68. As of April 30, the amount
outstanding was US$8.6 million (Annex II). For a review of the Bank Group's
proposed strategy for lending in Burma, reference is made to paragraphs 18-20
of the President's Report of the same date on a proposed credit to the Union
of Burma for an Inland Water Transport Project.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
4.        Reference is made to paragraphs 21 to 26 of the President's Report
of the same date on a proposed credit to the Union of Burma for an Inland
Water Transport Project.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
5.        In recognition of the urgency to undertake the rehabilitation and
modernization of the railway and inland water transport sectors, the Govern-
ment submitted proposals for consideration by the Bank Group in September 1971.
Following the visit of an economic mission in the spring of 1972, and of a
project preparation mission in September 1972, two missions visited Burma in
January/February 1973 to appraise the projects. A report entitled "Appraisal
of a Third Railway Project" (No. 172-BA) is being circulated separately. A
summary of the credit and project is attached as Annex III.
6.        At the negotiations, held in Washington in April, 1973, the Govern-
ment of the Union of Burma was represented by V Chit Moung (Deputy Minister
of Planning and Finance), U Maung Maung Hla (Deputy Executive Director, Union
of Burma Bank), U Hla Maung (Director General, Planning Department), U Tun
Shein (Managing Director, Burma Railways Corp.), U Hla Win (Managing Director,
Inland Water Transport Corp.), U Kyaw Khine (Deputy General Manager, Burma
Railways Corp.) and U Ngwe Nyunt (Deputy General Manager, Inland Water
Transport Corp.).
Dw3CLLon of the Project
7.        The proposed project consists of the last two fiscal years, from
1974 through 1975 (and spillover to 1976), of the current four-year Invest-
ment Plan of the Burma Railways Corporation (BRC). The main purpose of the
project is to enable the BRC to rehabilitate and acquire diesel locomotives,
rolling stock and track, and to create adequate facilities for repairing
and maintaining rolling stock. The principal items included are equipment
for wnrksho-r3s and sheds; track renewals; procurement of 110 freight cars and
61 passenger cars, and t:he rehabilitation of rolling stock and diesel loco-
motives. 1The acquisition of 30 diesel locomotives, which is also part of
the project, wilt be financed by a French supplier's credit.   (For details
see Annex 1lT.)
8.        Thae BRrWr hihch would be responsible for the execution of the
project, is a state-owned corporation operating a 1,949 route-mile meter-
gauge system. There are tLen branch lines connected to the main trunk route
connecting the Port of Rangoon with Mandalay in the north.  While tech-
nicallv an autonomous entity, BR.C is controlled by the Government through
tlhe Mlnlstry o: Transpeot- and Communications.  For all practical purposes,
BRC functions as a department of the Government with the Managing Director
being responsible for day-to-day operations. The Managing Director is
assisted by a General Manager under whom there are departmental chiefs
responsible for traffic operations, civil engineering, mechanical engineer-
ing, maintenance, administration and accounting. The quality of management
is satisfactory and staff discipline is good.
9.        The BRC's four-year investment plan forms part of the current
national plan (1971/72-1974/75), and it involves a total expenditure of
US$66 million equivalent of which US$39.9 million represents the foreign
exchange component. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated



- 3 -
at US$44.2 million equivalent including a foreign exchange component of
US$30 million. The proposed IDA credit would cover US$16.7 million of the
foreign exchange costs. Of the remaining foreign exchange costs, US$12.5
million would be financed by a French Credit, signed in August 1972, for the
acquisition of 30 diesel locomotives, and a small balance of US$0.8 million
would be met from the Government's own resources for on-going operations.
10.       The financial results from BRC's operations in recent years have
been satisfactory, although they have to some extent been distorted through
equipment maintenance not being carried out at normal levels. Financial
statements for the five years to 1971/72 show that BRC generated from its
own resources K 307 million, and after providing for debt service and
working capital there remained K 229 million. Capital expenditures during
the period amounted to K 249 million.   Therefore, while BRC has not been a
net contributor to government revenues, it is clear that most of the BRC .
expenditure on capital account has been met by its own cash generation. BRC's
financial prospects are satisfactory. The forecast revenues are based on the
expected annual growth of 4.5 percent and 1.3 percent for freight and
passenger traffic respectively. No provision has been made for any increase
in rates and fares. During negotiations, agreement was reached that during
the period 1973/74 - 1975/76 operating expenses would not exceed 87 percent
of operating revenues, and would not exceed 85 percent thereafter. It was
also agreed that BRC would incur further debt only if net revenues were at
least 1.5 times debt service requirements.
11.       Procurement would be made through international competitive bidding
in conformity with the standard guidelines, except for certain replacement
and spare parts for locomotives, rail cars and rolling stock which are already
in service, estimated to cost about US$3.1 million equivalent. Components
for the new freight and passenger cars would be procured in knockdown condi-
tion for manufacture/assembly into complete units in railway workshops. BRC
has adequate capacity, experience and skills to undertake the work.
12.       The procurement and rehabilitation of diesel locomotives, freight
wagons and coaches will generate substantial benefits in the form of lower
maintenance costs. The rehabilitation and expansion of workshops will
improve the maintenance and availability of the locomotives. Altogether
the economic rate of return on the project is estimated at 16 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
13.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Union of Burma
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolu-
tion approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Article VIII of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment sets out the execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government and the BRC as a condition of effectiveness. The
provisions of the draft agreement conform to the normal pattern for credits
for transport projects.



-4-
14.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
15.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
