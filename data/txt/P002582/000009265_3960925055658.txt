WHITE  ULE PUMP SJHEM ES REHABILITATIlON PROJECT
(Cr. 1119-SU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the White Nile Pump Schemes
Rehabilitation Project in Sudan, for which Credit 11 19-SU in the amount of US$35 million was
approved on March 26, 1981. The credit was closed on December 31, 1987, one year behind
schedule. Only about 30% of the credit was disbursed. The last disbursement was on October
14, 1988. US$23.4 million of the Credit was canceled.
'Te PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the Eastern Africa
Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The Borrower has not submitted
Part II.
Preparation of this PCR was started in November of 1989, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
WHITE NILE PUMP SCLHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1119-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
ProjectQbiet iv es
1.      The Project was appraised at a time when the productivity of major irrigated areas was declining,
including the production of cotton, a major export crop. This contributed to a deteriorating balance of
payments situation. In order to address this problem, the Government wished to promote exports in order to
increase export revenue, and to increase overall productivity. One major policy intended to achieve these
objectives was the Export Action Program (EAP), which aimed to increase the volume of cotton production
for export by an average of seven percent a year through the eighties. The White Nile Project was one of
four Projects designed to support the EAP.
2.      The Project itself had three major objectives: (a) to increase crop yields, particularly for cotton,
and stabilize water supply on the White Nile pump schemes; (b) to improve the financial and economic
returns on the schemes and raise tenant incomes; and (c) to study possibilities for future investment programs.
The Project empioyed an integrated approach to assisting the pump schemes and provided for agricultural
machinery, road maintenance, workshops, fuel storage, motor vehicles, construction of offices, stores and
staff housing, technical assistance to strengthen management, as well as rehabilitation of pumps and irrigation
distribution systems. It was to be an interim measure to increase productivity on the schemes until
modernization could be effected.
EMiect rearation and Design
3.      The Bank appraisal mission reduced the scope of the Project as conceived by the identification and
preparation missions. Because the appraisal team projected that modernization of the schemes might occur
sooner than previous missions had forecast, it recommended a phased approach, the first of which would be a
smaller investment in rehabilitation, covering only a five year period. Previous to Project start-up, it
recommended forming the White Nile Agricultural Production Corporation (WNAPC) to manage the schemes
and to take responsibility for Project implementation. In addition, the Government transferred the
responsibility for irrigation operations from the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) to WNA 'IC, a major cause of
the project's failure.
Implementuation Experience
4.      The Project encountered serious difficulties. Some of these problems were project-specific while
some were caused by political instabilities and inappropriate macroeconomic conditions such as exchange rate,
trade and marketing regimes that discouraged cotton production. While all irrigation rehabilitation projects
faced similar problems, some produced better results due to better project management. The management of
WNAPC, however, was weak. As a result of its failure to adequately staff its irrigation engineering
department, the irrigation rehabilitation works were not implemented.
5.      By mid-1984, only about $2 million of the credit had been disbursed. The Bank and GOS
conducted a mid-term review to determine the future direction of the project. One major conclusion was that



- iv -
at the existing exchange rates, financial earnings from cotton would not cover financial costs, which were
very high given the state of technology and high production costs. It was decided that the prudent strategy to
adopt at the White Nile schemes was to: (a) maint?'n produc-tion while minimizing financial losses in the short
run, and (b) prepare the ground for further investment in the area over the longer run.
6.        The Project was redesigned in 1984 to refocus on canal rehabilitation. The responsibility for
irrigation was transferred to the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI), which would then be responsible for the
expanded canal rehabilitation component. The substantial building component was reduced by 91%.
Further, the Bank endorsed thie Government's proposal to transfer some smaller schemes from the public to
the private sector or cooperatives. In addition, the WNAPC agreed to reduce excess staff and to use
machinery, services/inputs (other than irrigation) on cotton crops only. Finally, the redesigned Project
included studies for further development of the White Nile Area. The revised Project required a
commitment of US$22.3 million from the Bank instead of the US$35 million appraised.
7.        The Credit was extended for a year, mainly to provide for a preparation study for modernization
of the White Nile schemes, and a study of alternaiive institutional arrangements. It also included provisions to
carry out a smail part of the canal rehabilitation component. Due to an overcommitment to other projects,
the MOI was unable to fully meet its responsibilities with respect to canal rehabilitation; the study of
cooperatives was completed, though no action was taken as the Bank deemed the strategies put forward as
unfeasible; finally, the modernization study was completed and was well received. However, no action was
taken on staff reduction or privatization.
!wRject Rslts
8.       The Project failed to achieve two of its objectives: (1) Crop yields were well belew those
predicted at appraisal and water supply on the pump schemes was never stabilized; and (2) Financial and
economic returns on the schemes were dismal. Only three project components were fully completed as
xppraised: the rehabilitation of pumps and engines, the modernization study, and the procurement of seven
motor graders for road maintenance. The most important component, canal rehabilitation, was not
undertaken until the Project was extended by a year, when some small measures were implemented.
Proiect Sustainability
9.       The Project failed to meet its objectives, therefore sustainability is not a question.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.      The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)   Macroeconomic policies and institutional reforms were central to the rehabilitation effort.
(1)  Where Government's commitment and public reaction to policy and institutional reforms are
uncertain, a pilot approach would have been advisable. The project could have focussed on a
limited number of schemes and tried out institutional reforms and new and cost-effective
technologies.
(c)   The appraisal mission overestimated WNAPC's technical capability to implement the irrigation
component. Supervision missions gave the matter urgent attention and recommended strengthening
of its capability. When this failed to happen, the decision was made to turn management over to



the MOI. But by that time, it was too late as the Ministry had become committed to too many
other projects.
(d)  The number of irrigation projects being implemented at the time of White Nile may have impeued
its successful implementation. As noted above, the MOI became overcommitted to these other
projects and could not fulfill even minor responsibilites at project end. In addition, one of the
state-owned civil works contractors was unable to meet its obligations in regard to canal
rehabilitation due to overcommitment.
(e)   Some type of accountability for parastatal managers should have been introduced. MDs of the
WNAPC were not committed to running an efficient and productive Corporation and there was
little incentive for them to do so. To improve management, the Corporation should keep adequate
records of production costs, production, labor productivity and irrigation performance on a scheme
by scheme basis.
(f)   Unavailability of local currency caused Project delays, and could have been prevented if the
Government had properly constituted the Steering Committee foreseen at appraisal. The Steering
Committee could also have contributed to a more successful Project by conducting annual reviews,
as laid out in the appraisal.
(g)  The Project calls into question the role of Government (and parastatals) in the schemes. Although
0os agrees with the recommendations of studies calling for privatization of some pump schemes,
it has not taken action.

2.       Macroeconomic Context. In the early 1980s, Sudan was facing a balance of payments
crisis. It had a large and growing deficit on current account and external payments arrears
accumulating to a level of about $1.2 billion in 1979. The crisis was largely the consequence of
inadequate economic management policies compounded by external factors, such as the sharply
increased cost of petroleum imports. At the same time, Sudan's exports declined, due mainly to the
reduction in yields and area of production of cotton, the chief export commodity.
3.       To tackle this crisis, the Government of Sudan (GOS) made significant policy changes to
re-establish financial equilibrium and restore the economy's development momentum. These included
(a) financial stabilization and IMF agreements; (b) export promotion and public investment programs;
(c) changes in public corporations; and (d) improvements in the management of external debt. The
Government's strategy was to concentrate on the completion of ongoing projects and to choose those
investments that would most quickly contribute to the growth of exports and domestic revenues. As
part of this strategy, the Government introduced several policies, including an Export Action Program
(EAP), which aimed to increase the volume of cotton production for export by an average of seven
percent a year through the eighties. Sorghum and groundnut production would be increased as well,
but to a lesser degree.
4.       Bank group lending during this period followed a comprehensive approach of supporting
agricultural and infrastructural investments to restore production capacity on the one hand, and
institutional and economic reforms on the other. The emphasis of the investment projects were in
areas that would help the enuntry generate increased export earnings to support the recovery effort.
The focus in the near term was on rehabilitation and increasing irrigation intensity in existing
irrigation schemes, which produced 95% of the cotton exports. At the same time, the Bank supported
sectoral reforms through the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program I (ARP I, Cr. 1000-SU), which was
implemented in conjunction with IMF programs.



-2 -
S.       Agriculture Sector Develogment Objectives. At the time of appraisal, agriculture was the
dominant sector in the economy and was viewed by the Government as the key to future growth and
development. However, the 1970s had witnessed a declining trend in the productivity of most major
irrigated areas. This decline was a result of several factors, including: an expansion of irrigated
areas at the expense of maintenance investment; poor decisions on crop choices (a policy of import
substitution which meant diversification out of cotton to other crops) aggravated by tax and price
policies; foreign exchange constraints which limited import of agricultural inputs; and weak
management of public sector corporations. In the White Nile area, these problems had led to a
decline in productivity resulting in reduced personal incomes and an outflow of population from the
area. It also contributed to a diversion of labor input from agriculture to livestock and urban
employment. The Government viewed a rapid expansion in agricultural output and exports as a way
to improve its balance of payment and debt service ratio. It embarked on a program to rehabilitate
irrigation schemes where most of the cotton was grown.
6.      The iritation subsecto was considered to have the most potential for increasing yields and
realizing the objectives of the EAP. The Agricultural Rehabilitation Program served as a basis for the
introduction of four further projects to support the EAP, all within the irrigation subsector. These
included a rehabilitation project for New Halfa (FY80), an engineering study followed by a
rehabilitation project for the Gezira (FY83), a rehabilitation project for the Blue Nile Pump Schemes
(FY82), and this project, a reh2bilitation of the White Nile Pump Schemes (FY80). All of these
irrigation sub-sector projects shared the short-term goal of rapidly increasing the output of export
crops (particularly cotton) for ten years or so. This increased output was expected to yield quick
returns in terms of foreign exchange earnings thereby helping to alleviate the balance of payments
problem. Medium-term objectives for the irrigation subsector were to modernize the pump schemes,
and to abandon the unremunerative schemes; and the long-term goal was to tap Sudan's under-utilized
hydro-power potentials to improve the financial viability of irrigation schemes. A study component,
designed to analyze how to meet the medium-term objective of modernizing the irrigation sub-sector,
was also included in the Project.
C. Proiect Qbiectives and Description
7.      PrQiect Qbjectiyv. The Project had three major objectives. The first was to increase crop
yields (particularly for cotton, the country's leading export crop) and stabilize water supply on the
pump schemes operated by the White Nile Agricultural Production Corporation (WNAPC). This
would be effected through rehabilitation of agricultural and pumping equipment in the schemes, and
where necessary replacement of existing machinery and equipment (keeping them in operation until a
full scale reorganization and modernization could be carried out), and through strengthening of
infrastructure, management and support facilities. The second objective was to improve the financial
and economic returns on the schemes and raise tenant incomes. The third objective was to address
longer term development needs of the area through detailed studies directed at future investment
programs.
8.      EMigQ   Cem 2gnents. The project was designed as an integrated approach to rehabilitating
irrigation schemes on the White Nile. It was to cover 174 ongoing pump irrigation schemes operated
by the White Nile Agricultural Production Corporation (WNAPC) along the White Nile south of
Khartoum. Total Project base costs were given as US$38.1 million. Project components included:



- 3 -
(a)   Rehabilitation of pumpsets and pumphouses (US$5.4 million);
(b) Rehabilitation of irrigation distuibution systems (US$4.6 million);
(c)   Provision of agricultural machinery, equipment, and spare parts (US$6.1 million);
(d)   Establishment of workshops and fuel stor'    angements (US$3.5 million);
(e)   Provision of road maintenance equipment (US$1.2 million);
(f)   Provision of motor vehicles (US$2.3 million);
(g)  Installation of a te6ecommunication network (US$0.5 million);
(h)   Constructiun of buildings for offices, stores and staff hnusing (US$8.0 million);
(i)   Measures to strengthen management, administration, maintenance, and training
capability of WNAPC (US$2.1 million);
()   Studies for further development of the White Nile area and preparation of a follow-
up project (US$2.3 million);
(k)   Supply of incremental annual farm inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and
sacks (US$2.1 million).
D. Project Design and Organization
9.       A Joint FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program team identified and prepared the Project.
They anticipated that it would be at least 10 years before a full-scale program of reorganization and
modernization could be undertaken on the White Nile schemes. In order to increase productivity on
the schemes (which had greatly deteriorated since they were nationalized in the late 1960s) until such
time that a full-scale reorganization could take place, they recommended an interim program that
would help raise crc . utput, increase tenants' incomes and reduce subsidies to the Corporations
managing the schemw. However, the Bank mission that appraised the Project recommended a change
in design. It projected that modernization of the schemes may begin sooner than the 10-year time
period assumed by the preparation mission and therefore recommended a smaller investment in
rehabilitation, covering only the ensuing five years. It envisioned that this would be followed by
several projects focussed on modernization of the schemes.
10.      The Project was carefully prepared, and formed part of an overall Bank plan for the
irrigation sub-sector. However, in retrospect, the timing of the investment is debatable. One
criticism is that the project may have been premature, and that reforms in pricing and marketing and
production relationships should have preceded investments in the irrigation schemes. The other side
of the argument, however, is that at that time, there was an urgent need to increase agricultural
production. It was also expected that policy reforms would be carried out hand in hand with the
rehabilitation. However, the appraisal mission could not have foreseen the political instability and the



lack of Government commitment that affected the materialization of these reforms. When the
supporting policy changes did not take place, the project could not stand on its own. Given the risk,
the comprehensive scope and size of the project were inappropriate. A pilot approach of modernizing
a few schemes vould have been advisable, but at the time, the Bank was convinced that an integrated
project was the best approach to help the country's economic recovery.
11.      Policy reforms were an important part of the project, some of which were conditions for
the project's approval. These included important economic reforms designed to provide incentives to
cotton production. 1/ The project preparation mission also considered strengthening of the
management and organization of the schemes to be crucial for attaining Project objectives.
Consequently, they recommended restructuring of the overly centalized Public Agricultural
Production Corporation (PAPC). The GOS abolished the PAPC and replaced it with more
autonomous agricultural entities, including the WNAPC.
12.      The roles and responsibilities of the institutions responsible for the project were clear.
However, the appraisal mission and the Government were overly optimistic in the institution
strengthening that could be achieved within the project period. The project was to help WNAPC
build up its own irrigation engineering department to take over irrigation operations from the Ministry
of Irrigation (MOI). (This was done to avoid difficulties in coordinating responsibilities of the MOI
and the Corporation.) However, the time frame was unrealistic and the responsibilities were later
transferred back to MOI.
13.      Another design flaw was that the project did not emphasize agricultural technology
transfers that could raise yields and cut costs. More attention could have been paid during appraisal
and supervision to high yielding cotton varieties and cost-effective technologies.
E. Proiect Implementation
14.      The Project encountered serious difficulties. Some of these problems were project-speciflc
while some were caused by political instabilities and inappropriate macroeconomic conditions such as
exchange rate, trade and marketing regimes that discouraged cotton production. While all irrigation
rehabilitation projects faced similar problems, some produced better results due to better project
management. The management of WNAPC, however, was weak. The frequent absence of the
Managing Director and higher officials meant delays in decision making. Further, mismanagement of
fuel resources led to a diversion of fuel away from the schemes and the unavailability of fuel at the
proper pumping times led to lower crop production. The weakness of WNAPC management was
related to: (a) poor organization; (b) burdens due to transfer of irrigation operation and management
to WNAPC; (c) excess unskilled staff on the payroll; and (d) the wide dispersion of the many small
schemes. As a result of WNAPC's failure to adequately staff its irrigation engineering department,
the main project component, canal rehabilitation, was not carried out as designed (para. 22 (a)).
/ For *xampl, the Govermnment had instituted a Financial Stabilization Program which included
devaluation of the Sudanese pound; further, it entered into an Extended Fund Facility agreement with the
IMF that triggered a number of policy reforms including (1) abolition of the export duty on cotton, (2)
offering a more attractive exchange rate for cotton exports and (3) some measures to build into the tax
nd profit sharing systems an element of bias in favor of cotton. In addition, it had redesigned its
agricultural policies with export promotion as an important goal.



-5-
15.     Another problem was the failure of the GOS to provide operating budgets needed by the
Project. Many field and project activities that were essential to raising crop yields and production
could not take place. The fuel shortage, which affected the pumping and thus the supply of irrigation
water, was partly attributed to inadequate operating budgets. The appraisal mission had foreseen this
problem and sought to address this through the Annual Work Program (AWP). The AWP was to be
reviewed by a stee-ring committee of senior level government officials before it was presented to the
Bank, and it vwas thought that this would provide the WNAPC with better access to funds from
banking institutions and adequate foreign exchange. However, the steering committee was never
properly constituted since no senior-ranking members of the MOFEP were included; further, conflicts
between the MOFEP and the Bank of Sudan (BOS) negatively affected decision making.
16.      The financial situation of the WNAPC contiinued to deteriorate over the course of the
Project because of high operating costs (the WNAPC insisted on maintaining a large, clearly non-
productive staff); low land and water charges (true cost recovery was never instituted); and
outstanding tenant debts. At the same time, the international price of cotton declined and an
overvalued exchange rate yielded inadequate financial returns in local currency.
17.      In October 1983, the Government called for a national conference in Kosti, the WNAPC
headquarters. The conference prescribed a comprehensive package for the pump schemes reform,
including partial privatization, continuation of the rehabilitation program, installation of self-
administration committees to take over the management function, reduction and ultimately elimination
of surplus labor. However, attempts at economic and institutional reform were met with stiff
resistance from the pressure groups such as tenants and labor unions and local political organizations
and none of the recommended measures could be implemented.
18.     By mid-1984, only about $2 million of the credit had been disbursed. The Bank and GOS
conducted a mid-term review to determine the future direction of the project. One major conclusion
was that at the existing exchange rates, financial earnings from cotton would not cover financial costs,
which were very high given the state of technology. Given (a) high production costs and consequent
financial losses, (b) the uncertainty regarding WNAPC's future role, and (c) the positive production
response from provision of essential inputs, it was decided that the prudent strategy to adopt over the
short term at the White Nile schemes was to: (a) maintain production while minimizing financial
losses in the short run, and (b) prepare the ground for further investment in the area over the longer
run.
19.       The Project was redesigned in 1984 to refocus on canal rehabilitation. The responsibility
for irrigation was transferred back to MOI, which would then be responsible for the expanded canal
rehabilitation component. The building component was reduced by 91% to include only a few
buildings at the major site of Kosti and for extension work (which the WNAPC added after the
Project began). Further, the Bank endorsed the Government's proposal to transfer some smaller
schemes from the public to the private sector or cooperatives. In addition, the WNAPC agreed to
reduce excess staff and to use machinery, services/inputs (other than irrigation) on cotton crops only.
Finally, the redesigned Project included studies for further development of the White Nile Area. The
revised Project required a commitment of US$22.3 million from the Bank instead of the US$35
million appraised.

20.      Again, weak Project management led to slow implementation of Project components; in
particular, the MOI, which under Project redesign now had responsibility for three components, was
slow to implement its rehabilitation of canals due to the fact that it was constrained by technical
manpower capacity. It refused to hire consultants, even though this was required by covenant and
adequate funds were included. (The MOI claimed that its resources and capabilities were adequate
for the task). In fact, however, the MOI was stretched to capacity trying to meet its commitments on
other projects, and therefore was not able to fulfill the requirements of Project redesign. The
WNAPC became the White Nile Agricultural Schemes Administration (WNASA) but the organization
was unchanged. It failed to carry out Bank recommendations to control costs and especially to cut its
excessive staff and to privatize some of the rzhemes, both socially and politically difficult taskrs.
21.      The project closing date was extended by a year to December 31, 1987, mainly to complete
the study components. Technical Assistance and support were therefore provided for: (a) a study of
alternative institutional arrangements and (b) the preparation study for modernization of the White
Nile schemes. The extension was also meant to protect existing Project investments that could be
completed within a year and would be viable regardless of eventual institutional arrangements.
22.      Variances between planned and actual -esults. In the end, only three components were
fully completed as appraised: (a) seven motor graders were procured for road maintenance, (b) the
rehabilitation of irrigation pumps and engines (some of them were procured under ARP I) was
completed slightly above appraisal projections and (c) the modernization study was completed. The
remaining components were altered by Project redesign in 1984 and by conditionalities of the
extension of the Credit in 1986:
(a)   The most important component of the project, canal rehabilitation, was not undertaken until
the Project was extended by a year, when some measures were implemented for banks
formation, desiltation and clearance of many intake channels. This extraordinarily long
delay contributed to lower productivity and impeded the potential created by the
pump/engine rehabilitation. Further, the earthworks aspect of the component was to be
undertaken by a state corporation which was unable to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely
manner because it was overcommitted to other Bank irrigation projects.
(b)   Provision for agricultural machinery and equipment was scaled down midway through the
Project. The 11th Bank Supervision mission noted that procurements for agricultural
machinery, spares requirements, vehicles and ginnery spares under the Credit and ARP I
had substantially enhanced WNAPC's physical resources, and though below appraisal
objectives were sufficient for the needs of the redesigned project of 1984.
(c)   Project redesign also cut the workshops and fuel storage component by two-thirds; regional
workshops were not built and all major tractor repairs were centered at Kosti and Duiem,
which lacked tools and equipment, skilled labor and had a shortage of spare parts (a central
workshop was never constructed at Kosti).
(d)   Project redesign was also responsible for a 91% reduction in the building component; in
the end, the Project erected only one central store at Kosti and 27 small stores in the
Blocks, as well as 7 prefabricated houses.



(e)   Technical assistance was largely implemented but the relative success of this component is
doubtful (para. 29).
F. Project Results
23.      Project Objectives. The Project failed to achieve two of its three stated objectives: (a) As
a result of the problems noted above, as well as drought, crop yields were well below those predicted
at appraisal and during Project redesign (see Part III, table 6A). Further, the water supply on the
pump schemes was never stabilized. In fact, the final supervision report noted, "GOS's flip-flopping
over the past seven years on who should control irrigation has resulted in serious water supply
problems." (b) Financial and economic returns on the schemes were dismal. The economic rate of
return is estimated to be zero or negative since cotton production did not increase. By Project
midpoint, the WNAPC was bankrupt and was a huge drain on the national economy due to the large
loans that the Corporation took out from the BOS. The Corporation continuously refused to introduce
any cost reduction measures such as eliminating excess staff. By Project end, WNAPC indebtedness
to the BOS had risen to about LSd 115 million. Returns to tenants were also low. Continual
excessive costs and low production on the schemes meant that tenant debt (money owed to the
WNAPC by farmers for advances for farm inputs) rose to over LSd 58 million. However, food
production, particularly wheat, increased and helped ease the food shortages during the drought and
famine of 1984/85. (c) Project technical assistance provided a well-prepared modernization study
which can be used for design of future investment programs. At Project close, only US$10.8 million
had been disbursed, less than half of that anticipated at Project redesign, and about 30% of the
appraisal estimate.
G. Projet Sustainability
24.      Studies have shown that alternative institutional arrangements are needed to make the
schemes tinancially sustainable, with a division of responsibilities among Government agencies,
farmers groups and the private sector. The Bank would continue discussions with GOS on this matter
as part of the dialogue on the future of state enterprises. Appropriate macroeconomic conditions also
need to be in place. These include exchange rate, and trade and marketing regimes that would give
adequate production incentives.
H. Bank Performance
25.       The Bank (working with the FAO) carefully identified and prepared the Project. Through
appraisal, the Project designers wished to prepare an integrated Project that would address agricultural
as well as irrigation needs of the White Nile area. The large geographic dispersion of the White Nile
shemes was a cause for concern at the early stages of project preparation but the Bank decided to
include the entire area of the Corporation. The many widely scattered schemes contributed to the
implementation problems. The transfer of irrigation responsibilities to a newly created unit was also a
mistake. Bank supervision teams attempted to deal with the institutional problems, which brought on
the GOS decision to transfer the responsibilities back to MOI. They attempted to address these
problems through frequent supervision missions (averaging one every six months) and through
discussions with both Corporation and GOS officials. The Bank also addressed the weakness of the
WNAPC financial and operational management as well as problems related to local funding
availability. When it became clear that the Project needed to be redesigned, the Bank helped GOS



redesign and refocus project activities, and canceled about a third of credit. Supervision teamns were
technically strong with good staff continuity. In fact, one senior irrigation engineer was present on
all 14 missions.
I. Borrower Performn
26.      The main problem encountered was poor management at the senior project management
level. Three Managing Directors were appointed throughout the Project (and a fourth took over at
the close of the project). They were unable to forge working relationships with the MOFEP or the
MOI (WNAPC needed the technical expertise of the MOI in order to implement the irrigation
component of the Project). Further, management of the WNAPC was not committed to cost control
(as noted above, the Corporation insisted on maintaining an excess staff of unskilled workers, and
fuel leakage was widespread). Finally, the Corporation had difficulty in carrying out the advice of
supervision missions that repeatedly urged: (a) drastic improvements in WNAPC financial and
operational management; (b) transfer of irrigation operations to MOI; and (c) progressive privatization
of WNAPC activities.
27.      GOS attempted to confront some of these difficulties by convening a conference in 1983
that outlined three major changes, including transfer of irrigation operations to MOI, but did not
implement them in a timely manner. Later, it dissolved the WNAPC in June, 1986. A new Board
was appointed, but much of the WNAPC remained as before, under the new name WNASA. The
final supervision report notes, "Government has taken a decision in principle to wind up WNAPC but
has been unable to figure out how to implement it," due to opposing vested interests and the need to
further define alternative production arrangements. In addition to these problems, political upheaval
and changes in the constitution of relevant ministries (the Ministries of Irrigation and Agriculture
were merged, then separated again) further handicapped the Project.
J. Project Relationship
28.      Overall, Bank relations with the Borrower remain positive. However, the Bank did
experience some stress in relations with the ministries involved with the Project (the MOA, MOI,
MOFEP) at various times during implementation, and with the WNAPC.
K. Consulting Services
29.      According to supervision missions, technical assistance improved the Corporation's
capabilities in analysis and preparation of work programs, analysis of accounts and handling of
procurement of goods and implementation of pump/engine rehabilitation. However, the I Ith
supervision mission notes, "...On the other hand, the impact of technical assistance has not been
visible in the areas of production and cost management." This was mainly due to the hostility of the
WNAPC towards technical assistance which was evidenced by the Corporation's delay in appointing
technical assistance to the Planning and Development Unit. The Corporation's hostility to technical
assistance meant that experts were given purely advisory rather than operational responsibility. The
consultants hired to conduct studies regarding (a) the feasibility of cooperatives, and (b)
modernization of the White Nile schemes, performed their work in a proper and timely manner. The
modernization study was particularly well-received.



-9-
L, Project Documentation and Data
30.      The Development Credit and Project Agreements for Credit 11 19-SU were well prepared.
The Staff Appraisal Report was complete and provided a useful framework for project
implementation. Regarding data for the PCR, data related to crop production and yields was readily
available, though procurement data was harder to sift out.
M. Lessons Learned
31.      The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)   Macroeconomic policies and institutional reforms were central to the rehabilitation effort.
(b)  Where Government's commitment and public reaction to policy and institutional reforms
are uncertain, a pilot approach would have been advisable. The project could have
focussed on a limited number of schemes and tried out institutional reforms and new and
cost-effective technologies.
(c)   The appraisal mission overestimated WNAPC's technical capability to implement the
irrigation component. Supervision missions gave the matter urgent attention and
recommended strengthening of its capability. When this failed to happen, the decision was
made to turn management over to the MOI. But by that time, it was too late as the
Ministry had become committed to too many other projects.
(d)  The number of irrigation projects being implemented at the time of White Nile may have
impeded its successful implementation. As noted above, the MOI became overcommitted
to these other projects and could not fulfill even minor responsibilities at project end. In
addition, one of the state-owned civil works contractors was unable to meet its obligations
in regard to canal rehabilitation due to overcommitment.
(e)   Some type of accountability for parastatal managers should have been introduced.
Managing Directors of the WNAPC were not committed to running an efficient and
productive Corporation and there was little incentive for them to do so. To improve
management, the Corporation should keep adequate records of production costs,
production, labor productivity and irrigation performance on a scheme by scheme basis.
(f)   Unavailability of local currency caused Project delays, and could have been prevented if
the Government had properly constituted the Steering Committee foreseen at appraisal. The
Steering Committee could also have contributed to a more successful Project by conducting
annual reviews, as laid out in the appraisal.
(g)  The Project calls into question the role of Government (and parastatals) in the schemes.
Although GOS agrees with the recommendations of studies calling for privatization of some
pump schemes, it has not taken action.
