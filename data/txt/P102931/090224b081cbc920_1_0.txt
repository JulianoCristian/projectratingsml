                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government in achieving a sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of service
                         standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project management
                         process; a regulatory framework for all of MOPW#s sectors of responsibility that increases consumer confidence in infrastructure service provision; and the legal and
                         organizational separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and regulation of infrastructure provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The loan has seen an increased pace of project implementation and several long term consultancies under the modernization program were launched during 2012. The one year
                         extension of the loan approved on January 2014 plus some pending changes in the procurement process are expected to be key factors to achieve the project development
                         objectives.
