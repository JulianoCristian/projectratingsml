F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government in achieving a
sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of service
standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote
competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project management process; a

                                                 v
regulatory framework for all of MOPW’s sectors of responsibility that increases
consumer confidence in infrastructure service provision; and the legal and organizational
separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and regulation of infrastructure
provision.

Some of the original PDOs and intermediate indicators were found difficult or impossible
to measure. Thus in 2009 the Borrower and the Bank agreed to a revised set of indicators.
(See Section 1.3 of the ICR) The new indicators were reflected in the Aide Memoire
dated November 20, 2009 and, although they were never formally changed, they became
the framework on which the project was monitored. The information below is based on
the agreed revised indicators.

                Fully achieved. This component, one of the main linchpins of the project, has helped
                to successfully establish a new paradigm in MOPW’s planning, introducing a new
                methodology that integrates regional needs and captures the synergies of different
                projects within a development program. Several consulting contracts contributed to
    Comments
                develop the methodology and apply it to different programs (e.g. City Ports, Meterx,
     (incl. %
                City Plans, and Systems of Territorial Information). By 2011 thirteen Regional
  achievement)
                Infrastructure Plans and Hydrological Management Plans were developed and
                approved. By 2013 the new methodology was fully mainstreamed and 99% of the
                investments included in the 2014 budget come from regional plans developed with the
                new methodology.

H. Restructuring (if any)
By mid-2012 the Borrower requested and the Bank agreed to a one- year extension of the
loan with a new closing date of January 31 2014. The objective of the extension was to
allow further disbursements on long-term consultancies financed under the loan and also
included a few changes in the procurement rules and the implementation of Anti-
corruption Guidelines as described below.

The Procurement and Consultant Guidelines were updated to reflect the versions dated
January 2011, which allows the use of framework agreements, known as “Convenios
Marcos” in Chile, for the procurement of goods, works and non-consultant services. In
addition, the Bank agreed to raise the maximum limits for using ChileCompra for
consultant services, from US$100,000 to US$300,000. In addition, the definition of
“Convenios Marco” was amended to include non-consultant services. Finally the Anti-
corruption Guidelines dated October 15, 2006 and revised in January 2011 was to apply
to the Project to be consistent with the updated version of the Procurement and
Consultant Guidelines.

1    Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
In the early 1990s, the Government of Chile took stock of its infrastructure needs and
estimated its infrastructure deficit at US$11 billion with additional losses due to lack of
competitiveness of US$1.7 billion annually. 1 In determining how to respond to this need
for massive investments and significant improvements in service delivery, the
Government also recognized that the public sector did not have the resources to carry out
the major works required, nor could it commit its budgetary resources exclusively to
infrastructure investments given the country's social investment needs. To help face this
challenge, the Government first called on the private sector to take part in the building,
maintenance and operation of major road works. In the years since its inception, the
concession program has expanded both in terms of sectors and design. Chile had at the
time of appraisal (and still has) what may be the world's most extensive concession
program encompassing roads, ports, railroads, bridges, tunnels, reservoirs, jails and
canals. The Ministry of Public Works' (MOPW) concessions portfolio-including roads
and highways, bridges, airports, dams, canals, prisons, and other public edifices-has
risen in real terms from about 450 billion pesos in 1995 to over 1 trillion pesos in 2005 .
More strikingly, the share of private sector participation in investments had increased
from 9 percent to 65 percent over the course of the 1995-2005 decade.
In addition to the growing concessions program, at the time previous to project appraisal
the Government of Chile had announced a significant expansion in the public financing
of infrastructure. The intent was to provide Chile's regions and export products with
greater access to markets and to further improve the levels of basic services for Chilean
consumers. The administration recognized that both its growing public investment and
concession program would require greater attention in terms of planning, contract design,
project management and oversight in order for them to maximize their potential as
contributors to higher growth levels.

The Chilean administration had identified specific constraints to the operational and
institutional structure of the MOPW that it believed had to be addressed in order for Chile
to reach new level of efficiency and accountability in infrastructure investment. Those
constraints included:


Planning:



1
 Sectors covered by Ministry of Public Works include transport assets such as inter-urban roads, urban
roads, highways, bridges, and airports; water resource infrastructure such as dams, storm drainage systems,
and canals; rural infrastructure such as small water systems, ferry landings, and fishing ports; and public
buildings such as jails, hospitals, and schools. Of transport, water resource and public building contracts,
only ports are concessioned and monitored by a separate agency. There are separate regulatory agencies
for privatized utilities such as water supply, telecommunications and energy

                                                     1
    •   Lack of medium and long-term planning with an integrated geographic
        perspective oriented to the competitiveness of Chile's productive sectors.
    •   Low level of interaction with other relevant stakeholders in infrastructure sector
        and a lack of societal or consumer voice in project planning.
    •   Investment programs which are contract-driven rather than integrated along a
        supply chain, leading to coordination difficulties and inefficient expenditures.

Standards, Contracts and Competition:
   • Lack of explicit service standards embedded in concessions or public works
       due to an historic focus on input-driven rather than performance-based
       contracts.
   • Uneven levels of competition during bidding processes for either concessions
       or public works exacerbated by lack of information correlating outcomes to
       contract size, structure, design elements or bidding procedures

Project Management:
   • Low levels of accountability related to project outcomes due to an atomized
       approach to project management with different individuals responsible for each
       stage of project development.
   • Poor availability of information about project costs, contract management or
       design and construction issues.

Oversight and Regulation:
   • Institutional inability to provide effective oversight of contracts and concessions
       according to agree upon levels of service, let alone cost elements.
   • Lack of ability to consider consumer concerns or even to assure public access
       to information in the oversight of services.

Organizational Reform:
   • An organizational structure that does not provide for clear separation of roles
       and responsibilities among the four major areas of activities-planning,
       contract design, project management and regulation.

Measures to address these challenges made up the core components of the Institutional
Strengthening Program of the Ministry of Public Works. The Government of Chile
requested that this reform initiative be supported with a Bank Development Policy Loan
(DPL) and, the subject of this report, a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). 2 The DPL 3
intended to achieve explicit short term outputs and defined a subsequent series of tasks
that would require several years to complete and would be implemented under the TAL.
Under the DPL the following tasks were undertaken: (i) completion of competitiveness

plans for key clusters; (ii) development of sample performance standards for high and
low volume roads, for both concessions and public works contracts, and (b) review of
bidding processes and recommendations on new procedures; (iii) completion of design
for regulatory accounting system; and (iv) determination of standards to be regulated for
roads and one other sector.

Bank's involvement in this initiative was sought to leverage the Bank's experience in
logistics and territorial planning, in the design and execution of public-private contracts,
in project management and in the development of regulatory frameworks for
infrastructure. In addition, the Bank offered a comparative advantage in its ability to draw
upon global knowledge, sustain a policy dialogue, and exploit synergies with other
operations and technical support to Chile including, but not limited to, the Infrastructure
for Territorial Development Project, the TranSantiago Urban Transport DPL and TAL,
and the fee-for-service technical assistance on the valuation of contingent liabilities in
infrastructure - see Annex 9 for a complete list of projects. Finally, both the Ministry of
Finance and the MOPW were attracted by the synergies that could be gained from having
both a DPL and a TAL to finance the key components of Institutional Strengthening
Program. The thematic and substantive linkages of the two projects were expected to
provide an effective framework for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the
reform program.


1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Project Development Objective was to assist the Government in achieving a
sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of service
standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote
competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project management process;
a regulatory framework for all of MOPW's sectors of responsibility that increases
consumer confidence in infrastructure service provision; and the legal and
organizational separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and
regulation of infrastructure provision.

Output and Outcome Indicators for monitoring the progress of the objectives centered on:
(a) increased return of infrastructure projects due to the new planning methodology; (b)
greater competition in bidding supported by fair risk-sharing arrangements embedded in
contracts and consumer responsive service targets; (c) greater responsiveness to
consumer concerns related to the levels of service; and greater oversight of performance
by public sector service providers as well as concessionaires; (d) reduction in variance
between values established at contract signature and final values at contract execution;
and (e) normative and organizational structure that provides clear separation and
definition of roles and responsibilities for planning, contracting, works execution and
oversight. The methodology for calculating the baseline and subsequent indicators would
be updated to reflect the availability and reliability of data as well as the most appropriate
approach for monitoring of change. The baseline for each indicator was to be determined
during the first four months of the project after effectiveness. The project would also

monitor progress towards the expected outcomes through the medium-term indicators for
each of the components as seen in the next paragraph.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
    Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO remained unchanged during the life of the project. With respect to the key
indicators, they were found to be difficult to measure and, in some cases, impossible to
establish a strong causality between project and outcome. In May 2009 the PIU and the
Bank agreed on a revised set of indicators which were included in the Aide Memoire
dated November 20, 2009. Although the changes, summarized in the table below, were
never formalized, the new agreed indicators were the ones used by MOPW and this ICR
to assess the achievements under the project. 4

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The immediate beneficiary of the project would be the MOPW and its ability to respond
more effectively to the needs of the users of public infrastructure. The main beneficiary
of the project is the Chilean population through the design and implementation of
projects focusing on regional development and equity, a more efficient use of private
capital in providing public services, and a strong focus on user satisfaction. Ultimately,
those benefits are expected to stimulate economic activities and spread the benefits of the
project to the entire population in Chile. In addition, improvement of efficiency of public
works management would save public expenditures, which leads to benefits to all
taxpayers.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The operation had five components, four of which address the core aspects of MOPW's
business activities: planning; setting standards for contracts, and conducting bids;
managing projects; and regulating or overseeing ("la fiscalización de") both concessions
and public works. A fifth component (Organizational Reform) was to bring coherence to
the program through the development of a legal and organizational structure that defined
the expected new roles and responsibilities of the MOPW. Each corresponding
component as described in the Loan Agreement is presented below. Section II of the
PAD provides a more detailed description of the project.

1.6 Revised Components
The project components remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.


1.7 Other significant changes
By mid-2012 the Borrower requested and the Bank agreed to a one- year extension of the
loan with a new closing date of January 31st, 2014. The objective of the extension was to
allow further disbursements on long-term consultancies financed under the loan and to
include changes in the procurement rules and the implementation of Anti-Corruption
Guidelines as described below.

The Procurement and Consultant Guidelines were updated to reflect the versions dated
January 2011, which allows the use of framework agreements, known as “Convenios
Marcos” in Chile, for the procurement of goods, works and non-consultant services. In
addition, the Bank agreed to raise the maximum limits for using ChileCompra for
consultant services, from US$100,000 to US$300,000. In addition, the definition of
“Convenios Marco” was amended to include non-consultant services. Finally the Anti-
Corruption Guidelines dated October 15, 2006 and revised in January 2011 was to apply
to the Project to be consistent with the updated version of the Procurement and
Consultant Guidelines.


2   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR finds the quality at entry as moderately satisfactory, since:

Project design was in line with the main pillars of the Bank’s strategy for Chile. By
supporting the implementation of the Government's Institutional Strengthening Program,
the TAL was in line with the goals and strategic approach set out in the joint IBRD-IFC
Country Partnership Strategy (Report No 38691-CL). The objective of the CPS was to
support Chile's efforts to converge with OECD income levels and living standards by
(i) accelerating growth and (ii) building a more equitable society. The Bank Group
strategy was based on the maintenance of close engagement with the authorities, which
                                            8
in recent had yielded important results in support of key Government programs and
through flexible, timely support that helped to advance Chile's development vision

A strong policy dialogue and analytical underpinning contributed to a sound project
design. The objectives and actions of the project were the result of more than a year of
work at MOPW and from consultations with relevant external stakeholders. The effort
was coordinated by a multidisciplinary team composed of MOPW staff with specific
responsibilities for each technical area of reform. That team identified the main
shortcomings of the MOPW and developed the proposals for their improvement. The
Bank supported the work of these teams with technical and regulatory advice since the
early stages of the reform’s inception. The result was a very comprehensive and detailed
set of objectives and tasks that provided an excellent blueprint for a complex institutional
reform.

The choice of lending instruments contributed to project continuity. The TAL was
presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors together with the DPL. The Ministry of
Finance and the MOPW, as already mentioned, were attracted by the synergies that could
be gained from having both loans to finance several of their key initiatives. First, because
the thematic and substantive linkage of the two projects was expected to provide an
effective framework for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Ministry’s
reform program for a period long enough that exceeded one administration. Second, by
having both a DPL and TAL, the political profile of the Bank-financed projects increased
and made possible a contingent role of the Bank as an honest broker between the
Ministries of Finance and Public Works when the reform suffered from delays during
implementation.

The quality at entry would have deserved a satisfactory rating if it had included a more
adequate results framework. Some of the originally proposed PDO and intermediate
indicators were difficult to measure and unrealistic in terms of timing. As shown in
Section 1.3 preceding and discussed in more detail in section 2.3 below, some of the
indicators had to be revised to make them more precise, measurable and in some cases,
achievable within the time frame of the project.


2.2 Implementation
The project was approved by the Bank's Board on June 14th, 2007 and it became
effective on February 27, 2008. Implementation progressed steadily throughout the life
of the project, albeit at different pace during different periods. In particular, internal
resistance to the modernization program, changes in government administrations and
staff directly involved with project implementation, at times lack of adequate funding,
and poor disbursement rates that jeopardized Bank involvement, contributed to slower




                                             9
project implementation. 5 However, in spite of its rocky beginnings, these problems were
eventually overcome and the modernization program, although a work still in progress,
has succeeded in bringing profound changes to MOPW’s view of its role in a world in
which users have a stronger voice and increasing demands. The following paragraphs
summarize the most salient aspects of the implementation process.

Resistance to change. The launching of the project by its original champion (minister
Bitar during the first Bachelet administration) was immediately faced with strong
opposition from MOPW’s staff. Unions interpreted the proposed reforms as implying
privatizations and the redundancy of some services. Senior management within MOPW
realized that the reform principles were not properly communicated and slowed down
implementation. The impasse allowed further work with the unions to convey the
message that the objective of the reform was to improve the efficiency of public spending
and that no redundancies were being considered. Even when the issue of potential
redundancies was put to rest, there was (and, with lesser strength still is) some
institutional inertia to change the vision from a provider of hard infrastructure to a
provider of high quality infrastructure services in those remaining few areas that are still
not fully mainstreamed. Team leaders have been key in involving MOPW senior and
junior staff (both in Santiago, where the headquarters of the MOPW are located and in all
the country’s Regions) in the modernization process. They have fostered implementation
of the reform by organizing trainings, strengthening the dialogue and building
coordination stages among areas that had traditionally worked somewhat in isolation in
order to bring everybody on board of the institutional changes.

Changes in administrations and staff. During the first two years of project
implementation the high rate of turnover of PIU’s coordinators considerably slowed
down progress in the modernization program. Since appraisal to late 2009 the project had
four coordinators, an average of one every six months. Subsequently, the upcoming
elections and expected change of the administration in March 2010 coupled with a
change in priorities to focus on a stimulus package to increase economic activity,
contributed to further delays. The elections brought about a change in the coalition in
power (the new one being from the center-right) after more than 20 years of a center-left
coalition and the new government was faced immediately with the devastating
earthquake that hit Chile in February, 2010. After the first few months of the new
administration, the Modernization Program received a strong endorsement. The tools
developed and implemented by the Program were tested, fully utilized and proved
effective in the emergency reconstruction projects that followed the February earthquake,
a fact that contributed to the renewed strong Government support of the program. The
MOPW undertook several actions to increase the implementation pace of the
modernization efforts, including providing a stronger institutional support with its
transfer from the Directorate General of Public Works to the Undersecretary of Public
Works and the appointment of a new highly effective project coordinator.


5
  It should be noted that progress on project implementation was fairly independent from the rate of
disbursements during the first half of execution, since in Chile loan funds are not additional to the
Ministry’s budget.

                                                 10
Disbursements and Project funding. The first two years of the Modernization Program
were implemented without Bank funding, with the first disbursement of loan funds taking
place in mid-2010. The poor disbursement rates and the slowing down of project
implementation during 2009 caused the revision of the PDO rating to MU. Supervision
missions identified the problem as a worrisome lack of communication with the MOF
with respect to how budget allocation mechanisms work in Chile when funds from a
Bank loan are available. Bank funds are not additional to budget allocations and the latter
were many times assigned to areas of the program that were not eligible for Bank
financing.

The dismal disbursement rates were the subject of the mid-term review and the
subsequent meetings involving the Bank’s country director in which the Bank team
agreed with the PIU and MOF that if changes were not made before June 2011 the
Project would be canceled. The agreement included to: (1) appoint a new Project
Coordinator, with knowledge of the Modernization Program and credibility within the
organization; (2) request at least one disbursement before June 2011; (3) define the new
administration’s prioritization areas and launch an activity (consultancy, workshop) in at
least one of these areas; and (4) provide a stronger commitment to the Modernization
Program. Authorities in the Ministry of Public Works, confirming the importance that
was attributed to the continued presence of the Bank for the success of the Modernization
Program complied extensively and fast with the agreements made. The actions
undertaken included: (1) a new and highly effective Project Coordinator, a long term
qualified official in the Ministry was appointed; (2) a new request for retroactive
disbursement was presented to the Bank; and the Minister gave a stronger institutional
support to the Modernization Program by transferring the management from the
Directorate of Public Works to the Undersecretary of Public Works. In practice, this
implies giving more visibility and power to the PIU. Moreover, the Strategic Directorate
that was created as a high level coordinating unit to monitor the progress of the
Modernization Program started to meet again once a month, after 15 months of
discontinuity. Several articles about the Modernization Program were published in many
newspapers as a result of interviews with the Undersecretary, providing clear support to
the Modernization Program.

Disbursement issues were satisfactorily addressed to a great extent through the already
discussed loan restructuring. By the beginning of 2013 disbursements reached 34 percent
of loan funds and accelerated considerably during the year. By the loan closing date
US$8.24 million were disbursed (70 percent of the loan) and the remaining US$3.45
million were canceled.

Lower than expected budget allocations also contributed to slow the implementation of
the Program. An estimated front-loaded cost structure resulted inadequate to finance a
program in which the initial stages were devoted to communicating visions and goals,
seeking consensus, discussing strategies and alternative methodologies, seeking
information from different international experiences and subsequently develop time
consuming terms of reference for complex studies and/or technical assistances. Since the
initial allocations were not fully utilized, and the MOF relied on past execution rates to
                                            11
define subsequent allocations, funding was decreasing when the needs increased. Budget
allocations during 2009 and 2010 were at a level that jeopardized the continuation of the
program. Again, these issues were resolved once discussions were held to restructure the
project and place it in the right track.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
    Utilization
As already discussed, the result framework of the TAL included targets that were not
measurable or lacked a clear distinction between end-of program outcomes monitorable
at the time of completion and outcomes that would materialize in the longer term as the
reform process consolidates. In addition, some of the indicators for the medium term
outcomes were hard to measure, not very realistic, and misleading. 6 These drawbacks of
the M&E framework were identified very early during the project execution and by 2009
a revised set of more realistic and measurable indicators were prepared by MOPW and
agreed with the Bank.

The revised set of medium term outcomes helped to narrow down and provided useful
milestones for each policy area objectives. The fine tuning of the indicators to ensure
their alignment with the expected outcomes, the availability of data for their periodic
monitoring, and the establishment of baseline values was carried out as part of the
supervision activities of the TAL. The process of revision of the M&E and its
implementation was useful to strengthen the dialogue with the counterpart and identify
new opportunities for support. Both the interim semiannual reports prepared by the
MOPW and the supervision missions were particularly useful to collect data relating to
the project implementation. The missions provided the framework for an in depth follow-
up of the project components’ progress and served to highlight pending issues to the
authorities. In addition the supervision missions gave the Bank and the MOPW the
opportunity to deepen the policy dialogue and identify areas of joint cooperation that
were not identified during project preparation. Finally, a field visit conducted during
project supervision served to corroborate the process of the reform implementation in the
regions.



6
  One PDO indicator was the increase in the rate of return (of an investment project) due to a better
planning methodology. Even when some positive correlation may occur, the causality between the new
planning methodology and the rate of return could be very difficult of being proven. Moreover, the
indicator does not provide guidance if the rate or return should be measured ex ante or ex post (once the
project is operative). For instance, some typical issues in project preparation such as the underestimation of
cost and overestimation of demand can be avoided by the implementation of the new planning
methodology. However, the rate of return may decrease during the project preparation if cost is higher and
demand is lower.
A second indicator was defined to capture the increase in market competition due to a new contract and
process standardization measured by a Herfindahl index (HHI). While the contract and process
standardization can lead to a more transparent and simple procurement process, the capacity to affect the
market share of public contractors can be negligible or impossible to capture. Indeed, the entry of new
contractors to the market of public works, if occurs, can take some time and be affected by other variables.

                                                     12
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Limitations imposed by the Bank’s procurement rules contributed to the initial substantial
lag in disbursements. The first disbursement took place in October 2010, more than two
and a half years after the loan became effective. Initially, one of the main reasons for
disbursement delays was the role played by Contraloría (auditing body of Chile) who
added at least 6 months to the procurement process of each consulting work. Eventually,
Contraloría agreed to work on a standard form for Bank-financed consultancies.
Subsequently, and as the pace of implementation improved, the limitations were imposed
by the Bank: i.e. matters related to anticorruption clauses in contracts and the limit of
US$ 100,000 for contracts using the ChileCompra system. 7

The Borrower repeatedly stressed the importance of revising the procurement procedures
and the positive impact that it would have on disbursements, as several contracts could
not be financed by the loan due to that particular limitation. On December 12, 2012 the
Loan Agreement was revised to extend the original closing date to January 31st, 2014
and to update the Procurement and Consultant Guidelines to reflect the versions dated
January 2011, which allows the use of framework agreements, known as “Convenios
Marcos” in Chile, for the procurement of goods, works and non-consultant services. In
addition, the Bank agreed to raise the maximum limits for using ChileCompra for
consultant services, from US$100,000 to US$300,000. In addition, the definition of
“Convenios Marco” was amended to include non-consultant services, and the Anti-
corruption Guidelines dated October 15th, 2006 and revised in January 2011 was to apply
to the Project to be consistent with the updated version of the Procurement and
Consultant Guidelines.

MOPW had adequate financial management systems, software, and trained staff. No
systemic problems were identified during implementation. The rating of the project,
however, remained as MS (moderately satisfactory) mainly because of the high rotation
of the financial management staff. This issue impacted the preparation of financial
reports, which presented problems and needed some corrections to be accepted.
Contraloría, the National Audit Office, also made comments requesting some changes
and improvements in the presentation of the information. Finally, the correction of some
issues took time and a few issues were repeated in other reports.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The vehicle used for the implementation of the Institutional Strengthening Program of the
MOPW (Programa de Modernización del MOP) ends at the end of June 2014. The long-


7
  The hiring of consultant firms with estimated cost less than US$100,000 was to be generally carried out
using national procedures which include advertisement and processing through the Chilecompra Portal:
such procedures - that may include open competition are not consistent with the short listing procedures as
specified in the Bank's guidelines but in Chile such procedures ensure transparency and quality service and
therefore, the Bank allowed the direct contracting of the firms thus selected.

                                                   13
term sustainability of the achievements seems to be guaranteed by the fact that the
program was a mean to improve the functioning of the different units of MOPW. That is,
each unit involved in the program was the final recipients of the technical assistance and
they are advancing independently with cementing their new role.

The MOPW, however, is interested in continuing with institutional strengthening in two
areas where the Bank might be requested to provide support in the near future: i) contract
management in infrastructure concessions; and ii) institutional set up of the water sector.
The first topic refers to the need to improve the oversight function of the concession unit
and it was identified as a priority by the recently appointed management of MOPW. On
the water sector, some progress was achieved during the program but there are other
reforms that required further support and the timing of the project was not suitable for
their implementation.


3    Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The main objective of the TAL remains extremely relevant to Chile’s current agenda. The
modernization program of MOPW remains very much in line with the government’s
focus on (i) investment decisions based on programs fostering equity, territorial
integration and regional development; (ii) a more equitable distribution of public-private
risks and better oversight of the provision of services; and (iii) the shift towards a
performance based infrastructure management as measured by users’ satisfaction. The
recent reelection of President Bachelet who’s administration was the original champion
of the modernization process, provides further enhancement to the relevance of the
objectives which have been already mainstreamed in the operations of MOPW. Chile’s
continued efforts to converge with OECD countries performance provide a favorable
support for the reform. Finally, MOPW has an undisputed role in the Chilean economy as
a vehicle for implementation of countercyclical policies. 8 The need to improve the
efficiency and performance of the MOPW becomes even more important in the light of
its increasing role as growth and employment generator.

The objective of the loan also remains relevant for the achievement of the Bank strategic
objectives, which emphasized the need to continue to focus on the modernization of the
state through a close engagement with the Chilean authorities. Likewise the project
objectives are fully consistent with those set in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
endorsed by the Board in May 2007 and in February 2010 9 , contributing directly to
objectives of supporting the efficiency of infrastructure and public services in addition to
decentralization and regional development.

  Chile has been cited as an example of how to implement adequate countercyclical economic policies. See
for instance the article titled “Stimulating” published by The Economist on February 19, 2009 (available at

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO)

PDO Indicator 1: “New planning methodology for infrastructure functioning and fully
incorporated in the investment decision of the MOPW”

The project fully achieved all the intermediate institutional targets leading to MOPS’s full
adoption of a novel integrated planning. The new methodology derived from a strategic
long-term view of regional development and was brought down to the tactical selections
of project with an integrated geographic perspective oriented to the competitiveness of
Chile's productive sectors and the equitable and sustainable access to goods and
services to all the country’s territories. The new methodology, now being used in 99%
of the MOPW’s newly approved projects, includes a high level of interaction with
other relevant stakeholders in the infrastructure sector and a societal or consumer voice
in project planning. The integration of the investment programs along a supply chain
is expected to substantially decreased coordination difficulties and inefficient
expenditures. All MOPW’s projects included in Chile’s 2014 budget come form
strategic investment programs evaluated using the new methodology. In 2010, with
the new administration, the Bank was requested to pay increased emphasis on water
resource management under the integrated planning activities. A large consultancy
launched in 2011 produced a manual being successfully used for the planning and
management of rainwater in large urban centers, thus contributing to the objective of
improved planning in a one of MOPW’s critical priority areas.

PDO Indicator 2: “Greater competition in bidding supported by fair risk-sharing
arrangements embedded in contracts and consumer responsive service targets”.

This objective was partially achieved. The objective was fully achieved with respect to
the incorporation of standard of services in concessions and civil work contracts.

Progress in ensuring greater competition in the bidding process centered in a series of
studies and proposed revisions to reduce the excessive restrictions that limited the
inclusion of participants in the registry of consultants and construction companies, to
increase the precisions of the bidding documents and to reduce discretionary decisions.
The proposed regulations for public works incorporating the new proposals were
presented to the Contraloría in 2012. Contraloría raised several comments on the
document but stop short of its approval. Clearly this is the most contentious area were
many strong interests are at stake and decisive political support is necessary for any
meaningful change. Nevertheless, even without the actual formal revision of the
Regulation of Public Works (Reglamento de Obras Públicas), some progress was made
in the standard bidding documents, such as the handling of the two- envelope system, the
improvement of the polynomial adjustment method and the dropping of the publication of
MOPWs project budget. Further progress and full approval of a new Reglamento is a
challenge left to the new Bachelet administration.


                                            15
PDO Indicator 3: “Greater responsiveness to consumer concerns related to the levels of
service; and greater oversight of performance by public sector service providers as well
as concessionaires”

This objective was fully achieved. This was probably one of the more complicated
objectives in terms of resistance to a complete change in the conceptual and
methodological model to implement a service- oriented approach to public works. After a
process of identifying service levels and standards for the design, construction and
exploitation of each type of works, these are being introduced as explicit obligations in an
increasing number of concession contracts for airports, roads, hospitals, etc., actually
surpassing the projections of the intermediate targets. By the end of 2013 MOPW had
entered more than 120 contracts with explicit service standards which, in addition to
several contracts in hospital and airport concessions, include performance-based and ad-
measurement contracts comprising 13,371.53 km or 71.7% of the country’s road network.
In addition MOPW successfully developed and implemented through surveys a system
for the evaluation of user’s satisfaction in at least four types of services and is continuing
with the task of developing the systems for other services under their responsibilities

PDO Indicator 4: “Reduction in variance between values for construction/investment
established at contract signature and final values at project execution.”

The objective was fully achieved. Reductions in variance between costs for
construction/investment established at contract signature and final values at project
execution were confirmed by comparing contracts carried out before and after the full
institutionalization of the new project management approach. The creation of Project
Management Offices at the central and regional levels in 2010 and the full adoption of
the “project manager” figure increased accountability and reduced atomized decisions.
The new organization is being supported by the development of a solid digital platform to
provide rapid information on project costs, contract management and/or design and
construction issues. The effectiveness of the new project management system was fully
proved during the reconstruction efforts following the 2010 earthquake, a fact that was
instrumental in securing the new administration support for the project.


Objective 5: “Normative and organizational structure that provides clear separation and
definition of roles and responsibilities for planning, contracting, works execution and
oversight”

Partially achieved. The Concession Law, one of the targets in this component, was
approved and made public as Law 20.410 on January 1st, 2010. However, the main laws
changing MOPW’s organization (the Superintendence Law and the Organic Law of
MOPW) were not pursued and were not considered a Government priority. Instead,
MOPW is implementing a strong oversight effort through contract oversight systems that
are already in place for concessioned airports (e.g. information screens, escalators, etc.)
and for contract oversight of rural potable water.

                                             16
3.3 Efficiency
The project should be considered as highly cost effective since costs should be
exceedingly compensated by improved capacity reflected in fiscal savings and efficiency
gains. The MOPW manages a budget for 2014 of about US$ 3.3 billion of which about
US$ 2.4 billion are allocated to investments. The cost of the project, at a total of US$
29.15 million, represents less than 1% of the budget of one year, yet it was sufficient to
introduce deep and permanent improvements in efficiency and service levels. The
already confirmed reduction in the costs and execution times of contracts that are being
derived from the adoption of an “integrated management system” would exceedingly
compensate for the costs of the project. Additional gains, probably more sizable but
more difficult to quantify, should be derived from the selection of projects that focus on
equity and the social benefits that were previously ignored.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The ICR considers the overall outcome of the project as satisfactory since (a) project
objectives remain highly relevant to the development of public infrastructure in Chile and
the government’s pursue of growth with equitable regional development; (b) the project
demonstrated satisfactory achievements of its DOs, especially in regard to full
institutionalization of integrated planning, efficient performance based management of
projects and services, a more substantive oversight of the provision of services, and the
inclusion of user satisfaction as a key measure of performance; and (c) the project passed
the test of approval of administrations covering a wide range of the country’s political
spectrum and is fully embedded in the modus-operandi of MOPW. Moreover, the project
was instrumental in bringing about the modernization of MOPW. Without the project,
and thus the Bank involvement, it is unlikely that the Modernization Program would have
been kept in the agenda and in the country’s budget. Even when the financial
contribution of the loan was at times minimal, MOPW insisted that the continuous
presence of the project was vital for the continuation of the reform program. The
satisfactory rating, however, does not coincide with the last ISR’s rating of Moderate
Satisfactory, which unfortunately gives inordinate weight to the poor disbursement
performance of the project rather than to the achievements of the development objectives
and was not revised when disbursements picked up.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The operation built the foundations for generating an indirect impact on poverty
alleviation by inducing greater efficiency, effectiveness and accountability in the
utilization of public resources. It also broadened participation in public infrastructure
investment, and fostered transparency and accountability in infrastructure service
delivery (principally by enhancing oversight, and access to information). In addition, the

                                            17
project promoted instruments such as strategic environmental assessments that have
already fostered (and will continue to foster) the integration of environmental aspects into
the planning process. All the above, will help Chile to achieve OECD standards for
public works projects that contribute to sustainable development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The operation’s institutional impact was and will be substantial. It established a new
institutional paradigm for the MOPW. This includes a new planning methodology
designed to provide an integrated strategic vision for all types of infrastructures. The
operation introduced the profile of the project manager which was key to create an
integrated project management approach that covers the full life cycle of projects. It also
designed a Project Management Office (PMO) to improve the management and oversight
of the portfolio of projects under the responsibility of the MOPW. The operation further
developed an integrated technological platform that is building a database for monitoring
the performance of concessions and public works.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
One interesting outcome that was not included in project design was the establishment of
the Public Works Institute in the MOPW. The reform process required a substantial
amount of training on planning, project management, contract standards, concessions,
information technology, etc. As it was found that many of the professional being sought
in academia for providing training were members of the MOPW, the government decided
to create the in-house training Institute, a move that is resulting in the continuous
upgrading of the professional skills in the Ministry.

Finally, the relevance of this project for the Bank agenda should be highlighted as Chile
is an example for the Bank in the area of infrastructure service provision. The Bank has
constantly relied on Chile to illustrate to other countries in different regions how
infrastructure reforms should be conducted, in particular in the area of attracting private
sector financing and operators through public private partnerships. World Bank staff and
public officials from East Asia and South East Asia have conducted study tours to learn
from the Chilean experience. Thus, the Bank will benefit significantly from the MOPW
modernization process as it will provide valuable lessons for other countries that request
the assistance of the Bank to follow a similar path of reforms.

4   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

                                            18
The sustainability of the achievements of the TAL operation is deemed substantial,
given that most of the objectives have been fully institutionalized and became an integral
part of MOPW’s modus operandi. While to continue to move forward and deepen the
modernization efforts, particularly for the still incomplete legal and regulatory changes,
would clearly require the presence of a reform-minded management team and strong
political support progress made to date is most likely to endure changes in leadership.

There are several factors that mitigate the risk associated with potential changes in
leadership. In addition to the strong ownership of the new MOPW’s vision within the
institution, risks are reduced by: i) the already strong support from different
administrations; (ii) the users pressures for reform resulting from improved performance;
iii) the heightened role of public consultation organisms; and iv) the strong ownership
within MOPW’ of its strategic plans.

Finally, the risk of cultural resistance and vested interests within the institution opposing
project implementation, probably the most tangible one during the early years of project
implementation, has been largely contained. A well-established organizational culture
and self-interest inertia originally resisted institutional change within the MOPW.
Mitigation measures aimed at fostering stakeholders’ participation and promoting change
management served to counter-balance this resistance to change. The gradual integration
of new profiles (such as the project manager) and the progressive definition of new
institutional bodies for supervision and coordination, also served to mitigate this risk.
Addressing the risks imposed by interests outside the institution to move forward with the
legal and regulatory changes still necessary to fully complete the modernization program
will require further work, particularly to strengthen the communication channels between
the executive and the legislative branches of government to gather support for the
modernization of the Ministry’s legal structure.



5   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: moderately satisfactory

The rating for Bank performance during the preparation phase is moderately satisfactory.
The justification for this rating is as follows: acknowledging the complexity of the reform,
the Bank assigned a highly qualified team with extensive experience in the relevant
policy areas. The team was able to maintain a close collaboration with the Minister and
his team from the beginning, and responded promptly and with high levels of flexibility
to their requests for assistance in certain topics (particularly the drafting of the
Concessions and Superintendence of Public Works Law) at the outset of the reform
process. Experts from different parts of the world participated actively in preparation

                                             19
missions and workshops, providing ad-hoc advice directly to the Minister and his cabinet
on specific issues. The team’s appropriate skill mix helped deliver a well-designed
project and provided value added to the Borrower. The Bank’s performance assisting the
Borrower in identifying and appraising the project to ensure consistency with the CAS
and with government’s priorities, and in a manner that would ensure attainment of
expected outcomes, was also very valuable. Performance at entry could have been
satisfactory if design of the M&E framework had included more relevant and measurable
indicators.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: moderately satisfactory

Traditional supervisory activities to monitor progress toward mid-term outcomes were
carried out and missions traveled to the field more than twice a year, with additional
regular Bank support provided directly by the Project team. Beyond the focus on regular
supervision matters, there was a strong interest on the part of the Bank in assessing
impact of project activities and, in doing so, maintaining central government focus in the
reform agenda. To ensure a feasible impact analysis, objective indicators, and the
availability of the required data to monitor their evolution throughout project
implementation, the M&E framework for the project was revised with Chilean
counterparts. In addition the supervision team was very proactive and successfully
intervened to keep the project alive when the Government support faltered. Supervision
missions did play the productive envisaged role of “honest broker” between MOPW and
MOF, and all of the MOPW officials interviewed for this ICR coincided in that the
presence of the Bank was instrumental in saving the project when the political support
was at its lowest. The less than satisfactory rating is due to the following: (i) the revision
of the result framework was never formalized. Although a problem of form more than
substance, the change would have improved the rather confusing presentations of the
result framework in the ISRs, which mixed the original and revised indicators; and (ii)
the supervision team relied heavily on disbursements rather than on achievements to
evaluate project performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory.
Based on the above, the ICR considers the overall Bank performance as moderately
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: satisfactory
Government performance is rated satisfactory due to the commitment and involvement in
MOPW’s reform initiative, as evidenced by: (i) the active participation of the Ministry of
Finance from project inception. The positive commitment of the Ministry of Finance,
given the structure of power in Chile, is a sine qua non condition for the successful

                                             20
implementation of any institutional reform in Chile; (ii) the explicit support from the
highest levels of government to the reform program in public speeches and press releases;
and (iii) the valuable contributions and participation from staff of other public agencies in
multiple initiatives of the reform program (in particular, involvement of multiple agencies
in the seminars carried out by MOPW under the Integrated Planning policy area). On the
other hand, the poor budget execution of the reform program during its first two years
prompted MOF to reduce budget allocations at a time in which the program was starting
to take off. These shortages of funds contributed to slowing down the implementation of
the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: satisfactory

Implementing agency performance is rated as satisfactory. From the beginning of project
implementation, MOPW has assigned a qualified team to lead the initiatives under each
policy area. These teams have worked hard in the production of terms of reference, and in
the organization of trainings and other events; strengthening the dialogue and building
coordination stages among Ministry areas that had traditionally worked in relative
isolation. The Project Coordinating Unit has complied with all of its fiduciary
responsibilities in a satisfactory manner, and played an important role in providing
relevant information to assess the attainment of outputs established for the ICR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: satisfactory

Based on the above, the ICR considers the Borrower performance satisfactory.




6   Lessons Learned

•     An intensive early period of communication and participation as part of the
      process of problem recognition and problem definition is fundamental for
      ensuring support to institutional changes. MOPW underestimated the need for
      launching an effective process of communication for gathering staff backing for the
      modernization program. Even once the initial concerns for job stability were
      addressed, the acceptance of new conceptual and behavioral norms in a big and
      powerful institution proved a difficult task that was eventually overcome by
      moving from a “diffusion of communications” to a more participatory approach for
      setting common goals.
•     The endorsement and strong ownership of the leaders of an institution are
      crucial to ensure the continuity and success of major reforms. After Minister
      Bitrán, who was the original reform champion, left office in January 2008,
      immediate support by his successor, Minister Bitar, was decisive to providing
      continuity to the modernization program. This endorsement was critical at a time

                                             21
      when support to the reform was waning within the MOPW due to weaknesses in
      the internal communication of the reform’s principles and objectives among
      ministry’s stakeholders. The priority of the program was further and definitely
      confirmed in 2010 when the administration changed hands, thus ensuring its
      continuity.
•     The cost curve of institutional reform should take into account the lead- time
      necessary for consensus building and task preparation. The cost curve
      estimated for the TAL was front- loaded. During the initial years, however, the
      needs focused on internal deliberations on visions, strategies and goals. These
      required the help of individual consultants to define future assistances and develop
      complex Terms of Reference for more resource consuming consultancies. Thus,
      actual need for funds increased with time (rather than decrease as projected). This
      discrepancy between actual and expected costs was at times a source of project
      underfunding.
•     The Bank should evaluate more closely the procurement thresholds or
      consider more flexible procurement rules for countries with a proven record
      of controlling corruption. The procurement limits originally established for the
      use of ChileCompra, were at the center of the poor disbursement record of the
      project. Its revision and the use of limits more according to the procurement record
      of Chile (which probably should have taken place as soon as the problem was
      identified), proved instrumental in turning around disbursement s performance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


The project should be considered as highly cost effective since costs should be
exceedingly compensated by improved capacity reflected in fiscal savings and efficiency
gains. The MOPW manages a budget for 2014 of about US$ 3.3 billion of which about
US$ 2.4 billion are allocated to investments. The cost of the project, at a total of US$
29.15 million, represents less than 1% of the budget of one year, yet it was sufficient to
introduce deep and permanent improvements in efficiency and service levels. The
already confirmed reduction in the costs and execution times of contracts that are being
derived from the adoption of an “integrated management system” would exceedingly
compensate for the costs of the project. Additional gains, probably more sizable but more
difficult to quantify, should be derived from the selection of projects that focus on equity
and the social benefits that were previously ignored.

1. INTRODUCCIÓN

El Programa de Fortalecimiento Institucional del Ministerio de Obras Públicas (MOP),
fue una reforma integral que buscó fortalecer las áreas estratégicas del Ministerio, para
planificar integralmente los proyectos de infraestructura y recursos hídricos, realizar
contratos con estándares de servicio, hacer más eficiente la gestión de los proyectos y
mejorar la capacidad de regular y fiscalizar las obras públicas que mejorarán la calidad de
vida de la ciudadanía.

A partir del 2007, el Ministerio de Obras Públicas inició el proceso de modernización,
para potenciarse como un proveedor de obras y servicios de infraestructura pública más
eficaz y eficiente, con mayor capacidad de planificación y gestión, al servicio del
bienestar de las personas y de la competitividad de los sectores productivos del país.

Esto ha significado una transformación en el sentido y forma de proveer obras y servicios
de infraestructura pública al país; un cambio que significó pasar de sólo ejecutar
contratos a gestionar obras al servicio de la ciudadanía. Esta estrategia de cambio que
incluye la declaración de su propuesta de valor a la ciudadanía, la revisión y rediseño de
sus procesos de negocio, con énfasis en fortalecer las competencias de sus 8.700
funcionarios (aproximadamente).



2. ANTECEDENTES DEL PROGRAMA Y ROL DEL TAL


El Programa de Fortalecimiento Institucional del Ministerio de Obras Públicas o también
llamado, al interior del Ministerio, Programa de Modernización, se financió parcialmente
con los recursos de un convenio de préstamo de asistencia técnica suscrito con el Banco
Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento (BIRF), Banco Mundial, hasta por un monto
de 11.7 MMUS$, con un plazo de ejecución entre los años 2008 y 2012 y, que en su
último año de ejecución, se extendió hasta el 31 de enero del 2014.

Dicho programa, dada su magnitud y alcance, toda vez que actúo sobre la gestión interna
del Ministerio, objeto y sujeto de esta transformación, fue relevado y se le denominó
como un proyecto de Estado, incluido en las metas gubernamentales ministeriales. Los
procesos de transformación que se impulsaron ya están en etapa de consolidación, operan
en forma transversal al interior del Ministerio y pasaron a ser parte de las prácticas
permanentes.

Sus principales líneas de acción fueron:
   • Fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad de aguas.
   •   Consolidación del modelo de planificación integrada con visión territorial.
   •   Estudios para mejorar el reglamento de obras y consultorías.


                                            40
   •   Consolidación el funcionamiento de las Oficinas de Gestión de Proyectos.
   •   Administrar proyectos bajo la metodología de Gestión Integrada de Proyectos.
   •   Implementación del Sistema de Gestión del Mantenimiento.
   •   Avanzar en el modelo integral de relación ciudadana.
   •   Consolidar los proyectos tecnológicos desarrollados.
   •   Avanzar en el modelo de gestión por competencias.

 La Subsecretaría de Obras Públicas, desarrolló durante estos años una restructuración
funcional, cumpliendo con la misión institucional, permitiendo instalar procesos y
unidades que mejoraron la gestión interna de la institución a nivel ministerial e implicó el
desarrollo de la infraestructura pública, y el uso sustentable y eficiente de los recursos
hídricos.

Hoy gran parte de las iniciativas se encuentran en su fase de término o con un avance
significativo, salvo las que por su planificación natural exceden el término del programa,
como por ejemplo: los avances en el Sistema de Gestión del Mantenimiento en otros
Servicios Ejecutores MOP, la Actualización de la Información de Infraestructura
Aeroportuaria, las mejoras en el Sistema de Gestión Documental; y el segundo estudio de
la Dirección de Planeamiento para el análisis y medición de variables e indicadores de
planes territoriales de infraestructura y gestión de recursos hídricos MOP

El Programa de Modernización ya es una realidad, ya es parte del MOP, y desde la
Subsecretaria se consolidó como aquel proyecto que permitió, con la ayuda de los
funcionarios, mantener como práctica habitual el mejoramiento continuo de nuestro
accionar. Con ello, se crearon instancias de trabajo y nuevas estructuras, que permiten
mantener a través del tiempo las líneas de trabajo impulsadas:

   •   Comité de Planificación Integrada (Dirección de Planeamiento)
   •   Unidad de Estándares (Dirección General de Obras Públicas)
   •   7 Oficinas de Gestión de Proyectos PMO (Dirección General de Obras Públicas)
   •   Unidad de Gestión Ministerial (Unidad de Monitoreo Ministerial de la
       Subsecretaría)
   •   Unidad de Relación Ciudadana y Gestión de la Información (Subsecretaría)
   •   Academia de Obras Públicas (Subsecretaría)


3. CUMPLIMIENTO DE LOS OBJETIVOS Y PRINCIPALES AVANCES EN
LAS MATERIAS


Se planteó como desafío mostrar resultados que avalen al Ministerio como un proveedor,
gestor de obras y servicios de infraestructura pública, más eficaz y eficiente, con una

                                            41
clara orientación hacia el usuario, focalizado en su gestión interna, potenciando 4 ejes:
planificación de infraestructura y gestión de recursos hídricos, desarrollo de estándares,
gestión de proyectos y fiscalización. De acuerdo a esto, a continuación se muestran los
principales avances.

Con respecto a instalar un modelo de planificación integrada, el objetivo principal fue
contribuir a un enfoque sostenido integrado de la infraestructura pública y del recurso
hídrico, con un diagnóstico inicial en la cual destacaba una planificación no sistémica, sin
mirada de largo plazo ni multisectorial, sin coordinación con otros actores relevantes.

Al cierre del proyecto, se ha conseguido diseñar e instalar un proceso de planificación
ministerial orientado abordar los nuevos desafíos de provisión de servicios de
infraestructura, generando un alineamiento estratégico en torno a resultados e impactos
para el desarrollo territorial, logrando con esto construir una visión estratégica de
desarrollo país de mediano y largo plazo a fin de proveer servicios de infraestructura con
un sentido estratégico.

Entre las políticas desarrolladas, cabe destacar que se cuenta con una propuesta de una
Política de Financiamiento para la Infraestructura MOP, que incluye en primer término
un análisis y diagnóstico de las necesidades financieras para resolver las brechas de
infraestructura en el país, detectadas por diferentes estudios e instituciones, luego las
alternativas y modelos de financiamiento basadas en la experiencia nacional e
internacional y finalmente una propuesta de alternativas y posibles cursos de acción en
los ámbitos fiscales como en el campo de la colaboración público-privada. También se
finalizó la Política Nacional de Servicios de Infraestructura de Borde Costero,
desarrollada por la Dirección de Obras Portuarias con apoyo de Dirección de
Planeamiento, en la cual se proponen los lineamientos de acción que deben enmarcar el
desarrollo de las diferentes tipologías de infraestructura de borde costero en cada uno de
los cuatro ámbitos considerados: Cobertura, Sostenibilidad Económica, Calidad y
Sustentabilidad. En la segunda dimensión de trabajo, se realizó el seguimiento de la
Política de Conservación Vial, elaborada en tres etapas, entre el 2010 y el 2012, etapas
que responden a la problemática de las redes pavimentadas, redes de caminos básicos y
redes no pavimentadas respectivamente. Así mismo, se realizaron actividades de
seguimiento de la propuesta de política intersectorial de Infraestructura Aeroportuaria.
En ambos casos se verificó que en términos generales, en aquellas intervenciones a las
cuales hace referencia la política, están en consonancia con los lineamientos de política
planteados originalmente.

En el ámbito de la modernización se desarrollaron planes de inversión, de carácter
regional, estos planes y su cartografía se difundieron en el sitio web del Ministerio, en el
portal de internet de la Dirección de Planeamiento y en el Observatorio de la
Infraestructura y de los Recursos Hídricos: http://sit.mop.gov.cl/observatorio ; ambos
sistemas fueron desarrollados en el marco del Programa y permiten facilitar el acceso y la
integración de la información espacial, tanto a nivel institucional como con los propios
ciudadanos.



                                            42
También en el marco de la modernización de la institucionalidad del agua y del recurso
hídrico la situación inicial era débil, con tiempos de respuesta a solicitudes demasiado
extensos, con información respecto de disponibilidad y calidad del recurso deficiente,
incompleto y disgregado.

Ante ese escenario, entre los años 2010 y 2011 se realizó, en conjunto con el Banco
Mundial, un informe de diagnóstico de la gestión de este recurso en Chile, que sirvió de
base para la formulación de una política y estrategia nacional sobre esta materia. En la
preparación de esta estrategia, se definió, como uno de los desafíos claves, el
mejoramiento de la institucionalidad de aguas del país. En este mismo contexto se
desarrollaron dos estudios: “Mejoramiento del marco institucional para la gestión del
agua” y la “Preparación del Plan de Desarrollo Institucional de los Recursos Hídricos”,
ambos financiados parcialmente con aportes del Banco Mundial.

Por otra parte, la componente de estándares y contratos radicada en la Dirección General
de Obras Públicas, declaraba al inicio del proyecto que la gran mayoría de los contratos
de obras del ministerio no incluía compromisos explícitos de servicio y solo respondían a
requisitos constructivos. Por tanto, el ministerio no contaba con mediciones respecto a la
percepción de los usuarios sobre la calidad de los servicios que presta la infraestructura
pública del país. En este contexto se trabajó en la identificación de estándares y niveles
de servicio para un total de 11 tipologías de obra, 41 contratos con estándares explícitos,
se elaboró y difundió un plan de mejoras de aeropuertos concesionados, se incorporaron
estándares de servicios explícitos en las nuevas licitaciones de proyectos concesionados,
además de elaborar una política de contratación por niveles de servicio, junto con un plan
de mejoras de obras viales. Además durante la ejecución del proyecto fue posible
elaborar el Manual de Aguas Lluvia: Manual de drenaje urbano y la guía para el Diseño,
Construcción, Operación y Conservación de Obras Marítimas y Costeras.

En cuanto a la componente de contratos, poco se avanzó; sólo se trabajó en el análisis y
de las mejoras del reglamento de obras del ministerio y una modificación al reglamento
de consultorías, ambas materias que aún se mantienen en análisis.

Antes del inicio del programa, existía una cartera de proyectos desagregada, sin visión de
conjunto, no se lograba visualizar las diferentes etapas de un proyecto: factibilidad,
diseño y construcción; por esa razón se estableció en la orgánica del programa una
componente Gestión Integrada de Proyectos (GIP), con el fin de integrar las diversas
etapas de la obra, controlar las variables de costos, calidad y plazos utilizando
herramientas tecnológicas y una nueva metodología de administración de manera de
contar con un perfil de jefe de proyecto, profesionales altamente calificados, impulsando
con ello mejores prácticas en la realización de contratos de obra pública.

Se implementaron las oficinas de gestión de proyectos (PMO), cuya función principal fue
estructurar y desarrollar un soporte metodológico, alineado con la visión de GIP
instaurando buenas prácticas y metodologías que ayuden a las autoridades y a los equipos
responsables de la ejecución de la inversión, haciendo más eficaz y eficiente su labor.



                                            43
En materia de fiscalización se diseñó un sistema informático que buscó fortalecer los
mecanismos de fiscalización y control, para el cumplimiento de los estándares de servicio
de las obras públicas.

En cuanto a gestión interna, se avanzó en la elaboración de un modelo de gestión
estratégica Balanced Scoredcard Ministerial, sistema de reportería ministerial y mejoras
en los sistemas de información tales como: portal web, intranet, portal de relación
ciudadana. También se implementó un modelo integral de atención ciudadana,
incorporando competencia para gestionar los procesos que nos permiten responder
oportunamente a las demandas de la ciudadanía. En materias de modernizar la gestión de
personas, para fomentar mayor eficiencia y aportar en el logro de los objetivos
institucionales, en el marco de la subcomponente de recursos humanos se creó la
Academia de Obras Públicas, cuyo objetivo es brindar una asesoría de apoyo para el
desarrollo de las capacidades de formación de los Inspectores Fiscales.



4. DESEMPEÑO DEL BANCO

Durante el plazo de ejecución del préstamo se realizaron varios cambios de Gerente de
Proyecto, tanto al interior del Banco, como en la Unidad Ejecutora. Ante cada reemplazo
el Banco Mundial realizó una misión, para presentar a cada nuevo jefe de proyecto, cada
cambio consideró profesionales calificados y dispuestos a trabajar con la Coordinación
del Programa.

Gracias a los acuerdos sostenidos entre el Gobierno y el Banco, fue posible desarrollar y
continuar con los procesos de mejora, implementados en el marco de la modernización.
En este contexto, el Banco Mundial colaboró en la supervisión del proyecto, revisando
aspectos del ámbito de gestión financiera y adquisiciones. Sin embargo, faltó más apoyo
en materias de carácter técnico, para orientar, contribuir e instalar los avances del
proyecto propiamente tal.


5. DESEMPEÑO DEL PRESTATARIO

El ciclo de Administración del Estado de Chile, comprende cuatro años de gobierno, un
periodo muy breve de gestión, esto provocó una dificultad en el funcionamiento, puesto
que mediante cada cambio debíamos presentar los objetivos y lineamientos a nuevas
autoridades.

Por nuestra parte, debemos reconocer que se debió impulsar un plan comunicacional
continuo y permanente, para enfrentar una significativa resistencia al cambio, debido a
que el proyecto era innovador y pretendía modificar la forma de trabajo, de cultura y
cambio de paradigma en el ámbito de cómo ejecutar las tareas del ministerio.

En relación a la ejecución del proyecto su desempeño fue satisfactorio, calificación y

                                           44
opinión consensuada con el Banco Mundial. Esto representa que el Programa de
Modernización quedó inserto a nivel ministerial, es decir, las componentes que se crearon
pasaron a la línea y a la fecha de cierre de nuestro informe son parte de las unidades
funcionales, dichos objetivos fueron cumplidos gracias al compromiso de las autoridades
de turno, quienes generaron bases de lineamientos transversales e involucraron
proactivamente a los funcionarios.

En lo que respecta al préstamo, su ejecución fue lenta, podemos mencionar que una de las
razones fue el bajo umbral de desembolso, para consultorías o estudios bajo las normas
de adquisiciones nacionales, las que no podían pasar los USD$100.000, esto significó
realizar una serie de gestiones tendientes a modificar el convenio, para lograr una mayor
ejecución y ampliar el umbral de desembolsos, acciones que se contrataron en el último
año de ejecución. Es importante señalar que dichas modificaciones podrían haberse
realizado mucho antes. No obstante, dicho cambio aportó positivamente a la ejecución
financiera, al cierre del préstamo se desembolsó un total de $ 4.194.389.839 de pesos
chilenos, lo que representa una utilización del préstamo de un 70,4%.


6. LECCIONES APRENDIDAS

La dirección del proyecto, específicamente la Unidad Ejecutora se estableció inicialmente
en la Dirección de Contabilidad y Finanzas, luego de un año fue trasladada a la Dirección
General de Obras Públicas. En septiembre 2010, el Ministro de Obras Públicas decidió
traspasar la coordinación técnica y administrativa a la Subsecretaría, a partir de enero
2011. Este cambio obedeció al rol transversal y estratégico del Servicio, así como por su
mayor nivel de decisión y relevancia dentro de la orgánica Ministerial. Este cambio fue
muy relevante, para alcanzar los objetivos propuestos, por tanto una lección aprendida
que debemos tener presente para proyectos de la misma envergadura, será ubicar la
Unidad Ejecutora en lo más alto del organigrama.

Este programa se centró en las áreas de la pertinencia, transparencia en la planificación,
contratación, gestión, conservación y explotación de las inversiones, ya sean financiadas
con fondos fiscales, por concesión u otra modalidad. También se consideraba la
separación institucional del rol de fiscalización de la calidad de servicio y la promoción
de garantías explícitas de calidad de servicio a proveer con las obras. En este marco, las
restricciones en procedimientos operativos y la nueva estructura institucional, requería de
un gran apoyo en los procesos de cambio, debido que consideraba modificaciones al
interior de la organización, precisamente en la forma de gestionar sus procesos y
resultados asociados. El paso de una situación a otra supone un cambio importante que
necesita y requiere un acompañamiento comunicacional significativo, una gestión del
cambio previo al inicio del proyecto, lo que no ocurrió en este caso.

Otra lección a considerar que destaca positivamente fue la factibilidad de realizar
modificaciones al convenio de préstamo, lo que le otorgó flexibilidad en dos aspectos:
una modificación funcional en las componentes, un cambio en su estructura, dentro del
marco regulatorio del convenio y la segunda fue ampliar el plazo del préstamo, junto con

                                            45
el umbral de desembolsos al amparo de las normas nacionales. Ambas reformas fueron
advertidas durante su ejecución, lo que significó una flexibilidad en el contrato y un
acuerdo entre las partes.

En términos operativos, la administración y ejecución de un proyecto, se identifica por
llevar un alto flujo de documentos y ejecutar un gran número de acciones de carácter
administrativo, lo que conlleva a un manejo considerable de información, en donde se
ven involucrados funcionarios de todas las unidades y una gran coordinación interna,
tareas que demandan una gran carga de trabajo y que no están ajenas a falencias. Por lo
anteriormente expuesto, se determinó impartir capacitaciones internas a todas las
contrapartes técnicas de convenios vigentes, junto con revisar procedimientos y generar
manuales operativos.

En temas de indicadores de gestión es preciso señalar que son una herramienta de control
que permite observar la información desagregada y su estado de avance. En base a lo
citado, es importante destacar que los indicadores deben ser factibles de alcanzar, de
acuerdo a actividades planteadas y no tan solo traducidas a un número o reporte, sino que
deben servir de ayuda para fomentar el mejoramiento de los resultados del proyecto,
impulsando la eficiencia, eficacia y productividad de los procesos involucrados.


7. CONCLUSIONES

En términos generales, es preciso señalar que durante la ejecución del Programa de
Fortalecimiento Institucional, se presentaron debilidades que afectaron el cumplimiento
de los objetivos propuestos inicialmente, tales como el recambio de autoridades y
coordinadores, las dificultades de modificar normas y reglamentos; y la falta del
acompañamiento comunicacional de forma permanente y continua.

Al margen de las dificultades que se presentaron, es preciso señalar que los procesos de
mejoras que se realizaron al interior del ministerio, permitieron cambiar el paradigma y
pasar de sólo construir obras a ser un organismo público orientado al servicio de la
comunidad, con la capacidad de instalar nuevos procesos en el ámbito de planificación
estratégica, con objetivos y prioridades, contando con una metodología moderna de
gestión de proyectos nos lleva a pasar de una administración fragmentada de contratos a
una gestión integrada de los proyectos, para concluirlos a tiempo y en los costos
estipulados, disminuyendo sus riesgos, proporcionando información confiable, pertinente
y oportuna para la toma de decisiones, instrumentos que permiten rendir en forma
responsable cuenta pública de la gestión institucional.
