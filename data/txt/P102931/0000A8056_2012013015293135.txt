                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government in achieving a sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of
                         service standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project
                         management process; a regulatory framework for all of MOPW#s sectors of responsibility that increases consumer confidence in infrastructure service
                         provision; and the legal and organizational separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and regulation of infrastructure provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The positive trend verified in the project development since January 2011 is still driving its development pace. After the appointment of a new Minister in charge of the Ministry of
                         Public Works, Mr. Laurence Golborne Riveros, the PIU and the Minister himself expressed their utmost support to the program, that enjoys a strong endorsement at all levels of the
                         Ministry's organization. Moreover, the Undersecretary of Public Works is strongly committed with the project and acknowledged the profound impact that it has at all levels of the

                         Ministry's organization. Another key factor for the current positive development trend is the leadership of the PIU within the Ministry's structures as well as the effective personal
                         leadership showed by the project manager appointed on January 2011, Ms Daniela Devoto Mehr.

                         The Mid Term Review Supervision Mission was undertaken on August 8-10, 2011, and included a meeting between the new Country Director for LCC6C, Ms. Susan Goldmark, and
                         the Undersecretary of Public Works, Ms. Loreto Silva Rojas. In that meeting the Undersecretary ratified the interest of the Ministry of Public Works on its partnership with the World
                         Bank for the development of the modernization program and the intention of requesting a one year loan extension (up to January 2014). The objective of this extension would be to
                         allow further disbursements of long term consultancies financed under the loan, that have been launched recently by the Ministry (and other that will follow in 2012) and have
                         deliverables that extend beyond the current closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The loan has seen an increased pace of project implementation and several long term consultancies under the modernization program were launched during 2011. The Ministry of
                         Public Works envisages a one year extension of the loan as a key factor to achieve the project development objectives as well as the disbursement objectives.
