                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government in achieving a sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of service
                         standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project management
                         process; a regulatory framework for all of MOPW#s sectors of responsibility that increases consumer confidence in infrastructure service provision; and the legal and
                         organizational separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and regulation of infrastructure provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
