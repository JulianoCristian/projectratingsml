                         The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government in achieving a sustainable and integrated approach to the planning of infrastructure; levels of
                         service standards for infrastructure as well as model contracts and procedures that promote competition and assign risks appropriately; an integrated project
                         management process; a regulatory framework for all of MOPW#s sectors of responsibility that increases consumer confidence in infrastructure service
                         provision; and the legal and organizational separation of the areas of planning, contracting, execution and regulation of infrastructure provision.

                         implemented by the Modernization Program have been tested and fully utilized in the emergency reconstruction projects that followed the earthquake of February 2010.
                         The Ministry of Public Works has undertaken several actions to increase the implementation pace of the Modernization Program, including: (1) providing a stronger institutional
                         support to the Program with its transfer from the Directorate General of Public Works to the Undersecretary of Public Works; (2) launching several new consultancies; (3) ratifying its
                         partnership with the World Bank and proceeding to request additional disbursements.
