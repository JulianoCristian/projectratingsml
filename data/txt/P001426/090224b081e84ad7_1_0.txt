WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank's
entering into the Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed so
to guarantee such obligations of the Borrower;
NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all
the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated March 15, 1974, with
the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein
(said General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee
Agreements of the Bank being hereinafter called the General
Conditions).
Section 1.02. Wherever used in this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the

ARTICLE II
Guarantee; Provision of Funds
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any
of its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor
and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the
premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan and the punctual
performance of all the other obligations of the Borrower, all as

Section 2.02. Without limitation or restriction upon the
provisions of Section 2.01 of this Agreement, the Guarantor
specifically undertakes:

Bank; and


﻿-4-
(b) whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the
funds available to the Borrower, including those referred to

expenditures.

ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt,
which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of the
creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization or
distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in creating or
permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision
to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or adminis-
trative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall promptly and at no cost
to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other
charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets
satisfactory to the Bank.


﻿-6-
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i)
any lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof,
solely as security for payment of the purchase price of such
property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of
banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more
than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets"
means assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative
subdivision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by,
or operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange
assets held by any institution performing the functions of a
central bank or exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions,
for the Guarantor.

commencing with Fiscal Year 1977 and every Fiscal Year thereafter
until the Fiscal Year in which the Project shall have been
completed, the Guarantor shall take or cause the Power Sector to
take, from time to time, all such measures (including, but not
limited to, adjustments in the rates for the sale of electricity
by the Power Sector) as shall be required to cause the Power
Sector to provide, in every Fiscal Year until the Project shall
have been completed, consolidated funds from internal sources


﻿-7-
equivalent to not less than 16% in Fiscal Year 1977, 13% in Fiscal
Year 1978, 16% in Fiscal Year 1979 and 18% in every Fiscal Year
thereafter until the Project shall have been completed, of the
corresponding aggregate capital expenditures.
(b) For the purposes of this Section:
(i) the funds from internal sources of each Power
Sector Entity shall be calculated as the difference
between:
(A) the sum, for the Fiscal Year in question,
of its gross revenues related to
electricity operations, consumer deposits
and cash contributions in aid of construction,
and net non-operating income; and
(B) the sum, for the Fiscal Year in question,
of its operating, maintenance and administration
expenses (excluding depreciation and any other
non-cash charges), interest and other charges
on its debt (excluding interest and other
charges accrued during the Fiscal Year in
question and which have been charged to
construction works, when such construction
works are being financed under a loan),


﻿-8-
repayment of its debt (including sinking fund
payments, if any), all taxes imposed on it,
all its payments resulting from cash dividends
and other cash distributions of income and
surplus or both (excluding dividends paid, or
cash distributions of income or surplus or
both made to the Guarantor, if any, and

capital expenditures;
(ii) the term "consolidated funds from internal sources"

Sector Entities after excluding therefrom such
amounts as shall represent sales of electricity
between Power Sector Entities;
(iii) the increase (or decrease) in net working capital
other than cash shall be calculated as the
difference between:


﻿- 9 -
(A) the value at the beginning of the Fiscal
Year in question; and
(B) the value at the end of the Fiscal Year in
question
of current assets (excluding cash or the equivalent

capital expenditures during such Fiscal
Year; and
(B) for Fiscal year 1978 and every Fiscal
Year thereafter: the average of the
aggregate capital expenditures during
the Fiscal Year in question and the
aggregate capital expenditures during
the Fiscal Year preceding the Fiscal
Year in question.
(c) For the purposes of the foregoing, the Guarantor shall
enable, or shall cause every Power Sector Entity other than the
Borrower to enable, the Borrower to comply with the Borrower's
obligations under paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 5.04 of the
Loan Agreement.

Section 3.03. (a) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree,
commencing with the Fiscal Year following that Fiscal Year in
which the Project shall have been completed and every Fiscal
Year thereafter, the Guarantor shall take or cause the Power
Sector to take, from time to time, all such measures (including,
but not limited to, adjustments in the rates for the sales of
electricity by the Power Sector) as shall be required to provide
the Power Sector with revenues sufficient to yield an annual rate
of return of not less than 9% of the aggregate average value of
net fixed assets in operation.

all Power Sector Entities after excluding therefrom
such amounts as shall represent transactions of
any kind between Power Sector Entities;
(iv) the phrase "value of net fixed assets in operation"
means, for each Power Sector Entity, the gross
value of its net fixed assets in operation during
the Fiscal Year in question valued from time to

depreciation;


﻿- 13 -
(v) the average value of net fixed assets in operation
during the Fiscal Year in question will be

in operation at the end of the Fiscal Year in
question to the value of the net fixed assets in
operation at the beginning of such Fiscal Year
and dividing the total by two; and
(vi) the phrase "aggregate average value of net fixed
assets in operation" means the sum of the average
value of net fixed assets in operation of every

the prices paid for fuel by the Power Sector in order to transfer
the cost of such additional operating expenses to the customers of
the Power Sector.
Section 3.07. The Guarantor shall carry out, or cause the
Borrower to carry out, by January 30, 1978 or such other date
agreed by the Bank, a study under terms of reference satisfactory
