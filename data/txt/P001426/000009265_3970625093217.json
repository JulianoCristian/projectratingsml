and Third Development Finance\n            Company Projects in Liberia was implemented. Both the Second\n            and the Third Projects were approved against the background\n            of two decades of impressive growth of the economy,\n            impressive operational and financial performance of the\n            Liberia Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI), and\n            government policies favoring private foreign and domestic\n            investments. During implementation the environment changed\n            drastically with adverse impact on the financial condition\n            and performance of LBDI as well as its clients. The unstable\n            economic conditions and political changes during the period\n            of project implementation, resulted in a number of\n            businesses being closed or changing ownership. These overall\n            economic factors reduced the development impact of the\n            projects in relation to what would have been in normal\n            economic conditions. The medium- to long-term funds provided\n            under the projects, together with other foreign lines of\n            credit to LBDI, represented virtually the only term\n            resources available in the country for the private sector.\n            The role the projects played in the economy was, therefore, substantial."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
