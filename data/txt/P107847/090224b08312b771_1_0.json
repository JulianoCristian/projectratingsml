The sources of such\n            time and cost over-runs can be diverse, ranging broadly for\n            example, from inappropriate procurement strategies and\n            protocols, through incomplete and or unsuitable designs,\n            sub-optimal tenderer-contractor planning, and or estimating,\n            to poor construction management, and or contract\n            administration. The base-line against which over-runs are\n            assessed for this pilot study is the signed construction\n            contract so that any increases are against agreed contract\n            price and duration. Setting an earlier base-line for\n            example, at project appraisal stage will probably highlight\n            higher over-runs, but it will have blurred the focus by\n            shifting attention to necessarily less accurate upstream\n            estimates of time and cost. The current starting point\n            enables the required focus on the performance of the\n            selected contract teams, including the consultants,\n            contractors, and contract administrators on each package.\n            Two recent World Bank supported road works projects, namely:\n            (i) the road sector assistance project (RSAP), and (ii) the\n            provincial roads project (PRP) were identified for sampling."}, "docdt": "2014-01-01T04:25:04Z"}
