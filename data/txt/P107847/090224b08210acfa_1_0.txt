                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has three components. The first component envisages rehabilitation of 350 km of roads in three provinces (Eastern, Northern and Uva). Component two would carry out
                         road maintenance program. Component three is for institutional capacity building.

                         Three contracts, one in Uva Province (Uva-04) and two in Eastern Province (EP-01, EP-02) have been completed.

                         The progress is as follows:

                         Uva Province:
                         (i) The overall physical progress and financial progress of six contracts (117.6 km) is about is 77% and 72% respectively.
                         (ii) Uva-04 contract is completed at 100%, three contracts Uva-01, Uva-03 and Uva-05 are progressing satisfactorily. Uva-06 was awarded last July and is in the initial stages.
                         However, Uv-02 contract is lagging behind seriously and is problematic.

                         Eastern province:
                         (i) The overall physical and financial progress of five contracts awarded is about 85% and 62% respectively.
                         (ii) Five contracts (56 km) are under implementation. Three of the contracts are almost completed. EP-07 contract was awarded September 2013. However, EP-05 contract is lagging
                         behind and actions are being taken to improve its performance.

                         Northern Province:
                         (i) The overall physical and financial progress for NP-01 and NP-02 is at 94% and 96% respectively.
                         (ii) Bid evaluation for NP-03 and NP-05 contracts is ongoing.
                         (iii) Arbitration proceedings for NP-01 and NP-02 canceled contract is being reviewed due to claim by the contractor and counter claim by PRDD to recover losses.

                         The next implementation support mission is tentatively proposed in February/March 2014.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project Implementation progress rating is satisfactory and financial management has now been upgraded to satisfactory.

                         • Overall cumulative progresses in the three provinces are 70 percent against 82 percent and implementation is progressing satisfactorily.
                         •Thirteen civil works contracts are under implementation in the three provinces, while two are under bidding to be awarded in a month or so. Three contracts, one in Uva (Uva-04) and
                         two in the Eastern province (EP-01, EP-02) have been completed.
                         •Four out of six contracts in Uva province are scheduled to be completed by December, this year and therefore the government is reminded to release adequate funds to make the
                         final payments to the Contractors.
                         •The utility poles at some contract sites (in the EAstern and Uva provinces) need to be moved out or provided with barriers/ visible measures immediately so as not to pose a safety
                         threat.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
