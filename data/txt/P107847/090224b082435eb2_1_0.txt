                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project Implementation progress and financial management ratings are satisfactory.

                         • The physical progress of the contract Uva-02 is about 56% after elapsing over 150% (38 months against 24 months) of the contract period. A two-pronged approach was jointly
                         agreed upon: (i) to allow one more chance to the current contractors to fulfill their commitment and complete the road by Oct 31, 2014; and (ii) in case of failure to meet the targets by
                         April 30, 2014, the current contract will be terminated immediately and a rebidding to award the balance work will be undertaken without a delay.
                         • The safety and environment risks to the public and road users at the Uva-02 site has resulted in downgrading of the environmental safeguards rating.
