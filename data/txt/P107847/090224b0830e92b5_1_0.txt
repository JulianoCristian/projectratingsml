Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Provincial Roads Project has envisaged the rehabilitation of 230 km of provincial roads in three provinces (Eastern, Northern and Uva) that has
 high rates of poverty. It has also supported a road maintenance program in Uva province whilst institutional strengthenning and capacity building has
 been carried out across all provinces as well as the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Authorities that coordinates the the three provinces.

 The overall cumulative physical progress of the Project is 100% against a 100% target in the three project provinces (Uva, Eastern and Northern) for all
 three components (Part A 100%, Part B 100%,Part C 100%).Overall financial progress achieved as of March 31, 2015 has been 92%.

 1.         Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Loan Covenants. The Project has been completed on schedule and has achieved the PDO,
            which is to improve access to socio-economic centers in the Northern, Eastern and Uva through the sustainable management of improved
            road infrastructure. The post project road user satisfaction survey has been completed and the final draft of the Implementation completion
            report has been produced. The re- structuring paper reflecting the change in roads rehabilitation target (from 350km to230km), under Part A of
            the project has been approved. In response to the request of the GOSL received by the Bank on March 30, 2015, a partial credit cancellation
            of USD 2million has been carried out. The disbursement deadline date (grace period) has been extended by 2 months up to September 30,
            2015.
 2.         Project Completion and Closing. All civil works under the project implemented through Part A and B and all of the activities carried out
            through part C have been substantially completed and the project has reached closure on the March 31, 2015.
 Damages suffered by Uva province due to extreme weather condition - Damages suffered through landslides, slope failures, rock falling etc. were
 observed in Uva province and the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) along with the PRDD conducted an investigation of the damaged
 sites on the contracts. NBRO has indicated a total period of 24 months for the investigations and rectification of failures from landslides as well as failure
 of slopes, including procurement of civil works, for which GOSL had requested for an initial extension of project closing date by six months . In
 response, the Bank has recommended that the rectification of all of the damages suffered from extreme weather conditions in Uva province be
 addressed through the Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) that has been specially designed to address resilience for climate related risk
 that is also financed by the WB.

               Substantial amount of in-house capacity has been built within the PRDD's in all three provinces for safeguards and fiduciary management
               and these skills will be retained as the project implmentation units have also been the provincial road departments itself that are
               permarnant.

               The Target value at project closure has been partially achieved. Limited funding has been the main reason for the partial achievement of
               the indicator, which has been affected by the small vehicle population contributing funds through the Vehicle licensing fees that has started
               to grow since the cessation of the conflict in 2009. In addition, the Northern Province has been the first province to set up the RAMS where
               a transparent and technical basis is being used or the selection of roads.

               The GAAP for this project is designed to achieve the following objectives:
               3.        To broaden stakeholder participation in design, monitoring and evaluation of the project;
               4.        To strengthen feedback mechanisms between users and suppliers;
               5.        To bring the decision-making process closer to the beneficiaries; and
               6.        To strengthen the Bank’s attention to and mitigation of fiduciary risks in (i) project design and (ii) project supervision.
               The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (through PCU and PIUs) have implemented the GAAP satisfactorily throughout
               the project design and supervision stage.

               The Northern and Eastern PRDD's are in the process of preparing their maintenance strategies. Uva is in the process of identifying their
               requirements for a Road Asset Management System, after which they will proceed to formulating a maintenance strategy.

               Maintenance plans are developed by all of the provinces to seek budgetary assistance. Progressively they have been more realistic in using
               the necessary technical skills and the Road Asset management Systems
