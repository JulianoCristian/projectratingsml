                         The progress is as follows:

                         Uva Province:
                         (i) The overall physical progress is 73% and financial progress of the five contracts (103 km) of the Province is about 66%.

                         (ii) The four contracts, are progressing reasonably well, three are slightly behind schedule but one Uva-02 is substantially behind while one contract -Uva 04 has been completed and
                         the road handed over.
                         (iii) The bid evaluation of the new contract UVA 06, about 14.5 km long, but was on hold pending resolution of the budget provision issue- now cleared for award.
                         (iv) All the four contracts have been granted extension of time for increase in the quantities and on bad weather account and all these five contracts have cost variations.
                         (v) The periodic maintenance Contracts have been awarded but were slowed down due to a lack of required budget provision by the Government.
                         (vi) The routine maintenance contracts are also progressing. However the budget allocation from the PC to the PRDD is about 50% of the receipt from the vehicle licensing fee.


                         Eastern province:
                         (i) The overall physical, financial progress of the four contracts is about 66% and financial progress is about 54%.
                         (ii) All the four contracts (51 km) have been awarded and are under implementation with behind schedule.
                         (iii) The routine maintenance work is ongoing, however the budget allocation from the PC to the PRDD is less than 50% of the receipt from the vehicle licensing fee.

                         Northern Province:
                         (i) The overall physical progress is at 62%, and financial progress of the four contracts is at about 55% and the progress has picked up in the last few months.
                         (ii) Overall contract awards for civil works are about 90% completed for US$17.64 million with disbursement of US$5.02 million.
                         (iii) The routine maintenance work is ongoing, however the budget allocation from the PC to the PRDD is about 50% of the receipt from the vehicle licensing fee.

                         •        Physical progresses of most contracts in the three provinces has improved since last October and is rated as satisfactory now.
                         •        Lack of required budget provision by the Government (for this 100% financed IDA Credit) has affected the payments to the contractors (component A) and the award of the
                         contracts for the periodic road maintenance (component B). Finanacial Management Rating has therefore been downgraded from Satisfactory to moderately satisfactory; Counterpart
                         Financing has been downgraded from Moderately satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory.
                         •        Allocation of funds to the PRDDs for the routine maintenance, collected through the Vehicle License fee is about 50% which should be 100% as per the agreement.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
