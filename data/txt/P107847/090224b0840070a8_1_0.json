Some lessons\n            learned included: it is critical that good quality detailed\n            engineering designs, bidding documents, environmental, and\n            social safeguards documents are prepared during project\n            preparation and procurement completed for key contracts and\n            consultancies. Enhancing capacity of the internal audit must\n            be given special focus in future projects through\n            institutional strengthening and capacity building component.\n            The local contractors\u2019 capacity was heavily overstretched\n            due to increased amount of funding being channeled in to\n            large infrastructure projects. Ad-measured, item-rate civil\n            works contracts frequently encounter major cost over-runs,\n            due to significant variations in final work quantities and\n            delays in project implementation. The environmental\n            assessment at appraisal should address the vulnerability of\n            roads to landslides. Learning from the experience of\n            landslide stabilization in Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and\n            India, cost-effective soil bioengineering and biotechnical\n            measures for remediating slope instability should have been applied."}, "docdt": "2015-12-28T01:15:01Z"}
