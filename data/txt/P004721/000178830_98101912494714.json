"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Inland Waterways component of the\n            project consists of: (a) increasing the width and depth of\n            the navigation channels in the rivers Chao Phyra and Nan;\n            (b) constructing two river ports at Nakhon Sawan and Taphan\n            Hin; (c) providing a demonstration barge convoy of steel\n            barges and a pusher tug; and (d) consultancy services and\n            training. On completion of the project, the two rivers will\n            be navigable year round with a minimum water depth of 1.7 m,\n            which would help increase the low-cost barge traffic of bulk\n            commodities. About 60-65 percent of all benefits will accrue\n            from transport of rice and maize, the principal export\n            produce of the project region covering 20 changwats and\n            including about 11 million people. The coastal ports\n            component consists of: (a) dredging the entrance channels of\n            two of the more important ports, Bandon and Pattani; (b)\n            technical assistance and procurement of a trailing hopper\n            dredger; (c) geophysical and hydrographic studies to\n            determine spoil dumping areas; and (d) consultancy services\n            and training. Improvement of maintenance dredging capacity\n            and procedures will benefit about 40 coastal ports and their\n            hinterland where shipping and fishing remain principal\n            economic activities."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
