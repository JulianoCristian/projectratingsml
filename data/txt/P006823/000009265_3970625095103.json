in\n            Barranquilla, Colombia's 4th largest city (about 70\n            percent of the beneficiaries of this program reside in the\n            city's lower income areas); and (b) promote the\n            institutional development of Empresas Publicas Municipales\n            de Barranquilla (EPMB) by strengthening its management,\n            administration and operating efficiency.  Such improvements\n            should, in turn, restore the company's financial\n            viability, enabling EPMB, by 1989, to generate sufficient\n            funds from internal sources to finance a reasonable share of\n            its investment requirements.  The project would include the\n            provision of equipment, civil works and technical assistance\n            for these purposes as well as consultants' services for\n            preparation of subsequent network expansion to meet demand\n            in the 1990s."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
