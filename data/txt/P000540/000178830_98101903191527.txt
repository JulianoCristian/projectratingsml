INTERNATIONAL DEVELOR-1ENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESImDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FOR A
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a, proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of the Congo for the equiva-
lent of US$h.O million on standard IDA terms to help finance the estima.ted
foreign exchange costs of a. project for highway maintenance (US$3.4 mil-
lion) and to refund the outstanding balance of Highway Engineering Credit
S-6 COB of 1969 in an amount of US$600,000.
PART I -   INRODUCTION
2.        The Bank Group's first association with what is now the People's
Republic of the Congo (the Congo) dates back to the 1959 loan of US$35.0
million (230-FR), jointly guaranteed by the Congo, France and Gabon, to
help finance the manganese project of the Compagnie Miniere de l'Ggooue
(COMILOG). The mine itself is in Gabon; the ore is transported by a, rail
link t'-rough important forestry areas in the Congo to the Congo.-Ocean
railroa,d near Dolisie for shipment through Pointe Noire (see ma.p attached).
3.        The first lending operation in the Congo, following independence
in 1960, wa,s the loan of US$3000 million to the Compagnie des Pota.sses du
Congo (CPC) (480-COB) in 1967 for a. pota.sh project. The Executive Directors
ha.ve been informed about the serious problems with the project and the
sta.tus of the loan in the Secrcte=yls memorandum of Septem.ber 21, 1971
(SecM71-h56)0 Subsequent operations, which have so fa.r concentrated on
highways and education, are discussed below. A summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits a.s of October 31, 1971,is attached a.s Annex I.
he        Following preparatory studies financed under a, Bank technica,l
assistance grant of $185,000 in 1966, the 1969 highway engineering credit
of $630,000 (S-6 COB) helped to finance three studies, all of which have
been satisfactorily completed at less than the estimated cost, and $30,000
of the credit ha,s been cancelled. The first of these studies wa,s of the
feasibility and detailed engineering of the h0 km Pointe Noire-Bondi roa,d,
which led to the US$1.5 million credit (189-COB) in 1970 for the improve-
ment of a. 35 km Pointe Noire-Nakola. section,, After difficulties in securing
tenders a.t satisfactory prices, the contractor ha,s been selected a.nd work
began in August 1971, Initial problems with the preparation of withdrawa,l
requests are being resolved and disbursements will shortly get under way.
A re-evaluation of the economic justification ha.s shown that, despite the
greatly reduced production by the CPC pota,sh mine, which this road serves,
the economic rate of return of the project will rema,in over 9 percent.



-2-
5.        A decision to go ahea.d with construction of the Sibiti-Zanaga.
roa.d awa.its the resolution of problems delaying construction of the FED-
financed road cornnecting Sibiti to the Congo-Ocean ra.ilwa.y a.t Ja,cob and
of the shorta.ge of capa.city on the ra.ilroa.d itself between Ja.cob and
Pointe Noire. The Bank is Executing-Agency for an on-going UNDP study
of solutions to the railway problemo This study, which is due to be com-
pleted in March 1972, may lea,d to proposals for an IDA credit to finance
deta.iled engineering for tra.ck realignment and the purcha.se of a,dditional
rolling stock and signalling equipment.
60        The third study financed under Credit S-6 COB is the ba.sis for
the highwa.y maintenance project described in Part III below. The project
was a.ppra.ised in the field in March/April 1971, and credit negotiations
were concluded in Wa.shington on October 8. The Congolese delegation wa.s
led by ]4r. Louis-Sylva,in Goma., Minister of Transport and Public Works.
7.        The 1971 credit of US$305 million for an education project
(237-COB) will help to finance (i) the construction, furnishing and
equipment of a, Tea.cher-Training College, a Vocationa.l Training Center,
a. Technician Training Institute, and ten science laboratories; and (ii)
the provision of 26 man-years of technical a.ssistance0 Project imple-
mentation ha.s started: a. Project Unit ha.s been set up in the Ministry of
Education, and sites for some of the buildings ha,ve alrea.dy been selected.
Steps a.re being ta.ken to appoint the technical a.ssista,nce experts.
8.        Although support for improved transport services will continue
to be of high priority and is essential to future a.gricultural and forestry
development, it is important to find wa,ys to help directly in the develop-
ment of agricultura,l production, a,s discussed further in Part II below.
Project identification and preparation is under way and it is hoped to
a.ppra.ise a. livestock project ea,rly in 1972.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
9.        An economic report entitled "The Economy of the People's
Republic of the Congo -- Recent Evolution and Prospects" (AW 26a.,dated
November 18, 1971),ba.sed on the June 1970 mission and subsequent dis-
cussions,is being circula.ted sepa.ra,tely. Country da,ta are contained in
Annex II.



- 3 -
10.      The Congo is well endowed vith natural resources, such as
timber. More recently, oil has been found and commercial exploitation
will start early next year. The population of about one million is
40 percent urban. Per capita income has been estimated at $255 for 1970,
but it is unevenly distributed. The annual growth of GDP during 1963-1967
has been 4 percent in real terms, or 2.4 percent per capita. Growth is
estimated to have slowed down starting in 1968, since major investment
projects had been completed. Timber and timber products have provided
the bulk of export earnings. Prospects for increased timber production
are good, but their realization depends on the expansion of transport
facilities. Although large investments have been made in industry and
mining, the economy is still service-oriented, with the tertiary sector
alone accounting for 57 percent of GDP. This is because Brazzaville,
the capital, was the administrative center for French Equatorial Africa,
because government services steadily increased after independence, and
because Congolese transport facilities serve regional needs.
11.      The dominant feature of the Congolese economy is its position
as an inter-regional transport center. The bulk of the Transequatorial
Route, an almost 3,000 km long road-river-rail network from Chad through
C.A.R.. to Pointe-Noire, is located in the Congo.  Transit traffic accounts
for about 80 percent of total traffic at the river port of Brazzaville,
and about 64 percent at the sea port of Pointe-Noire. Mlore than 50 per-
cent of rail traffic is also transit.  WJith the help of national feeder
roads, the bulk of the Transequatorial Route also serves the CongoWs in-
ternal transport needs.  aLintaining these roads and existing access
roads to remote regions and regions with high economic potential is
urgently required.
12.      In 1969, the Government withdrew from the convention establish-
ing the Agence Transequatoriale des Communications (ATEC), a multi-
national transport agency jointly established with the C.A.R., Gabon, and
Chad. The Government took over ATECts transport facilities located on
its territory and set up a national agency, the Agence Transcongolaise
des Communications (ATC), to run them. ATC is continuing transport
services to the former ATEC partners under a series of bilateral agree-
rnents which have led to satisfactory cooperation.
13       Agriculture is less important in the Congo than in most
other African countries. The rural sector, excluding forestry, contri-
butes only 10 percent of GDP at current market prices, and only 6 per-
cent of exports. Agriculture and forestry together nevertheless pro-
vide a living for about 60 percent of the population. The Government
is still testing various approaches to modernizing agriculture, such as
mechanized state farms, smallholder development, etc. Reliable year-
round access to the agricultural hinterlands through improved road mmin-
tenance would certainly contribute to removing one of the obstacles to
agricultural development.



1h.       As stated in the economic report, there are many opportunities
for investment and development in the Congo, notably in forestry, agro-
industries and minerals. The Government ha,s not yet completed the final
version of the Intermedia.te Three-Year Development Plan it intended to
issue in mid-1971. In the absence of a development plan,the June 1970
economic mission analyzed a tentative list of projects totalling CFAF 90
billion, which a, consultant to the Government had prepared earlier, and
concluded that a program of about CFAF 72 billion over five years
would be fea.sible0 This figure, which takes into account the serious
financial resource constraints (see next paragraph under (a)), and
includes CFAF 20 billion of investment by the foreign-owned petroleum
sector, constitutes a. considerable investment target for a. country of
the size of the Congo,
15.       Growth prospects depend a.mong other things on:
(a)   ability of the Congo to generate a.ga.in sufficient public
sa.vings. After many years of current budget surpluses, the Congo's 1970
budget wa.s in deficit due to a. decrea.se in tax revenues and an increa.se
in current expenditures, and the Government is aware that in pa,rticula.r
further increa.ses in expenditures for personnel will have to be limited
and additional mea.sures to increa.se public revenues will have to be taken;
(b)   reorganization and the reduction of losses of the state
enterprises;
(c)   continued ability of ATC to provide reliable and efficient
service for the country and its neighbors;
(d)   improvement of the process of planning and alloca,ting
resources in relation to a. ra.tional set of priorities in the productive
sectors;
(e)   adaptation of education to the manpower needs of the
economy; and
(f)   need to continue to attract foreign private investment
within the framewlork of a. mixed econcmy.
16,        In view of the fa.vorable petroleum and timber export prospectsj
and a.ssuming an inflow of public external capital at current levels, the
balance of payments in the nea.r future will be mana.geable if the level of
imports continues to be kept under controlo Congots trade deficits are
offset by payments for transport services and inflows of foreign ca.pital,
and are therefore not significant.
170       Congo's development prospects are better than in most Africa,n
countries, because of her endowrent  with natural and trained human resources,
but even with a, sustained effort to'generate public savings, the Congo will
ha.ve to rely heavily on external assistance to sustain an adequate rate of
growth. However, a,t present, Congo's creditworthiness is severely constrained
by a. high debt burden, and external a,ssistance a.t this time should so fa.r a,s
possible be on concessionary terms.

18.       Apart from the establishment of ATO (para 12 above), the Con-
golese Government has undertaken a number of nationalizations. The sta-
tus of settlement is as follows:
(a) Societe Equatoriale d'Energie Electrique (SEEE) --
Agreement has been reached.
(b)  Union Electrique dtOutre-Mer (UIELCO) -- the Government
has recognized the principle of compensation;but agreement
has yet to be reached on the valuation of assets.
(c) Compagnie Africaine des Services Publics (CASP) -- the
Government has similarly recognized the principle of com-
pensation, but agreement has not yet been reached on the
valuation of assets.
(d) Compagnie G4n4rale de Transports en Afrique Equatoriale
(CGTAE) -- The Governments of the Congo and C.A.R., -w,ho
both nationalized CGTAE, have reached a common position.
The outstanding issues concern the valuation of the
assets of the Company, benefits for Headquarters staff,
and the terms of payment of the compensation. Discussions
between Congo, C.AeRo, and the Company were resumed in
February 1971, and another meeting was planned for November
1971.
(e) Societe Industrielle et Agricole du Niari - Soci4t6
Sucri6re du Niari (SIAN - SOSUNIARI) -- the Government has
endorsed the outstanding debts. Agreement has been reached
with Caisse Centrale de CooDpration Economique on the
payment of all obligations and with Compagnie Francgaise
d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext6rieur on short-term debts.
The Government has recognized the shareholders' right to
compensation. Before negotiations can begin, the Company
has to submit financial data and balance sheets up to
September 25, 1970, the date of nationalization.
The Bank will continue to follow closely the progress made in the settle-
ment of these investment disputes.
PART III - THE PROJECT
l90       The highway network is a feeder to the rail and river system and
ensures communication with remote and sparsely populated regions. This
network of about 11,000 km is extensive, with 11 km per 1,000 inhabitants,
compared with 15 km in C.A.R., 9 in Chad, and 4 in Cameroon. However, most
of the roads have low design standards and are in poor condition. Only
1,500 km out of the 8,300 km of classified roads provide all-weather ser-
vice.



Since major upgrading is not justified at present, improved maintenance is
the best way to satisfy the need for reliable road transport. This is the
purpose of the present project.
20.       The project consists of a four-year highway maintenance program
(1972-1975), which consultants would help implement, and provides for:
(i) reorganization and strengthening of the road
maintenance organization;
(ii) comprehensive training of personnel;
(iii) overhaul of the existing equipment fleet and
procurement of additional equipment; and
(iv) extension and renovation of workshops for
equipment maintenance.
Reorganization
21.       Administration, maintenance, and improvement of the classified
highway network is the responsibility of the Regie Nationale des Transports
et des Travaux Publics (RNTP), which operates under the direct supervision
of the Miinister of Transport and Public IWorks. The RNTP budget is estab-
lished as a separate accournt within the Treasury under the joint authority
of the Director General of RNTP and of the ianister of Finance and Budget.
RNTP's revenues are mainly derived from government contributions and special
taxes on fuel, lubricants, and timber production. RNTP personnel number about
1,450, including laborers. Of RNTP's 22 engineers, nine are Congolese, and
13 are French provided by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). Congolese
students are presently receiving engineering training abroad and about 20
are expected to graduate in the next five years.
22.       Ihe project will focus on improving the efficiency of the RNrP by
introducing a clear demarcation between highway maintenance and other activiX
ties and by reorganizing its maintenance operations. To this effect, the
Government confirmed during negotiations that: (i) the administration and
maintenance of the highway network will be RNTP's prime responsibility;
(ii) the provisions made in the RNTP budget for highway maintenance will be
used exclusively for that purpose; and (iii) other services and works per-
formed by RFiTP for the Government or for the private sector will be accounted
for separately and financed out of funds specifically provided to RNTP for
this purpose.
23.       The thrust of the proposed reorgarization is to regroup RNTP opera-
tions and concentratethem on about 4,600 km of roads of economic and
administrative importance.   Regional authorities, with RNTP's technical
assistance and with equipment leased from its Equipment Divislon, will
maintain the remaining roads.   The thirteen RNTP field subdivisions will be
regrouped into seven. Enactment of the decrees necessary for the reclassifi-
cation of the highway network and the reorganization of RNTP is a condition
of effectiveness of the credit.



-7-
24.     The Road  Maintenance Division of the RNTP, which was created
recently at BCEOMIs recommendation, will be responsible for planning
and supervising highway maintenance works carried out by the field
subdivisions. An adequate cost accounting system for maintenance works
will be introduced to provide a basis for relating expenditures to the
type and volume of work performed, and to evaluate the efficiency of
operations. The improved costing methods will also be used for budget
preparation.
25.     To improve the management and maintenance of highway maintenance
equipment, the RNTP equipment fleet and the subdivision workshops will be
placed under the responsibility of the Equipment Division. Existing
equipment inspection services will be strengthened to ensure proper super-
vision of workshops and equipment and to speed the delivery of spare parts.
The subdiviCi'ns will lease the equipment fromn the Equipment Division at
rentals sufficient to ensure that the expanded Equipment Division is
provided with sufficient funds to renew the equipment, to order spare parts,
and to carry out necessary repairs.
26.     An Office of Organization and Methods will be created and attached
to the Director General of the RIITP to plan, coordinate, and supervise
the execution of the program.   This office will also introduce adequate
reporting methods, monitor the introduction of the new accounting system,
and reorganize the RNJTP budget. iMaintenance works and other RNTP activities
will be budgeted, and accounted for, separately.
27.     The reorganization plan outlined above is well suited to the
RNTP and should improve the supervision of its road maintenance operations
and the use of its equipment.   The Government has agreed to implement
this plan and also to ensure that:
(i)  the field inspection services of the Road Maintenance
and Equipment Divisions w,ill be strength--ed and
provided with adequate stcif a,id equiplrlent; Lnd
(ii)  the RNTP budget will include specific and adequate
provisions for purchase of spare parts, maintenance
equipment repair and renewal, to be administered by
the Equipment Division.



-8-
Training of Persomnel
28.      A comprehensive training program has been drawn up to retrain
all RNTP maintenance personnel periodically and to select and train
field foremen and workshop supervisors. The program will familiarize
personnel with the new organization and introduce proper guidelines
for road maintenance works and equipment maintenance.
29.      A shopwork training center (CATP - Centre dtApplication des
Techniques des Travaux Publics) will be established on the premises
of the central workshops in Brazzaville. Each category of personnel
will undergo one to three monthsr sessions, including formal instruc-
tion and on-the-job training.
30       The RITP professional staff will be trained through close asso-
ciation with the work of the consultants. Complementary practical
training abroad will be provided for staff assigned to responsible posi-
tions in RNTP. The consultants will assist the Government in finding
suitable training opportunities.
Maintenance equipment
31       The project will provide the necessary spare parts to eliminate
a backlog of equipment repair, and a limited quantity of new equipment
designed to improve the efficiency of the mechanized units. This in-
cludes graders, fuel tankers to supply and service mechanized units,
and light trucks and general purpose vehicles for better communications
between the units and the subdivision and for inspection and spare
parts delivery.
vvorkshops and Buildings
32.      The workshops and buildings to be constructed under the pro-
ject have been limited to those elements strictly required for the
establishment of the new organization and the execution of the program.
The workshops of the seven subdivisions will be renovated and equipped
with necessary tools and equipment. Radio communication equipment will
be provided to extend the present RNTP radio communication system to the
northern subdivisions. Workshops will be constructed for the newly
established subdivision of Kinkala and for the subdivision of Pointe
Noire, which is being relocated at the outskirts of the city. The
central workshop in Brazzaville will be expanded and a number of old
machine tools will be replaced.   Offices and sheds will be built for
the Equipment livision and for the Training Center.
Technical Assistance
33.      Technical assistance is required to initiate and supervise the
highway maintenance program. A team of nine experts will be provided
under the project to assist the RNTP in carrying out its program.   These



experts will be required for VLry-Lng period.s up to 40 months, totaling
about 260 man-months.   Seven of them will work- within the RUTP. Two
experts provided under the project, one engineer and one technician,
will be responsible for setting up and operating the Training Center.

rience in similar cases and a draft proposal presented by BCMI01.



- 10 -
36.      A contingency allotexalice has been provided to cover a price
escalation of 5 percent per annum for the foreign exchange and the local
components of the project, on the basis of recent trends in equipment
prices, consultants' services and domestic construction costs. The con-
tingency for possible physical overruns amounts to 10 percent for equip-
ment and tools, 15 percent for construction, and 10 percent for consul-
tantst services.
Financing and Disbursements
37.      The proposed credit will finance the foreign exchange component
of the project,estimated at US$3.4 million equivalent, or 80 percent of
the project cost, and in addition refund the outstanding balance of $600,000
of Credit S6-COB. In addition to meeting the local costs of US$850,000 or 20
percent of the project cost, including some US$400,000 of taxes, the Govern-
ment has agreed to keep annual budgetary allocations for highway maintenance
at an adequate level to meet recurrent maintenance costs. These are expected
to increase from CFAF 800 million in 1972 to CFAF 950 million in 1976.
Appropriate shares of this budget will be allocated to the RNTP and to the
local authorities for their respective tasks. The minimum amount to be
allocated to equipment renewal would be CFAF 115 million in 1972, rising
to CFAF 130 million in 1976. The proposed amounts are in line with the
level of highway maintenance expenditures over the last few years and
are about equal to the optimum requirements as defined by BCECM in the
highway maintenance study.
38.      Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the following
basis:
(i)  c.i.f. cost of equipment, tools, and spare parts;
(ii)  60 percent of contractorst invoices for the con-
struction of workshops and buildings representing
the estimated foreign exchange comrponent; and
(iii)  foreign exchange costs of consultants' services as
identified in their contract.
Execution and Procurement
39.      The Government (through its Ministry of Transport and Public
Works) will cause the project to be carried out by RNTP. Procurement
will be in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Bidding documents for
equipment, tools, and spare parts will be prepared by the equipment
experts provided by the consultants and will be submitted to IDA for re-
view. The RNTP Engineering Division, with the assistance of the equipment
experts, wTill prepare he plans for construction of workshops and buildings.



40.      The Govermment has selected BCEOM to provide the technical
assistance services under the project.   Since BCECM satisfactorily
carried out the highway maintenance study that served as a basis for
the project, this selection is appropriate.   The Government and the
consultants are presently discussing terms and conditions.    Signature
of a contract is a condition for effectiveness of the credit.
41.      The maintenance program will be carried out over the period
1972-75.   The first year will be devoted to procurement, construction,
headquarters reorganization and installation of the training center.
During the second and third year, the reorganization will be extended to
the field subdivisions and staff training will begin.   The fourth year
will be the first year of normal operations during which it is expected
that Congolese staff wrill gradually take over the responsibilities of
the consultants.   After the third year the progress of the project will
be reviewed with a view to assessing the possible need for further tech-
nical assistance.
421.     The project wjill improve the productivity of the RIJTP labor
force through organizational reforms and training.   It will not entail
significant changes in the overall number of people employed in highway
maintenance since the improved methods to be introduced under the project
will not alter the labor content of highway maintenance operations.
Highway maintenance is not a suitable field in Congo for the development
of -;nployment opportunities since there is no surplus labor in the rural
areas where most of the additional manpower, required for more labor-
intensive maintenance methods, would have to be recruited.    The con-
struction of the workshops and buildings will provide employment for
150 to 200 workers for a period of about six months.
Economic Justification
43.      The purpose of the four-year highway maintenance program is
to reduce road user costs and provide reliable year-round access to
agricultural hinterlands.   WlJhile road transport plays a secondary role
in the transport system as a whole, its effective functioning is vital
to the economy.   Roads act as a feeder to the railway system in the
south and to the rivers in the north and also provide the only means of
communication for many of the remote population centers.    Since traffic
volumes are generally light, major road improvements cannot be justified
at this time.   Improved maintenance appears the appropriate way to
provide more reliable road transport at reduced costs.
844      The economic evaluation has been designed to (i) determine the
level of resources which would most suitably be allocated to highway
maintenance; and (ii) evaluate the economic returns of the proposed
program by comparing it in terms of investment outlays, incremental
maintenance expenditures and road-user savings'to the alternative of
perpetuating the present situation.

45.      The economic life of the project has been estimated at 10
years, reflecting the weighited average of the ecoromoic lives of the inter-
dependent elements making up the program. Assuming an annual traffic
growth of 6 percent, the internal economic return of the project is about
20 percent.
46.      In estimrating future traffic volurres, the assumed annual rate of
growth (6 percent) is substantially below the estimates of the consultants.
If, however, traffic were to grow at only 4 percent p.a., which appears to
be very conservative, the rate of return would be 14 percent, which is
still satisfactory.
47.      A further analysis has taken into account the cost of possible
additional technical assistance services after the project is completed.
Assuming that five experts would be required for another four-year period,
1976-1979, at an annual cost of CFAF 56 million (US$200,000), the rate of
return of the project would be still 17 percent for a traffic growth of 6
percent, and 11 percent for a traffic growth of 4 percent. Thus, the re-
turn of the project would be only marginally reduced if continuing techni-
cal assistance were required.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUI4ENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.      The draft Credit Agreement between the People's Republic of the
Congo and the Association, the Reccmmendation of the Comimittee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associationj
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.      The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits
for highway mnaintenance projects. Conditions of effectiveness are the en-
actment of the decrees to reclassify the national road system and to reorgan-
ize the RNTP, and signature of the contract for consulting services.
50.      I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreemnent of the Association.
PART V - RECUIDENDATION
51.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
