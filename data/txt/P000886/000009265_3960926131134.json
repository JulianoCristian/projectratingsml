Further to this, the project includes (d) pilot\n            programs to support the road transport industry and low cost\n            rural transport; and (e) technical assistance to the\n            National Planning Commission.  The main project benefit will\n            be a more efficient and cost effective transport system that\n            permits a higher level of economic activity in the country\n            and higher employment.  The project will help remove some of\n            the physical constraints in transport, reduce transport\n            costs for goods and passengers, and will effectively improve\n            exports, farm production, and the mobility of people."}, "docdt": "1987-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
