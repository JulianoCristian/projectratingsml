The transport sector had deteriorated badly, and\n            the road network was in such poor condition that it hindered\n            the government's 1983 economy recovery program. Since\n            1987, the World Bank has aided the country's transport\n            sector with three projects designed to raise the\n            sector's efficiency, and expand exports and farm\n            production. The projects helped build and repair thousands\n            of kilometers of roads, and succeeded in removing transport\n            bottlenecks, promoting market-oriented reforms, and\n            improving public sector management and resource allocation."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
