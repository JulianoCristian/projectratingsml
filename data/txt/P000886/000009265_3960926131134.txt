MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND TIHE INTFRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCITrION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 46.9 MILLION (US$60.0 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the Repub-
lic of Ghana for SDR 46.9 million (US$60.0 million equivalent) is st-bmitted
for approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years, and wouild assist in financing a nationwide project to
rehabilitate the transport sector in Ghana.
2.        Background and Strategy.  After a decade of neglect, Ghana's trans-
port system is in extremely poor shape.   It comprises about 28,000 km of
roads; a vehicle fleet of some 74,000 units; a 947-km railway linking the
country's three major cities (Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi) among themselves and
with the two main ports; two deepwater ports at Tema and Takoradi; a national
shipping company, the Black Star Line; a small inland water transport system
on the Volta Lake; one international airport at Accra and three main domestic
airports; and a national airline, Ghana Airways, providirg international,
regional  and  domestic  air  transport  services.   Although  t'te extent  and
configuration of the system is indeed adequate, even too generous, the state
of maintenance and operation of virtually all infrastructure and equipment is
deplorable   Important improvements have recently been made on all fronts,
particularly in railways and ports, through ongoing projects, but much more
remains to be done to regain adequate sector management, rebuild institutions
and rehabilitate and maintain infrastructure and equipment.
3.        Project Objectives.  The aim of the project is to sustain and help
consolidate the momentum of economic recovery by (a) removing physical bottle-
necks to expanding exports, farm production and labor mobility through better
maintenance and rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure;  (b) raising
the efficiency of the transport seccor through promotion of market-oriented
policies, increased involvement of the private sector, institutional support,
and  essential  technical  assistance  and  t7aining;  (c) facilitating  rural
transport by promoting appropriate low-cost technology; and (d) ultimately,
reducing transportation costs for both goods and passengers.
4.        Project Description.  The main thrust of the project will be (a) in-
frastructure rehabilitation, mainly in roads (73% of total project costs) and
railways (22%), with associated technical assistance; (b) support to sector
institutions and reforms (3%); and (c) pilot programs in support of small
scale private road transport and low-cost rural transport (2%).  Infrastruc-
ture sub-components under (a) are:  (i) an expanded nationwide two-vear road
maintenance program (1988-89); (ii) rehabilitation of the K'xmasi-Paga road,
Ghana's main link to the north; (iii) rehabilitation of priority bridges; and
(iv) essential rehabilitation of railway track and signalling. Sector support
under (b) will include:   (i) strengthening the planning and implementation
division of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC), and support
for infrastructure planning by the National Planning Commission (NPC); (ii)
organizational reforms at MTC; (iii) strengthening the Department of Feeder
Roads; (iv) technical assistance to the rewly established Ghana Civil Aviation
Authority (GCAA); tv) sector policy studies and reforms; (vi) sector-wide
training programs covering Government officials and private sector road
transport agencies; and (vii) improvement of road safety and traffic



management,  a critical need  in Ghana.   Under (c), pilot  lines of credit
admiristered through Ghanaian commercial banks will: (i) help small-scale
private workshop operators to buy tools and equipment so as to improve vehicle
maintenance and help rehabilitate old vehicle fleets; (ii) assist road
transport operators to build and operate a pilot commercial freight terminal
as a common-user facility; and (iii) promote introduction of small farm
vehicles, successful in India and China for evacuation of crops, and other
non-motorized transport such as bicycle-trailers and their adaptations for use
in rural areas and small towns.
5.        The total project cost is estimated at US$213.8 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$148.8 m  (68%).   Total finanicing
requirement including interest during construction is US$222-4 m equivalent.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Government expects a total cofinancing of US$100.5 m equivalent from Italy,
Canada, Japan and Airican Development Bank. The IDA-financed components will
not be adversely affected by some delay in finalizing the cofinancing
components.  Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement as vell as
the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group Operations in Ghana are shown
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps IBRD 20627, 20609 and 20629 shows
the road and railway systems and main project components. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 6912-GH, dated November 10, 1987 is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.   This project will complement and
reinforce IDA's ongoing assistance to Ghana in various sectors, which is
beginning to pay off in a quickened pace of economic recovery. It is based on
the transport se-tor strategy evolved between IDA and the Government in 1985
and is a logical sequel to earlier credits dedicated to better maintenance,
rehabilitation and more efficient management in this crucial sector.  IDA's
help is needed not only to encourage and ensure appropriate policy reform but
also to attract co-f'nancing support for the priority physical investments
that still need to be made under the Government's core transport rehabili-
tation program.
7.        Actions Agreed.  There are already agreements between the Government
and IDA on basic reforms in the trarsport sector introduced in recent IDA
credits.   These include annual review with IDA of Government's three-year
transport expenditure plans; phased reduction of excess staff in port and road
agencies; reorganization of the Ministry of Roads and Highways; and
establishment of a Road Fund based on new taxes on fuel to finance road
maintenance.  The following further agreements have been made in connection
with this project: (a) assurance of overall annual funding levels during
1988-90 for road maintenance from Road Fund and other budget allocations, with
a condition for quarterly advance payment, by the Government, of needed
maintenance funds into the road maintenance accounts of GRA and DFR, and
withholding of IDA disbursement for road maintenance if the agreed advance
payments are delayed; (b) elimination of operating subsidies for the railways
by 1991 and achievement of full financial viability by about 1995, thus
reducing working ratio from 220% in 1986 to 93% in 1991 and 76% in 1995,
through increase in efficiancy, reduction of staff and other measures; and the
signing of a Performance Agreement (Contract Plan) by September 1988 between
Government and GRC setting out performance and efficiency targets and giving
greater autonomy to GRC to function on commercial lines; (c) organizational
reforms in the Ministry of Transport and Communications; (d) agreement with
the Bank before September 30, 1988, on actions to streamline transport regula-
tions and to improve conditions for private sector transport operations in the
light of a road transport sector study being finalized; (e) setting up before



June 30, 1988, of a Transport Policy Review Committee with representatives
from Government, Chamber of Commerce and private transport agencies to regu-
larly review mutual problems in transport services and transport market opera-
tions;  (f) continuation until 1992 of annual joint review of Government's
three-year Public Investment Programs and annual public expenditure programs
in the transport sector; (g) prior consultation with IDA before undertaking
major new transport projects exceeding US$5 m equivalent per project; and
(h) various project  implementation arrangements.   Two conditions of credit
effectiveness are: Government payment into the Road Maintenance Accounts of
GHA and DFR (i) ar least 70% of the original 1987 budget for periodic road
maintenance (tbe estimated 70% amount being 2.66 billion cedis for the year),
and (ii) an initial amount of 700 million cedis to meet astimated road
maintenance needs for the first quarter of 1988.
8.        Justification and Risks.  The main benefit of the project will be a
more efficient and cost-effective transport sector that permits a higher level
of economic activity in the country.  Better sector policies and management,
and the removal of physical constraints, will effectively help exports, farm
production and marketing.  Economic return fr-m overall project is about 34%,
ranging from 25% for railway rehabilitation to 70% for bridge rehabilitation.
There are no significant risks associated with the physical components of the
project. The main risk relates to GRC's ability co improve its management and
to implement the financial and administrative measures, including staff
reductions, required to ensure its financial viability. Other risks relate to
the problem that may arise from Government delays in providing adequate flow
of local funds to GRC and for the road maintenance component.  These risks
will be minimized at GRC by the formulation of a Contract Plan that will
define the obligations of GRC and of the Government. For the road maintenance
component the risk will be minimized by credit conditions to withhold IDA
funds if local funding is not evailable, further reinforced by SAC conditions
already negotiat-d.   For the other components the risks are small and the
potential benefits  outweigh  the associated  risks.   Overall,  project  risk
appears moderate and acceptable.
9.        Recommendation.   I am satisfied  that  the proposed  credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
