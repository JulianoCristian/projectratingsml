to promote\n            efficiency of rural financial intermediation through\n            introduction of sound, market-oriented policies, and\n            development of the main institutions concerned with rural\n            savings mobilization and lending.  The project funds will be\n            used to provide subloans to expand production of commercial\n            agricultural products including crops, livestock and\n            fisheries, and for agroprocessing and marketing facilities\n            mainly in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, five\n            provinces of Shaanxi, Lianoning, Jilin, Jiangxi and\n            Guangdong, and Beijing municipality.  The project also\n            provides technical assistance to the Agricultural Bank of\n            China to continue its institutional development, focussing\n            on broader issues in financial management, loan policies and\n            procedures, management information system, and human\n            resource development, and make important contributions to\n            special emphasis areas including environment protection and\n            poverty alleviation."}, "docdt": "1990-10-09T00:00:00Z"}
