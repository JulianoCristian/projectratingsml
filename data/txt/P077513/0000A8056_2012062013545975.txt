                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Basing its activities on a national plan and on good international practices, the project has largely attained its development objectives, in spite of some moderate shortcomings. The
                         project has strengthened the health system, including through training and capacity building for dealing with HIV/AIDS and STI. It has strengthened M&E and has developed safe
                         blood banking. It has facilitated the development of relevant policies. In addition to strengthening the public sector response, it has enhanced the response of the civil society through

                         micro-projects, community participation, and the private sector through a realistic multi-sectoral approach which has reduced the impact of HIV/AIDS. The project has mobilized
                         partnerships and a joint UN response.

                         Given the fact that the relevance of the project objectives, design and implementation is rated Substantial, the efficacy of achieving the PDOs is Moderate, and the efficiency
                         considered Substantial, the overall performance of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
