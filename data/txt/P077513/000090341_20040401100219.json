support actions by the Government of the\n            Congo to low the spread of HIV-AIDS, and Strengthen support\n            and care for people infected or affected by HIV-AIDS. The\n            project has the following four components: Component 1)\n            Sub-component 1A is to improve the health system so that it\n            can respond to medical aspects of the epidemic and prevent\n            HIV transmission, particularly through safe blood\n            transfusion and better bio-security in general.\n            Sub-component 1B) The National Strategic Plan for the fight\n            against HIV-AIDS also sets forth the response of ministries\n            other than the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP)\n            which have under vulnerable groups and at-risk sectors under\n            their jurisdiction. The project supports these ministries.\n            Component 2) Will support efforts that emerge from civil\n            society to prevent the spread and to reduce the impact of\n            HIV-AIDS. These efforts may come from local institutions\n            such as NGOs, community-based organizations including\n            faith-based organizations and parent-teacher associations,\n            as well as trade unions, and to a degree, the private\n            sector. Component 3) HIV-AIDS, civil conflict, and the\n            decline of the public health system all contributed to the\n            emergence of a large and growing cohort of orphans and other\n            extremely vulnerable children (OVC) in the Congo. This\n            component addresses the OVC issue at a meaningful scale by\n            investing in the health, education and overall well-being of\n            these children. Component 4) Sub-component 4A) Will\n            strengthens the capacity of the Congo to fight against\n            HIV/AIDS by supporting the CNLS, and its Permanent Executive\n            Secretariat. Sub-component 4B) Will supports capacity\n            strengthening and training (and supply of related equipment\n            and materials) in the CNLS and its Permanent Executive\n            Secretariat, in Government ministries, and in civil society.\n            Sub-component 4C) Monitoring & Evaluation. This\n            subcomponent follows a plan developed under the Project\n            Preparation Facility. Sub-component 4D): Data collection at\n            the national level. Because of instability and civil\n            conflict, no one has collected systematic health and\n            demographic data for the past 10 years. These data are\n            necessary for rational planning of investments in health and\n            in the fight against HIV-AIDS and for monitoring &\n            evaluation. Therefore this component will support a Congo\n            demographic and health survey."}, "docdt": "2004-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
