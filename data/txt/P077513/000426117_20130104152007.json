development\n            outcome was modest, the Banks performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Over the past decade, the Government of Congo has\n            systematically promoted appropriate institutional\n            arrangements and participatory mechanism for testing, care,\n            treatment, education, counseling and reducing discrimination\n            against those affected by the virus. Concerns, however,\n            about the financial future and sustainability on the\n            national response level remain.  The Congo HIV/AIDS and\n            Health Project was characterized by delays in planning,\n            budgeting, and effectiveness in implementation of the\n            Project. Lessons learned from the implementation of the\n            HIV/AIDS and Health Project include: (A) Strong political\n            commitment is critical to establishing an enabling\n            environment to address the HIV/AIDS challenge in\n            post-conflict situations. (B) Strengthening management\n            capacity and promoting innovation are essential to achieve\n            results in low-capacity post-conflict environments. (C)\n            Ensuring the evidence basis for and the appropriateness of\n            indicators of project achievement is key to HIV/AIDS program\n            management. Overall, the Project has made it possible to\n            establish the basis of the national response to the fight\n            against HIV/AIDS in Congo through its contribution to\n            financing of the various strategic frameworks."}, "docdt": "2012-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
