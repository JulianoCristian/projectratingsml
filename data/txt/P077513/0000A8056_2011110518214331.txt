                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities to attain PDOs and activities have been focused on improving knowledge to limit the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs through: (i) a recently completed behavioral
                         change study on commercial sex workers to map the location of prostitution in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire thereby better targeting prevention interventions for this high risk group;
                         (ii) an HIV/AIDS and STIs prevalence survey of Men who have sex with Men (MSM) and of prisoners to be completed by December 2011 will provide similar data for these two high

                         risk groups; (iii) strong implementation dialogue and collaboration among all stakeholders involved in the HIV/AIDS and STIs response, including payment of counterpart funds has
                         been sustained throughout implementation with strong government and donor involvement; (iv) strong government sustenance of a credible national coordinating organ (SEP/CNLS)
                         with fully operational decentralized units has built sustainable national capacity for the multi-sector decentralized HIV/AIDS response now funded by participating donors; (v) the law
                         protecting the legal rights of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) was signed by the President on June 3, 2011 and its dissemination nationwide should be completed by end November
                         2011; (vi) greater collaborative work between SEP/CNLS and key sectors (e.g. Ministry of Health (MoH) M&E, academia, private sector and civil society) has enhanced the
                         integration of HIV testing, counseling, preventive treatment, MTCT and TB programs; improved joint annual monitoring and review of all project activities.
