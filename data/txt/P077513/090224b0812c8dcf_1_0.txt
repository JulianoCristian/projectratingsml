                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is one to last before the closing of the project on June 30, 2012. Data available as of September 30, 2011 show that the project has accomplished a lot in terms of outcome
                         and intermediate indicators. For example: (i) The Number of PLWHA benefiting fromARV treatment is 16,579 (end of project target at 15,000), (ii) The percentage of pregnant women
                         living with HIV who received ARVs to reduce MTCT is at 83% (end of project target is 80%), (iii) The number of active support organizations for OVC reached the end of project of 17,

                         (iv) The number of regional HIV/AIDS units (UDLS) reporting annually on at least 75% of M&E indicators is 11 (end of project target is 12), (v) The percentage of blood units used for
                         transfusion screened for HIV, HBV, and syphilis is currently 100% (end of project target is 100%), (vi) The law protecting PLWHA has been signed into law by His Excellence the
                         President of the Republic of Congo on June 3, 2011, (vii) The number of uniformed persons reached by HIV/AIDS messages reached 5,215 against an end of project target at 2,500,
                         and (viii) The number of private enterprises that offer HIV/AIDS services to workers is now at 46, well over the end of project target at 40.

                         However, it will be impossible for the project to provide assistance to 25,200 OVC when only 14,864 have benefited from such assistance so far. Similarly, the percentage of males
                         using a condom during their last sexual contact with a casual partner is currently at 27.9% and that will not reach the level of 60% expected at the end of the project. This is the same
                         for females. The percentage of the population reached through HIV/AIDS IEC/BCC radio/ television programs has remained stationary at 53.9% since 2004 and will certainly not
                         reach the 90% target by the end of the project.

                         The multi-sectoral approach has been previously supported by the project through financial and technical assistance to the SEP/CNLS. This multisectoral approach to HIV mitigation
                         will continue to be supported as the different UDLS put in place by the project will be supported by the Global Fund Round 9, which started on 1 December 2011. Also many Units for
                         the Fight against AIDS (ULS) in the various key Ministries that have been supported by the project currently have a budget line dedicated to HIV/AIDS activities.

                         Given the fact that the relevance of the project objectives, design and implementation is rated significant, the efficacy of achieving the PDOs is moderate, and the efficiency is
                         significant, the overall performance of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
