Lessons learned are as\n            follows. Since the risk that Congress would not enact all of\n            the envisaged legislation was not only recognized, but was\n            actually a main subject of discussion during negotiations,\n            the explicit mention (on the President Report) of such risks\n            should have specified the enactment of contentious\n            legislation into the conditionality of the operation.\n            Moreover, given that monitoring, and enforcement of\n            implementation is particularly difficult in a complex,\n            multi-tranche adjustment operation, specifically in light of\n            uncertain supportive legislative reforms, the effectiveness\n            of some regulatory changes related to large banks remains\n            questionable, possibly the credibility itself of such\n            changes. Thus it is fair to say, that cutting losses, and\n            canceling should be readily employed, much preferable if\n            solutions are unlikely to achieve the development objective,\n            a conclusion which should have been reached much earlier.\n            While restructuring is also an option to consider,\n            preferable to allowing difficult issues to continue, it is\n            suggested that single-tranche operations may be preferable\n            to multi-tranche operations, to avoid actions beyond the\n            control of the executive."}, "docdt": "2001-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
