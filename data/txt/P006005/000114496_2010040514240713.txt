Description of the Project
The objectives of the Project are:
 
(a)
implementation of appropriate financial management reforms that will 
transform provincial governments from generators of public sector current account
deficits
(as defined in the Manual) to generators of current account surpluses (as 
defined in the Manual) that may finance public infrastructure and services necessary 
to promote economic development;
(b)
strengthening of provincial governments' capacity to plan, program, 
finance, execute and monitor expenditure programs that are economically efficient,
financially sustainable, institutionally manageable, and environmentally sound; and
(c)
improving the provincial infrastructure and public services through 
technical assistance and physical investments that are consistent with the Borrower's
national adjustment program and that will promote economic development.
 
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications
thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such
objectives;
Part A:
 
Execution by Provinces and Eligible Provincial Entities of Eligible Sub-projects 
aimed at supporting institutional development, through technical assistance, training
and acquisition and utilization of professional equipment and software, and improving
public services and infrastructure through physical investments that are part of
approved FAIPs, including maintenance programs, rehabilitation, completion of
unfinished works, and new works.
 
Part B:
 
A technical assistance and training program to support the Borrower in: (i) 
promoting provincial institutional development;
(ii)
proposing, evaluating and
monitoring provincial financial reforms and investment programs
(including
environmental screening and assessment); (iii) designing and putting into effect a 
provincial financial management information system at the federal level; and

(including the

Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of the Special Account

3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account

On the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower for a deposit or

amounts, as shall have been justified by the evidence supporting the request for such
deposit furnished pursuant to paragraph

Conditions and paragraph
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
 
(ii)
the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories minus the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section
5.02

Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph
2

(ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, deposit
into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an 
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or
justified.

the Borrower has made such deposit or refund.
 
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account and immediate
cancellation.
