GHANA REHABILITATION PROJE^T
CREDIT AND PRO.JECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                The Republlc of Ghana
Beneficiaries:           The Republic of Ghana and Ghana Cocoa
Board (COCOBOD)
Implementing Agencies:  COCOBOD and Department of Feeder Roads (DFR)
in the Ministry of Roads and Highways
Credit Amount:           SDR 31.3 million (US$40.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                   Standard, with 40 years maturity
Relending Terms:         SDR 11.2 million (US$14.3 million equivalent) would
be onlent by the Republic of Ghana to COCOBOD, to finance project
initiatives of COCOBOD's commercial activities (input supply and internal
marketing), at 8.52 over 20 years including 5 years grace; foreign exchange
risk would be borne by COCOBOD. SDR 12.16 million (US$15.5 million
equivalent) to finance project initiatives of COCOBOD's non-commercial
activities (research, extension, training, disease control and management)
would be given in the form of a grant.
Cofinanciers:            ADF FUA 28.0 million (US$33.0 million equivalent).
Possible cofinancing to be confirmed from ODA
(U.K.) of Pounds Sterling 5.0 suillion (US$8.0
equivalent) and from BADEA of US$10.0 million.
Proiect Description:    The project aims at:  (i) supporting the policy
reforms in the cocoa sector agreed under the first Structural Adjustment
Credit; and (ii) increasing cocoa production and yield to stabilize output
at an anmual level of about 300,000 t. This would be achieved by (i)
maintaining producer price incentives; (ii) improving the institutional
efficiency of COCOBOD particularly its extension, seed production, disease
control, functions and by gradual privatization of input supply; (iii)
improving cocoa evacuation and quality control; (iv) implementing a road
rehabilitation program in cocoa areas; and (v) strengthening cocoa
research, especially the breeding program for drought and disease
resistance and improved yields.
The project would be a naticial project and would be implemented over five
years and include the following four main components: (1) Technical
Services for Cocoa Production which incltMe reorganization of the Cocoa
Service Division (CSD), and the strengthening of extension, seed production
and disease control and gradual privatization of farm input supply. (2)
Research including (i) streamlining the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana
(CRIG) to promote its activities in plant breeding and disease control;
(ii) the establishment of an off-station unit to conduct on-farm research;
and (iii) staff development. (3) Internal Marketing. While the question
of privatization of the buying system is being examined by the study (under



- iii -
the SAC) of phased privatization of the total marketing system, the project
would provide limited support to critically needed storage and transport
investments to evacuate cocoa, from remote villages in areas with poor
infrastructure, where it is judged that the private sector is unlikely to
be active in the foreseeable future. Apart from these areas, COCOBOD's
share in internal transport of cocoa would remain below 15?.  (4)
Essential Road Upgrading Program to facilitate the evacuation of cocoa and
the participation of private haulers.  The component would be implemersted
by private contractors, asnd would cover (i) improvement of about 3,000 km
of feeder roads and bridges; and (ii) construction of 60 km of new feeder
roads, 2 major bridges, and 80 km of tracks.

the efficiency of COCOBOD; (ii) ensure on' i.ncentive producer price; (iii)
improve income distribution and raise rural living standards; (iv) reduce
rural unemployment and increase economic activity in the countryside; (v)
increase cocoa exports with consequent higher availability of foreign
exchange and Government revenue. The risks includet (i) world prices
being lower than what is forecast, to which the project is not overly
sensitive; (ii) failure of GOG to maintain reasonable real producer price
incentives, agreement on which will be a condition for effectiveness; and
(iii) unfavorable natural factors such as unusual droughts and major
disease outbreaks; for facing the latter, the technical capacity is being
strengthened. There is also the risk of delay in the achievement of the
institutional development objective of streamlining COCOBOD and the
privatization of input supply and marketing services. This ris'" would be
minimized through close monitoring, but would not significantly aftect the
production benefits.

GHANA
COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Gh'na launched a major economic reform program
in 1983. In a supportive response, IDA approved a series of short-term
credits to provide critically required imports and immediate rehabilitation.
needs for key sectors (cocoa, timber, mining, roads and transport). In
addition, economic and sector work carried out by the Bank produced an
agreed strategy to tackle medium-term adjustment issues which were
supported by a Structural Adjustment Credit. The emphasis of this strategy
is on improving incentives and availability of inputs to exploit existing
capacity and promote production. As cocoa is the mainstay of the Ghana
economy (it provided 67Z or US$519 million, of 1986 export earnings), and
as the success of the Economic Recovery Program depends heavily on the
cocoa sector to meet its growth objectives, the Government of Ghana
requested IDA to support a cocoa sector project to increase production and
address the sector's major constraints.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      Ghana (area 238,500 km2) has an estimated population of 14
million, growing at 32 p.a. It lies between about 50 N and 110 N latitude
and between 10 E and 30 W longitude. It is bounded by Cote d'Ivoire on the
West, Burkina Faso on the North, Togo on the East and the Atlantic Ocean on
the South.
A.        General Economic Situation
2.02      According to most indicators, there was a progressive
deterioration in the Ghanaian economy from 1970 to 1982, with GDP declniing
at an average rate of 0.5Z per annum and real per capita income falling by
30?. Export earnings dropped 52? and the value of exports was reduced from
21? to 4? of GDP during this period. The consumer price index increased at
an average annual rate of 80X from 1975 to 1980, by 117? in 1981, 22? in
1982 and 122? in 1903. The per capita GNP was about US$310 in 1983.
2.03      The falling per capita income over this period resulted in
greater incidence of absolute poverty, groving unemployment and emigration
of skilled professionals. Deterioration in the roads, railways,
electricity supply, telecommunications and the transportation fleet was
also very evident.



- 2 -
2.04      Since 1983, the Government has launched a number of policy
reforms aimed at reversing the steady decline of the economy. These
reforms included a series of devaluations (from ¢ 2.75 to US$1 in 1983 to 0
90 in 1986 and about 0 150 in 1987); the introduction in September 1986 of
a dual excha.nge rate and its unity, in February 1987, under the market
(auction) rate; several increases ir. cocoa prices from 0 12,000/ton in 1983
to 0 85,000/ton in 1986 and 0 140-150,000/ton in 1987; reduced price
controls; increased interest rates; increased fiscal stringency and greater
private sector involvement.
2.05      These measures, combined with better weather conditions since
1984, have led to an upturn in the economy with an 8.62 increase in real
GDP in 1984 and a further increase of about 5.12 for 1985 and 5.3X for
1986. The consumer price index rose by 40? in 1984 and only 102 and 20? in
1985 and 1986, respectively. Exports rose by 292, 122 and 202 in 1984,
1985 and 1986, respectively. For 1984, the balance of payments showed a
current account deficit of US$221 million (2.4? of GDP), down from the
deficit of US$356 million in 1983. However, the deficit increased again
to US$283 million in 1985 and is projected to reduce to US$193 million in
1986 and go up to US$331 million in 1987.
2.06      Continued development of the econorqy is couistrained at present by
the poor state of basic infrastructure, the need for further sectoral
reforms, the weak institutional framework, shortage of foreign exchange,
shortage of skilled personnel, insufficient inter-skill wage differentials
and/or performance incentives, inadequate private sector involvement and
weakness of the financial and banking sector.
B.        Government Policy
2.07      As part of its economic recovery program, GOG has decided to
further improve and deepen the economic structural reforms aiming at the
following four major objectives:
(i) Ensure and sustain economic growth through further improvements
in incentives accompanied by sector rehabilitation. The
principal instrument to attain the growth objective is the
exchange rate and trade policies. Market forces would
increasingly play a larger role in the determination of prices,
quantities, imports, etc.
(ii) Stimulate a substantial increase in the level of saving and
investment. This would be done mainly by (a) restoring
confidence in the financial system and banking institutions,
through tax policies that encourage savings; (b) reducing bank
operating costs; (c) taking measures to improve the financial and
managerial structure of state-owned banks; (d) ensuring
confidentiality in the relationship between banks vis-a-vis their
clients; and (e) providing and securing positive real interest
rates for deposits.



- 3 -
(iii)  Improve the balance of payment and place it on sound ground.
This would be mainly achieved through Government exchange rate
and trade policies and by pursuing a prudent borrowing strategy.
(iv) Improve the management of resources in the public sector. The
principal instrument to achieve this objective would be the
public expenditure program and the reforms of the state
enterprise sector.
C.        The Agriculture Sector
2.08      Agriculture is the backbone of the Ghanaian economy.  It absorbs
nearly 602 of total labor force; contributes about 53? of GDP and supplies
up to 77? of total merchandize exports. Despite its importance, from
Independence through the early 19809 the sector did not receive the policy
and institutional support it needs for sustained development.
2.09      The main features of agriculture in Ghana are:  it is primarily
rainfed, most producers are smallholders and productivity is generally low.
Agricultural production is particularly risky and the task of providing
vast numbers of small farmers with improved techniques, incentives and
marketing services is of central importance to agriculture's development.
Cultivable land is relatively plentiful: only 302 of the 10 million
hectare of cultivable land is actually cultivated. However, only 0.07? of
total cultivable land is irrigated, although the Government accorded high
priority to irrigation in the last decade. Most farmers practice shifting
cultivation as land is abundant, and mixed cropping is the common response
to reducing the risks of rainfed agriculture. However, there are more
densely populated areas in the north and the south, where permanent
cultivation has to be adopted and where maintenance of soil fertility is of
particular concern since over the longer term, given Ghana's population
growth rate estimated at 3? per annum, the pressure on land would only
intensify.
2.10      Institutional support for Agriculture is divided between cocoa
and non-cocoa sectors. Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) is responsible for
cocoa, coffee and sheanuts and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is
responsible for all other crops. Coordination between MOA and COCOBOD to
harmonize policies need to be strengthened, particularly in the areas of
extension services, training and farm input supply. This need has already
been recog-4.zed by IDA and the Government, leading to the establishment,
under the A ricultural Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP, Cr. 1801-GH),
of an Agricultural Policy Coordination Committee (APCC). The APCC
composition which includes representatives of MOA, COCOBOD, Bank of Ghana
and the Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, Industrie-, Science
and Technology, Trade, Land and Natural Resources, Local Government and
Transportation and Communication, would help ensure a better coordination
of support activities and development of a consistent set of policies.

3.01      Cocoa is the most important subsector in Ghana's economy,
providing 65? of the export earnings, 9z of GDP and 23Z of Government
revenues in 1985. It employs some 24X of the labor force; occupies well
over a third of the land under cultivation; and about 0.5 million
households or 1/3 of the estimated total farm families, are engaged in
cocoa production.
3.02      In the 1960s Ghana was the world's leading producer of cocoa,
with a record production of 566,000 tons, about one third of the world's
supply in 1964165. Since then, production has declined from an average of
over 400,000 tons in the sixties and early seventies to about 300,000 tons
in 1976177 and even more drastically in the early 1980s to a mere 158,000
tons in 1983/84.
3.03      The root cause of the decline was undoubtedly the poor producer
prices for cocoa which brought in their train, neglect of farms, smuggling,
shift to other crops, abandonment, fire, disease, migration of youth to
occupations other than cocoa cultivation and slowing down of replanting.
More serious than the loss in production has been the severe erosion of the
sector's long term potential caused by the neglect of cocoa farms and lack
of regular replanting. The negative impact of the decline in production on
Ghana's economy was exacerbated by a significant fall in international
prices of cocoa between 1977 (US$3,790/ton) and 1981 (US$1,800/ton).
3.04      The area under cocoa has been reduced drastically since 1979 due
to drought, fire, disease and abandonment of farms, or their replacement
with foodcrops. Although the data base is poor, the general consensus in
COCOBOD seems to be that there are at present approximately 1.1 million ha
of viable cocoa in Ghana, about 152 of which consists of hybrids. However,
more than 402 of the existing cocoa is over 30 years old and declining in
yield. On average, about 20,000 ha are also probably going out of
production (assumed to occur when a stand of cocoa is around 10 years old)
each year. Furthermore, much of the existing cocoa stock is in a generally
neglected state with widespread capsid damage, infestation with weeds and
mistletoe, lack of shade control, blackpod disease and progressively
increasing incidence of Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD).
3.05      Production Technology.  Ghana is a low cost producer of cocoa.
The traditional farming system is low technology, planting seed directly in
the field at close spacing (2,500 or more plants/ha) using up to five seed
per hole and thinning to one plant. Seeds are from low yielding disease
susceptible trees. Cultural practices are minimal with little or no
attention to pest control, pruning or underbrushing, and average annual
yields are about 250 kg/ha at most. Given better husbandry including CSSVD
eradication these common Amelonado types yield between 400 kg/ha and 450
kg/ha annually at full production. Improved seed from higher yielding



hybrids with some swollen shoot tolerance could average annual yields
between 550 kg/ha and 600 kg/ha but only if farmers improved cultural
practices. Failing this, yields from hybrids are unlikely to exceed 360
kg/ha and may average nearer 320 kglha. They could however be raised to
between 700 kg/ha and 900 kg/ha if in addition to practicing better insect
pest control, underbrushing and pruning trees farmers would manage the soil
fertility with fertilizer applications, control black pod disease and
rodents, regulate shade intensity and give plants a good start by preparing
them in nurseries befo-e planting out at optimum spacing and crop geometry.
3.06      In terms of returns to labor, hybrid cocoa managed at
intermediate level of teclmology offers most benefit to farmers.
Replanting with hybrids is not an option for increasing production in the
short to medium te.n. Rapid increases would have to come from management
improvements on existing trees rather than from new plantings.
Rehabilitation of traditional varieties as well as hybrids through the
application of moderate technology, involving regular manipulation of shade
(normally shade thinning), spraying against capsids, mistletoe removal,
pruning (to improve canopy architecture), more frequent harvesting and
regular brushing offers the quickest method of boosting yields at
reasonable cost. The main thrust of the Board's current program is
therefore to promote this technology through inputs and extension services.
3.07      The number of cocoa farm owners has been recently determined to
be about 265,000. The average age of cocoa farmers, presently around 55 to
65 years, has been increasing due to rural to urban migration of young
people and increased life expectancy. Since most farmers own two or more
parcels of cocoa and use sharecroppers to manage the extra farms, the total
number of cocoa growers is estimated to be around half a million. A
typical farm would consist of 1-2 ha of cocoa in 2 or 3 parcels and another
1 or 2 parcels of foodcrops. The foodcrops, mainly plantain, maize,
cassava, cocoyams and yams, are grown primarily for subsistence. Plantains
and cocoyams and yams, are grown as nurse crops for cocoa. Over 75Z of
cocoa farmers are caretakers or sharecroppers receiving one third of the
produce according to the 'Abusa' system or half the produce under the
'Abunu' system. Under the low producer price of recent years these systems
did not provide adequate incentive for improvement in field management.
3.08      With the reforms in the cocoa subsector and the progressive
devaluation of the Cedi introduced by the Government since 1983, the
producer price of cocoa has gone up progressively as followst

1/  CPI adjusted, taking cocoa price of 1970 as 100.
The cocoa farmer's share of the actual export sale price has, however, not
gone up as spectacularly on account of devaluations.  As a proportion of
the world price, it represents about 432 of the expected FOB price.
However, the 1986 producer price of ¢85,000 was announced only after the
main crop had been purchased and so would benefit only to the light crop
(about 3? of the main crop) of 1986. The main crop purchased in 1986 was
paid for at the 1985 price of ¢56,000/ton. Thus, the producer share of the
world price (and sales income) was actually in the range of 25.8?
(US$540/t) for the 1985/86 crop. This also means that the 1985/86 main
crop cocoa would have received a higher price if smuggled to Ivory Coast
(US$815/ton) or Togo where the price was twice of that in Ghana.
3.09      Nevertheless, the above producer price increases combined with
some improvements in COCOBOD's internal marketing operations, reduced
smuggling and better weather conditions, resulted in increased cocoa
production in 1984185 (170,000 tons) and 1985/86 (205,000 tons). It is
clear that to reestablish the historical production levels (para 3.02),
producer prices will play a crucial role.
B.        Institutions and Services
3.10      Institutional support for cocoa production is provided by COCOBOD
through its divisions and subsidiaries as follervs:
(a) The Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG)
3.11      CRIG is responsible for research into all aspects of cocoa
production and primary processing. Its mandate has been widened in recent
times to include research on other tree crops - coffee, cola, sheanut and
tallow' tree. CRIG is a long-established research institute with well
qualified staff and impressive facilities. It has a well established main
station covering 287 ha at Tafo and substations at Afosu, Bunso and Bole
with their own offices, stores and staff houses. Much of these facilities
and equipment are in poor state of repair and require rehabilitation or
replacement. The Institute is managed by a Director assisted by two Deputy
Directors and consists of 4 administrative divisions and 6 research
divisions.



- 7 -
3.12      CRIG has been well recognized in the past for its high quality
research results although recent economic circumstances have adversely
affected this performance. However, much of these results were not being
widely applied because of the disincentives experienced until recently by
cocoa farmers in Ghana. Response by farmers to recent pricing arrangements
is good. As !mprovements in marketing arrangements are made and prices
become more attractive, farmers are expected to accelerate the
resuscitation rate of cocoa production. This would stimulate the demand
for and appliction of improved technologies to raise yields and production
efficiencies. The role of CRIG in this process is critical. The industry
is faced with serious technological problems which would require
intensified efforts by CRIG scientists to resolve. The main problems are
in the management of pest, diseases and soil fertility, and the development
of new varieties resistant or tolerant to the 'Swollen Shoot" virus and
with potential for high yield and quality. While CRIG has maintained
relatively high scientific standards in its work, some of the technical
problems tackled are not of immediate relevance to the problems of the
cocoa farmer. A more satisfactory mechanism is critically needed fo-
ensuring such relevance and for further improvements in contacts with the
extension services of CSD. Similarly, improvements are needed in
systematic attempts to draw from the results of research published each
year as to their practical implications for the farmer or the extension
services. Other problems besides the needed improvements in the
programming and management of research, whose elimination would increase
the effectiveness of CRIG's research are:
(i) the absence of cost-effectiveness considerations in designing and
approving research projects;
(ii) poor maintenance and recording by CSD of off-station trials;
(iii) inadequate attention to trials in the new cocoa areas of Western
Ghana, partly due to lack of transport; and
(iv) poor maintenance of buildings, shortages of vehicles, equipment
and spare parts, inadequate contacts with sister institutions
abroad and reduced availability of publications, resulting in
part from impractical mechanisms for the release of budgetted
funds.
The problems identified above would be addressed by the project (paras 4.27
to 4.34).
(b) The Cocoa Services Division (CSD)
3.13      CSD is responsible for providing extension, training, pest and
disease control, seed production and input distribution services to cocoa
farmers. Six regional offices serve the Eastern, Ashanti, Brong Ahafo,
Western, Central and Volta regions. The regions are divided into 99
districts, each with its own District Office. CSD employs a total of some
19,300 staff.



3.14      Following are the main problems whose resolution would improve
CSD operations and would be addressed by the project (paras 4.15 and 4.16):
(i)  poor supervisory capacity and lack of adequate mobility which is
being exacerbated by the excessive number of districts and staff;
and
(il)  inadequate monitoring and evaluation system.
3.'.5     Extension.  At the farmer level, each district is divided into
Extension Units (EUs), each manned by an Extension Field Assistant (EFA)
and four 'extension" laborers. An EFA is supposed to serve about 1,200 ha
of cocoa (an average of about 600 farmers), providing extension and input
supply services. There are 1,652 EPAs at present, technically supervised
by Senior Technical Assistants (STAs), but reporting administratively to
the District Cocoa Officer (DCO) through the SPA.
3.16      Until recently, the extension services of CSD were mainly
concerned with carrying out brushing (weeding), spraying (when insecticide
and transport were available), harvesting, lining and pegging for farmers
against nominal fees. After CSD's restructuring, new policy was to hava
extension workers concentrate on providing advisory services and inputs to
farmers rather than on doing things for them. In practice, EFAs have not
yet adjusted to these new functions and still tend to use their gangs of
laborers to perform the same services for farmers, albeit on a reduced
scale.
3.17      Following are the major problems whose resolution would permit
the extension services to fulfill their new role effectively and would be
addressed by the project (paras 4.17 to 4.20)s
(i) the excessive numbers of "extension" laborers and EFAs;
(ii) lack of transport to enable EFAs to visit farmers regularly;
(iii) lack of structured, supervised work programs and too much
emphasis on the distribution of inputs;
(iv) lack of regular training of EFAs to fit them for their new
role and the dilapidated state of Bunso Cocoa College and
its facilities which prevents such a training program from
being started;
(v)  inadequate research-extension communication; and
(vi) lack of capacity to produce extension and publicity
materials;
3.18      Disease Control.  The regulatory activities of CSD are
principally CSSVD survey and treatment. Surveys for disease are carried



- 9 -
out by a field staff of about 730 Field Assistants (FAs) assisted by about
1,600 laborers (one FA and two laborers/team). In addition, about 470 FAs
and 990 laborers are employed in initial treatment, reinspection and
retreatment procedures. The FAc are supervised by a total of 220 Senior
Field Assistants (SFAs) and the overall operation at the district level is
managed by the District Officers.
3.19      The main tasks of the FAs as currently defined are to spot
outbreaks of the disease, mark and cut out the visibly infected trees along
with adjacent trees which could harbor the disease. Once an outbreak has
been thus treated, arrangements are made for an ex gratia payment to the
farmers and the Rdjoining cocou is reinspected 6-monthly for 24 months in
order to detect and treat any further infections. In the area of
mass-infection (AMI), where the disease is most widespread, the approach is
to persuade farmers through incentives (¢ 67,000/ha presently) to cut out
all cocoa and replant with resistant/tolerant hybrids in blocks of at least
1 ha, leaving a cocoa-free cordon around the perimeter. The cordon may be
put under coffee or colanut. If it is left to bush alternative, hosts of
the CSSV must be removed.
3.20      The present constraints, which would be addressed by the project
(paras 4.25 and 4.26), are largely concerned with the lack of qualified
staff for monitoring of both the technical and operational aspects of the
program and the lack of funds with which to make the incentive or
inducement payments to farmers for infection control efforts.
3.21      Input Distribution.  The third major area of CSD's activities is
the supply of implement and production inputs. Imported inputs, mainly
mistblowers, handsprayers, spare parts for sprayers, insecticides,
fungicides, polythene bags, matchets, pruners and petrol-oil mixture for
mistblowers, are distributed by CSD, but procured by the Procurement
Division (PD). The insecticide requirements are obtained from the chemical
formulation plants at Tema and Abuakwa and the fuel-oil mixture from the
Tema oil refinery.
3.22      Farmers are provided with most of these Inputs at subsidized
prices. Thus, at the exchanige r:te of 160 cedis to the dollar, the current
selling price of mistblowers carries a subsidy of 90?, handsprayers 74?,
sprayer spares 100X, insecticides 84-90?, fungicides 662 and polythene bags
1002. Petrol/oil mixture, matchets and pruners are sold without subsidy.
Recent decisions of COCOBOD/CSD include, however:
ti)  the elimination of all subsidies on inputs over a 3 year period;
(ii)  the dropping of matchets and pruners from its list of inputs
supplied to farmers, and;
(iii)  the transfer of the fuel/oil mixture supply service to the oil
companies and their dealer networks.



- 10 -
3.23      The main problems connected with the input distribution which if
eliminated would have a favorable impact on quality of farm services are:
(i) poor telecommunications between COCOBOD headquarters and CSD,
between CSD and its warehouse at Tema, and between CSD and its
regional and district offices;
(ii)  failure of the Procurement Division (PD) of COCOBOD to keep CSD
informed of cargo arrivals or non-arrivals and progress on
clearing customs, etc.; new procedures being adopted by PD would
overcome this problem;
(iii)  inadequate transport capacity (especially in regard to the
distribution of seed pods - see para 3.24 below), sometimes
resulting in delays in the delivery of inputs; transport
difficulties also result in poor supervision of CSD's field
program;
(iv) poor road infrastructure;
(v) delays in obtaining import licenses, opening letters of credit,
etc.; and
(vi) high costs of providing subsidized mistblower repair services.
Host of the above issues could be resolved by increasing
gradually the role of the private sector in the input supply
system. This objective is a key element of the project (para
4.35).
3.24      Seed Production and Distribution.  Seed production and
distribution services are provided by CSD through its seed gardens, managed
by a coordinator based at Tafo. There are 17 seed gardens distributed over
5 regions. They are associated with the cocoa stations but are
administratively controlled by the regional officers. They consist of
about 40 ha of monoclonal and 70 ha of older biclonal productive seed
gardens. These seed gardens, over 60X of which have trees over 25 years
old, are badly managed (some even showing visible symptoms of CSSVD);
however, they are still expected to produce over 2 million seed pods in
1985/86, adequate to plant about 28,000 ha.
3.25      The main problems which would be addressed by the project (paras
4.22 to 4.24) in CSD's seed production and distribution services are:
(i) poor management (lack of supervision, poor performance by
pollinators (250-400 pollinations/day), lack of basic
phytosanitary controls in the seed gardens, inadequate labelling
and maintenance, etc.);
(ii) limited availability of seed at times during the year when demand
among farmers (for direct seeding) is greatest.



- 11 -
(iii) lack of overall seed garden policy, planning, and evaluation;
(iv) inadequate transport for pod distribution as well as for use by
supervisory staff;
(v) lack of a pipeline of fully tested successful replacement parent
clones for future use; and
(vi) insufficient seed garden area to cater to the needs of the
Western Region.
(c)  The Produce Buying Company. Ltd. (PBC)
3.26      PBC is responsible for the purchase and evacuation of cocoa,
coffee and sheanuts. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of COCOBOD, enjoying
a monopoly buying concession for cocoa and operating 3,218 Buying Centers
(Societies) distributed across 134 buying districts of the cocoa growing
region. The number of Buying Centers has declined (from 4,300 in 1981) in
recent years in response to reduced production and to the introduction of
the Akuafo 1/ cheque system of payment. Some 17,860 staff are employed by
PBC.
3.27      The PBC is also responsible for having the produce graded by the
Produce Inspection Department (PID), bagging and storing it at central
depots and transporting it to Tema and Takoradi ports by rail or road,
using private haulers as well as its own fleet of trucks. Cocoa is stored
in the port in warehouses leased from the Ports Authority and becomes the
property of the Cocoa Marketing Company, Ltd., the trading subsidiary of
COCOBOD which is responsible for its export. All handling of the cocoa in
the ports is by the Cargo Handling Corporation, wholly owned by Government.
3.28      In common with other divisions and subsidiaries of COCOBOD, PBC
has problems arising from poor communications. However, the most serious
constraints to its operation which would be dealt with by the project
(paras 4.37 to 4.42 and 4.46 to 4.48) are as follows:
(i) the lack of consistent political backing for PBC's efforts to
rationalize (closing down non-viable buying centers) the buying
system in order to reduce buying costs;
(ii) inadequate storage capacity in the Western Region;
(iii) lack of mechanical handling facilities, particularly at the ports
and railway sidings;
(iv) poor condition of the feeder road system, import restrictions and
1/   The word means 'farmer.'  The check can be cashed in any bank.



- 12 -
financial constraints, all of which prevent private haulers from
participating in societies-to-depot evacuation while at the same
time hampering the operations of PBC's transport fleet;
(v)  lack of a proper accounting system;
(vi) inadequate transport for supervisory staff; and
(vii) duplication of services among PBC, CSD, PID and ICD at regional
and district levels; this applies especially to accounting
services, transport, communications, security and building and
vehicle maintenance.
(d)  The Produce Inspection Division (PID)
3.29      PID operates a relatively independent system which is found to be
adequate. PID service aimed at ensuring that standards are maintained in
the quality of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts intended for export. The work of
PID involves inspection, grading and sealing every bag of produce at PBC's
Buying Centers (Societies), checking the quality of grading done by
purchase clerks by sampling bagged cocoa depots and rechecking consignments
on arrival at port and before shipment. Operating from its headquarters at
Accra, PID employs over 2,000 staff, it is effective and has a justified
reputation overseas for its grading work. The main constraints are similar
to those affecting the operations of PBC, but special mention must be made
of the lack of adequate transport for its supervisory staff. Out of 23
vehicles which could serve for this task, 7 are not roadworthy and all but
3 of them are over 5 years old.
(e) Infestation Control Department (ICD)
3.30      The ICD, operating out of its headquarters in Accra and with a
staff of about 200 persons, treats all storage premises by frequent
insecticidal fogging when the produce is stored and residual insecticidal
treatment when the warehouses are empty. Further treatment of cocoa
consignments is effected at the ports and there is complete disinfestation
with methyl bromide prior to loading. If necessary, ships' holds are also
fumigated. Originally, ICD was in the private sector and could revert in
the long run to a similar status; meanwhile it should be run on commercial
lines. The constraints to its operation are similar to those affecting PBC
and PID.
(f) Other COCOBOD Subsidiaries, which provide other services to the
sector, includes
3.31 -    Plantations. Ltd., which runs the Board's 92 cocoa (53) and
coffee (39) plantations and employs some 17,000 staff and
laborers. these plantations were established between 1976-78
aiming at increasing national production of both these
commodities. However, by mid-1978 it had already become evident
that progress with the development was disappointing. Since



- 13 -
then, several studies have been carried out which resulted in the
divestiture, already being implemented, of 52 non-viable
plantations (32 cocoa and 20 coffee), inc'Luding laying-off 10,000
employees. As agreed under the SAC, Annex 3-1, the future of the
other 40 plantations (21 cocoa and 19 coffee) is pending further
consideration through a feasibility study to be undertaken by
COCOBOD and completed in late 1987.
Ablakwa Formulation Plant, Ltd. The plant, which was
commissioned in 1980, formulates insecticida, "Unden 20," from
imported ingredients for spraying against capsids. The plant is
capable, with shift work, of attaining output levels in the range
of 4 to 5 million liters per annum. However, as the annual
consumption is about ' million liters, there was no need to
utilize the entire plant capacity and, consequently, since its
inception the plant's actual output has never exceeded 25Z of its
annual (5 million liters) capacity. With this low utilization
and overstaffing, production cost is quite high and its
competitiveness with imported insecticide is questionable.
However, with better management and a commercially-oriented
approach the plant could be diversified into other chemical
products, its efficiency improved and its cost reduced. COCOBOD
is pursuing a change of ownership and management to undertake the
necessary changes and improve plant performance.
Cocoa Processing Company. Ltd.- (CPC). The company operates three
factories, two at Takoradi (West Africa Mills (WAM) and Taksi)
and one at Tema (Portem), which produce a range of cocoa
products: cocoa liquor, cake, and butter for export, and cocoa
powder and chocolate for domestic consumption. The three
factories are said to have a combined nominal processing capacity
in excess of 80,000 tons of raw beans per annum. However,
utilization capacity in recent years !.s about 202 mainly because
of: (i) old equipment (the factories are quit' old - W.4M was
established in 1947, Taksi in 1964 and Portem in 1965 - and never
rehabilitated); (ii) chronic lack of spare parts; and (iii)
inadequate supply of raw beans. Due to low utilization and heavy
overstaffing, CPC is operating at a loss which, in the a.,ence of
financial figures, cannot be determined.
Cocoa Marketing Company (CMC). CMC is solely responsible for the
entire external marketing of the country cocoa production, coffee
and sheanuts. CMC maintains a liaison office in London (CMC UK).
The company earns half of one percent (112X) on CIF values of all
the sales as commission, which is adequate to cover all costs
(recurrent and capital), pay taxes (about 22X of its budget) and
leave some surplus. The CMC 1986/87 (October 1, 1986 to
September 30, 1987) budget is estimated at US$2.5 million.
C.        Roads



- 14 -
3.32      Road conditions throughout Ghana are extremely poor, particularly
in the west of the country where LJcoa yield is highest. Large areas are
completely isolated in the wet season. Transport costs and vehicle attri-
tion are excessive. Evacuation of cocoa from village store (Society) to
depots, and thence to either railhead or port, is carried out by the
Produce Buying Company (PBC) using road transport. Transportation from
depots to railhead, or to port, is almost wholly by private haulers under
contract to PBC. The condition of feeder roads giving access to societies
is such that private haulers do not operate on them. Haulage on society
feeder roads is by PBC using ad hoc methods of small trucks or
tractor-trailer combinations, at high cost.
3.33      Southern and central Ghana is traversed by a skeletal network of
sealed surface primary roads with conditions ranging from good to severe
failure. The main cocoa evacuation trunk roads from Brong Ahafo, Western
region and West Ashanti region to railhead at Awaaso, main depots at
Kumasi, or port at Takoradi are gravel-paved and in medium to severe
failure condition. Feeder roads connecting village societies and depots
are in very bad condition. In addition to poor alignment, there are
frequent collapses of temporary bridges and culverts. The project would
address the above-mentioned deficiencies (paras 4.46 to 4.48).
3.34      An ongoing IDA-financed Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance
Project (Credit 1601-GH) is addressing the problem of institutional support
and longer-term development of labor-intensive spot improvement and road
maintenance methods. A proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project will
increase road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance, but will exclude
cocoa feeder roads.
3.35      Ghana's road sector is administered by the Ministry of Roads and
Highways (MRH) which oversees road investments and maintenance. Tnree
agencies operate under MRH, (a) Ghana Highway Authority (GHA), an
autonomous body overseeing construction and maintenance of trunk roads
(primary and secondary roads); (b) Department of Feeder Roads (DFR)
handling construction and maintenance of feeder roads; and (c) Department
of Urban Roads (DUR) which is not yet autonomous of GHA. Prior to
mid-1986, the Cocoa Marketing Board (COCOBOD) had its own budget for
rehabilitation and maintenance of any roads under cocoa traffic,
irrespective of their classification as either GHA or DFR responsibilities,
and for the construction and/or maintenance of low-standard feeder roads to
village societies. With effect from January 1, 1987, PNDC instructed DFR
to assume full responsibility for cocoa feeder roads. Funding of ¢2.6
billion (about US$16.2 million) would be provided by COCOBOD for fiscal
86/87. For subsequent years, minimum funding would be not less than 02.6
billion in real terms, with a maximum of 6Z total cocoa sales.

Further significant increases from Western region can be achieved by
gaining road access to some 1,200 sq.km between the Bia River and the Cote
d'Ivoire border. Output from this area is currently head-portered to
Ivoire.
3.38      Cocoa Evacuation Traffic.  Evacuation of cocoa from societies to
depots and ports occurs from November through June. Haulage to depots
commences by mid-November using PBC vehicles, ranging from 9-ton 4x2 trucks
to 2-ton tractor/trailer combinations. Onward movement from depots to
larger depots, railhead or port is by private haulers under contract to
PBC. A small element (15X) is moved in PBC trucks. From the depots, 35?
is transported to railheads on the Western line from Kumasi to Takoradi at
Kumasi, Awaaso and Insu. The balance is hauled by road to port at Takoradi
or Tema, an average haul of 250 km.
3.39      Haulage Costs.  There is no data available on the prrasent cost of
transporting cocoa from societies to depots by PBC vehicles. It may be of



- 16 -
the order ¢ 15-20 per ton km. For onward transportation from depots,
private contract haulers are paid ¢ 9.9 per ton km with a 20? increment for
the bad standard of gravel surfaced roads predominating in the west. The
haulage industry considers the increment is grossly inadequate.
3.40      Department of Feeder Roads (DFR).  The Directorate is
considerably understaffed (381 of establishment in post), and is
inadequately experienced to plan, manage and supervise any increase over
its present activity level. There is a conspicuous deficiency of
middle-management grades with practical experience. Current field
activities and practices are generally inappropriate to low-cost roadwork
resulting in excessive costs, low productivity and subsequent high
maintenance cost.
3.41      Technical assistance to improve DFR planning and project manage-
ment capability is provided currently by the ongoing Road Rehabilitation
and Maintenance Project (RRMP) Credit GH-1601, and will be continued as a
component of the proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) (Appraisal
April 1987). Further management assistance is to be provided by a
Netherlands-financed team for two years commencing June 1987. Despite
these inputs, it is unlikely that DFR could ever undertake full management
control of the Cocoa Roads component without additional technical
asaistance, substantial staff increases, and intensive training.
3.42      COCOBOD Civil Works Department.  This department has been
responsible for past work on cocoa roads in addition to its other building
responsibility. Its resource for managing the road activity has been
totally inadequate, resulting in bad planning, massive cost and time
overruns, and gross deviations from specification. Under the project,
COCOBOD will appoint a competent officer to liaise with GHA and DFR during
the project, ensuring adequate data flow between Produce Buying Company
(PBC), Cocoa Services Division (CSD) and DFR for assessing priorities, work
programming, and monitoring progress and costs.
3.43      Road Construction Industry.  Contracts for road work are prepared
by DFR on a schedule of rates, and awarded to a selected contractor. This
is an unsatisfactory system. MRH is implementing a pre-qualification and
annual registration system for road contractors which is acceptable to IDA
and will become operative in January 1988. Thereafter, only pre-qualified
and registered contractors can tender for work. Simultaneously,
competitive tendering will be obligatory.
3.44      There are 6 international-standard civil engineering companies
currently operating in Ghana. None have been involved in gravel road
reinstatement or maintenance, due to the petty nature of previous
contracts, and payment uncertainties. All now show considerable interest
in this project component. They have no serious problem over iMportation
of plant, spares and materials, and have adequate staff and labor resource.
The domestic road construction industry has, in the past, received
technical assistance under IDA-financed highway projects, but individual
contractors are still generally small firms, with limited technical,



- 17 -
managerial and financial skills. Further development of this industrial
sector is needed before major projects can be undertaken. Some 30 domestic
Ghanaian contractors are working for DFR on cocoa roads. All contractors
are under-equipped with ageing, and often, unsuitable plant. Five
contractors are working to good standards, each have an annual capability
of 60-70 km spot-improvement given improved management and reliable,
relevant plant. A further 7 are borderline standard with improvement
possibility.
3.45      The Condition of Roads.  Primary and secondary roads constructed
prior to the mid-60's were well-aligned and engineered, and their geometric
standards remain adequate for current traffic. Culverts are generally
adequate in size and condition, but timber bridges are deteriorated. Due
to cumulative lack of maintenance, drainage has ceased to function. Water
has become impounded on the road formation causing scour, gulleying and
erosion on gradients, quagmires on level sections, and creating mud wallows
at culverts, where seasonal stream* frequently have by-passed the culvert
and freeflow across or down the road rurmation. Roads constructed since
the mid-60's have suffered from many changes of geometric specification,
excessive geometric standards and gradients are commonplace. Feeder roads
have usually developed from the logging roads of timber companies, and
consequently are less well-engineered. The society feeder roads are
usually roughly-dozed spur accesses to individual village societies, and
are relics of the lowest standard of logging track.
3.46      Work Standards.  Work standards and unit costs of current
reinstatement and construction are not satisfactory. The main impediment
to achieving quality, progress and acceptable cost levels is the
inexperience of DFR field staff in effective planning and specification of
low cost road construction and improvement. Survey and contract documenta-
tion are unnecessarily detailed. There is no appreciation of topography in
alignment selection. Geometric specification is excessive, despite recent
revised specifications by DFR, and drainage structures are inadequately
designed. There is insufficient site supervision, and control of materials
and compaction is weak. This situation is remediable by training and good
example. There is ample evidence that the best domestic contractors can
produce acceptable standards of earthwork and gravel pavement when
adequately supervised, but progress is erratic due to plant and management
unreliability. The quality, and progress rate, of concrete work on
culverts and drainage structures is uniformly poor, and is a serious
restraint on progress. There is little current activity on routine and
recurrent road maintenance, and its quality is variable.
D.        Government Cocoa Sector Strategy
3.47      The Government of Ghana gives high priority to rehabilitation of
the cocoa industry. The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) which is the
framework for GOG policy (para 2.07), is relying heavily on improved
performance in the cocoa sector to meet its overall growth objectives.
The cocoa sector has the medium term potential for improved production and
productivity which, if adequately exploited, could increase foreign



- 18 -
exchange earnings and Government revenues as well as have a major impact on
reduction of rural poverty, particularly in the cocoa growing areas. The
major objective for the cocoa sector under the SAP is to increase cocoa
output from about 205,000 tons in 1985/86 to 258,000 tons in 1988/89 and
produce at least 303,000 tons by 1995. While significant progress has been
made in motivating production by increasing returns to cocoa farmers,
strengthening COCOBOD management capacity, and streamlining its services to
cocoa producers, much more remains to be done. The Government's sectoral
strategy, details of which are given in Annex 3-1, aims to overcome the
constraints discussed in Chapter MII. Within this context the Government
has adopted the following action program to achieve its sector objectives:
(i) further real increase in return to farmers, with farmgate prices
reaching up to 55X of cocoa FOB price;
(ii) reduce the share of cocoa revenues that currently accrue to
COCOBOD from about 25Z of the FOB price to an indicative target
of 15Z in 1988/89; at the same time COCOBOD will be divesting
itself from many of the commercial services which can be
efficiently provided by private enterprise;
(iii)  initiate removal of barriers to greater private sector
participation in providing services to the cocoa industry (para
2.07);
(iv) reevaluate the present system of cocoa taxation to ensure its
consistency with the objective of ensuring adequate producer
incentives; and
(v)  strengthening extension services, adaptive research, and disease
control including a massive campaign to control the cocoa
swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD); and
(vi) improving the road infrastructure, the lack of which poses a
major constraint to increased access to growing areas and a
disincentive to private sector participation.
As part of its cocoa sector strategy, government has also endorsed COCOBOD
committments to:
(a)  confining its activities to those which cannot be done more
efficiently b, other institutions or the private sector;
(b)  laying off excess staff in phased programs; and
(c)  preparing a three-year rolling corporate plan to ensure a
steady progress in line with (a) and (b) above.
Based on the commitments above, COCOBOD will aim to become over the medium
term a service organization to the cocoa industry involved primarily in



- 19 -
marketing support, extension, research, quality control and disease
control. In the short term it will:
(1) progressively shed off responsiblity for input supply, and
encourage the private sector to take it over;
(2) handle internat. buying and haulage, but COCOBOD's share in
hauling would be reduced to about 10 in the next three years;
(3) divest itself of ownership of commercial activities such as the
insecticide formulation plant at Abuakwa, and ito cocoa
plantations;
(4) relinquish the responsibility for construction of feeder roads in
cocoa areas to the Department of Feeder Roads in the Ministry of
Roads and Highways;
(5) explore alternative ways of improving the efficiency of internal
marketing and scope for greater private sector participation;
(6) continue to restructure its organizational framework to improve
decision-making and performance monitoring mechanisms; and
(7) promote extension, research, seed production for rehabilitation
and new plantings and launch a massive campaign to cut out CSSVD
infected trees.
The Cocoa Rehabilitation Project would provide essential policy, financial,
institutional and technical support to COCOBOD and the industry to achieve
these stated objectives in a timeframe consistent with the structural
adjustment program.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.        Proiect Origin
4.01      The Government of Ghana has requested IDA to extend its economic
support by funding a cocoa sector rehabilitation project. In reference to
a cocoa sector study carried out by the Bank in 1980, a project was first
identified in 1981 and followed by a prefeasibility study undertaken by
consultants. However, due to an unfavorable economic environment and
unresolved issues resulting from prevailing Government policies, the
project preparation process had to be suspended.
4.02      In 1983 the Government introduced a series of policy reforms,
including the cocoa subsector, aimed at removing constraints and promoting
the export earning industries. These reforms were supported by IDA through
three projects: (i) First Reconstruction Import Credit (Cr. 1393; US$40
million in 1983); (ii) Export Rehabilitation Project (ERP, Cr. 1435; US$76



- 20 -
million); and (iii) Export Rehabilitation Technical Assistance (ERTA; Cr.
1436; US$17.1 million) in 1984. These credits, mainly to meet essential
import requirements of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) and technical
assistance, were tied to further sectoral reforms - involving producer
price increases atid restructuring of COCOBOD - which have paved the way for
further project assistance to the cocoa industry. This process has been
further advanced by the first Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC). The
proposed project was reidentified by the Bank in 1985 and prepared in 1986
by an FAO/ODA team, through the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program.
B.        Objectives and Production Strategy
4.03      The project aims at (i) supporting the policy reforms in the
cocoa sector agreed under the first Structural Adjustment Credit; and (ii)
increasing cocoa prnduction and yield to stabilize output at an annual
level of about 300,000 tons. This would be achieved by (i) maintaining
producer price incentives; (ii) improving the institutional efficiency of
COCOBOD particularly its extension, seed production, disease control, and
by gradual privatization of input supply; (iii) improving cocoa evacuation
and quality control; (iv) implementing a road rehabilitation program; and
(v) strengthening cocoa research, especially breeding for drought and
disease resistance and improved yields.
4.04      Production Strategy.  The production strategy which forms the
basis for the project is:
-    to maximize production in the short to medium term by promoting
the rehabilitation of existing cocoa farms through improved
cultural practices, and anti-capsid spraying (as described in
Annex 4-1 for Technology Level III); and
-    to launch a massive 10-year planting/replanting program (based
largely on hybrids and building up to 40,000 ha/year) along with
a vigorous CSSVD control program in order to reestablish a cocoa
stock that could produce at least the 300,000 t of cocoa per
year, considered as the project's long-term target. It is
expected that nearly 90Z of the new areas planted each year
during the project period and beyond, would be hybrids and that
about two-thirds of this would be using moderate cultural
practices (as described in Annex 4-1 for Technology Level IV) and
at least 52 (perhaps 10%) would use improved husbandry
(Technology Level V).
4.05      The project would assist with gradual adoption of improved
technologies through upgrading of extension and associated R and D work,
disease control, input supplies and other services such as marketing, roads
and transport etc. It is projected that by year 5 (from the commencing of
the project) about 300,000 ha of existing cocoa would have been
rehabilitated while new areas or replanting would have reached 57,000 ha.
If these targets are achieved, the total production of cocoa could be up to
at least 260,000 t by PY5 (1993). In addition, the project would have set



- 21 -
the base to allow growth of replanting to reach about 25,000 ha a year by
PY7 (1995), which would be about the equilibrium replanting level for the
industry.
C.        IDA's Role and Rationale for its Involvement
4.06      For the past several years, IDA has helped Ghana to implement
projects and programs designed to increase production and export. Based on
lessons derived from earlier experience and past project implementation,
IDA's approach is to focus ont (i) improving incentive and economic
environment to reverse the steady deterioration in economic performance
since 1970 and establish sustainable economic growth; (ii) rehabilitating
infrastructure; and (iii) streamlining institutions. This is in line with
the Government Economic Recovery Program (ERP) which was introduced in
April 1983 and is being supported by a series of IDA-financed
projects/programs. IDA's role has been to help Government rehabilitate
productive assets, lay the basis for sustaining growth, mobilize and
coordinate donors' aid in support of a market and export-oriented strategy.
4.07      In support of the ERP, IDA has financed two Import Reconstruction
Credits, two Export Rehabilitation Credits (one for Technical Assistance),
and a Structural Adjustment Credit. It is developing v Structural
Adjustment and a Technical Assistance Credits as well as a Public
Enterprise Project. These macro level operations are complemented by
sector level operations: the Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit;
rehabilitation projects in public infrastructure (roads, power, ports),
health and education, agricultural services; and the proposed cocoa
rehabilitation project.
4.08      Lessons from Previous Cocoa Projects.  IDA financed two cocoa
projects in Ghana: The Eastern Cocoa Projact (Credit 205-GH, US$8.5
million) and the Ashanti Cocoa Project (Credit 1181-GH, US$14.0 million)
which were implemented between 1970-79 and 1975-82 respectively. Both
projects were designed to replant and rehabilitate about 50,000 ha of
cocoa. The principal problem that affected both projects was low farmer
participation owing to inadequate returns at prevailing producer prices.
In both Government had to undertake most of the rehabilitation, replanting
and maintenance work on behalf of the farmers; this led to delays in
achieving targets and increasing costs. The main lesson learnt from those
two projects is that unless broad sectoral and incentive issues were
resolved, successful implementation of localized or regionalized projects
is almost impossible (PPAR No. 3526 dated June 24, 1981 for the Eastern
Cocoa Project and PCR No. 5092 dated May 24, 1984 for the Ashanti Cocoa
Project). These lessons have been taken into account in the design of this
project.
4.09      While diversification of the economic base is important, given
Ghana's overwhelming reliance on cocoa for foreign exchange earnings, the
rehabilitation of the cocoa industry remains a priority in Ghana's plans
for economic recovery. Without cocoa rehabilitation and the consequent
improvement in foreign exchange earnings, further deterioration of the



- 22 -
economic situation in the country is certain. Ghana has a strong
comparative advantage in tree crops including cocoa. Commercial lending
under Ghana's present economic situation, would be inappropriate due to its
high cost, while other bilateral lenders have yet to develop a
comprehensive sector involvement and do not have funds to support the
entire sector.
4.10      As a sequel to the Export Rehabilitation Project and the SAC, the
project would not only help implement key policy agreements already reached
but also address the sector's major investment and institutional
constraints (para 3.10 to para 3.45) by ensuring producer price incentives,
strengthening cocoa research, reorienting and improving extension services,
increasing seed production, facilitating cocoa evacuation, increasing
institutional efficiency, and creating a better ground for
commtercialization and the progressive privatization of COCOBOD functions.
Without IDA support to the project, rehabilitation of the cocoa industry
and thus Ghana's economic restructuring would probably take longer.
D.        The Proiect Area
4.11      Geographic Location.  The Cocoa Rehabilitation Project, unlike
earlier projects, would cover the entire cocoa growing area of Ghana. This
includes nearly the whole of the Western and Central Regions (excepting the
coastal strips), and major parts of the Brong Ahafo, Ashanti, Eastern and
Volta Regions as shown in Map 1. Ilne actual distribution of cocoa farms as
it existed in 1981 is shown in Map 2.
E.        Project Design and Choice of Components
4.12      A national approach has been taken in the design of this project
because an area based project is ill-suited to address sector-wide issues.
However, different interventions, under the project, are likely to be
concentrated, as needed, in specific areas. The choice of components is
determined by the need to overcome the major constraints, discussed in
Chapter III on the provision of effective support services to cocoa
producers. These include research; extension and training; provision of
improved seed; control of cocoa swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD); roads;
supply of inputs and internal marketing, including produce inspection and
infestation control. All these oervices except roads 1/ , input supply and
internal marketing would remain 'permanent" functions of Ghana Cocoa Board
(COCOBOD), while the latter two services are of a commercial nature and
therefore destined for eventual privatization under the Government's and
Board's accepted policy.
1/   (Already transfered to the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR) in the
Ministry of Roads and Highways (MRH).)



- 23 -
4.13      Privatization of input supply and internal marketing activities
would reduce costs and increase the efficiency of these services. However,
given the prevailing poor condition of the road infrastructure and the
weakness of the private sector, too hasty an attempt to privatize input
supply and cocoa buying and evacuation systems could result in a breakdown
of these services at a time when they are needed most to supplement the
other measures being taken to boost production. Therefore, it is proposed,
to provide limited support to COCOBOD to maintain these services at a
satisfactor- level of performance while progressively promoting
commercialization, implementing a phased program of privatization in input
delivery and creating the conditions which encourage privatization in cocoa
marketing. To promote the privatization process and in light of the
continued dialogue between the Government and IDA on these issues, an
annual comprehensive review of these two components (farm input and
internal marketing) would be carried out. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations (para 5.01 (d)).
F.        Summary Project Description
4.14      The project would be a national project and would be implemented
over five years. The main components are: (1) provision of technical
services for cocoa production which include reorganization of the Cocoa
Service Division (CSD); (2) strengthening of extension services to promote
an improved production technology; (3) seed production; (4) improved
disease control; (5) strengthening of research including (i) streamlining
the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) to promote its activities in
plant breeding and disease control; (ii) the establishment of an
off-station unit to conduct on-farm research; and (iii) staff development;
(6) privatization of farm input supply; (7) internal marketing capacity:
(8) monitoring and evaluation; and (9) maintenance of minimal upgrading of
roads to facilitate the evacuation of cocoa and the participation of
private haulers in internal marketing.
G.        Detailed Features
1.   Technical Services for Cocoa Production
4.15      The Cocoa Services Division (CSD) of COCOBOD is responsible for
extension, seed production, disease control and input supply. In addition
to specific intervention in each of these areas (see para 4.25 to 4.29),
the project would support, through a reorganization plan, the broad
institutional development of CSD to enhance its ability to handle its key
responsibilities in cocoa development. The reorganization plan aims at (i)
improving CSD efficiency; (ii) ensuring effective supervision; (iii)
allowing a better use of the limited skilled staff; (iv) promoting
specialization; and (v) reducing cost.
4.16      Under the reorganization plan CSD activities would be implemented
at three levels (in addition to the farm level):   Headquarters; Region
(6); and District (about 39, a reduction from the present 101), assurances
to this effect were obtained at negotiations (para 5.01 (e)). The proposed



- 24 -
reorganization chart is shown in Annex 4-2. Most first-line supervisors
(senior field technical assistants (SFA/STA)) would be stationed away from
their District Headquarters. Under the COCOBOD Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) unit (to be established), a suitable M & E system for CSD
(field/farmer) activities would be organized. Under the CSD-strengthening
component the project would incorporate the following:
(i) Preparation of a comprehensive manpower development program,
including staff training needs, and the prepara-ion of job
descriptins for each position. (To be done by either local or
international consultants, 12 man/months.); and
(ii) Training of staff.
2.   Extension Services for Improved Technology
4.17      Extension operations under the project should be seen in a
longer-term perspective than implied by the five-year project
implementation period. After a period of neglect and poor management, the
cocoa sector is undergoing fundamental change, b . in terms of farmers'
interest in cocoa and the objectives and operations of CSD. These changes
include significant developments for extension. The previous involvement
of "extension' staff in direct services to farmers and in input
distribution and sale, by a heavily-manned service, would be replaced by a
focus on providing appropriate technical advice to farmers, and by a
relatively small, highly trained professional extension service. This
would ensure that the provision of the farm services is responsive to the
needs of cocoa farmers. Simultaneously to the strengthening of extension
under this project, extension operations in the Ministry of Agriculture
which focus on crops other than cocoa would be reorganized and supported
along similar lines under the Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project.
Experience of both these projects with extension strengthening could be a
significant input into a more comprehensive national strategy of extension
reform and strengthening (Annex 4-3). A separate extension service for
cocoa is justified, in the interim, by the more advanced state of the CSD
reorganization process and the urgent need to address sector issues (such
as disease control and production techniques).
4.18      Building on progress to-date, the extension service for cocoa
farmers would be further modified and strengthened. The basic objective of
the extension service is to advise farmers how to increase the production
and profit of their farms, and to keep other farmer services (especially
research and input suppliers) informed of farmers' concerns and needs. The
project would resolve the constraints to effective extension as noted in
para 3.16. Key features of the project extension operations
would include:
(i) a focus on technical advice to farmers and feedback to farmer
support services;
(ii) systematic field activities by EFAs, and systematic supervision



- 25 -
by SPAs and others;
(iii)  development of technical specialization at District, Regional and
Headquarters levels;
(iv)  regular (monthly) training and work review sessions for EFAs and
STAs that would focus on farmer-relevant topics;
(v) regular (each four months) workshops of CRIG and senior extension
staff to discuss messages for extension staff and farmer reaction
to earlier messages;
(vi)  specialized training of all levels of staff;
(vii)  the use of extension-operated demonstrations, individual and
group farmer contacts, and mass media support to enchance both
the specific technical and general informational roles of
extension;
(viii)  monitoring and evaluation of extension field and training
activities; and
(ix)  an end to direct service activities by extension staff and their
direct involvement in the s4le and distribution of inputs.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations (para
5.01 (f)).
4.19      These features of the extension service would be achieved largely
through the redeployment and reorganization of existing staff resources.
Following are the extension sub-components:
(i)  Training - regular in-services, special and overseas courses, and
study tours.
(ii)  Equipment - equipment for field staff and trainers (including
audio-visual support and reference materials) and furniture for
staff houses, Bunso Cocoa college and the former Farmer Training
Centers.
(iii) Civil works - renovation and re-equipping of (a) Bunso Cocoa
College, (b) Farmer Training Centers (to be used for extension
staff in-service training), and (c) 150 houses for Region and
District staff and STAs.
(iv)  Transport - provision of (motorcycles to EFAs, STAs (if needed)
and M&E staff, all on a loan/purchase basis, (b) one 4-WD vehicle
for extension supervision and technical support in each District
and Region and two at headquarters, (c) one 4-WD vehicle for H&E
support at headquarters and one in each of five Regions, and (d)
one 40-seat bus for Bunso cocoa College.



- 26 -
(v) Technical Assistance - 24 staff months for extension field
operations, 18 staff months for training needs analysis and
course development, and 6 staff months for the development of
technical messages and EFA/STA reference materials.
(vi) incremental operating costs - for all field and training
activities (including transport and building maintenance).
4.20      The CSD extension service would perform its intended function
through a number of actions, including improved work programming and
supervision, an emphasis on direct contact with farmers, the instigation of
regular and frequent in-service training, the forging of close two-way
links with cocoa research, and the establishment of a field-oriented
extension monitoring and evaluation system. Four other important features
of the project are: (i) field-level extension support to cocoa farmers in
Volta Regior. would be provided by the Ministry of Agriculture extension
service rather than by CSD; (ii) CSD extension staff would handle all
extension (i.e., of activities elsewhere the responsiblility of MOA) in one
cocoa-producing Region; (iii) CSD extension staff would advise farmers on
agro-forestry rather than solely on cocoa (and coffee, as appropriate); and
(iv) there would be a comprehensive mid-term review of CSD extension
activities in 1990/91 in order to determine what, if any, changes should be
made to improve their effectiveness. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained for (i) and (ii) above (para 5.01 (g)), and for (iv) (para 5.01
(d)).
4.21      The cost of the extension component is estimated at US$7.0
million (t 1.1 billion), of which the foreign exchange is about 48Z.
3.   Seed Production and Distribution
4.22      An accelerated replanting and new planting program is estimated
to require during peak years about 3.2 million pods to supply enough seed
of improved varieties. Capacity of existing seed gardens when
rehabilitated is about 2.93 million pods per year. However, more than 552
of this would be from the area of mass infection of the Swollen Shoot virus
in the Eastern Region and would not be used for planting in the low
infection or clean areas especially in the West. New sources of improved
planting material in virus free areas would be required. Replanting or new
plantings of hybrids in the next five years would depend entirely on seed
from existing seed gardens. Proposed new seed gardens cannot be expected
to produce significant amounts of pods before at least five years. The
management of nurseries also would require improvements to ensure maximum
production.
4.23      The following would be supported by the project:
(i) Increasing production on existinR seed gardens (110 ha) through
provision of equipment, materials, incremental salaries and
transport as follows:



- 27 -
- equipment (mistblowers and spares; and their operating
costs); materials and inputs (fertilizer, insecticides
and fungicides);
- salaries and allowances for an additional senior
technical assistant (to work under the Coordinator of Seed
Gardens at Tafo). Thirty additional pollinators would be
redeployed from CSD staff but they would not be financed by
the project;
- transportation (three 4-WD cars, 3 motorcycles and their
0 & M costs) 2/
(ii)  Establishment of a new cocoa station and 80 ha of seed
gardens in the Western Regions
- buildings and furniture (field barn, quarters, and office
block);
- land clearing, lining, holing, nursery costs. plantings
and infilling for 80 ha of seed gardens;
- operating costs.
(iii)  Irrigated seed pod production on a pilot scale to determine
if pod production could be increased at time of greatest demand.
- a drip irrigation system (pump set, pump house, piping,
nozzles, etc.) for 1 ha; operating and maintenance costs.
(iv) Training:
- training (2 man-months of training for the seed garden
coordinator in another cocoa producing country and local in
service training of 17 EFAs);
The total project cost for seed production and distribution is estimated at
U5$1.3 million of which investment is US$0.9 million and incremental recur-
rent over 5 years is US$0.4 million.
4.24      Organization of Seed Production and Distribution. The Chief Cocoa
Officer (CSD Head Office) would have overall responsibility for the seed
gardens. He would be assisted in the management and coordination of seed
garden activities by the present Seed Garden Coordinator at Tafo and a
second Coordinator to be appointed under the project for the Western, Brong
2/   Improved transportation for seed pod distributon is provided for under
the Input Supply and Marketing Components.



- 28 -
Ahafo and the western part of Ashanti Regions. The clonal material to be
included in the new seed gardens (80 ha) would be chosen in agreement with
CRIG breeders. Cocoa station managers would have responsibility for the
day-to-day activities of the seed gardens. Seed would be distributed by
the Seed Garden Coordinators to the Districts from where District Coordina-
tors (DCOs) would distribute to farmers. Seed distribution should be
limited to farmers who intend to adopt better cultural practices including
preparation of seedlings in nurseries with polybags and be sold at a price
not less than the prevailing market price for equivalent dry weight of
beans presently estimated at ¢ 16Ipod. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations (para 5.01 (h)).
4.   Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) Control
4.25      The swollen sbhot disease is the most serious technical problem
affecting cocoa in Ghana and a cure for it has not yet been found. Some
measures are available however, for reducing its incidence. The most
effective and practical is the eradication of sources of infection. In the
last twenty years the program of inspection and eradication has not been
sustained and the build up of the disease has been large, particularly in
the Eastern Region. The proposals are to revive the inspection program and
to step up eradication to deal with the backlog, estimated at over 17,000
ha, during the first three to four years of the project and then settle
down to maintain adequate inspection and a rate of eradication which is
expected to level at about 150 ha per year. The project would support the
overall strategy introduced by CSD in 1986 to deal with CSSVD. The sub
components to be financed are:
(i)  Incentive payments to farmers at the rate of ¢ 67,000/ha
(assuming a loss of 90 kg/ha of cocoa for 5 years at a price of
0150/kg) for:
- cutting out and replanting grants in the scattered outbreak
area for 10,930 ha and 12,330 ha respectively (the latter
figure includes the replanting of some areas to be cut out
before the project commences);
- cutting out and replanting grants in the area of mass
infection (7,000 ha and 5,000 ha, respectively).
About 372 of the payment is made in the first year of cutting
and if farmers replant, the remaining 63? would be paid in two
equal amounts in the 2nd and 3rd years.
This rate of 0 67,000/ha is presently adequate but would be reviewed
annually to adjust for possible economic changes.
(ii) Technical supervision of the control program would be supported
by financing the following:
- salaries and allowances of one senior officer and one
assistant project officer;



- 29 -
- consultancies totalling 39 man-months (10 man-months of a
cocoa rehabilitation expert, 9 man-months of an economist, 10
man-months of an epidemiolog4.st and 10 man-months of a
management consultant) to assist in assessing effectiveness of
control measures, their costs in relation to benefits, and in
the review of strategy and management of the program;
- trials to test feasibility of eradication by contract and
farmer CSSVD reporting;
- replacing vehicles, spare parts and equipment.
Total costs of this component of the project is estimated at US$11.2
million of which US$11.1 million is for the cutting out program.
4.26      Organization of CSSVD Control.  The project's CSSVD control
program would be managed by CSD staff under the present organizational
arrangements except for the following changes: (a) the senior CEVD
officer would set up and operate a system of monitoring regional CSSVD
control activities, with particular emphasis on ensuring that the
compensation grants reach the farmers for whom they are intended; (b) a
Special Projects Group would be established in CSD to work closely with
CRIG and to supervise and manage all field activities concerned with CSSVD
control. (c) Annual assessments preferably in May would be made on (i) the
progress of CSSVD control; (ii) CSSVD losses and the profitability of the
treatment; and (iii) staff allocations and duties, methods of work and
arrangements for making grant payments. These would be carried out with
the assistance of consultants. More details on CSSVD are given in
Annex 4-4.
5.   Research
4.27      The objective is to provide assistance to strengthen the capacity
of CRIG to deliver the necessary scientific and technical support in
restoring the cocoa industry to its former position in the international
cocoa trade, to reach an annual production level of about 300,000 t by the
turn of the century and to ensure standards of technical efficiency capable
of sustaining the increased production and high quality of product.
4.28      The present main deficiencies (paras 3.11 and 3.12) of CRIG are
(a) a research program which is not sufficiently responsive to the
immediate problems of the industry particularly in production operations,
(b) poor state of repair of laboratories, other facilities and equipment
and (c) inadequate linkages with extension workers and farmers. The
project would assist CRIG to improve its organization and facilities and
strengthen its capacity to meet the needs of a reviving cocoa industry. The
technical assistance would consist of the following main activities:
(a) Staff Development;
(b) Rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities; and



- 30 -
(c) Establishment of an "on-farm" research unit.
4.29      Staff Development.  Provision is made for post graduate training
of the less experienced graduates and for technical training of some of the
laboratory and field technicians. A total of 29 man years of training
abroad would be funded. They include 24 man years for post graduate
training of one to two years abroad each for some of the more recent
graduates, and five man years of training periods of three to six months
each for technical support staff. CRIG has selected for the proposed
post-graduate training program eight graduates who have successfully
completed their probation period and are confirmed or the permanent staff.
A skills gap analysis of the technical support staff will be undertaken
during the latter half of 1987 with assistance of DDA to determine the
training needs and to prepare an appropriate program. For on the job
training provision is made for 78 man months of consultancies in various
disciplines including coffee agronomy, virology, plant breeding and pest
and disease management, farming systems research etc. Funds are also being
provided for special overseas visits by staff to sister institutions, and
attendance at conferences to update themselves on subject matter relevant
to their work. Total costs of the proposed staff development is estimated
at US$3.2 million of which US$2.0 million would be for consultants for on
the iob tiaining.
4.30      Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Facilities.  The project would
support the upgrading of the physical plant and field facilities by
providing for:
(a) upgrading of laboratories by replacing obsolete equipment,
including standbv electricity generator, and repairing or
rehabilitating serviceable items, providing new print shop and
computer equipment, and improving library acquisitions;
(b) constructing a plant quarantine house;
(c)  acquiring vehicles and spares for staff and materials
transport, wheel tractors, equipment and spares for
maintenance of grounds and infrastructure, and machine shop
equipment for maintenance of plant and equipment;
(d) importing new germ plasm materials including improved coffee
varieties, laboratory chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides;
(e) salaries and allowances for one Agricultural Economist to be
added to the staff; and
(f) incremental operating and maintenance costs.
The total investment cost is estimated at US$3.1 million and the
incremental recurrent cost at US$1.5 million over fIve years.



- 31 -
4.31      Faming Systems (On-Fam) Research.  Support would be provided
for establishing a Farming Systems Research Unit by funding the required
staff, transport equipment and their operating costs. The consultant will
draw up and initiate a work program and assist in local st.ff training.
The estimated capital cost is US$66,000 and the incremental recurrent over
five years is US$64,000.
4.32      Research Organization.  The present organizational structure of
CRIG have some limitations particularly at senior .anagement level and in
linkages with extension personnel and farmers for inputs in research
programs and local testing and application of improved technologies. This
project would support measures to correct these limitations. The present
Executive Director has given notice of her desire to retire and would not
wish to hold the post beyond the end of 1987. The appointment of the new
Executive Director would be a condition for credit effectiveness (para 5.02
(a)). The appointment of a full CRIG Management Committee (CRMC) is to be
finalized and the committee made to function in taking important decisions
or settirg guidelines on research policies and priorities, approving work
programs, budgets, funding, staff appointments and terms of service, and
ensuring proper liaison with other institutions and farmer contacts.
Membership of this committee should be broadly based and comprise the
following:
-    the Deputy Chief Executive of COCOBOD (A,P & QC);
-    the Executive Director of CRIG;
-    the Executive Director of CSD;
-    three representatives of CRIG staff and workers nominated by
staff and workers' association;
-    three trmers nominated by by farmers' association; and
-    one representative each from the Government of Ghana, the
universities and the Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research.
4.33      CRMC would establish a Research Policy Sub-Committee (RPC)
comprising of the Executive Director and Deputy Directors (2) of CRIG, the
Executive Director of CSSD, the Deputy Director of CSD responsible for
extension, two regional CSD officers and one farmer. It will be chaired by
the Executive Director of CRIG and the Scientific Secretary of CRIG will
serve as its Secretary. It would advise CRMC on policies and priorities in
line with national development goals and should meet at least once a year.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations to have the RPC fully
operational by June 30, 1988 (para 5.01 (i)). The existing Cocoa Research
and Extension Technical Committee (CRETC) will be strenghtened and take
full responsibility for interagency coordination and advising on technical
matters affecting the orderly management of CRIG. Its membership shall
include the Executive Director of CSD (Chairman), Deputy Directors (2) of



- 32 -
CRIG, Heads of Divisions (6) of CRIG, the Director of PPMR, a
Representative of the Produce Inspection Section, Regional Cocoa Officers
(6) of CSD, and the Coordinator of Seed Gardens. It would meet at least
three times a year. It would pay particular attention to fostering the
linkages between extension services and farmers. In this regard it would
assume a special responsibility for organizing workshops in which the
senior research staff of CRIG would meet with cocoa extension staff to
review current status of the industry, highlighting problems requiring
attention and to be briefed on progress with ongoing research programs and
future plans. These seminars lasting one to two days, would take place
three times a year. They would represent an important forum from which to
acquaint research workers with cocoa industry problems and to inform
extension staff on new developments from research, technology packages
being formulated and tested, particularly the farming systems research
work, and the status of results for practical applications. Day to day
contact between CRIG and the extension service would be through (a) the
research and extension workshops to be organized three times a year (b)
periodic field visits on request to advise on special problems and (c)
regular visits to CRIG organized for benefit of extension workers and
farmers. Details on the 2esearch component are given in Annex 4-5.
4.34      CRIG management should seek impartial reviews of the scientific
and technical content of the approved research program, the quality of its
conduct, its relevance to farmers' and the industry's problems and the
soundness of the results. The project is to support the establishment of an
independent review body comprising internationally recognized high caliber
scientists who would meet periodically to assess the research program and
to advise the RPTC on the extent to which its recommendations are being
implemented and to indicate where changes in policies and programs may be
necessary. The first review should take place during the early part of
1988, the first year of project implementation and followed by another at
about the mid-term (1990/91) and thereafter at least every five years.
Assurances were obtaine&aat negotiations for this periodic review (para
5.01 (j)).
6.   Parm Input Supply
4.35      The COCOBOD is the main supplier of farm inputs to cocoa farmers
(para 3.21). For some of the inputs such as insecticides, fungicides and
mistblowets, COCOBOD has vertically integrated operations from impo;ting to
retail distribution. The Government, through COCOBOD, has agreed in
principle (under the SAC) to the removal of subsidies and the privatization
of farm input supply and distribution. The project would help COCOBOD to
adopt a subsidy removal and privatization program similar to the one agreed
upon for other r.on-cocoa inputs under the Agricultural Services
Rehabilitation froject (ASRP). GOG, through COCOBOD, has announced (May
1987) the first step of a three-year subsidy removal program. At
negotiations, agreement was reached on the elimination of subsidies over
the next two years, 1988 and 1989 (para 5.01 (k) and Annex 4-6). Impact of
subsidy removal on cocoa producer incentives is discussed in para 4.69.
Alongside the subsidy removal, a privatization plan has been agreed to in



- 33 -
principle during appraisal. A gradual process of privatization is planned
to allow time for the private sector to develop a wide retail network with
a minimum disruption in the supply system. The proposed program would
first privatize retailing, then wholesaling and finally importation.
Privatization would fit well into the divestiture program that GJG started,
increase competition and would be consistent with the marketing
arrangements under the ASRP.
4.36      The distribution of tools (matchets, knives, etc.) would have
been privatized prior to project start-up, or as soon as existing COCOBOD
stocks are sold out. In the first year (1988) the project would introduce
private retailing in the Eastern Region. COCOBOD would continue to deliver
at regional level or other 'bulk delivery' points. Retailers would sell at
uniform prices and they would buy at prices that allowed them a negotiated
margin. The experience gained would be used for designing a national
retailing network. In the second year (1989) the retailing would be
privatized in the Central and Volta Regions as was done in the Eastern,
with due modifications in response to lessons learnt. COCOBOD would
relinquish bulk delivery in the Eastern, Central and Volta Regions. The
prices would be higher, reflecting reduced subsidy levels, and would thus
be variable from region to region. In the third year (1990) both bulk
delivery and retailing in Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo Regions would be
privatized. The faster pace of privatization at this stage should be
possible given the experience gained in the Eastern, Central and Volta
Regions. All inputs would be sold at market prices in all regions. In the
fourth year (1991) both the bulk delivery and retailing activities would be
privatized in the Western Region. The private sector would now be fully
involved in all the regions. In May 1991, COCOBOD would announce that
starting the following year (1992), the private sector would be allowed to
import approved inputs for the cocoa industry. The announcement would
indicate clearly estimated annual requirements and existing stocks (if
any). The entire progress report on the implementation of the Program
would be provided to IDA by COCOBOD annually by March each year.
Assurances to this 5-year plan were obtained at nagotiations (para 5.01
(1)). The total cost of this component would be US$25.0'million of which
US$16.6 million would be for imports of agro-chemicals.
7.   Internal Marketing
4.37      This component consists of the following five major activities:
Buying, storing, hauling, grading and inspection, and infestation control.
The first three activities are carried out by the Produce Buying Company
(PBC) and the last two by the Produce Inspection Division (PID) and
Infestation Control Department (ICD) respectively (para 3.26 to 3.30).
4.38      The efficiency of the marketing system would be best improved by
introducing a commercial approach and encouraging competition to the
present system as discussed in para 4.09 for the short and long term
strategy. However, the poor condition of the economy and infrastructure
and the resultant weakness of the private sector do not permit progress



- 34 -
towards privatization as rapidly as desired, the commercialization process
could and should be introduced to PID, ICD and PBC.
4.39      The project would therefore provide short term technical
assistance (9 man months) to put in place an appropriate cost accounting
system and train staff and management in operating and using it. To
provide the cocoa sector with a smooth evaucation system, maintain its high
quality control and grading operation and ensure that all consignments are
exported free from deleterious organisms, the project would also provide:
(a) additional storage capacity, mainly in the western region, of about
10,000 tons (10 warehouses), improvement to existing sheds and limited new
construction at society level, provided rental of suitable sheds is not
available; (b) replacement, on declining scale, of transportation
facilities for PBC, ICD and PID mainly for supervision and evacuation of
cocoa from societies to regional depots; (c) equipment and materials; (d)
recruitment of two international caliber specialists, one for three years
and the other for 18 months to train counterpart staff and manage the
workshop and the logistic program and the workshop, respectively; (e) staff
training in various areas such as accounting, administration, management,
and vehicle and plant operation and maintenance, both through in-service
training and specialized training courses, and (f) 2 man months of
consultant assistance for a feasibility study concerning the use of
semi-mechanized methods of handling the vast quantities of produce passing
through ports and large depots. Total cost, including contingencies, of
the internal marketing elements over the five-year project period is
estimated at US$20.7 million of which the foreign exchange is US$13.1
million.
4.40      Organization.  ICD, PBC and PID would be responsible, each in its
own area, to COCOBOD management for the implementation of the project's
internal marketing program. In conformity with the policy of
cost-reduction through rationalization and streamlining of the buying
system, the project would assume the following actions to be completed by
the second year of the project (1989):
(1) All buying centers (societies) with annual purchases of less than
25 tons (about 656 societies) would be closed down;
(2) all buying centers with annual purchases between 25 and 50 tons,
about 830 societies, would be converted into sub-societies
(mobile buying units to visit the 'closed society" once a week).
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiation (para 5.01 (m)).
4.41      Action on each buying center would be taken only after a careful
study on the following criteria, among others:
-    Average purchases over the past three years;
-    future expectations for next 2-3 years regarding new farms, fire
damage or cutting out, etc.;



- 35 -
-    condition of roads/accessibilIty.
Arising from this lower number of buying centers, a corresponding
streamlining of districts would have to ensue, reducing their number by
approximately 35 to a new total of about 95.
4.42      Through the above rationalization, the number of full societies
(buying centers) would be reduced from 3,218 at present to about 1,730
which, based on 1985/86 crop, would achieve an average of 118 tons
annually. However, the number of buying points would be considerably
higher, about 2,700. Since the average productivity at the buying centers
(full societies) would still be low, it is expected that the buying team,
where possible, would on one or two fixed days per week, do the purchasing
in their sub-society(ies).
8.   Monitoring and Evaluation
4.43      The project would help to strengthen the overall policy analysis
capacity and would establish a project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
within the Policy Planning, Monitoring and Research Department (PPMRD) of
COCOBOD. M&E units would also be established in CSD and PBC. Given the
importance of cocoa in the economy and the fact that all aspects of the
management of the cocoa industry are under the control of COCOBOD, ic is
necessary to have an internal capacity to articulate the policy
implications of changes in the macro and global economy. COCOBOD also
needs to monitor and evaluate the implementation of specific policy actions
and programs. The project proposes a reorganization of PPMRD to enable it
to concentrate on three main areass (i) Policy Analysis; (ii) Program
Monitoring and Corporate Planning; and (iii) Management Information Systems
and Data Bank. The policy analysis function would inzlude studies of (a)
optimal pricing and taxation, given government's macro economic objectives
of revenue and foreign exchange earnings; (b) effect of changing farmgate
prices on producer incentives; (c) Ghana's comparative advantage in cocoa
production as well as the competitiveness of cocoa versus other tree and
food crops; and (d) resource use patterns at farm level especially land and
labor. The program monitoring and corporate planning function would
include (a) collating and monitoring of the COCOBOD's work program; (b)
coordinating the preparation of the corporate plan; (c) monitoring
conformity to the corporate strategy; and (d) preparation of progress
reports. The management information system and data bank function would
include (a) the production of periodic information for managerial
decision-making; (b) abstracting from the findings of the policy analysis
unit, those aspects of operational relevance; (c) maintaining of a data
bank on all aspects of the cocoa industry; (d) managing a library; (e)
liaising with all the divisions of COCOBOD on the production of quality
data; and (f) preparing all periodic reports to external agencies incluAding
the Government, Bank of Ghana, World Bank, etc. PPMR has an adequate
establishment of higher level staff; 3 positioLs for managers (one vacant);
4 for principal officers (3 vacant); 6 for senior officers (4 vacant) and 2
for officers (1 vacant). The filling of the vacant slots should provide an
opportunity for a new skills mix in line with changing needs. The existing



- 36 -
and proposed organization charts are shown in Annex 4-7, Charts 1 and 2.
The project would provide equipment including 2 micro computers, 2 word
processors, a photocopying machine and equipping a library.
4.44      The COCOBOD complex has an extensive system of data collection
for all its divisions as well as the headquarters. The capacity to
interpret data for day-to-day management decisions seems weak. For the
headquarters as well as for industry-wide data analysis, the proposed PPMR
Unit in charge of the MIS and Data Bank would help fill the void by
recruiting specialists for MIS and for Monitoring and Evaluation. For CSD
and PBC, Monitoring and Evaluation Units would be set up. CSD would
recruit two people (preferably agricultural economists) to help the
district, regional and headquarter managers to draw up detailed work
programs and to establish a system of monitoring the work program as well
as the extension impact generally. An additional agricultural economist
with farm management specialization, would also be recruited and be based
at CSD headquarters to liaise with the PPMR and to monitor farm level
incentives (a function previously done by PPMR). All the three people
should report to the Executive Director of CSD. PBC operations are large
and complex. There is a need for careful monitoring. It would recruit two
people (preferably a statistician and transport economist) to help monitor
its work program and to develop data for costing of the purchasing
operations. The two people would report to the Managing Director of PBC.
They would provide a link to the corporate planning function of PPMRD. The
Director of PPMRD would have overall intellectual responsibility for the
M&E function. Technical assistance support would be provided for a total
of 2 man years to help set up the system.
4.45      Studies.  Several studies are envisaged:  three of them would be
done under the CRP and two others under separate IDA financing. All terms
of reference for the studies are provided in Working Paper 8. A cocoa
survey would be done by CSD, assisted by PPMRD, in order to update
information on the tree stock. The study would seek to update all the
technical aspects of cocoa including: age-distribution, condition, input
use, yields, disease control, etc. Thereafter, the PPMRD would develop a
system for routine maintenance of the data through a farm monitoring
system. Little information exists on the socio-economic aspects of cocoa
farming. A separate study would be done to ascertain farm level dynamics
in response to the level of producer prices (cocoa and non-cocoa), impact
of extension, attitudes towards the disease control strategy, adequacy of
input supply system, need for credit, estimation of household income and
expenditure, use of labor (hired and family), land tenure arrangements,
share-cropping arrangements, etc. Routine maintenance of the information
would be done through the farm monitoring system. The third study would
deal with the question of streamlining the COCOBOD. Major structural
changes have taken place (for instance, divestiture of some plantations,
staff retrenchment, and budgetary restraint). The Head Office was not much
affected by the structural changes. Under the CRP, a study would be
undertaken to define an appropriate organizational structure; assess
manpower needs and skill gaps; identify training needs, prepare a master
plan for the upgrading facilities (office technology, space,



- 37 -
communications, etc.); propose on improved personnel management system and
prepare a retrenchment plan for the headquarters. Under the SAC, a pricing
study is proposed (its terms of reference are in Working Paper 5). The
study (see para 4.69 also) will focus on improving producer incentives;
assessing the revenue implications of alt.ernative producer prices and the
foreign exchange implications of different pricing strategies and
recommending a methodology to guide the determination of the annual cocoa
price to farmers. A marketing seminar to review comparative experiences of
other cocoa producing countries (such as Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and
Malaysia) in the role of and benefit from privatization a part or all of
the marketing functions would be organized by the Government with the
assistance of the Bank in December 1987. Assurances to this effect have
already been obtained in the SAC. Depending on the outcome of the
discussions a study of the marketing options for Ghana would be done during
calendar 1988.
9.   Road Program
4.46      The road program specific objectives are to (i) improve cocoa
evacuation efficiency; (ii) significantly reduce haulage cost; and (iii)
increase private haulers' interest in playing larger role in cocoa
evacuation. The objectives would be achieved by improving the standard of
roads subjected to cocoa haulage traffic, and maintaining the higher
standard.
4.47      The road program consists of the following 7 sub-componentss
(a) Spot Improvement Program. Remedial improvements to some 3,000 km
of primary, secondary and feeder roads and bridges, predominantly
in Western Brong Ahafo and Ashanti regions, which carry cocoa
traffic from village society to port or railhead. The program
would be planned and supervised by consultants. Spot improvement
program would be:
88189   89/90   90/91   91/92   92/93       Total
300     650     800      800     450      3,000
Approximately 25Z of the program will be executed by
labor-intensive domestic contractors currently undergoing
training under RRMP by an ILO team. DFR, assisted by ILO, will
supervise this element of the program.
Total cub-component cost is estimated at US$36.8 million of which US$24.3
million (66Z) is foreign exchange.
(b) Routine and Recurrent Maintenance Program. Road maintenance
would comprise (a) routine maintenance, i.e., the day-to-day
repair of potholes, ruts and drain clearance; and (b) recurrent



- 38 -
annual mechanized maintenance. Throughout the cocoa regions
there is a starting inventory of 1,300 km of road constructed, or
reinstated, since 1984 by COCOBOD and DFR, which is in adequate
condition for normal maintenance procedures. This inventory
would increase annually by the spot improvement program.
Recurrent plant-intensive maintenance would be implemented by
,ontractors. Routine maintenance would be carried out by
labor-intensive community effort where possible, applying
practices currently being developed by the RRMP (Credit 16u1-GH).
IDA will periodically review this activity with the DFR and ILO
team, and CPR will provide the vehicle for implementing and
disseminating their methods throughout the cocoa-growing
Districts. There is budgetary provision for hand tools and
supervisory staff vehicles. GOG will fund both routine and
recurrent maintenance operations.
The project makes no provision for periodic maintenance, which
should be programmed under normal DFR budgetary procedure after
project completion. Recurrent maintenance program would be:
88/89   89/90   90/91   91/92  92/93
No. of contracts          2       3        4       6       7
Kms                      600     900    1,200   1,800  2,100
Total sub-component cost is estimated at US$4.4 million of which US$1.1
million (25%) is foreign exchange.
(c)  New Road Construction.  60 km of new road and 2 major bridges
would be constructed to DFR specification in the area between the
Bia River and the Cote d'Ivoire border, to intercept cocoa which
is being transported into Cote d'Ivoire. The area has no
vehicular access to Ghana, and is reputed to yield some 4,000
tons of cocoa. The road would be supplemented by some 80 km of
track suitable for tractor/trailer combination access to
villages. Consultants would be engaged to plan and prepare
contract documents for LCB, and supervise construction. The
proposed program is:
88     89     90      91     Total
New road km         0     20     20      20      60
Tracks km           0     25     30      25      80
Total sub-component cost is estimated at US$1.9 million of which US$1.1
million (58Z) is foreign exchange.
(d) Technical Assistance
(i) Consultancy:



- 39 -
Planning the rehabilitation and spot improvement program
will be by consultants engaged and financed by REMP. CRP
will provide the following consultancy:
Spot Improvement Supervision       -    500 mm local
New Constrt-   n and Bridging      -     12 mm international
67 mm local
(ii) Headquarters - DFR
TPR will provide a Contract Administrator and Procurement
Adviser for 24 man months commencing September 1988, and a
Training Adviser for 12 man months commencing mid-1988.
(iii)  DFR Field Staff
UNDP will fund 2 volunteers with civil engineering
backgrounds to assist in site supervision and contract
administration of labor-intensive contracts, and 1 volunteer
with mechanical engineering experience to advise DFR and
contractors on equipment and plant management.
(iv) Roads Adviser
A Roads Engineer of international caliber will be appoitned
to COCOBOD under TOR agreed with IDA for the project
duration to coordinate all activities related to the roads
component. Appointment of the Roads Adviser will be a
condition of credit effectiveness (para 5.03 (a)).
(v)  DFR Staff
In order for DFR to obtain full benefit from the technical
assistance, recruitment of the following staff would be a
condition for disbursement against the road component (para
5.03 (a)):
3 training instructors
1 procurement/contract administrator
3 contract supervisors as counterparts to volunteers.
(e)  Ecuipment for DFR.  The project would supply vehicles, minor
survey and materials testing equipment, materials and radio, for
field operations and site supervision of project activities.
4.48      During negotiatiorns, assurances were obtained that (i) DFR's
annual approved budget and work program, for its cocoa road plan, would be
submitted by August 31, four months prior to each fiscal year, for IDA and
COCOBOD review (para 5.01 (n); (ii) the work program would include economic
evaluation based on criteria comprising vehicle operating cost savings,
quantity of cocoa to be evacuated, and the rehabilitation cost involved



- 40 -
(para 5.01 (o); these criteria would be used to rank roads on the basis of
the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Values (NPV); and (iii)
DFR's consultant and senior staff with qualifications and experience
acceptable to IDA would be appointed on agreed terms and conditions (para
5.01 (p).
H.        Proiect Cost and Financing
4.49      The total project costs over the five year development period are
estimated at US$128.0 million (equivalent to $ 20.5 billion) of which
US$76.8 million or about 60X is foreign exchange. The base costs are
estimated using prices obtained during appraisal in May 1987 and adjusted
to levels expected to prevail at time of negotiations estimated to be in
October 1987. The costs include (i) a physical contingency equivalent to
10? of base costs on all items; and (ii) price contingencies calculated on
base costs plus physical contingencies and compounded annually as follows
(a) for all locai costs, 15Z (1988), 10? (1989), 7.5 (1990 to 1992); (b)
the price contingency on the costs to be incurred in foreign exchange costs
(applying MUV Index), 1.3? (1988 to 1990); 3.5? (1991 and 1992). Total
contingencies are equivalent to about 25Z of base costs or 20? of total
costs. Project costs are summarized in Annex 4-8, Tables 1 to 3 and
detailed in the working papers. The table below highlights components and
their respective cost.   The costs are all incremental except the cost of
insecticides for the first year of the project which includes total
requirements. This was found to be essential to assure timely supplies
(para 4.35). Subsequent costs of insecticides as well as the costs of
fertilizer and fungicides are all incremental. The use of a constant
exchange rate despite a differential in foreign/domestic inflation rates
projected in the project's early years would not lead to over-commitment of
IDA financing since it would finance mainly foreign exchange costs and the
CSSVD incentive payment which is closely related to the world cocoa prices.

4.50      The proposed IDA credit of US$40.0 million represents 35.8? of
total project costs excluding taxes and duties, and it would cover 52? of
the foreign exchange cost. The balance of US$88.0 million would be funded
as follows: cofinanciers (foreign exchange balance) US$41.8; the Government
of Ghana would meet all the local costs on the road component amounting to
US$18.9 million and COCOBOD would finance the remaining local costs
amounting to US$27.3 million. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that COCOBOD would include in its annual recurrent and capital
budgets adequate funds to finance project activities excluding roads (para
5.01 (a)). IDA credit would be made available to GOG of which US$10.2
million would be allocated to the road component under DFR and the balance
of US$29.8 million to project components under COCOBOD. About US$15.5
million of the COCOBOD allocation would be applied, in the form of a grant,
to COCOBOD non-commercial activities including headquarters strengthening,
research, extension, training, disease control and seed production; the
balance of US$14.3 million would be on-lent by GOG to COCOBOD, under a
subsidiary loan agreement drawn up between them, for COCOBOD's commercial
activities including internal marketing and input supply. The period of
the on-lending would not exceed 20 years including 5 years grace period,
and the interest rate would at least be 1.1 times the IBRD prevailing rate.
COCOBOD would assume the foreign exchange risk. There are no comparable
rates in the financial markets in Ghana which would be used as a benchmark.
IDA and GOG are in the process of developing a financial sector adjustment
package which would include agreement on an interest rate structure.
Assurances would be sought that any amendments needed to achieve
consistency with the agreed financial sector policy would be made by
December 1988. Signing of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a
condition of credit effectiveness (para 5.02 (b)). The balance of US$10.8
million would be used by GOG to finance DFR for the cocoa road program.
Fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
cofiranciers credit would be a condition of effectiveness of IDA credit"
(para 5.02 (c)).
The proposed financing plan is summarized below:

- 42 -
There is a strong likelihood of attracting cofinancing: ODA has expressed
an interest by sending one of their staff to join preappraisal mission.
Other potential cofinanciers are being contacted. In the event that
adequate cofinancing to fill the gap has not been committed within 6 months
after board approval, GOG and/or COCOBOD will undertake to finance the
shortfall. Assurances to this effect would be sought at negotiations (para
5.02 (a)).
I.        Proiect Implementation and Management
4.51      While the Government of Ghana through its Ministry for Cocoa
Affairs would be responsible for ensuring that the project would be carried
out in accordance with the Credit and Project Agreements, Ghana Cocoa Board
(COCOBOD) would have direct responsibility for implementing all project
components except Roads which would be undertaken by the Ministry of Roads
and Highways (MRH) and implemented by its Department of Feeder Roads (DFR).
4.52      The project would be implemented through existing institutions:
COCOBOD and DFR (paras 3.10 to 3.46 and Annexes 4-9 and
3-2, respectively). No special project management unit would be
established and the overall responsibility for the project (excluding
roads) would rest with the Chief Executive of COCOBOD. Each
Division/Department or subsidiary (CRIG, CSD, ICD, PBC, PIO and COCOBOD
Headquarters with its departments) would be responsible for its respective
project component(s). COCOBOD and DFR (for the cocoa road program) would
submit along with their annual budget, an annual work plan approved by the
respective authorities for (a) roads; (b) research, seed production, CSSVD
control, extension, PBC, ICD, PID, PPMR; and (c) procurement at least four
months prior to each fiscal year for IDA review. Assurances to this effect
were obtained at negotiations (para 5.01 (n)). The project would be
4mplemented over five years; starting in March 1988 with completion
expected by July 1993 (Annex 4-10). The road program would be performed in
approximately equal tenders over the five-year implementation period. The
IDA credit would be disbursed over a period of 6 years of which about 901
by PY5 (CY 1992). As the project would be implemented through existing
institutions it is expected to be completed on schedule.
4.53      To establish the basis for a dynamic cocoa industry, specific
actions were agreed at negotiations. They would include measures to: (a)
improve and maintain throughout the project period cocoa producer
incentives; this would be a condition for credit effectiveness (para 5.02
(d)); (b) mid-term review on all project components, to assess progress and
ensure adjustment to prevailing conditions and policy, would be undertaken
in PY3 (1990/91); and (c) annual review of (i) COCOBOD's corporate plan,
(ii) farm input privatization plan, and (iii) internal marketing including
policy issues such as the use of private storage, increase of railways and
private hauling share in cocoa evacuation, and in particular COCOBOD's
marketing role; and (iv) CSSVD incentive payments. Assurances to (b) and
(c) above were obtained at negotiations (para 5.01 (d)). Agreement at the
mid-term review on internal marketing strategy and its work program of



- 43 -
internal marketing would be a condition for disbursement against this
component (para 5.03 (b)).
4.54      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that during the project
implementation period COCOBOD and DFR would employ consultants and the
following officers, with qualifications and experience acceptable to the
Government and IDA (para 5.01 (p)): Executive Directors (ED) for: CSD and
CRIG; Managing Director for PBC; Directors for Finance/Budget, Audit,
Policy Planning, Monitoring and Research (PPMR). Any change in the posts
of COCOBOD Chief Executive, its Deputy Chief Executives and the Dire"tor of
DFR would be undertaken in consultation with IDA. Conditions of credit
effectiveness would be that the DCE for Finance and Administration and the
ED for CRIG would be in post (para 5.02 (e) & (a)).
Technical Assistance
4.55      The need to streamline COCOBOD operations and to achieve project
objectives requires strengthening of the management and operational
systems. There are various areas where technical assistance is essential.
The project would, therefore, provide the followings
(i)       CSD
(a) Senior Agronomist operating as Deputy
Executive Director (Operation) for the entire project
period;
(b) 18 man-months for curriculumt development and training;
(c) 6 man-months for development of technical messages;
(d) 24 man-months for extension field system operating as
Technical Manager (Extension).
(ii)      CRIG
(a) up to 2 man-years of an agricultural
Economist/Farming Systems Specialist to assist with
organising and establishing the CRIGICSD Farming systems
unit, initiating its work program and training the two young
Agricultural Economists to be recruited for Farming Systems
work and Research Appraisal.
(b) 78 man-months of short term consultancies, according to
CRIG's needs, during the next five years to assist in the
Research program in different disciplines including, cocoa
agronomy, plant breeding, virology, soils, entomology, plant
pathology and biochemistry.
(iii)     PBC
(a) 9 man-months to put in place an
appropriate cost accounting system and train staff and
management in operating and using it;
(b) 2 man-months for a feasibility study concerning the use
of semi mechanized methods of handling the vast quanitities
of produce passing through ports and large depots;
(c) 3 man-years to manage and rationalize
the logistics system and to train counterpart staff (Haulage
Manager and consultant support);



- 44 -
(d) 18 man-months to manage the workshop and train
counterpart staff.
(iv)      COCOBOD Headquarters
(a) Management Information Systems Specialist
for 2 man-years (Head of MIS and Data Bank);
(b) Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist for
2 man-years (Head of M&E Unit); and
(c) 12 man-months to strengthen the
accounting system, introduce computer and train accounting
staff.
(v)       Road Program
(a) Road engineer for the project duration to coordinate and
supervise the activities of COCOBOD and DFR; and
(b) technical assistance provided through DFR which is
described in (para 4.49).
To increase its effectiveness the technical assistance staff would be
operating in line positions. An indigenous counterpart should be assigned
to work closely with and be trained by the respective technical assistant.
To ensure a better selection the technical assistant would be involved as
much as possible in the selection of his/her counterpart. Prior to external
recruitment of the required technical assistants, an effort would be made
to select suitable Ghanaian candidates with experience and qualifications
acceptable to GOG and IDA. The appointment of suitable persons with
experience and qualifications acceptable to the Government and IDA to fill
the following positions would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para
5.02 (f): (a) CSD Deputy Executive Director (Operations); (b) Technical
Manager Extension; (c) PBC Haulage Manager; (d) Deputy Director PPMR in
charge of MIS; and (e) Head of M&E Units (COCOBOD Headquarters).
Corporate Plan
4.56      Restructuring of COCOBOD and streamlining its operations are the
guiding principles for the three-year rolling corporate elan agreed under
the SAC. This plan would be based on COCOBOD's long te.m strategy. In
brief, COCOBOD would aim to progressively restrict its involvement to
marketing, quality control, extension, research and disease control. Under
the SAC, the corporate plan would be reviewed annually, this would be
continued and extended to cover the entire project period; assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations (para 5.01 (q)). Also,
assurances were confirmed at negotiations that the following terms agreed
under the SAC would be carried out (para ,v.11 (r)):
(i) Plantations. The study concerning the viability of the remaining
40 plantations would be completed as scheduled (September 1987) and actions
would be taken on its recommendations;
(ii)Cocoa Processing Plants. Rehabilitation of any of the cocoa
processing plants would take place only after feasibility studies financed
by COCOBOD have been undertaken in consultation with IDA, oD. their
viability;



- 45 -
(iii) Abuakwa Formulation Plant. COCOBOD would continue its efforts to
enter into joint venture arrangement for the Abuakwa Formulation Plant and
reports on progress made would be submitted quarterly.

4.58      Procurement of all goods, including feeder roads, works and
services financed under IDA credit would be procured in accordance with IDA
procurement guidelines. All contracts exceeding US$100,000 for vehicles,
equipment, works and farm inputs wou,d be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), since contracts of lesser value are unlikely to
attract international bidders.  Whenever possible, purchases would be
grouped into packages of at least US$100,000. Purchases valued at less
than US$100,000 but above US$60,000 would be procured through Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB). Purchases for group of items valued at less
than US$60,000 would be made through international or direct competitive
shopping on the basis of at least 3 quotations. A margin of 15Z of the
c.i.f. bid price or actual customs duties, whichever is less, would be
allowed for domestic preference to manufacturers. For roads constructed on
a turnkey basis and for other civil works, subject to ICB and LCB, a
prequalification process would be followed in accordance with IDA
guidelines and a margin of domestic preference of 7.51 would be allowed to
bona fide domestic contractors. Procurement under ICB and LCB would amount
to US$94.2 million. Procurement of consultancy services,



- 46 -
internationally-recruited staff, staff training and studies (US$11.7
million) would be done in accordance with IDA guidelines for the selection
of consultants. Other procurement largely financed by the Government and
COCOBOD such as: (i) the construction of minor civil works on force
account (US$0.2 million); (ii) local shopping for operating and general
services including salaries and allowances, vehicle and equipment operation
and maintenance, other operating cost like seed garden maintenance, library
acquisitions, building/houses maintenance, and purchase of stationery and
supply (US$11.9 million); and (iii) incentive payments to farmers for
cutting out infected trees (CSSVD) and replanting (US$10.0 million).
COCOBOD existing procurement guidelines summarized in Annex 4-11, have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable. All bidding packages, above
US$200,000 for goods, works &nd services, would be subject to prior review
by IDA and would represent 802 of the total value of procurement.
K.        Disbursement
4.59      The IDA Credit amounting to US$40.0 million would be disbursed
over six years beginning about the first semester of IDA PY89 through FY93.
The disbursement schedule is provided in Annex 4-12, while being shorter
than that for the Ghana historical disbursement profile of eight years for
agricultural and rural development projects is considered realistic for the
following reasons:
(a) the proposed project would be implemented by the existing
organization thus avoiding problems associated with organizational start
up, rivalry and the learning process.
(b) COCOBOD has had recent experience under various IDA credits which
should prove useful in implementing the proposed project.
(c) COCOBOD has no4, a better corporate vision than before, it is
finalizing the preparation of a Corporate Plan and should thus be in a good
position to implement the proposed actions (under the project) all of which
are in support of the corporate strategy.

amounting to less than the equivalent of US$50,000; (ii) purchases duly

would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE); and (iv)
CSSVD campaign payment to farmers. All supporting documents for SOEs would
be 1,eld by COCOBOD or DFR as appropriate in a readily available form and be
made available for inspection upon request by the IDA. Whenever possible,
withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of at least
US$20,000 prior to submission to IDA for reimbursement out of credit
proceeds. IDA reimbursements would be made to the Special Accounts if
appropriate or the COCOBOD or DFR respective account. Retroactive
financing would be allowed for expenditures incurred after January 1, 1988
as follows: (i) up to SDR 200,000 (US$250,000 equivalent) on Technical
Assistance (Category 7 of the disbursement schedule); and (ii) up to SDR
320,000 (US$400,000 equivalent) on contracts for the road component
(Category 2 (c) of the disbursement schedule).
4.61      Special Accounts.  At negotiations, assurances were obtained that
GOG through DFR would establish for the cocoa roads program a project
account (DFR cocoa account) with a local commercial bank. This account
(account No. 1) would receive the government contributions and be used to
pay for goods and services required for implementation of the cocoa road
program; GOG would pay its contribution, as would be stated in the approved
annual budget, quarterly and in advance into DFR (cocoa) account (para 5.01



- 48 -
(b)). GOG would deposit in the said DFR account 0160 million (US$1.0
million) which represents the estimated local operating and capital costs
for the first six months of the project, as a condition of credit
effectiveness (para 5.02 (g)). In addition DFR and COCOBOD would each
establish a special account (Account Nos. 2 and 3, respectively) for their
project components into which IDA would make an initial deposit of US$0.2
million in COCOBOD account and US$0.5 million in DFR account to be used to
prefinance goods and services reimbursable under the credit. The special
accounts would be operated under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and
IDA would, at its discretion, hold back their replenishment in the absence
of adequate financing by GOG and COCOBOD of the respective project compo-
nents. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para
5.01 (c)). The accounts would be managed by DFR and COCOBOD respectively
and should any disbursement made from these account(s) be found ineligible
for financing, GOG would deposit the corresponding amount into the
account(s) prior to submission of any further replenishment applications.
Special account procedures are given in Annex 4-13.
L.        Auditing and Reporting
4.62      All accounts related to the project including SOEs, and all
accounts related to COCOBOD subsidiaries/Divisions including its
consolidated one, would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The auditors report and statements of account would be
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year of COCOBOD
or GOG as applicable. COCOBOD and DFR would submit quarterly progress
reports to IDA and later a report on the project implementation and
achievements with six months of the project's closing date. Details of
reporting requirements are in Annex 4-14. As agreed under the SAC, COCOBOD
accounts, including its subsidiaries' accounts, would be audited as
follows: (i) all years up to September 30, 1985, by June 30, 1987; and
(ii) year ended September 30, 1986, by December 31, 1987. Submission of
1985 and 1986 audited reports, for COCOBOD and its subsidiaries, would be a
condition of credit effectiveness (para 5.02 (h)).
M.        Production, Marketing and Prices
4.63      Annual cocoa production in Ghana is expected to rise from about
225,000 tons in 1986/87 to about 263,000 tons in 1992/93 after which it
would rise relatively fast to about 310,000 tons in 1999 and reach a level
of about 333,000 ir 2002. The production growth would come from new
plantings started in the 1980s which will come into full bearing in the
mid-1990s. Within these total production estimates, the incremental annual
production attributable to project activities would be about 20,000 tons by
PYS (CY 1992) rising to approximately 105,000 tons by PY15 (CY 2002). This
would bring Ghana's total production to 255,000 tons and 353,000 tons in
1992 and 2002, respectively.



- 49 -
4.64      World cocoa production is forecast 31 to grow at an average of
1.7? per annum through the year 2000, by which time production is expected
to reach 2.5 million tons. Ghana's share of global cocoa production about
the year 2000 is expected to rise from the 1986/87 level of 12? to about
16t. The increased production of Ghana cocoa is forecast to have only a
marginal impact on world market prices: estimates 3/ show that the drop in
the world market prices attributable to increased production from Ghana
cocoa would amount to 2.62 in 1995, rise to 3.6? in 1997, then decline to
2.5? in 1999. The prices are expected to level off thereafter as
production stabilizes (Annex 4-15, Table 1). Ghana cocoa commands a
quality premium equivalent to about 10? above the world market price. Its
cocoa is in strong demand and it is thus expected that the incremental
output would be easily absorbed on the world market.
4.65      Cocoa prices are forecast to remain close to the present levels
until 1990 and to rise gradually through 1995 (Annex 4-16, Table 2). New
plantings are ezpected to slow down more in countries such as Brazil and
Malaysia where the producer share of world price is higher than in African
producing countries. If this scenario were realized, the period 1990-95
would be characterized by a reduced production growth rate and a consequent
increase in prices in real terms. The market shares of the major producing
countries are expected to change in response to improved producer
incentives. African countries like Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana
currently paying 30-502 of world prices have a larger potential for
production increases than, say, Brazil, which is already paying producers
60-70? of world prices. The low world.s market prices that are expected to
prevail in the next decade should not adversely affect Ghanaian producers
because existing producer prices are low in comparison to f.o.b. prices and
thus provide room for more producer price increases.
Cocoa Producer Prices
4.66      In the long run, cocoa producer prices in Ghana should be linked
to the world price and be determined by market forces. Export taxes should
ultimately be replaced by income taxes. Input subsidies are already being
removed and should be eliminated in May 1989. Other measures include the
privatization of farm input supply and marketing systems and the
streamlining of extension to improve efficiency. These measures would
improve resource use efficiency. However, in the short to medium term
covered by the project, account must be taken of the fact that: (i)
privatization of farm input supply and marketing systems must be undertaken
gradually and carefully if no undesirable disruption is to occur; (ii)
COCOBOD's streamlining and budget reduction is a continuing process and
takes time; and (iii) Government is substantially dependent on revenue from
cocoa. It is, therefore, prudent during this period to continue fixing
31   "Price Prospects for Major Primary Commodities,' World Bank,
Commodities and Projections Division, Revised July 1987.



- so -
producer prices at incentive levels taking into account changes in the
exchange rate, the need to compete with other crops and with neighboring
countries; providing adequate incentives for replanting and rehabilitating
cocoa farms, and as .,ch as possible, and to create confidence among
farmers concerning the long term prospect of cocoa by establishing a clear
policy.
4.67      Government's intention is to increase cocoa producer prices
gradually from nearly 30X of long run world price to about 55Z of same by
1988/89.  However, this should be considered as a preliminary stage and a
more systematic method should be developed. Therefore, GOG and IDA have
agreed, under the SAC, to develop a pricing methodology to guide the
determination of the annual cocoa price to farmers. The new pricing
framework would have the following three broad objectives: (i) improve
farmers' real returns from cocoa to provide sufficient incentives for
rehabilitation and replanting so as to maximize Ghana's strong comparative
advantage in cocoa; (ii) increase foreign exchange earnings from cocoa; and
(iii) increase Government revenue. Agreement on the cocoa producer price
arrangement would be a condition for credit effectiveness (para 5.02 (d)).
N.        Financial Impact and Proiect Sustainability
4.68      The Project would generate substantial revenues for GOG and
COCOBOD.  On the basis of the proposed cocoa revenue sharing formula
(0.55 farmer, 0.30 GOG, and 0.15 COCOBOD), incremental export revenue and
local cost contribution of GOG/COCOBOD would be as follows:
GOG US$ Mn (¢ Bn)
PYl          PY2           py3            Py4             PYS
Revenue                               -          0.6(.09)       2.4(.39)        6.4(l.02)
Contribution        2.0(.32)      2.4(.38)       3.3(.53)       5.4(.86)        3.0 (.48)
Net Revenue      -2.0(.32)    -2.4(.38)       -2.7(.43)     -3.0(.48)         3.4 (.54)
COCOBOD US$ Mn (¢ Bn)
Revenue                               -          0.3 (.05)      1.2(.19)        3.2 (.51)
Contribution        5.3 (.85)    5.2 (.83)       4.2 (.67)      3.0(.48)        3.2 (.51)
Net Revenue      -5.3 (.85)   -5.2 (.83)    -3.9 (.62)    -1.8(.29)
Although the project would require contributions from GOG and COCOBOD,
expected revenues would cover the costs starting from PY5 for both GOG and
COCOBOD.  The project's annual recurrent costs from PY6 onwards amount to
US$2.7 million (¢ .43 billion) for GOG and US$3.0 million (0 .48 billion)



- 51 -
for COCOBOD. Revenues thereafter would rise and would in any case be far
larger than the level of total recurrent costs. The project as it is
proposed is sustainable.
4.69      The financial feasibility of different investment scenarios was
assessed on the basis of per hectare crop budgets using unsubsidized
prices. The database for building farm models is weak but the information
on yields and input levels is adequately reliable. The data on returns per
manday and per hectare (Annex 4-16, Table 2) suggests that strong
incentives exist for replanting. The use of nurse crops (plantain and
cocoyam) in the first 3 years enhances the financial internal rate of
return. The gross margins for select years (8 and 10) for the different
technologies show returns that are in excess of the wage rate. The lowest
return in year 8, is three times the wage rate. The incremental incentives
for caretakers are similarly attractive. For replanting, the returns per
manday would range from 0 598 to 0 870 (or slightly above twice to three
and a half times the estimated wage rate). Most caretaker6 use family
labor for about 25X of their needs. On the basis of that estimate the
returns per manday of family labor would range from 0 1,643 (Technology IV)
to 0 2,732 (Technology V). The incremental returns per manday for
rehabilitating mature stock would be 0 725 for Technology III and 0 1,023
for Technology IV, both of which offer adequate incentives for
rehabilitation (Table 3). The returns per hectare from the hybrids are
higher than for competing crops (oil palm; maize/plantain/cocoyam; and
maize/cassava) when the hybrids are managed at technology levels IV and V
(which are the major target levels under the project).  The effect on
farmer incentives of the removal of subsidies is expected to be small: the
estimated subsidy on the 1986/87 cLop is 0 4,536 ($28.35) per ton, while
the cocoa price increase announced in May 1987 was 0 54,000 per ton
($337.50). The subsidy is only about 8Z of the price increase. The
analysis shows that using unsubsidized prices, the financial incentives for
rehabilitation (Annex 4-16) are likely to be botter and adequate under the
price policy to be pursued.
0.        Environmental Impact
4.70      The rehabilitation and expansion of cocoa is unlikely to
adversely affect the environment. It would promote better use of the land
in the medium to high rainfall belt of Ghana and offer greater prospects
for protection of soil against erosion. It would improve the hydrologic
behavior of the catchments which have beer. badly affected by clear felling
of trees and growing of food crops without adequate anti-erosion measures.
The proper management of cocoa with its associated shade trees and nurse
crops requires conditions comparable to that provided by the natural
vegetative cover and would improve the current unsatisfactory catchment
conditions where the vegetative cover has been indiscriminately removed and
much of the soil exposed periodically to direct impact of rainfall under
shifting cultivation. With regard to the use of chemicals the only risk to
the environment from the project could be that associated with possible
widespread use of insecticides for control of capsid bugs (cocoa mirids).
The two insecticides currently in use are Gammalin (gamma isomer of benzene



- 52 -
hexachloride, gamma BHC or Lindane) and Unden (Propoxur). The former is a
chlorimated hydrocarbon and is the best known compound for control of
capsids while the latter is a carbomate which is more expensive. Neither
are among the list of compounds excluded for use in Bank projects.
4.71      (apsid resistance to gamma-BHC and related compounds has been
noted in Ghana and other countries. The strategy used to overcome this is
to alternate between Gamma-BHC and Propoxur every 2 or 3 years in adjacent
regions. At the same time research continues to focus on new approaches to
the problem including biological control, cultural control and integrated
pest control as well as possible new and better insecticides. GRIG has
been assessing the effects of insecticides both in terms of build up of
resistance as well as effects on other insects particularly predators or
paradites of potential major pests to give necessary advance signals and
take corrective action.
4.72      CRIG has also been monitoring residue accumulation in cocoa beans
to satisfy market specifications. In association with the COCOBOD Health
Department, workers involved with applications of pesticides are given
periodic physical checks. CRIG has started to establish laboratory
facilities to initiate a program of monitoring pesticide residues in soils
and water supplies. Assistance will be provided by the project in
completing the laboratory facilities, establishing the analytic procedures
and training staff to run it. The Health Department of COCOBOD will extend
to farmers the monitoring of effects on health and will cooperate with CRIG
where necessary for analytic services. COCOBOD has strongly supported and
given assurances that monitoring of pesticide use and effects on the
environment and human health will be adequately undertaken to guard against
potential ill effects. Confirmation to this effect was obtained at
negotiations (para 5.01 (s)). The project is unlikely to cause serious
envirnonmental hazards but could bring major benefits to improvements in
catchment conditions if the replanting procedures follow recommended
practices for land preparation and crop management. The adoption of good
cocoa replanting practices and sound management of cocoa growing lands will
depend largely on the incentives received by farmers, particularly a
satisfactory price for the cocoa. The extension service will be
substantially strengthened to be in a position to provide the technical
information farmers will require to apply the recommended practices, most
of which are simple and easy to adopt.
P.        Benefits and Risks
4.73      The project would (a) increase cocoa production and consequently
foreign exchange earnings and government revenue (para 4.69); (b) improve
farmers' incomes (Annex 4-16); (c) complement the macro-economic reforms
being implemented, by instituting technical measures to help realize the
production potential of the industry; (d) complement the reform measures
initiated under SAC aimed at improving COCOBOD efficiency and thus lowering
the marketing costs; (e) establish a better link between research and
extension (paras 4.29-4..2) and assist farmers to adopt improved cocoa
husbandry practices (paras 4.13-4.17); and (f) open up inaccessible areas



- 53 -
thus benefiting cocoa and other food crops through easier evacuation (Annex
3-1).
4.74      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated to
be 25 percent with a net present value (at 102 discount rate) of ¢ 33.7
billion (US$210 million). The economic benefits would be derived from
increased production due to improved husbandry practices (frequent weeding,
underbrushing, spraying and harvesting) in combination with replanting and
rehabilitation of some of the existing stock. The ERR is quite robusts a
lag in the benefit stream by one year reduces it to 21Z and by three years
to 152; a 502 increase in costs accompanied by a 202 decline in benefits
would lower it to 11Z. Benefits would have to fall by about 492 or costs
increase by 97? to reduce the ERR to zero. The ERR is also robust if one
assumes implementation delays: if the Ghanaian historical disbursement
profile for agricultural projects were to apply, the ERR would be 202,
Annex 4-17. Financial results are discussed in paras 4.70 and 4.71.
4.75      The main risks facing the project include:  (i) failure by GOG
and COCOBOD to maintain real prices at levels that provide reasonable
inc3ntives to farmers; (ii) lower world cocoa prices than what is forecast;
(iii) delay in the process of streamlining COCOBOD, removal of input
subsidies and the privatization of the input supply system; and (iv)
unfavorable natural factors such as unusual drought and major disease
outbreaks.
4.76      The first risk, failure to maintain and improve the level of real
prices is being addressed by requiring that a pricing study, already agreed
upon under SAC, be completed and a pricing formula be agreed upon as a
condition of loan effectiveness. GOG has already agreed to the annual in-
crease of producer prices to reach an indicative level of 55 percent of the
F.O.B. price by 1988/89. The second risk, drop in international prices to
which the project is not overly sensitive; the rate of return falls to
19.92 and prices are 202 lower than forecast in the entire 25-year period.
The third risk, failure to remove input subsidies and carry through the
privatization of input supply is being addressed already by GOG: in May
1987 a series of price increases were announced that reduced subsidies by
as much as half. Over the next two years the remaining subsidies will be
eliminated (paras 4.38 and 5.01 (o), and Annex 4-6, Table 1). Under the
project, GOG's willingness to undertake the privatization reforms would be
formalized through an agreement at negotiations on an action plan for the
privatization of farm inputs distribution (paras 4.39 and 5.01 (p)). The
delay in the process of streamlining COCOBOD would be minimized through
close monitoring, but would not significantly affect production benefits.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations for the proposed credit, the following
principal issues were discussed and agreement reached with GOG, DFR, and



- 54 -
COCOBOD, and specified as conditions in the Development Credit and Project
Agreements:
Financial Conditions
(a)  COCOBOD would include and provide in its annual current and
capital budgets adequate funds to finance project activities
(excluding roads), and in the event that adequate cofinancing to
fill the financing gap is not available GOG/COCOBOD would
undertake to finance the shortfall (para 4.50);
(b  GOG, for the road component, would open at a commercial bank a
DFR (cocoa) account to be used to pay for goods and services
required for the implementation of the cocoa road component, and
would pay into it quarterly and in advance, its annual share as
stated in the DFR (cocoa) approved annual budget (para 4.61);
(c)  The Special Accounts for DFR (cocoa) and COCOBOD would be
operated under terms and conditions agreed with IDA and IDA
would, at its discretion, hold back replenishment in case of
inadequate financing by GOG/COCOBOD of relevant project
components (para 4.61);
Project Administration Conditions
(d) Progress on the privatization of farm inputs and internal
marketing and the level of CSSVD incentive payments would be
reviewed annually with IDA. Also a mid-term review on all
project components, to assess progress and ensure adjustment to
prevailing conditions and policy, would take place by November
1990 (paras 4.13, 4.20 and 4.53);
(e)  Not later than January 1, 1990, the number of Districts operated
by CSD would be reduced to 39 (para 4.16);
(f)  Extension staff would be relieved of their duties to be involved
in the distribution of farm inputs (para 4.18);
(g)  Two pilot operations to experiment with different extension
approaches would commence by January 1989: (i) in CY 1989 MOA
would be responsible for cocoa extension in 50Z of CSD districts
in Volta Region. At the end of the year the performance would be
reviewed and based on that review, steps would be taken to enable
MOA to handle extension in the entire Region; (ii) CSD would
follow the same process and timetable for non-cocoa crops in
Brong-Ahafo Region (para 4.20);
(h)  Seed or seedlings would be sold at a price nLot less than the
prevailing market price for equivalent dry ireight of beans (para
4.24);



- 55 -
(i)  A Research Policy Committee (RPC) with TORs agreed with IDA would
be appointed by June 1988, comprising of the Executive Director
(Chairperson) and Deputy Directors (2) of CRIG, CSD Executive
Director, 2 CSD Regional Officers, a farmer and CRIG Research
Secretary serving as Secretary (para 4.33);
(j)  CRIG would undertake periodic external assessments of its
research program; the first assessment would be undertaken by
March 31, 1988, and the second by June 30, 1991 and thereafter at
least every 5 years (para 4.34);
(k)  Government and COCOBOD would reduce cocoa farm input subsidies in
three annual steps and eliminate them in a phasing to be agreed
with IDA by December 31, 1989 (para 4.35);
(1) Farm input distribution system would be gradually privatized
according to a schedule agreed with IDA. This program would be
reviewed annually by COCOBOD. The results of the first review
would be provided to IDA by March 1989 (para 4.36);
(m)  PBC, in rationalizing its operation, would by January 1, 1990:
(i) close down all buying centers with annual purchases of less
than 25 tons; and (ii) convert all buying centers with annual
purchases between 25 and 50 tons into sub-societies which would
be visited once a week by a mobile buying unit (para 4.40);
(n)  COCOBOD and DPR (for the cocoa road program) would submit along
with their annual budget, an annual work plan approved by the
respective authorities for (a) roads; (b) research, seed

Annex 4-1
GHANA
Cocoa Rehabilitation Project
Cocoa Production Technology in Ghana
A. Introduction
1.        This annex reviews farmers' agronomic practices and considers
proposals for upgrading field operations in rehabilitation, replanting and
new plantings. It examines the reasons for the low productivity of cocoa
farming in Ghana and stresses the need to improve current levels of tech-
nology, especially with regard to field husbandry. Past increases in cocoa
production in Ghana were due almost exclusively to expansion of the culti-
vated area. However, the need to raise farm income by increasing produc-
tivity per unit area is now regarded as essential to strengthen the economy
of the cocoa sector.
B. Productivity Constraints
2.        Productivity of cocoa farms in Ghana is generally estimated at
between 160 and 250 kg/ha/yr. This is less than 1/3 of the average produc-
tivity of farmers in Brazil (700 kg/ha/yr) and around 1/6 of the average
productivity commonly obtained in well-managed farms all over the world
(1,000 - 1,200 kg/ha/yr).
3.        Productivity is affected by agronomic as well as by socioeconomic
factors. The socioeconomic constraints in Ghana include a) low prices paid
to farmers; b) land tenure system in which caretaker farmers, who consti-
tute over 75% of cocoa producers, receive only one-third to half of the
produce; c) aging of the cocoa farming community caused by out-migration of
young people who do not see a future in cocoa farming; d) poor extension
services in which regular contact aimed at teaching farmers is almost
non-existent and extension agents lack training in both subject matter and
communication skills; and e) poor accessibility of newly planted areas for
both distribution of inputs and buying and evacuation of cocoa.
4.        The agronomic factors most frequently mentioned in Ghana as
responsible for the low productivity are diseases and pests, especially
swollen shoot and capsid damages. Very little attention is given to other
agronomic factors, such as poor farm husbandry, which impose serious con-
straints to higher yield. Problems such as excessive shade, poor methods
of establishing new plantings, inadequate weed control, among others, are
also contributing as much as diseases and pests,to reduced yield and, need
to receive more attention. In order to emphasize the importance of upgrad-
ing agronomic practices in Ghana, a brief review will be made of the
underlying principles associated with high yield in cocoa.



- 63 -
C. Crop Physiological Factors
5.        Research on the physiology of yield variability stresses three
factors as the main determinants of productivity in any crop: (a) the size
or area of the leaf canopy, usually expressed by the ratio of leaf surface
to ground surface, or the "leaf area index" (LAI); (b) the rate of
photosynthesis per unit leaf area, also known as "net assimilation rate"
(NAR); and (c) the allocation of assimilates between the fruits and other
parts of the plant, or the "harvest index."
6.        To obtain high productivity form a crop, the first rule is to use
cultural practices which will increase light interception by the crop
canopy, that is, which will promote a fast growing LAI. There are many
methods of promoting canopy development for greater light interception.
These methods either promote rapid leaf growth or prevent premature leaf
fall (or increase leaf duration). As a rule, most agronomic treatments
which increase LAI will also increase crop yield. This is what happens,
for instance, in the case of fertilizer application, irrigation, control of
leaf diseases or leaf damaging insects, etc. Genetically superior
cultivars normally exhibit higher leaf canopy development than unselected
ones. The development of LAI is also much affected by planting distance,
this being the main reason why close planting greatly favors early economic
returns in cocoa growing. It must be emphasized that this beneficial
effect of close planting occurs only during the first 4-8 years after
planting. In a mature and well managed cocoa plantation with completely
closed canopy, close spacing has practically no effect on LAI or on produc-
tivity per unit area.
7.        Spacing deserves special atte cion in Ghana, where farmers plant
at very high density, often using as mady as 6,000-8,000 cocoa seedlings
per ha. Unfortunately this practice is used even by farmers planting
scarce hybrid seeds and supposedly supervised by CSD extension agents.
Such wasteful practice is obviously placing a major constraint upon achiev-
ing the desired target for replanting 20,000 ha/yr of improved varieties.
High density planting has also an undesirable effect on tree architecture.
It stimulates vertical growth and inhibits the development of lateral
("fan") branches. As a result the plants become too tall for harvesting
and spraying, besides being less productive, as will be explained later.
Greater effort should be made to adopt the planting distance recommended by
CRIG (2.5 x 2.5 m or 1,600 plants/ha).
8.        With regard to the second yield determinant, the photosynthetic
rate or NAR, the possibility of selecting cocoa cultivars genetically
superior in terms of photosynthetic efficiency has not yet been fully
explored by plant breed'-is. However, since cocoa is usually grown under the
shade of larger plants, the relationship between yield and shade has been
the subject of much research in most producing countries, and this is
obviously related to photosynthesis. It is now generally accepted that the
benefit of shade in the cultivation of cocoa is not to provide a low light
intensity considered optimal for growth and yield. Its main function is to



- 64 -
counteract unfavorable ecological factors, such as low soil fertility, wind
damage, excessive transpiration leading to moisture deficiency and in-
creased insect attack, especially capsids and thrips. If all such unfavor-
able factors can be controlled by methods other than by use of shade, the
highest production of cocoa is obtained without shade. From a practical
point of view, however, moderate shading is generally considered as the
safest and most economical method of counteracting unfavorable conditions
in most regions, especially in areas where soil and rainfall distribution
are not entirely satisfactory. Excessive shade is a common problem however
in Ghana and should be avoided. Besides decreasing yield because of lower
photosynthetic production, it contributes greatly to increasing the inci-
dence of black-pod disease.
9.        With regard to the third factor, the "harvest index", it is
recognized that additional research is needed to develop practical methods
of modifying the division of photosynthates between fruits and vegetative
growth in the cocoa tree. It has been experimentally demonstrated that hand
pollination substantially increases the harvest index, especially in
self-incompatible cultivars. This method undoubtedly finds practical
application in seed gardens as a way to increase productivity. Some
authors have also demonstrated that pollination and yield can be increased
by blowing the flowers with forced air from a spray machine (Soria, 1980),
but this technique has not found practical application among farmers. Care
must be taken to avoid "excessive" pollination as this is known to cause
heavy defoliation which greatly reduces yield the following year. Death of
trees may also occur when excessive pollination is used for two or three
consecutive years.
10.       There are good indications that the harvest index will increase
when pruning is used for the purpose of reducing plant height and promoting
lateral growth of "fan" branches. This is accomplished by periodic elimi-
nation of orthotropic ("'chupon") branches so as to prevent the formation of
more than two or three branching sites or "jorquettes" on trees. This
practice is traditionally used by cocoa farmers in other countries, where
trees are spaced at 3x3 m and plant height is seldom allowed to reach more
than 4-5 m, or about half the height of cocoa trees in Ghana. The high
density planting system commonly used in Ghana has the disadvantage of
inducing premature shedding of fan branches, stimulating excessive growth
in height and diameter, of the main trunk. Besides creating obvious
difficulties for some cultural practices such as spraying, mistletoe
removal, harvesting, etc., this type of husbandry renders the trees less
efficient in intercepting solar radiation (reduced leaf area index at
maturity) and also reduces the number of productive flower cushions per
unit area.
D. Production Technologies
11.       The production technologies currently being practiced by farmers
in Ghana have been classified into five groups, which may be described as
follows:



- 65 -
12.       TechnololLevel I.  This is the most common method and comprises
the following: after felling and burning the forest (or other natural
vegetation) at the onset of the dry season (November/December) the land is
used to grow food crops (usually cocoyam, plantain, and cassava) at
irregular spacings and plant density. Cocoa is planted at stake, also at
irregular spacing, using unselected seeds from the farm. Frequently as
many as 6,000 - 8,000 seeds are planted per ha, sometimes more (spacing of
1.0 - 1.Sm, often using 2-3 seeds per hole). Cocoa seeds are often planted
before food crops are sufficiently developed to provide the necessary
shade. The farm is brushed only infrequently and no pruning is done.
Little or no spraying is used against capsid bugs or blackpod disease.
Misletoe is not removed relglarly and rodents are not controlled. Shade is
not controlled until it has grown extremely excessive. Yield at full
production is estimated at no more than 250 kg/ha, but could average
between 160 and 210 kg/ha.
13.       Technology Level II.  This category adopts the same practices as
described for Technology level I, except that hybrid seeds are used instead
of unselected seeds. Some farmers who have had their farms planted by
project labor under the Eastern and Ashanti Region Projects may have used
better planting methods (regular spacing and 1,600 plants/ha). Under these
poor maintenance practices the annual yields should average between 300 and
320 kg/ha although in exceptional cases they may reach 360 kg/ha.
14.       Technology Level III.  In this category, farmers are growing
unselected cocoa (Amelonado types) under moderately advanced husbandry
practices, such as regular brushing, shade control, spraying against capsid
bugs (2 to 4 times/year), rodent control, pruning of dead branches and
unwanted chupons, removal of mistletoe, and spraying against blackpod in
cases of severe outbreak. Annual average yields are estimated at between
400 and 450 kg/ha.
15.      fTechnology Level IV. In this category similar practices as above
are practiced, except that hybrid seedlings from polybag nurseries are
planted in rows at 2.5 m x 2.5 m spacing (1,600 plants/ha). Annual average
yields, at full production are estimated at between 550 and 600 kg/ha.
16.       Technology Level V.  This is based on the results of CRIG trials
and on examples from other cocoa producing countries. It includes at least
two additional treatments besides the ones used in Technology Level IV:
better control of shade by the use of planted shade trees (Glyricidia and
others) and correction of soil mineral deficiencies by the use of fertiliz-
ers. It is estimated that an annual average yields of between 700 and 900
kg/ha or even higher may be obtained with this technology. The economics
of fertilizer use is expected to be favorable but this is to be reviewed
and verified by CSD and CRIG. However, even with good returns, the rate of
fertilizer use is expected to be gradual because of the advanced nature of
the practice for small farmers in Ghana.



- 66 -
17.       In terms of returns to labor, hybrid cocoa managed at intermedi-
ate level of technology (Technology Level IV) appears to offer most
benefits to the farmer. However, replanting with hybrids is not ar. option
for increasing production in the short to medium term. Rapid increases
will have to come from management improvements on existing trees rather
than from new plantings. Rehabilitation of traditional varieties as well
as hybrids through the application of moderate technology, offers the
quickest method of boosting yields at reasonable cost. This involves
regular manipulation of shade (normally shade thinning), spraying against
capsids, mistletoe removal, pruning (to improve canopy architecture), more
frequent harvesting and regular brushing. The main thrust of the Board's
current program is therefore to promote this technology through inputs and
services.
18.       High input technology, similar to that applied elsewhere in-
volves, in addition to the practices applied in Technology Level IV,
starting seedlings in polybag nurseries, applying chemical fertilizers,
planting shade, and sometimes prophylactic spraying against blackpod
disease. Experience elsewhere has shown that these technologies - espe-
cially the use of fertilizers combined with shade thinning - are very
effective in increasing yield, often doubling it within a relatively short
period. Because of costs and lack of experience in the use of fertilizer
in Ghana, these practices are unlikely to find wide acceptance by farmers
before results are clearly demonstrated in different parts of the country.
As an initial step, it is proposed that such demonstrations be undertaken
early by the CRIG/CSD "on farm" research unit to be established at Tafo.
19.       In the long term, production increases must come from new plant-
ings of hybrids. While from a technical point of view it would be desir-
able to maintain these plantings at least at a moderate level, particularly
keeping capsid damage to a minimum, in practice, farmers would do this only
if they perceive it to be in their own interest. Calculations of the
return per man-day suggest that farmers would find it more attractive to
exparnd their holdings rather than adopt moderate or high level technolo-
gies. Furthermore, caretaker farmers would be extremely reluctant to adopt
such practices which require high additional inputs of labor. Only in
areas where land is limiting for absolute or artificial reasons or in
situations where farmers would wish to capitalize on substantial price
improvements are they likely to choose intensification as a means of
increasing incomes.
20.       Increases in production could arise in the short to medium term
through farmers presently practicing Technology Levels I and II shifting to
Technology Levels III and IV, respectively, that is, through intensifica-
tion involving the use of greater material and labor inputs. Longer term
production increases could come from increase in area under cocoa and/or
adoption of higher yielding technologies by farmers. Thus, farmers using
Technology I could increase production by shifting, with replantings or new
plantings, to Technology II, if they do not wish to invest much more cash
or labor, or to Technologies III, IV or V if they wish to intensify produc-
tion and maximize their returns per hectare. Para 4.21 to 4.26 of the main

report describes the production strategy and arrangements for seed
production and distribution to meet the replanting needs.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
Extension Services Objective and Strategy
Objectives
1.        The basic objective for strengthening agricultural extension in
Ghana is to facilitate increased agricultural productivity and rural
incomes by the establishment of an efficient and cost-effective service
responsible for all the agricultural extension needs of farmers.
2.        The attainment of this objective entails the development of an
extension service that is able to advise: (i) farmers how to increase the
production and/or profit of all their farm-based production activities,
including crops, livestock, agro-forestry and farm fisheries; and (ii)
agricultural research and other agricultural support services of farmers'
needs and priorities. Obviously such needs vary over time and place, which
accounts for the intrinsic organizational flexibility and support required.
3.        While the organization of the service should be flexible to
accommodate production and cultural conditions, there are principles of
effective extension operation on which there is little room for compromise
without jeopardizing its basic role and effectiveness. These include:
(a) Advice on all farmers' productive activities should be the
responsibility of a single extension service; locally important
activities should be handled by local extension staff who receive
appropriate training and technical specialist support.
(b) Extension's sole commodity is knowledge and its work takes place
primarily in the field and with farmers: extension's
organization, work programs and evaluation should reflect this,
as should complementary activities, such as mass media programs.
(c) As important as extension's advice to farmers is its advice on
farmers' concerns and priorities tc other agricultural support
services--research, input supply, credit, marketing, rural roads
and water supply, and so on. 1/
1/  An effective extension service can help develop the efficiency of
other agricultural services by keeping them informed of farmers' needs
and by putting pressure on them to be responsive to these needs.
However, these services themselves often require fundamental reform in
parallel with extension's strengthening, particularly given the
increased demand on these services that usually results from strong
extension work.



- 70 -
4.        An extension service organized to fulfill these principles should
be able to serve effectively the vast majority of Ghana's farmers who
mainly practice smallscale mixed farming. The work of this service woula,
however, be complemented by other agencies. For example, extension support
for plantation crops and other highly commercial operations might be
provided by a private or perhaps cooperative body responsible for the
extension of a particular crop, as well as for its input supplies and
marketing. Input suppliers and other commercial organizations could
undertake some advisory work. Any constructive non-government participation
in extension is to be encouraged, and there should be close coordination
between such agencies and the basic extension service.
5.        A reasonably efficient unified extension system should be
established in five to ten years. (As explained below, much of the first
five years would be taken up with determining an appropriate extension
system, and the subsequent years with its progressive implementation.)
Once the basic system is established, however, it will need to be
continuously upgraded to meet the changing needs of Ghana's farmers.
Current Extension Situation
6.        The present coverage and quality of extension operations in Ghana
is highly variable. This is to be expected given that they are carried out
by about fifteen organizations (Appendix 1). These organizations operate
in different areas for different crops, within a variety of institutions
and supported by a number of financial sources; there is little
coordination in policy, objectives or operations between the organizations.
Our knowledge of the activities of the agencies involved in extension is
incomplete. With some notable exceptions, however, in general it may be
said that they are over-staffed, under-financed and poorly-organized; that
they work with little technical purpose or focus; that there is little
contact between extension staff and either farmers or research; and that
the three principles of effective extension noted above (para 3) are not
implemented. Despite the number of organizations involved, there has been
little attempt to establish effective extension services outside particular
Regions, although the need to do so is acknowledged in the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) and Cocoa Services Division (CSD), the two largest
extension organizations.
7.        Support for extension from external organizations has centred on
selected Regionai. The Bank has worked through the Upper and Volta Region
Agricultural Development Projects. It has not analyzed comprehensively
extension objectives or operations in Ghana, nor attempted to establish a
strategy for its support to extension nationwide, although it has now
accepted the need for such national-level analysis and acticni.  The other
main development organizations involved with agricultural extension
activities in Ghana (see Annex 1) have been so in much the same way as the
Bank; they have had little impact on national extension policy or
coordination, nor on the broader upgrading of extension's role and effec-
tiveness. The Bank and others have recently given attention to the



- 71 -
function and organization of the Ministry of Agriculture and thus in a
general sense to extension (through, for example, the Agricultural Services
Rehabiliation Project); this interest has yet to be reflected in
significant changes in the institution.
Extension Strengthening Strategy
8.        Experimentation.  The first step to the objective of establishing
a comprehensive agricultural extension service is not to unify but rather
to experiment. This is necessary in order to determine Government and
extension and related staff's opinions on the matter, and to determine an
extension system appropriate to Ghana's agro-economic and cultural
conditions and its staff capabilities and interests. Moreover, there is
sufficient urgency in strengthening extension operations for both cocoa and
other crops that such work should commence without the delay entailed in
the establishment of a unified extension service.
9.        Experimentation will take place over the coming three to five
years on three fronts: cocoa extension services supported by the Cocoa
Rehabilitation Project (CRP); the Ministry of Agriculture under the
Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP); and, also supported by
ASRP, in Volta Region as a continuation of work under the Volta Region
Agricultural Development Project (VORADEP, Credit 1009-GH). None of these
experimental activities are contrary to the principles of effective
extension noted above, and they are valid and productive in their own
right. Details of extension strengthening work on these three fronts
follow.
10.       The extension service of CSD (which is also responsible for
coffee, a minor crop) is a significant operation given the importance of
cocoa to the Ghanaian economy. Until recently, CSD "extension" was
primarily a direct service operation for farmers and had little technical
orientation or content. Some reform of the extension service has begun
with the restructuring of COCOBOD. Under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project
the cocoa extension service will be reorganized with the objective of
providing farmers, for the first time, with efficient technical support for
cocoa production.
11.       The main changes that are being undertaken prior to or as part of
the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project are:
(a) an end to direct services for farmers (and hence the redundancy
of about 10,000 laborers);
(b)  an immed4ate reduction in the number of the lowest level exten-
sion agents by about 45% (to 900);
(c) an end to extension staff being directly involved in the sale and
distribution of inputs;



- 72 -
(d) the design and implementation of feasible and monitorable work
programs for all extension staff;
(e) the establishment of regular contacts with research and of
regular in-service training and work-review sessions for all
extension staff; and
(f) the building-up of technical expertise (in cocoa agronomy,
disease control, seed production, input support and exten-
sion/communication) at regional and headquarters levels of the
CSD extension service.
12.       The need for these changes has been identified during project
preparation, and their implementation is the basic objective of the
project's extension component. Due to uncertainty over some features of
the cocoa subsector (e.g., the number and location of active cocoa farmers,
farmer response to improved price incentives, and the number of extension
staff required by level and location), there will be an in-depth mid-term
review of the extension component in Project Year II and provision for its
modification in light of review findings.
13.       As part of this effort to establish an efficient extension
service for cocoa farmers in conditions of considerable uncertainty, two
experiments will take place under the project. First, field level cocoa
extension activities in one Region (Volta, the least important for cocoa
production of the six Regions where cocoa is grown) will be handled
exclusively by the VORADEP extension service, with technical support
provided by CSD. That is, cocoa farmers will be served by one extension
worker who will advise them on all their farm operations; the extension
workers will be trained in cccoa production by CSD technical specialists.
Second, as the converse to the Volta Region experiment, CSD extension staff
in one Region will assume in a phased manner the responsibility for
extension support for all agricultural activities. They will receive the
appropriate training and specialist support for this role from MOA. The
Region for this experiment has yet to be selected; Western Region could be
appropriete given the expansion of cocoa production there and its current
thin coN rage by MOA staff.  In addition to these two experiments, CSD
extension staff in the five Regions where they will operate will be trained
and advise farmers on agro-forestry in order to encourage wider planting of
appropriate trees on land owned by individuals.
14.       Parallel to the strengthening work with the cocoa extension
service as described above, the Ministry of Agriculture extension service
will be supported in two ways under the ASRP--in an extension strengthening
pilot program in a number of regions, as well as in Volta Region where
support of VORADEP's extension activities would continue following that
Credit's closing in December 1987.
15.       Except where they have been seconded to a project structure as in
VORADEP, MOA staff are now barely active in extension. One important
reason for this (and that given great weight by MOA staff) is a lack of



- 73 -
funds. Whatever the reason, while MOA is the obvious institutional "home"
of a national extension service, it is not clear whether, even in the
absence of significant resource constraints, MOA staff at all levels would
be sufficiently interested and able to provide effective extension support.
Consequently, a major objective of the ASRP extension strengthening pilot
program is to determine how MOA as an institution can best be organized to
support extensiot. and also the interest and ability of MOA in extension --
and so ultimately its appropriateness as the home of a unified service.
16.       The ASRP extension strengthening pilot program aims at establish-
ing a unified extension service for non-cocoa, non-plantation crops in up
to three Regions. Beginning with one Region in Year I and depending on
implementation experience, pilot program activities would commence in a
different Region in each of the project's first three years in an iterative
process in which program activities of any one year will closely reflect
earlier experience (both inside and outside the pilot program). The
objective of the pilot is to provide a precise definition of issues and
organizational alternatives entailed in extension strengthening. The
on-hands experience of the program should lead to practical ways to
overcome specific problems in organization, research linkages and
technology identification. The program would build on the experience of
all other extension activities in Ghana, and would include a preliminary
review of the training programs and resources available an agticultural
training institutions. It would also provide for logistical support to MOA
staff working with the Ghana Grains Development Project in selected Regions
to enable them to operate more effectively prior to the national
reorganization of extension services.
17.       Ashanti Region has been selected by MOA as the Region in which
the ASRP pilot program would start. This is appropriate in light of the
extremely weak links of MOA and particularly of its extension staff with
agricultural research in Ashanti (as much as anywhere) and the location of
the Crop Research Institute in the Region. Further, an improved
maize/cowpea technology is available, and the importance of cocoa
production in the Region will force consideration of how best to serve the
non-cocoa extension needs of cocoa farmers.
18.       Progress is being made under VORADEP in establishing a broadly
focussed field extension service. VORADEP extension staff are responsible
for animal husbandry as well as crops, and there is reasonable coordination
of the agricultural extension and rural home economics services. Extensi,n
staff are examining ways to include agro-forestry and farm fisheries in
their brief. Given the basically sound organizational structure of the
VORADEP extension service, the decision to have it responsible for cocoa
extension in the region (see para 13) should be a useful test of how cocoa
and non-cocoa extension operations can be integrated. ASRP support of
VORADEP extension activities, and associated research and training, will
enable their further refinement and improvement while an appropriate
national program of extension support is being developed.



- 74 -
19.       Evaluation.  The proposed extension strengthening activities
under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project and the Agricultural Services
Rehabilitation Project will require two or three years' implementation to
begin to provide useful indications of broader relevance. This time will
not be ill-spent. At least six of Ghana's ten Regions will be covered by
one or more activity under the two projects. Important basic issues that
will be tackled include: determination of Ghanaian farmers' and Government
staff's expectations of extension; practical ways of integrating non-cocoa
extension services, including some that are not the direct responsibility
of MOA; ways of developing effective two-way linkages with agrlcultural
support services (i.e., particularly, but not only, research); and,
appropriate forms of extension field operation, field/media interplay and
technology identification and development.
20.       The CRP and ASRP extension strengthening activities will be
closely monitored. The purpose of this monitoring is to improve their
ability to meet their particular objectives and to establish their
relevance to the proposed unification of extension services. The CRP
extension component will undergo a comprehensive review before the end of
Project Year II (1989), and will be adjusted as needed in view of the
review's findings. ASRP includes provision for a study, also in Project
Year II (1989), of the organization of agricultural extension and training
in Ghana. That study would cover the extension pilot operation supported
by ASRP (and also ASRP support of the Ghana Grains Development Project
technology and VORADEP), and would also review all major extension
operations and their related training. For all intents and purposes, the
study would serve as a preparation analysis for more comprehensive support
of extension strengthening in Ghana.
21.       From regional to national intervention.  Establishment of an
effective agricultural extension system throughout Ghana will require
resolution of a number of issues that the Cocoa and Agricultural Services
Rehabilitation Projects are unable, and not designed, to resolve. They
include national-level mechanics of unification and comprehensive
research-extension linkages, and extension staff training, motivation and
manpower development which need to be addressed by national policy and
programs. The objectives and components of a national project that could
be a suitable vehicle should be designed in the light of experience with
the extension operations described above. It is possible to say now,
however, that it is likely to be an "extension project" though with
parallel support (either in the projec-, or otherwise) for agricultural
research and training; while being "national", it need not cover
simultaneously all of Ghana with a field extension service; and it should
deal adequately with the extension needs of women farmers (on which a start
is being made by VORADEP).
22.       The timing of this national intervention is not yet clear.  A
national extension project is currently in the lending program as FY9OL.
Given the experimentation planned under ASRP and CRP and the mid-term
reviews that will take place in 1989, the project could conceivably be a
year or so later than now planned; this would not unduly delay significant



- 75 -
extension restructuring and would provide time to evaluate further the
experience of CRP and ASRP extension operations, as well as of related
activities (such as the proposed reorganization of MOA and preparation of a
Bank-supported agricultural research project). On the other hand, the
wide-ranging nature of extension-related issues that cut across all Regions
and the proposed ASRP/CRP interventions emphasizes the need for a national
approach. In that a national extension project will itself attempt to
resolve issues not handled by the currently-proposed programs, an early
start with a fundamentally sound national program would be advantageous.
For the time being, however, the matter of timing of this national project
should be left open until the operations proposed above are underway.

GPANA
Cocoa Rehabilitation Project
Disease Control
1.        Swollen Shoot Disease is the most serious technical problem
affecting cocoa in Ghana. It is caused by a virus, of which more than one
strain has been identified. The vectors are several indigenous species of
the mealy bug which infests cocoa as well as forest trees and other woody
plants. Several of these vectors, including the main one in Ghana
(Plancoccoides njalensis) are tended by ants which feed on the honeydew the
mealy bugs produce. They construct protective tents from soil which can
give shelter from contact insecticides. The adult males are winged but
cannot transmit the CSSU. The virus is spread only by the wingless females
which walk from tree to tree through connecting brances and leaves of
adjacent trees or when blown by wind. Several strains of the virus are
identified according to their vectors, host range and symptoms on cocoa.
The most virulent are those which occur througlout the mass infection areas
in the Eastern Region and elsewhere. The .lamage to the trees by the
disease eventually leads to death and can represent substantial loss to the
farmer particularly in the areas of mass ir,fcction where it is difficult to
check. However, the spreading rate of the virus is not rapid and this
allows time to apply sanitation measures for controlling the incidence.
2.        Measures for curing the disease have not yet been developed, and
because of the nature of the organism a solution of this type may be a long
way off. In the meantime, a number of measures can be applied to reduce
the disease incidence and its effects on the industry. These include (a)
using varieties which have some degree of resistance or tolerance to the
virus; (b) controlling the mealy bug vector by biological means or
insecticides; (c) protecting susceptible cultivars by innoculation with
mild strains of virus; and (d) eradicating sources of infection. The most
effective of these is the eradication of sources of infection. This
requires comprehensive inspectton programs and cutting out of visibly
infected trees in outbreak area- together with trees within a susceptible
range, depending on the size and duration of the particular outbreak. This
measure appears drastic and farmers do not cooperate readily in applying it
especially when they do not appreciate the seriot-sness of the problem and
they are not appropriately compensated for loss of income from the
destroyed trees. In the last twenty years efforts at eradicating infection
sources have not been sustained and the build up of the disease incidence
haf been large particularly in the areas of mass infection in the Eastern
Region where a more virulent strain of the virus is present. The proposals
are to revive the inspection program and to step up eradication to deal
with the backlog, estimated at over 20,000 ha, during the first three to
four years of the project and then settle down to maintain adequate
inspection and rate of eradication which is expected to level at about 150
ha per year.
3.        Although the technical methods or details have not yet been
worked out, the protection of susceptible high yielding hybrids by



- 79 -
innoculation with the mild strains offers strong possibilities for future
management of the disease. Similar applications on vJ.rus diseases of other
commercial tree crops are successfully undertaken as general practice.
Should the method be verified as effective for CSSVD the practical details
of implementing it on a large scale will have to be worked out. The
program of work at CRIG for CSSVD control has this approach high on its
list of priorities for attention. The search for greater resistance to the
virus is also being accelerated by CRIG in its breeding program for
improved varieties.
4.        Apart from project activities described in the wain text (para
4.27 and 4.28), CRIG's research program will pay special attention to
developing for the longer term alternative control measures which will
include:
(a) breeding and testing of resistant or tolerant varieties;
(b) testing the techniques of innoculation of young plants with
a mild strain of the virus to build up some degree of
immunity;
(c) control of the vector; and
(d) simple techniques for earlier identification of infections
and to reduce the cost of the eradication process.
5.        Black Pod Disease.  This disease occurs in Ghana and is more
prevalent under wet humid conditions. It can cause serious losses cf beans
from infected pods but in general it is not a major limiting factor to
efficient production under conditions of high management standards. The
incidence of the disease can normally be kept within acceptable norms
through normal cultural practices which incorporate good sanitation
procedures. These includes regular underbrushing, sensible prunning of
cocoa as well as shade trees and eradication of infected pods. Control
measures with copper fungicides are also effective but the treatments may
not be cost effective unless the field managment technologies are high and
factors of production are at their optimum. In addition to cultural
practices to deal with this disease, CRIG recommends the use of those
varieties which have demonstrated greater tolerance to the fungus
particularly in areas with very high humidity. The economics and
technology of chemical control would be an important component of the CRIG
work program particularly in the farming systems studies to be initiated.

GHANA
Cocoa Rehabilitation Project
Research
1.        Cocoa Research in Ghana was started about 50 years ago at the
Central Cocoa Research Station established at Tafo in the Eastern Region.
At one time (1944-1962) the research program covered the problems of
Nigeria and Sierra Leone as well. The institution was then designated the
West African Cocoa Research Institute (WACRI). Since 1962 when it became a
national institution, and renamed the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana
(CRIG) it has concentrated on the problems of cocoa in Ghana only, although
it is interested in maintaining links with other institutions involved in
cocoa research in neighboring West African countries and elsewhere.
2.        Responsibility for CRIG has been shifted periodically between
central government Agencies and it is now under the Cocoa Board which
provides funding, appoints staff and approves work programs and budget.
Over the years CRIG and its predecessor organizations have experienced
various evolutionary changes, some of which have been brought on by econom-
ic and political circuwF6tnces. in the last ten or so years the severe
economic difficulties in the country and the downturn in revenue from cocoa
have had their adverse effects even though CRIG has managed much better
than other research institutions in Ghana, most of which are under the
Council for Science and Technology which answers to the Ministry of Indus-
try and Science. It has been able to retain most of its experienced
research staff and while funding was limited, particularly foreign curren-
cy, it was able generally to pay salaries on time and maintain a research
program without undue interiuption. The responsibilities of CRIG have been
expanded to include research in some other tree crops and presently they
include coffee, Colanut and Sheanut, all of which are purchased and
exported by the cocoa board. They are also concerned with developing
alternative oil tree crops such as the tallow tree (Pentadesma butyraega).
3.        The main aspects of its work which have suffered rely on foreign
currency. In particular the equipment and physical facilities have
deteriorated and many components or items have either become inoperative or
are obsolete and inefficient. This had tended to reduce on the output of
staff and new important programs of work have been postponed. The project
will assist CRIG to remedy its current deficiencies by providing funding
for acquiring or rehabilitating essential equipment and to secure technical
assistance particularly for staff training. The objective is to provide
assistance to strengthen the capacity of CRIG to deliver the necessary
scientific and technical support in restoring the cocoa industry to its
former position in the international cocoa trade, to reach an annual
production level of about 300,000 t by the turn of the century and to
ensure standards of technical efficiency capable of sustaining the
increased production and high quality of product.   Para 4.29 to 4.37 of
the main text describes the deficienci's of CkIG and sets out the
assistance which will be supported by the project.

4.        The staff of CRIG have an ongoing review process for the research
work in progress and for the planned programs. Arrangements are being made
for independent reviews by internationally recogaized scientists who will
advise CRMC on the appropriateness of the program, the adequacy of the
experimental designs and techniques and quality of their implementation.
The findings of these reviews would be taken into account by the management
of CRIG in determining its priorities and allocation of funding and staff
resources.
5.        Cocobod recognizes the importance of research as a support
service to the industry and has generally provided adequate local funding
for staff salaries and other operational costs. It has however not been
able to satisfy the needs of foreign currency to acquire essential equip-
ment, materials and services which are available only abroad. It also has
not always met adequately the needs for basic service buildings and other
facilities but this is now being redressed.
6         CRIG has succeeded better than other research institutes in Ghana
in maintaining a strong core group of well qualified and experienced plant
and soil scientists despite the many factors restricting their output. It
has an ongoing program of staff recruitment to meet its work targets. The
newer recruits are generally at the first degree level and they are put
through an in service training program during a probationary perlod of two
to three years after which it will be determined whether they have the
capacity for pursuing a career in research and to meet the requirements of
CRIG. Their subject specialization is then strengthened by appropriate post
graduate training. Much of this training has been undertaken of late in
Ghana but it is limited by the ability of the local institutions to provide
the training at the required level in all the specializations. The present
program for post graduate specialist training to be undertaken abroad
includes the subject of Agronomy, Agricultural Economics and Farming
Systems Research, Computer Science Entomology, Plant Pathology, Soil
Science, Plant Physiology, and Biochemistry. Attention will focus in the
next few years on the new unit for farming systems research in which staff
of CRIG and of r&D will be associated and have the interaction of the
research scientists', the extension workers' and farmers' concerns. CRIG
management will continue to monitor the staff skills level and distribution
in relation to the needs of its work programs and made due allowances for
training in the gaps which are identified.
7.        Farming Systems Research.  CRIG has been testing under different
ecological conditions in the cocoa and coffee growing zones the results of
experimental work at the Tafo and Bunso stations. This work, however, is
not generally done in the context of farmers' practices or of economic
considerations. CRIG is not organized to undertake comprehensive "on farm"
testing of its research findings before deciding on the appropriateness of
particular technical packages for promoting to farmers. A major step to
improve the linkages between the research and extension workers and farmers
will be the establishment of a Farming Systems Research unit to test out
individual research findings under different ecological and cultural
conditions or farm environment and also to test complete promotional



- 82 -
packages incorporating new technologies to ensure they are sufficiently
practical and acceptable economically. The unit will be staffed by
officers from both CRIG and the Extension Services of CSD. The
Agricultural Economists to be appointed by CRIG will have key roles in this
unit. They will first have to be trained in techniques of farming systems
research and provision is being made for technical asrdistance to start the
unit, to develop the investigational techniques and procedures and to draw
up a program of work.

ANNEX 4-9
GHANA
COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) Structure
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The purpose of this Annex is to summarize briefly the main
features of the new structure of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD). By a
letter dated March 16, 1983, the PNDC Government instructed the Ghana
Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMFA) to mount a
seminar on "the restructuring of the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board/Cocoa
Sector." This seminar, which was attended by representatives of all
interested agencies, took place in May 1983 and led to the publication of a
"Consensus &aport," in which detailed recommendations were made for
organizational reforms and staff reductions. This document formed the
basis for the restructuring exercise which has been in progress over the
past two years.
II. THE GHANA COCOA BOARD
2.        The structure of COCOBOD was set 3ut in a Government memorandum
prepared after the publication of the 'Consensus Report." The Board was
defined as a commercial profit-making body which would operate as a holding
company to which would be attached the following divisions and
subsidiariess
-    Cocoa Services Division (CSD), respouisible for pre-harvest
activities, particularly for agricultural extension, disease and
pest control, input supply and seed production;
-    Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG), responsible for all
aspects of research into cocoa production and processing, as well
as for research on coffee, cola and sheanuts;
-    Produce Inspection Division (PID), responsible tor produce
quality control at all stages of purchasing and evacuation;
-    Infestation Control Department (ICD), responsible for
disinfection of cocoa storages to ensure that all consignments
are exported free from deleterious organisms;
-    Plantations, Ltd., which owns and operatee the Board's cocoa and
coffee plantations;



- 91 -
Produce Buying Company, Ltd. (PBC), responsible for purchase and
evacuation of the cocoa, coffee and sheanuts;
Cocoa Marketing Company, Ltd. (CMC), which handles the
international sale of the cocoa crop on behalf of the Board;
-    Abuakwa Formulation Plant, Ltd., which formulates insecticides
for use in the capsid control program, using imported
ingredients;
-    Cocoa Processing Company, Ltd. (CPC), which consists of three
processing factories - West African Mills, Takoradi; Cocoa
Processing Factory, Tema; and Cocoa Processing Factory, Takoradi.
Each of the divisions and subsidiaries has its own Management Committee or
Board of Directors.
The Head Office
3.        COCOBOD is currently run by a Chief Executive who reports to the
Office of the PNDC Coordinat'ng Secretary (equivalent to the Office of the
Prime Minister). The restructuring, however, calls for the establishment
of a Board of Directors consisting of:
-    3 persons to be nominated by the Government, one of whom shall be
the Chairman;
-    4 farmers' representatives;
-    3 COCOBOD workers;
-    Governor of the Bank of Ghana or Deputy Governor (Foreign) as
alternate;
-    Secretary of Finance and Economic Planning (or alternate);
-    Secretary of Agriculture 'or alternate);
-    Secretary of Trade (or alternate);
-    Chief Executive, COCOBOD.
4.       Reporting to the Chief Executive are 3 Deputy Chief Executives:
-    DCE (Agronomy, ?roduction and Quality Control), responsible for:
-    Plantations, Ltd.;
-    Cocoa Services Division;
-    Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana;
-    Produce Inspection Division;
-    Infestation Control Department.



- 92 -
-    DOE (2peratAons), responsible for:
-    Produce Buying Company, Ltd.;
-    Cocoa Processing Company, Ltd.;
-    Abuakva Formulation Plant, Ltd.;
-    DCR (Finance and Administration), responsible for all Head 0fice
support functions.
Also reporting directly to the Chief Executive are:
-    The Cocoa Marketing Co.;
-    Audit Department;
-    Public Relations Department;
Legal Department;
-    Policy Planning, Monitoring and Research Department.
For a sumary of the organizational arrangements, see Chart 1.
Staffing
5.        An Implementation and Monitoring Committee (1KCO) was appointed
to oversee the restructuring of the Board, and particularly to assess staff
requirements and make arrangements for retrenchment. by setting up
sub-committees at -vrious levels, establishing clear selection guidelines,
treating each staff member on a case-by-case basis and offering quite
attractive redundancy payments, IMO has successfully and smoothly
completed the first phase of the retrenchment program, which covered 5
divisions/subsidiaries. A total of almost 17,000 staff, moat of whom were
at junior level, have been declared redundant, leaving about 60,000 actual
employees as follows:
COC0B0D HQ           2,195
CSD                 19,900
PID                  1,890
FBC                 17,860
CRIG                 1,800
ICD                    250
cm10                   160
CPC                  1,600
Plantations         16,500
Total          62,155
13,200 employees are due to be retrenched in the let half of 1987; 10,000
plantation staff and 3,200 from CSD.
6.        The main problems affecting the Board's costs and its capacity to
serve the industry include:



- 93 -
Range of Responsibilities.  COCOBOD remains responsible for a
number of activities which might eventually be managed with
greater efficiency and at less cost to growers by private sector
interests. Such activities include input distribution,
equipment, repair, haulage, cocoa and coffee plantation
operation, and cocoa processing. If these operations were to be
divested, there would be a need for further structural changes
and staff reductions at Head Office.
Over-manning.  While it is clearly not possible to estimate
manpower requirements accurately until COCOBOD's future role is
defined, there continue to be many visible symptoms of
over-manning, both at Head Office and in the field. Unless the
ratio of junior to senior staff (currently around 39:1) is
narrowed, supervision is bound to be light and effective
work-time and productivity low.
Staff Skills.  Although COCOBOD is insisting that all new
recruits for professional and technical posts are appropriately
qualified, opportunities for recruitment are bound to be limited
during a period of shrinkage. Many of the key middle-level posts
are occupied by staff who do not have the requisite skills but
who have been promoted on the basis of years of service rather
than performance.
Management Style.  In spite of the largely commercial nature of
Tts business, COCOBOD continues to operate in civil service
style, with little concern for costs or transaction speed. There
is little effective delegation of authority with the result that
much senior staff time is taken up in dealing with minor
personnel problems rather than the brcader mspects of management.
-    Information.  The lack of reliable information on the state of
the Board's operations, its stocks and its finances also
contributes o an environment in which corrupt practices can
easily go undetected.
7.        A broad framework for the medium to long term development
strategy of COCOBOD has been agreed upon under the SAC. In brief, COCOBOD
would aim to become a service organization to the cocoa industry, involved
primarily in marketing, extension, pest and disease detection and control,
seed production, research, price regulation, and produce inspection. The
Head Office would be concerned principally with:
-    developing policies and planning for the cocoa subsector,
including setting of produce prices;
-    monitoring performance of its divisions and subsidiaries (as well
as of any private operators) and reporting to the Government on
the state of the subsector;
-    promoting inter-divisional coordination, and coordination with
other Government Departments and agencies;



- 94 -
overseeing the implementation of incentive and subsidy programs;
assisting or representing the Government in international
negotiations on cocoa production and trade;
providing central support services to its divisions and
subsidiaries, particularly for:
-    Budget, Accounts, Audit
-    Personnel, including payroll maintenance and training
-    Procuremsnt and Importation
-    Legal Affairs
-    Computer Services
-    Design and Supervision of Major Civil Works Contracts
-    Public Relations.

GHANA
GHANA COCOA III PROJECT
COCOBOD Procurement procedures
1.        In general, three methods of obtaining quotations for external
procurement are used by COCOBOD, namely:
-    international competitive bidding (ICB),
-    international shopping, and
-    direct contracting.
International Competitive Bidding
2.        All requirements with an allocated value of US Dollars 100,000 or
more are procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB), whenever the
time available prior to the goods being required is sufficient to allow for
the administration involved in this method of procurement. If insufficient
time is thought to be available, it requires the collective decision of the
External Purchases Committee (EPC) to waive the bottom limit for ICB: this
decision is recorded in the minutes of the committee meeting and is subject
to approval by the Chief Executive.
Notification and Advertising
3.        Under ICB, in order to provide timely notification of bidding
opportunities to potential suppliers, the invitation to bid should be
advertised in the local press at least three times in the thirty days
preceding the availability of the bid documents, and, depending on the
value of the contracts to be awarded, advertising in a newspaper(s) with
wide international circulation.
International Shopping
4.        This method is based on comparing price quotations obtained from
at least three different suppliers, who are invited directly by COCOBOD to
submit bids. Bid documents would normally contain the following minimum
information:
-    detailed specifications of the goods required,
-    a full description of the factors to be taken into account
in evaluating the bids received, and how these factors are
to be applied
-    a short introductory invitation to quote prices and delivery
for the goods required.



- 98 -
In general, international shopping is used only where the allocated value
for the goods required is less than US Dollars lOOtOOO0
Direct Contracting
5.        Direct contracting to a specific supplier without competition is
used under the following circumstances:
-    when the required item is proprietary and can only be
obtained from one source, and
-    when COCOBOD have adopted a policy for the standardisation
of equipment or spare parts, to be compatible with existing
equipment, which justifies additional purchases from the
original supplier.
Decisions to contract one supplier directly are made collectively by the
EPC and recorded in the minutes of the committee meeting and are subject to
the approval of the Chief Executive.
Bid Documents
6.        The bid documents are required to contain all the information
necessary for a prospective bidder to prepare a bid for the goods to be
provided. While the detail of the bid documents may vary according to the
nature of the goods to be procured, the documents would contain reference
to the following:
-    invitation to bid,
-    deadline for submission of bids,
-    validity of bids and bid security,
-    governing language for bids,
-    conditions of contract,
-    procedures for conversion of bids expressed in different
currencies into a single currency for the purpose of
comparing bids,
-    documents establishing bidders' qualifications to bid,
-    documents establishing goods' eligibility and conformity to
specifications,
-    limits on disbursements, for example, to go-Is provided from
eligible sources,
-    procedures for evaluation and comparison of bids,
-    terms and methods of payment,
-    performance security,
-    documents to be supplied to COCOBOD on shipment of goods,
-    technical specifications.
Bid Opening
7.        The time and the place of the bid opening is specified in the bid
documents. Bids must always be opened in the presence of the External



- 99 -
Purchases Committee, and, depending on the value of the contracts, in
public. The total amount of each bid and the manufacturer's name should is
read aloud and the details recorded. The original copy of each bid is
signed by the chairman of the External Purchases Committee and one other
member.
Bid Evaluation
8.        The purpose of bid evaluation is to determine the cost of each
bid to COCOBOD in a manner which will permit a comparison of bids on the
basis of their evaluated cost. The bid with the lowest evaluated cost, but
not necessarily the lowest price is selected. The bid documents specify
the relevant factors, in addition to price, to be considered in bid
evaluation, and the manner in which they will be applied for the purpose of
determining the bid with the lowest evaluated cost. Factors which are be
taken into account include all or some of the following:
-    CIF price of goods,
-    price of spare parts,
-    delivery schedule offered,
-    availability of local service,
-    quality, adaptability and reliability of the goods offered,
-    compatibility with existing equipment, and
-    past performance of suppliers in supplying goods to COCOBOD.
The factors used in the bid evaluation should be given relative weightings
in order that all bids can be compared on the same basis.
Approval of Bid Evaluation
9.        Whatever method of procurement is used, the Procurement Manager
present the results of his bid evaluations to the EPC. These evaluations
must be governed by the bid evaluation factors and weightings stated in the
relevant bid documents. He must also list separately those bids which have
been rejected, together with the reasons for the rejections. On the basis
of these evaluations, and by examining as many of the quotations which have
been submitted as are deemed necessary, the EPC must decide which suppliers
should be awarded contract. The results of their decisions is forwarded
for approval (if required) to the external funding agencies involved (if
any), together with the bid analysis and any other information which may be
required to support the choice of supplier. The Chief Executive is also be
advised of the suppliers to be awarded contracts by way of a copy of the
minutes of the committee meetings. The details of the order values and the
suppliers are entered on to POPS by the procurement progress clerk.   A
record of the bids received for each requirement, the names of each
supplier and the bid analysis must be kept by the Procurement Department
for future reference.

Comments on the Cocobod Procurement Procedures
10.       The COCOBOD procurement procedures are generally acceptable but
the following aspects of the bidding procedure requires modification:
(a) the length of time for advertising prior to issue of bid
documents should be treated flexibly and be increased from
thirty to 45 days if thought to be advisable; and
(b) the threshold value beyond which the advertisement would
have to be placed in the international press should be
specified.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
Special Proiect Accounts
1.        Separate Special Accounts would be established by GOG through DFR
and by COCOBOD at a commercial bank. The accounts would include: (i)
Sipecial Account #1 to be opened by GOG through DFR in which GOG would
deposit its contribution to be used to pay for goods and services required
for the implementation of the cocoa roads program. COG would deposit in
the said account ¢160 million (US$1.0 million) which represents the
estimated local operating and capital costs of the cocoa roads component
for the first six months of the project. Thereafter GOG would pay its
contribution quarterly in advance into Special Account t1; (ii) GOG through
DFR would also establish a Sgecial Account #2 into IDA would make an
initial contribution of US$0.5 million to be used to pre-finance the
foreign exchange cost of goods and services reimbursable under the IDA
credit; (iii) COCOBOD would also establish a Special Account #3 into which
IDA would make an initial contribution of US$0.2 million for the financing
of non-cocoa road components of the project.
2.        The Special Accounts Nos. 2 and 3 would be maintained in U.S.
Dollars and operated by DFR or COCOBOD under terms and conditions
acceptable to ID. Replenishment would be conditional on GOG quarterly
releases to DIR, or evidence of adequate financing by COCOBOD of its
project components. The Accounts would be replenished on the basis of
monthly withdrawal applications submitted by DFR or COCOBOD. These
applications would be prepared promptly after receipt of monthly bank
statements from the commercial bank holding the Accounts. Applications
would be supported by: (a) an annotated copy of the bank statement,
cross-referenced to the items appearing on the replenishment application;
(b) summary sheets together with full supporting documentation for items
which do not qualify for disbursement on the basis of SOEs, or certified
SOs for expenditures authorized on this basis; (c) a reconciliation
statement which confirms that an appropriate balance remains in the Special
Account; and (d) a statement disclosing the quarterly contributions made by
GOG to the DIR project account. Should any disbursement from these
Accounts be found ineligible for financing, GOG or COCOBOD as the case may
be would be required to deposit into the Account a sum equivalent to the
Ineligible amount, prior to the submission of any subsequent claims for
replenishment.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
Auditing and Reporting Requirements
1.        COCOBOD and the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR) would each keep
financial records in accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect
their financial status. They would ensure that their respective accounts
as well as the special accounts and the Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
were audited annually by a firm of independent external auditors acceptable
to IDA. The audited accounts and the auditors report including a statement
certifying whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended
purpose, would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of their
fiscal years.
2.        COCOBOD and DFR would each prepare a separate annual plan and
work program that would clearly show proposed project related activities.
A procurement program would also be prepared to reflect proposed purchases
for the following year, detailing the items, unit costs, quantities,
timing, sources of funding and procurement methods (whether ICB, LIB and
other). This program would be submitted to the IDA for information. For
procurement this procedure would be additional to any specific requirements
for procurement under IDA credits (see Annex 4-13). On the basis of the
annual plans, work program and procurement program, COCOBOD would earmark
funds in its budget, and the Government would make its contributions, for
Its share of road financing, quarterly in advance.
3.        COCOBOD and DFR would each submit quarterly reports to IDA
containing at least the following information achieved (in quantitative
terms); objectives for the subsequent period(s) and major issues/problems
encountered or likely to arise in a subsequent period. The quarterly
reports would contain a summary of current expenditure and a cumulative
record. After project completion, COCOBOD and DFR would each prepare a
Project Completion Report analyzing project implementation and achievements
in relation to its objectives and would submit them to IDA within six
months of project closing date.

Farm Budgets
Financial Results
1.        The financial feasibility of different investment scenarios was
assessed on the basis of per hectare crop budgets. Such analysis should
have been based preferably on whole or even partial farm budgets. However
little accurate data exists on which to build farm models. The existing
information is adequate for assessing the different options facing the
farmers. The key decisions facing the cocoa farmers are (i) whether to
rehabilitate an existing cocoa farm or not; and (ii) if to rehabilitate,
whether (a) to replant or rehabilitate existing cocoa trees; or (b) replace
the cocoa with food crops or oilpalm. The relative returns to land and
labor are among the main factors that may guide the farmers investment
decisions, depending on the relazive scarcity of the two factors. Both
situations seem to exist in different cocoa growing areas.
2.        Using non-subsidized prices shown in Table 1, the returns per
manday and per hectare are summArized in Table 2 for owner operators.
In general, replanting is more attractive than rehabilitation of mature
trees. In the first five years returns from replanting are enhanced by
interplanting with plantain (for shade in the first three years of growth)
and cocoyam. The returns per manday exceed the wage rate for all the
technology assumptions. By the eighth year, the lowest return per manday,
for all labor, is about three times the wage rate. The returns per hectare
from hybrid cocoa managed at intermediate or higher management levels, are
generally higher than for competing crops: oil palm; maize/cassava;
maize/plantain/cocoyam.
3.        The rehabilitation c' the cocoa farms will depend to a large
extent on the adoption of recommended husbandry practices by caretakers.
Table 3 presents the returns for caretakers. The returns per manday for
replanted/planted cocoa (Tech 1 to V) are in all cases higher than the wage
rate by a range of at least twice, to as much as thrice. If one assumes
that caretakers supply 25 percent of total labor requirements, the range is
2.5 to 10.9 times more than the rural wage. The incentive for
rehabilitating mature trees is less strong; the returns per manday is about
1.5 the wage rate for the traditional variety Tech VI, and 1.8 the wage
rate for the hybrid, Tech VII. Asswming that caretakers use family labor
to the tune of say 25 percent of total incremental labor requirements, the
respective returns for the traditional and hybrid varieties would be 2.9
and 4.1 times the prevailing wage.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The project's ERR is about 23 percent (25 percent if the costs of
research, extension and training are excluded). The discounted net present
value is 033,708 million at the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Ghana of 102. The detailed assumptions are shown in para 3 below. The ERR
is quite robust to declines in benefits and increases in costs: a 20
percent drop in benefits and a simultaneous increase in costs of 20 percent
would lower the ERR to about 16 percent. If benefits were to lag three
year (costs remaining constant) the ERR would fall to about 21 percent.
Tables 1 and 2 show the detailed results.
ERR Assumptions:
(a) With and Without
2.        For purposes of economic analysis it was assumed that project
actions should help the farmer who is rehabilitating to achieve higher
returns (than without project) through the adoption of project recommended
actions. Plantings under technology I and II would essentially be the
current levels of technology, and are not included in the incremental
project output. The project would assist farmers to move to higher yield-
ing technologies as follows: adopting either of technologies III, IV or V
by replanting cocoa; and or rehabilitating existing cocoa with technology
III or IV. For a description of the various technologies see Annex 4-3.
Incremental output from technology III, IV, V, VI and VII was adjusted
downwards to attribute part of the increase to a price response. The
adjustment factor was derived from an assumed short run price elasticity of
supply of .5 and a price increase in real terms of 76 percent over the last
three years.
(b) Other Computational Assumptions
(i) the life cycle of a tree is assumed to be 50 years;
(ii) the project life is cut off at 25 years as being adequate to
provide a reliable indicator of yield potential of the tree.
(iii) a standard conversion factor of 0.79 is assumed, given the
official exchange rate of US$1 - ¢160 expected to be in
effect at negotiations;
(iv) the conversion factor of 0.79 was used; for labor;



- 113 -
(v) duties are netted out and subsidies are adjusted to reflect
economic prices. Cutting out grants are included because
they cover real resource costs of cutting out and of produc-
tion foregone;
(vi) a farm-gate export parity price for cocoa is used; and
import parity prices are used for all importables. Annex
4-17;
(vii) incremental production and incremental farm cost streams are
obtained by aggregating crop budgets adjusted to economic
prices;
(viii' costs of internal marketing are excluded from the ERR
calculations because they are included in the derivation of
farm-gate prices.
(ix) the economic Rate of Return was estimated including and
excluding the costs of (a) Research; (b) Extension and
Training;
(x) all the costs of the road component were included because
the roads will be used principally for cocoa related activi-
ties (evacuation, input distribution, etc.);
