MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR A
COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for the equivalent of US$40.0
million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to heIr finance a
nationwide project to rehabilitate the cocoa sector in Ghana.
2.        Backaround:  Cocoa is the most important subsector in Ghana's
economy, providing 632 of export earnings, 92 of GDP and 11% of Government
revenues (1985). It employs some 24? of the labor force and accounts for
over a third of the land under cultivation. In the 1960s, Ghana was the
world's leading producer of cocoa, with a record output of 566,000 tons in
1964/65 (one third of world supply). Since then, production has declined
from an average of over 400,000 tons in the 1960s and 1970s to about
300,000 tons in 1976/77 and only 158,000 tons in 1983184. This decline of
cocoa production was the outcome of several factors: (i) poor producer
prices and the overvalustion of the cedi which led to the neglect of farms,
reduced replanting and shift to other crops, and smuggling, (ii) weak
disease control and farmer services; and (iii) inefficient farm input
supply and marketing systems run by the Government Marketing Board. Two
previous projects financed by IDA and IBRD, the Eastern Region Cocoa
Project (Cr. 205-GH) and the Ashanti Region Cocoa Project (Ln. 1181-GH),
failed to arrest the decline in cocoa production, mainly due to the
unsatisfactory rectoral and macro-economic policy environment in which they
were implemented. Because of their focus on area development in selected
production areas, the projects were unsuited to address sectoral policy
issues; a comprehensive national approach to rehabilitate the cocoa sector
and a more favorable macro-economic environment was needed. The lessons
learnt from these earlier projects have been incorporated in the design of
this project, which would rehabilitate the cocoa sector nation-wide and
address sectoral policy issues as well.
3.        Proiect Objectives:  The project aims at increasing cocoa
production to stabilize output at an annual level of about 300,000 tons.
This would be achieved by implementing the policy reforms in the cocoa
sector included in the Government's Economic Recovery Program and supported
by IDA under the Structural Adjustment Credit, and by parallel investments
in the rehabilitation of the cocoa sector. These policy reform actions
would include the establishment of an incentive pricing policy,
restructuring the role of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) in production,
processing, input supply and marketing in line with its strategy for long
term development of the sector. The project would further enhance the
ongoing dialogue between the Bank and the Government with a view to
achieving an eventual privatization/divestiture of all commercial
activities of the COCOBOD.



-2-
4.        Pwoiect Description:  The project would be a national project and
would be implemented over five years. The four main components are: (a)
improvements in technical services for cocoa Droducers including the
reorganlzation of the Cocoa Service Division (CSD), the strengthening of
extension, seed production, and disease control servJhes and gradual
privatization of farm input supply functions; (b) strengthening of research
including (i) streamlining the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) to
promote its activities in plant breeding and disease control; (ii) the
establishment of an off-station unit to conduct on-farm research; and (iii)
staff development; (c) maintenance of the internal marketing systen,
through the provision of essential support to critically needed storage and
transport investments, to evacuate cocoa from remote villages in areas with
poor infrastructure until an agreed program for progressive privatization
is developeci and implemented; and (d) essential road upgrading proaram to
facilitate the evacuation of cocoa and the participation of private
haulers. The last component, to be implemented by private contractors,
would cover (i) improvement of about 3,000 km of feeder road and bridges;
and cii) construction of 60 km of new feeder roads and 75 km of tracks.
5.        The total project cost is estimated at US$128.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$76.8 million (611). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given in
Schedulee C and D, respectively. A map of Ghana showing the cocoa growing
areas is &lso attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6818-GH, dated
October 19, 1987, is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  As a sequel to the Export
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1435-GH) and the Structural Adjustment Credit
(Cr. 1777-GH), the project would not only help implement agreements on key
policy reforms needed in the sector but also address the sector's major
investment and institutional constraints by strengthening cocoa research,
reorienting and improving extension services, increasing seed production,
facilitating cocoa evacuation, increasing institutional efficiency,
creating a better ground for commercialization and progressive
privatization of COCOBOD functions. Commercial financing v'ould be
inappropriate due to its high cost. In addition, other bilateral donors
have yet to develop a comprehensive sector involvement. In any case,
because of the high resources requirements of rehabilitating the entire
sector, they would not have sufficient funds. As a result, without IDA
involvement in the rehabilitation of the cocoa sector, restructuring of
Ghana's economy would take much longer.
7.        Actions Agreeds  There is basic agreement between the Government
and IDA on major reforms needed in the cocoa sector, and they are
incorporated into recent IDA credits and most recently under the SAC.
These includes (i) a gradual increase in producer prices (pending the
completion of an incentives study now under way) from nearly 301 of
long-run world price to an indicative target of 55a of the same by 1988/89;
(ii) streamlining of the organization and management of COCOBOD; (iii) a
three-year rolling corporate plan to secure a steady progress toward
confining COCOBOD's activities to areas which cannot be done more



-3-
efficiently by other institutions or the private sector; and (iv) a
termination (by 1988/89), in a phased manner, of the farm input subsidy.
During negotiations the Government has further agreed on the following:
(a) the mechanism for establishing producer prices beyond 1989, at levels
necessary to secure farmers' interest in growing cocoa and to provide
adequate incentives for disease control measures would be concluded by
August 31, 1988; (b) 1988 cocoa producer price would be set at not less
than 49Z of the cocoa FOB price; (c) annual review of the implementation of
the plan for privatization of farm input distribution; (d) initial reform
of internal marketing such as use of private storage and review of the role
of COCOBOD in this area; (e) restructuring of CRIG manageLuent and external
review of its annual research programs and priorities; (f) implementation
of a plan for revitalizing the extension services and strengthening of the
linkage between extension staff and farmers; and (g) ensuring that the
lending terms and conditions on GOG lending to COCOBOD for
commercially-viable activities are on a commercial basis. Agreement on
cocoa producer price arrangements and the staffing of COCOBOD's key
positions would be a condition for credit effectiveness.
8.        Justification:  While diversification of Ghana's economy is
important, given the country's overwhelming reliance on cocoa for foreign
exchange earnings, the rehabilitation of the cocoa industry remains a
priority in Ghana's plans for economic recovery. Without rehabilitation of
the cocoa sector, and the consequent improvement in foreign exchange
earnings, the recovery of Ghana's economy would be slow and more difficult.
Ghana has a strong comparative advantage in tree crop production,
particularly cocoa. In view of the very low producer prices compared with
the international prices of cocoa, there is ample scope for an increase in
cocoa production in Ghana, even if the world prices were to decline. The
ERR for the project is co_servatively estimated at 23Z, including the costs
of techn.ical assistance, research and extension services, and the ERR is
not overly sensitive to fluctuations in world prices of cocoa.
9.        Risks:  The main project risks relate to the possibility of the
Government's failure to maintain reasonahle real producer price incentives,
unfavorable natural factors such as unusual drought and major disease
catbreaks, which cannot be ruled out. There is also the risk of a delay in
implementation of the institutional development aspects of the project,
e.g. the streamlining of the COCOBOD, and privatization of inputs supply
and marketing services. These risks are, however, minimized with the
understandings reached under the project, and through planned intensive
supervision efforts and close monitoring by IDA.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
