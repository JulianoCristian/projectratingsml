national one, is to be implemented over five years,\n            providing a sustainable framework for the development of the\n            cocoa sector.  To that end, the project comprises four\n            components including (1) technical services for cocoa\n            production; (2) research; (3) internal marketing; and (4) an\n            essential road upgrading program.  It will (i) increase the\n            efficiency of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD); (ii) ensure\n            an incentive producer price; (iii) improve income\n            distribution and raise rural living standards.  It will\n            further (iv) reduce rural unemployment and increase economic\n            activity in the countryside; and (v) increase cocoa exports\n            with consequent higher availability of foreign exchange and\n            Government revenue."}, "docdt": "1987-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
