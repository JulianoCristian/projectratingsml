sustainability were uncertain, Borrower performance was\n            deficient, and assessment of outcomes was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the substantial devaluation\n            of the Cedi during the project period, the gradual recovery\n            of cocoa prices on the world market and the increase in the\n            farmers' share of the fob price triggered a significant\n            production response in the last two years of the project.\n            This demonstrates that extraneous factors can be crucial for\n            the success or failure of a project. In this particular\n            case, it also highlights the need for greater care in the\n            use and interpretation of commodity price projections. The\n            lack of clear financing arrangements at the time the credit\n            became effective seriously affected project start-up.\n            Especially for projects which involve a multiplicity of\n            donors, the financing plan has to be firmed up prior to\n            effectiveness and a mechanism put in place to coordinate the\n            activities of the various donors. For the multiplicity of\n            policy and institutional changes envisaged, the project had\n            insufficient leverage and support at the political and\n            executive levels. For an agency with an annual turnover on\n            the order of US$300-400 million, efficient and speedy\n            implementation of a project which was viewed by many of the\n            agency's staff as threatening their jobs and which\n            entailed a comparatively small amount of financial\n            assistance was not high on the list of priorities."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
