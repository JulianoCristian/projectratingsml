PERU
AGRICIUTURAL CRMDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project for which
a Bank loan of USS25 million equivalent is proposed. The loan would sup-
port a three-year lending program of the Banco de Fomento Agropecuario del
Peru (BFA) for medium- and long-term ínvestments in agriculture, encompassing
livestock and agro-industry to be made by small farmera, including cooperatives,
and medíum size farmers.  BFA, which ia government-owned, would be the
borrower with Government bearing the exchange risk.
ii.       The Bank has made four previous loans to BFA:  105-PE in 1954,
162-PE in 1957 and 257-PE in 1960 (each for US$5 million); and 415-PE in
1965 for US$15 míllion. All four have been fulty disbursed and the first
three have been fully repaid. The Bank has made four other loans fór agri-
cultural development in Peru: US$1.3 million in PY 1953 (67-PE) and US$1.7
million in FY 1954 (98-PE) for agricultural machinery; and two loans for
irrigation: US$18 million in FY 1955 (114-PE) and US$6.5 millien net of
cancellation in FY 1965 (418-PE). All but the last have been fully dis-
bursed.
iii.      Peru's agricultural sector produced 14% of the country's GOP in
1970, a relative decline from ita ahare of 20% in 1960. During the same
period, the proportion of the labor force employed in agriculture declined
from 53% to 48%. During the last two decades, agricultural production grew
by less than 2% annually as compared to 5% of the country' a ecenomy growth
and 3% of population grawth. The relative stagnation in agricultural pro-
duction has reduced Peru's favorable agricultural balance of payments. Ex-
cluding fishmeal, agricultural exports exceeded imports by US$100 millíon in
1963 but by 1971 this surplus had been reduced te US$16 míllion. Sugar,
cotton and coffee dominate agricultural exports, while wheat, meat and dairy
products are the main agricultural preducts imperted.
iv.       The main problems encountered are:  (i) the demographic Dressure on
land actually cultivated which, at about 0.38 ha per rural person and 0.18 ha
per ínhabitant, is the highest in Latin America; (ii) the fact, that the aver-
age production per worker in agriculture is less than one-fifth the average
output per worker in other sectors; (lii) regional disparities, particularly
the subsistence farming un the Sierra as compared to high productívity in
irrigated coastal valleys; (iv) the high cost of land development, whether
for irrigation (Coast) or for settlement (Selva); (v) under-and unemployment
in the rural sector; the mal-distrlbution of land before the land reform law
of 1969 was introduced; (vi) presaure to increase food imports because the
domestic demand for foodstuff ís increaslng faster than supply, followed by
a deterloration in the agricultural balance of trade: and (vii) the uncer-
tainty following iinmediately after the agrarian reform law of 1969 was
announced.
e



- ii -
v.        Although land reform has been an objective since the early 1960's
it is only since 1969 that Govermment has introduced measures that change
ownership of land fundamentally. Before 1969, about 84% of land was con-
centrated in only 1.3% of holdings. Reforms are now underway, however, to
transfer large portions of agricultural land to cooperative ownership but
about three-fourths is still in the hands of individual farmers, mostly of
small and medium size. Despite considerable changes in the agrícultural
structure, output has remained stable during the last three years and Govern-
ment ís trying to reduce imports by encouraging investments in the agricul-
tural sector. The proposed Project would assist this policy.
vi.       The National Development Plan 1971-75 places particular emphasis on
agrlcultural development, particularly: (i) the implementation of the land
reform law of 1969; (íi) encouraging cooperatives and settlement of a maxí-
mum number of families on the land and the promotion of worker participation
in management so as to achieve higher o01tput, higher rural living standards
and a more equitable distribution of rural incomes; (iii) the promotion of
specific categories of products, with emphasis on import substitution wher-
ever practicable; and (iv) the reduction in the level of unemployment in the
rural sector from 31% in 1970 to 23% in 1975.                       '
vii.      BFA is virtually the only institutional source for lending to the
agricultural sector, being responsible for about 80% of such lending. It,
hovever, has been very short of medium and long-term lending funds.  In
fact, during the first half of 1972, 96% of its lending was on short term.
Under the Project, BFA would finance medium- and long-tere inves tments in
addition to those supported by a US$12 million IDB loan for 70 newly formed               E
cooperatives. BFA also handles Government trust funds, mainly for small
farmers and cooperatives, but the risk in these operations is borne by the
Government, with the Ministry of Agriculture carrying out  -he loan appraisal.
viii.     Under the Project, BFA would make about 2,500 loans to smiall farm-
ers, including cooperatives, and medium-size farmers for investnents in live-
stock farming, on-farm development for mixed farming, perennial crops and
agro-industrial development. Total Project cost would amount to US$41.7 mil-
lion equivalent.  Sub-borrowers would contribute 20% and Government would
provide BFA with another 20% in the form of a capital contribution. The pro-
posed loan, equivalent to 60% of Project cost, would cover the balance, in-
cluding the estimated foreign exchange component (46%) and some local cur-
rency (14%).
ix.       Lending funds would be earmarked to serve both cooperatives and
individual farmers in equal portions.  The effective interest rate charged
to cooperatives would be 9% per annum during the first 15 months of Project
execution and 10% thereafter, or another rate agreed upon by BFA and the Bank,
and to individual farmers 13%. Loan terma would range fromi five to 15 years.
x.        Procurement would be through normal comnercial channels, since the
range of items to be financed under the Project is very diversely spread



- iii -
over a four-year investment period and not suitable for bulk procurement.
A number of foreign firms are represented, assuring keen coi.petition, and
supplles are adequate on the local market and prices competitive.
xi.       The financial rates of return are estimated to range from 19 to
39%.  The overall economic rate of return is estimated at about 26%.  During
negotiations appropriate assistances were ohtained, providing a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$25 míllíon for a term of 18 years, including a
five-year grace períod.






PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDTT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Two Bank preparation missions, consisting of Messrs. P. Courbois
and J. Peberdy, and Messrs. P. Courbois and G. Luhman, visited Peru in May
1971 and in March 1972 to help complete preparation of an Agricultural Credit
Project for investments by individual farmers and cooperatives in livestock
development, minor irrigation and on-farm development, mechanization, orchards
and processing facilities. The Project report was finally prepared by the
Banco de Fomerto Agropecuario del Peru (BFA), which would be the borrower,
with Governmen.t as the guarantor. This report was the basis for appraisal
following the loan application submitted by the Ministry of Economy and Fi-
nance in August 1972. A loan of US$25 million equivalent is recommended.
1.02      Despite recent slow development of the agricultural sector, growth
prospects are good. Governmrent is encouraging investients in agriculture
through technical and financial assistance and, lately, through an improved
price policy but BFA, virtually the only institutional source for medium- and
long-term loans to agriculture, has been short of lending funds for these
terns. The proposed Project has been designed to help correct this deficiency.
1.03      The Bank has made four previous loans to BFA:  105-PE in 1954,
162-PE in 1957 and 257-PE in 1960 (each for US$5 million), and 415-PE in
1965 for US$15 million. All four loans have been fully disbursed and the
first three have been fully repaid. The Bank has made four other loans for
agricultural development in Peru:  USt1.3 million in FY 1953 (67-PE) and
US$1.7 million in FY 1954 (98-PFE) for agricultural machinery; and two loans
for irrigation: US$18 million in FY 1955 (114-PE) and US$6.5 million net
of cancellation in FY 1965 (418-PE). All but the latter have been fully
disbursed.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Pertu in September/October 1972 consisting of Vessrs. K. W. Berg, D. B. Argyle,
0. Urbina (Bank), and R. A. Crofts and B. C. Bilbo (Consultants).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Area and Population
2.01      Peru has an area of some 1.3 million km2 (Maps) and a population of
about 14.5 million. Of the total land area, only about 2% or 2.5 mnillion ha



-2-
is under cultivation (including fallow lands). Another estimated 21% or 27
míllaon ha is declared as natural pasture but large parts of this area are
being used only in a very extensíve manner. About three-quarters of the
country is occupied by mountains (up to 6,770 m), desert and undeveloped
jungle. In the coastal zone, where most of Peru's intensive agriculture
is situated, production depends ccmpletely on irrigation. There are 52
valleys in which some 650,000 ha (5% of total coastal area) are irrigated
to produce mainly cotton, sugarcane, maize and rice. However, only about
30% of this land always receives adequate irrlgation water; a further 40%
receives sufficient water in an average year, while the remainíng 30% re-
ceives adequate irrigation only in years of abundant rainfall. Of the total
livestock produiction, over 60% is accounted for in the Sierra, achieved mostly
under extensive conditions on unímproved natural pastures, and over 30% comeÉ
from intensive operations of dairy and fattening units on the coast.  Good
prosnects for increasing livestock production exist in the Selva, but high
clearance, settlement and marketing costs, the latter caused bv difficult
communications, are obstacles to its development.
Agriculture in the Economy
2.02      About half of the country's population lives in rural areas and
saoe 30% of the total economically active population is either unemployed or
underemployed. The contribution of agriculture (excluding fisheries) to the
GDP declined from 20% in 1960 to about 14% Ixn 1970. While Peru's population
during the last two decades has been growíng annually by about 3%, the                      e
country's economic growth has averaged 5% as compared to only 1% to 2% in the
agriculture sector. Food imports have, therefore, been increasing, reaching
US$144 million in 1971.  In the same year agricultural exports, excluding
fishmeal, amounted to USS160 míllaon. The latter have, on average, remained
on the same level during the 1967-71 period.
2.03      Crops occupying more than 100,000 ha are maize, potatoes, barley,
cotton, rice, coffee and wheat.  Another irportant crop is sugarcane.  The
chree main agricultural export products are sugar, cotton and coffee, while
the major agricultural irports are wheat, meat and dairy products. Trends
in agricultural production, hovever, indicate that the gap between food pro-
duction and internal denand is widening. It has been estimated that the aver-
age annual rate of increase in the demand for food over the next several years
will be about 4.67. This would likely result in incremental food imports of
about US$15 to 20 million annually, with consequential effects on the balance
of payments. Government development plans, therefore, aim at a selective in-
crease in production to maintain a positive agricultural balance of payments
under a supervised investment progran, backed by credit made available through
the BFA. To achieve these targets, Government intends to increase productivity
at the farm level through a fundamental change in land tenure which will also
bring about an improvement  in income distribution.  These changes are expected
to encourage new investments. The proposed Project supports these objectives
(for more details, see Annex 1).

B. Land Reform
2.04      The agricultural sector in Peru is undergoing a substantial change.
In 1961, 84% of the land was concentrated in only 1.3% of the total number of
holdings. To rectify this, two agrarian reform laws were passed, one in
1964, which was solely a land distribution measure, and the other in 1969.
The former was implemented in only four provinces in the Sierra region --
Cuzco, Puno, Pasco and Junin -- and resulted in the expropriation of 1.5
million ha of 795 inefficiently managed large estates (latifundios), together
with some 270,000 head of livestock. Land was then reallocated to about
20,000 family holdings. Although no attempt was made to implement the max-
imum retainable limits laid down by the law for different categories of land
in the coastal region, some medium-sized farmers took steps to bring their
holdings within these limits (for a more detailed analysis, see Annex 2).
2.05      The new agrarian reform law introduced in June 1969 is a much more
comprehensive measure and only since its implementation have rapid changes
come about. Definitions of maximum land holdings, valuation and compensation
payments for properties expropriated under the new law are much more striet
than under the law of 1964. Implementation has been progressively extended
so that it now covers virtually all the coastal and Sierra regions and a
separate law for the Selva is expected to be promulgated shortly. In addi-
tion to the expropriation of latifundios and land consolidation of very small
holdings (minifundios), legal justification for expropriation is given by
abandonment or inefficient management and the existence of anti-social or
feudatory land use systems or of unlawful labor conditions.
2.06      The maximum owmer-operated land holdings permitted are:
(a)  Coastal Region Arable Farms:
150 ha irrigated or
300 ha non-irrigated;
(b)  Coastal Livestock Farms:
1,500 ha natural pasture;
(c) Sierra Region Arable Farms:
15 to 55 ha irrigated according to district or
30 to 110 ha non-irrigated according to distriet; and
(d) Sierra Region Livestock Farms:
area necessary to support 5,000 head of sheep
at shearing time.
.



-4-
In all categoríes, these líints may be substantially increased (provided
the publlc interest allows) where wages paid are at least 10% higher than
the legal minirnum rates and profit is shared with workers. On the other
hand, the limits are reduced or cancelled when labor regulations have not
been observed.  Compensation for expropriated property ls paid partly in
cash (livestock and machinery) and in bon<s.
2.07      As of August 31, 1972, about 4.3 million ha had been expropriated
cornprising 2,200 units; otut of this, 2.L million ha had been distributed to
some 102,000 families. The amount of land exDropriated represents about
one-third of that declared 'expropriable` under present plans (total 12.7
million ha).
2.08      The following table shows a brealcdown of land (including agricul-
tural and non-agricultural) declared exnropriable and progress as of August 31,
1972:
Expropriated
Expropriable          August 31, 1972
('00n ha)    (1)      ('00n ha)         (%)
Irrigated                       79h         6          307            7
Non--irrigated                1,265        10          219             5
Pastures                      6,930        52 2,707                  64
Other                         3,618        30          995           24
TOTAL                  12,677       100        4 228          100
Present plans call for expropriating a total of 9.8 million ha hy the end of
1075, consisting of about 9,500 farm units (in 1961, there were about 840,000
farrns in Peru, covering a total of 17.7 mnillion ha). This compares with a
total of about 30 million ha of cultivated and nasture land in Peru.
2.09      Most of the land distributed under the land reforn has been allo-
cated to cooperatives of various kinds. Ahout 2.0 million ha lis in the hands
of 274 production cooneratl.ves, comnunal cooperatives and agricultural socie-
ties of social interest (Annex 2). Another 0.3 million ha has been distributed
to some 25,000 individual farmers.  It is estinated that Government will form
over the ne::t tTlree years about 50 new productíon cooneratives annually in
which each rmer'her's "share" of land will be about 10 ha.  In addition, there
are 227 cooperatives vhich were in existence before 1969 and which are nostly
service cooperatives. Many service cooperatives were formed hefore 1969 being
comnosed nostly of medil'm-size farmers.  There were several service coopera-
tives that lacked leadership and proper organization. They have disappeared
over the years. Those which have survived are worklng satisfactorily. Newly
formed cooperatives receive considerable Government assistance particularly
in management and accountina training, and while operational results are
lirnited because of their recent formation, there are encouraging signs in
regard to producti.vity.



5-
2.10      These new cooperative organizations, although intended to be self-
governing, operate under a comprehensive administrative structure that con-
trols their planning and operations to promote achievement of production
targets laid down in the National Development Plan.  The aim is to settle
the maximum number of families on expropriated land in viable units that
will improve agricultutral productivity and so permit increases in rural
living standards. So far, Governrent has taken a pragmatic approach in ex-
ecuting land reform, being guided by the desire to achieve social justice,
while at the same time maintaining or improvin- production.  Consequently,
production has not declined and, in some cases it has increased.  On the other
hand, the speed of land reform is also slowing down because of that. Coopera-
tives play already an important role in Peru's agricultural sector and this
is increasing. In order to provide them with sufficient and adequately
trained staff, GovernTnent has been setting up schools to train management
staff for the cooperative sector (para 2.09), but there is still a danger of
a shortage of qualified personnel as the land reform progresses. Government
is aware of this problem and gives high priority to proper training. At pre-
sent it receives technical assistance fron bilateral sources, UINDP and under
a US$12 million ITB-loan signed in June 1972.  These training prograns are
considered satisfactory.
C. Agricultural Credit
e
2.11      The Banco Central de Reserva del Peru (Central Bank) has the major
responsibilitv for controlling credit and for providing general direction
of the banking svstem, while the Superintendencia de Bancos (Superintendency
of Banks) is responsible for ensuring that the banking system and individual
banks comply with regulations.  There are a total of 21 commercial banks
which are mainly concerned with commerce and general lending.  In addition,
the Banco de la Nacion (Bank of the Nation) acts as banker for the Government
and five specialized governmient-owned banks assist in the development of
agriculture, industry, mining and housing. The Banco de Fomento Agropecuario
del Peru (BFA) (Chapter IV) specifically serves in agricultural and forestry
developnent. It is well represented througbout Peru and provides over 80%
of institutional agricultural credit, whiich totals about S/. 8,000 million
(USS207 million) loans outstanding; the remaining amount comes from the
commercial banks. Agricllítural credit represents about 20% of total insti-
tutional credit -- a percentage which has been fairly constant over the
past five years. Despite the growth in agricultural loans from SI. 5,000
to SI. 8,000 million (US$130-207 million) over this period, however, there
is still a shortage of lending funds -- particularly long-term . In recent
years, BFA's predominance in the agricultuire field has increased and it is
probable that this trend will continue as manv former clients of the commer-
cial banks have heen expropriated and the cooperatives replacing them will
deal with BFA, which can provide loans at preferential interest rates.  In
1971, one-third of BFA's new loans were made to cooperatives and this per-
centage is expected to increase.



-6-
2.12      BPA provides nearly all the medium- and long-term lending to agri-
culture in Peru and the bulk of the short-term lending but its ability
to make long-term loans has been greatly reduced over the last four to five
years because of lack of suitable resources. The commercial banks have pro-
vided mainly short-term loans for larger production units and agro-industries.
BFA's lending includes Governnent funds (mainly from external sources) held
by BFA as trust funds. In addition, BFA received in June 1972 a US$12 mil-
lion loan from IDB to finance investments in about 70 newly formed coopera-
tives. Companies engaged in sale of machínery and other major inputs pro-
vide some additional credit.
2.13      Rates of interest on loans from commercial banks are normally 14%.
BFA's interest rates are low and range from 7% for loans below S/. 50,000
(USS1,300) to 13% for loans above SI. 300,000 (US$8,000), based on the prin-
ciple of assisting small farmers and encouraging the production of certain
food crops. Interest rates to cooperatives are usually 7% to 9% and are
derived by divíding the total amount of the loan by the number of members
in the cooperative and then using this figure to establish the relative in-
terest rate normally charged for individual farmers. The Central Bank's
discount rate for commercial bank loans is 9-1/2%; however, agro-industrial
projects receives preferential discount rates of 5% and 7%. However, BFA's
preferential discount rate is only 2% and Central Bank funds are an important
part of its short-term resources. Interest rate ceiling on fixed deposits is
11% while savings deposits normally receive 7%.  Deposits with housing socie-
ties normally pay 10%.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The Project would be part of BFA's lending program, over a three-
year cormmitment period. It would help finance investments in livestock,
on-farm develoDment including mínor irrigation, drainage and storage, mechan-
ization, orchards and related processing facilities on loan terns between
five and 15 years. Investments would be made mainly by small farmers in-
cluding those grouped in cooperatives and the balance by medium-size farmers.
The Project would finance throughout the country:  (i) the development of
livestock farming, i.e., beef and dairy cattle, sheep and alpacas (43% of
total Project investment); (íi) on-farm development for annual crop produc-
tion including alfalfa (25%); (iíi) perennial crops (12%); and (iv) agro-
industrial development including pigs and poultry (20%). BFA would be the
borrower and would administer the Project. Total Project cost is estimated
at SI. 1,614 million (US$41.7 million) and the Bank's contribution would be
US$25 million, or 60%, covering the US$19 million estimated foreign exchange
cost (46%) and US$6 million local currency (14%), which is justified on
country grounds, while Government and beneficieries would each contribute
US$8. j million (20%) equivalent.  The contribution of the latter is con-
sidered reasonable.

3.03      About 2,500 small- and medium-size farrners and cooperatives wjould
participate in the Project.  A large portion of Project investments would be
made in the coastal region xwhere Peru's mnost intensive agriculture is situ-
ated, but consi derable investments, partictilarly for beef cattle production,
would also be sPiiported in the Selva and Sierra. The nuimber of loans under
the particular investnent categories mentioned above could var'  considerably
depending whether large sub-loans were made to cooperatives for such invest-
ments or not.  It is expected that most sub-loans for pigs, poultry and agro-
industrial investments would be made to cooperatives.  Also, some sub-loans
to cooperatives would be made for dairy and beef production. On the other
hand, both cooperatives and individual farmers would make investments for
annual crop production including alfalfa, which includes mainly on-farm irri-
gation, draina-e and mechanization. Sub-loans for perennial crops are ex-
pected to be nade principally to individual farmers.  Of the total project
funds, 50% would be earmarked for lndividual farmers and 50%' for cooperatives.
The estimated number of loans is based on the separate consideration of each
e



investment category, but in practice investments would likely be in a combina-
tion of several integrated items. The separation into five illustrative types
of investments has been made to test the financial return of each major pro-
duction activity on its own merits.
3.04      The composition and size of the proposed Project are based on:
(i) kind and size of sub-loans financed by BFA In the past; (ii) BFA's
expected staff capacity to process and supervise sub-loans; and (iii) the
estinated credit demand by both individual farmers and cooperatives for
investments not expected to be financed under Government's trust funds, for
which BFA carríes no risk, or under an IDB loan which finances 70 large
cooperatives.
B. Detailed Features
Pasture Establishment and Improvenent for Milk Production
3.05      Existing dairy farmera, mostly small farmers (about 15 ha) and
some cooperatives would get long-term loans for expanding and improving
their operations. It is difficult to estimate the size of cooperatives
for this kind of investment, but the largest amount of loans are expected
to go to srmall farmers, particularly in the Sierra.  In total, about 11,000
ha of new pasture would be established, following ploughing of land previously
tised extensively as natural pasture. Another 11,500 ha would be improved
wíthout ploughing by seeding, cleaning and fertilization. This would involve
about 1,200 sub-loans, including some large loans to cooperatives. Invest-
ments would cover: pasture development (21% of investment); breeding stock
(46%); machinery (7%); buildings (15%); and fences and water supply (11%).
The dairy herd would be based on Holstein and Brown Swiss cattle, which have
heen raised in Peru, yielding about 3,700 kg annually by year 4 after the
investment. Average investment per sub-borrower is estimated to be about
US$4,000 equivalent (Annex 3).
Pasture EstablishTnent and ImProvement for Beef Production
3.06      Under this category, the expansíon of beef production through
pasture establishment and improvement would be financed.  !edium-size
farmers (about 110 ha and 220 head of cattle) would clear about 50 ha of
jungle or other unused land and plant new pasture and also improve about
6(0 ha of existing pasture. As in the case of dairy projects, some coopera-
tives would also participate. Investments would take place mainly in the
Sierra (highlands) and Selva (jungle) and would involve, in total, about
300 to 400 sub-loans and some 44,000 ha of pasture. Investoents would
cover: pasture developrient (23% of investment), breeding stock (32%),
machinery (28%), buildings (7%), and fences and water supply (10%). In
addition, the Project would also finance some similar investments for
sheep, llama and alpaca operations which, however, are expected to be on
a much more extensive basis.  Average investrnent per sub-borrower is es-                  e
timated to be about US$30,000 equivalent.



-9-
Pig Production
3.07      The Project would also finance investments for pig production,
to be undertaken mostly by large sugar cooperatives. About 10 large sub-
loans would be made for buildings (37% of investment), breeding stock (23%),
feed (20%), labor and veterinary costs (10%) and machinery (10%).  In total,
this would provide facilities for a herd of some 3,200 breeding sows and about
40,000 fattening stock. In addition, the Project would finance some similar
investments for poultry.  Investment cost per unit is estimated to be about
US$330,000 equivalent.
Annual Crop Production and Alfalfa
3.08      Sub-loans would be made for developing about 22,500 ha through
on-farm irrigation, drainage, land levelling and mechanization. About 300
to 400 small- and medium-size farmers and some 20 cooperatives are expected
to develop land which haye not been used intensively because of drainage and
irrigation problemrs, and shortage of mechanization equipment. Most of the
investments would be made in the northern coastal area where irrigation and
subsequent drainage are essential to assure good yields. Crops to be grown
are mainly cotton, sorghum, maize and potatoes. Investments would include:
machinery (67% of investtnent), land levelling (18%), drainage construction
(7%) and minor irrigation (8%).  Investment costs are estimated to be equiv-
alent to about US$6,000 for small farmers, US$20,000 for medium-size farmers
and up to US$200,000 for cooperatives (Annexes 4 to 6).
Perennial Crops
3.09      Mostly small- and medium-size farmers would make investments in
perennial crops, which would include mainly:  mango, banana, pineapple, avocado,
citrus, olive, grape and asparagus. Under the Project sub-borrowers would
each establish perennial crops on about 10 ha which has previously been used
for annual crops. Sub-project costs would cover: planting (30% of invest-
ment), labor (39%), machinery and equipment (9%), land preparation (10%) and
fertilizer and pesticides (12%). It is expected that 6n0 such loans would
be made covering a total of 6,000 ha.  Average investment costs are estimated
to amount to about US$8,000 equivalent per sub-borrower (Annex 7).
Agro-industrial Investments
3.10      Because of increasing production from commercial farming, there is
a need for investnents in processing facilities for agricultural products.
It is expected that sub-projects would be prepared for lemon oíl and olive
oil extraction plants, milk pasteurization plants, feed mills, sausage-
making plants and cold and grain stores.  No models have been developed for
agro-industrial investments because the variations in types make meaningful
presentation difficult. Since BFA has a very limited experience in finan-
cing such investments, all sub-loans under this category, including any
other agricultural investments not mentioned above, would be submitted to



- 10 -
Bank for prior approval regardless of size (para 4.14 and Annex 8).
Investment costs per individual sub-borrower would vary considerably,
averaging about TUS$160,000 equivalent.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
3.11      Total Project cost is estimated at SI. 1,614 million (1TS$41.7
million), of v¡hich 46Y, or SI. 735 million (US.<19.0 million), would be for-
eign exchange.  Cost estimates and foreie,n exchange requirenents, based on

.Excluded from Project financing would be cooperatives receiving loans under
the IDB project and, unless the Bank agrees otherwise, any investment for
sugar production by cooperatives. Financing for the latter has not been
requested by BFA because sugar cooperatives have suffícient reserves for
self-financing and would need BFA leans only for their diversification plans.
Alse excluded from financing would be sugar refining. During negotiations
assurances were obtained en these mat:ters.
Financing
3.13      Of the total Project cost (S/. 1,614 million or US$41.7 million),
20% would be financed by sub-borrowers, which includes the contribution of
family labor (S/. 323 million); BFA would contribute 20% from its own re-
sources (S/. 323 million) which it would receive from Government in the form
of a capital contribution to BFA. An initial SI. 100 million would be paid
into the Project account. In addition SI. 123 and 100 million would be paid
within 12 and 24 months of loan effectiveness. During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained on these matters. The former would be a condition of
effectiveness. The Bank loan would cover the balance, or 60% (S/. 968 million
or Us$25.0 million), which would be US$6 million more than the estimated
foreign exchange component (46%). This is justified on country grounds. The
financing plans for individual components of the Project are summarized in
the following table:

3.14      BFA would be the borrower and Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.  Assurance were obtained on this matter.  The Bank loan
would be at the standard interest rate and repayable over a períod of 18
years, including five years of grace. SWith sub-loans being made over a
three--year period, the last repayment to BFA would be mnade 18 years after
the start of the Project. The Project cash flow projections indicate that
repayment of the Bank loan, as indicated above, would be appropriate (Annex
11).

D. Procurernent and Disbursement
Procurement
3.15      The items to be financed for the approximately 2,000 to 3,000 sub-
borrowers throughout Peru over the four-year investment period, are varied
and would not be suitable for bulk procurerment through international compe-
titive bidding.  In most cases, land development and construction of farm
buildings would be undertaken by the sub-borrowers themselves or by small
local contractors. Goods required for such constructions, including planting
material, livestock,, machinery and equipment would be obtained through exist-
ing commercial channels, which are satisfactory.  International suppliers
of the imported items are adequately  represented in Peru, competition is
keen and services are reasonable.
3.16      In recent years, Government has imposed import ceilings, which are
adjusted quarterly in the light of demand and available funds. This condition
has had little effect on tractor and machinery dealers, but, with the expected
rise in demand for such goods, there might be some shortage from time to time
for both tractors and machinery, including spare parts. Tractors and imple-
ments are exempted from custom duties and supply is satisfactory. Government,
in early 1971, invited tenders for a tractor assembly plant, and the award has
finally been made in late 1972. This would be the first tractor manufacturing
plant within the Andean Group of which Peru is a member. However, it is estí-
mated that production of such a plant would not get underway before 36 months
after the award was made. Therefore, assurances were obtained from Government
that it would ensure that the supply of tractors and spare parts therefor
would be adequate and of reasonable prices for the investments under the
Project.
Disbursement
3.17      With BFA's conmitments extending over three years, its disbursements
would be spread over about four years and Bank disbursement is expected to
cover four and a half years. The Bank disbursements would be made for 75% of
amounts disbursed by BFA for individual loans against a certificate of expen-
diture. The documentation for such expenditures would not be submitted to the
Bank for review, but would be retained by BFA and made avaílable for inspec-
tion by the Bank during the course of supervision missions. Individual loans
would represent up to 80% of the new investment financed.  The Bank would
disburse up to an amount specified for each category.  In a-dTt-ion, 50% of the
Bank loan amount would be earmarked for individual farmers and 50% for produc-
tion cooperatives and service cooperatives. This takes into account the grow-
_ng importance of cooperatives presently occupying 25% of agricultural lands
and benefitting from a US$12 miUlion IDB loan (para. 6.01). Bank disbursements
would thus be the equivalent of: SI. 416 million for livestock other than pigs
and poultry; S/. 242 million for investment in annual crop and alfalfa produc-
tion; SI. 116 million for perennial crops; and SI. 194 million for agro-
industrial investnents, pigs and poultry and others not included above. A



- 13 -
schedule of estimated Bank disburseTment is given in Annex 9.  In the event the
expenditures under any category provided for should decrease, the amount of
the loan allocated to such category and no longer required could, at the re-
quest of the horrower, be reallocated to another category.
IV. BANCO DE FOHENTO AGMOPECUTARTO DEL PERU (BFA)
General
4.01      The Banco de Formento Agropecuario del Peru (BFA) is a Government
owned agricultural credit and developnent institution which was established
in 1952 as a successor of the Banco Agrícola del Peru established in 1931.
It provides over 80% of institutional credit to the agricultural sector.
Additionally, BTA has a marketing monopoly on natural rubber and jute and is
also the trustee for Agrarian Reforn Bonds on which it incurs no risk. A
new basic law governing the BFA was enacted in 1968 but since then its status
and operations have been affected by the Agrarian Reform Law, which includes
directives on thc broad credit policies to be followed by RFA. Emphasis is
to be given to cooperative organizations and they are to receive priority for
credit in a situation where funds are limited.  A new BWA law under prepara-
tion is expected to incorporate these modifications. BFA is responsible to
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and hv law coordinates íts credit policies
with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Comnittee of Governrment Credit Policy.
(BFA is described in greater detail in Annex 10.)
Resources
4.02      The resources of BPA have more than doubled over the last five
years and amounted to S/. 8,786 millaon (TTS$226 níllion) at December 31,
1971. Paid-up capital (authorized capital us S/. 10,000 million (US$258
million)) comprised S/. 1,663 million (USW43 nillion), an increase of 120%
over the last four years, and reserves were SI. 124 million.  Other major
resources included: Central Bank advances of SI. 1,295 million (US$33.5
million) provided at concessionary discount rate of 2%; current deposits,
S/. 1,115 million (T1SS29 million), which are mainly excess funds of the
coTmercial banks; provisions SI. 1,081 million (US127.9 million); and an
IBRD loan, S/. 477 million (TJSS12.3 mitllion).
4.03      Use of Resources; Lending Operations.  BFA's outstanding loans fron
its own funds (excluding trust funds) increased sharnly from just over
S/. 3,000 mTlllion (UJS$112 million) 1/ in 1966 to S/. 6,son Tillion (US$168
million) in 1971 (Annex 10, Table 1). However, when viewed against inflation
and hig,h overdues, BFA's annual lending volume in real terms has increased at
1/   Calculated at exchange rate at time of consideration.
e



- 14 -
only a moderate rate.  New long- and medium-term loans granted during 1966
were S/. 250 million (ITS$9.3 million) and irtcreased to only SI. 300 million
(US7.6f million) in 1971, actually a decrease in real terms, reflecting BFA's
íack of long-term resources since IBRD loan funds were fully drawn in 1968.
During the first six months of 1972, BFA wias able to make only 4% of its
new loans on medium- and long-term, while 96% was on short term.  New short-
term loans, however, rose fromi S/. 1,780 million (USS66.4 million) in 1966
to SI. 5,000 million (US$129 minlion) in 1971 and BFA is able to meet most
requests for such borrowings. Increased access to Central Bank funds has
been a major factor in this.
4.04      Besides the lending operations from its own resources, BFA administers
the credit aspects of Government trust funds for the agricultural sector.
For this, BFA receives in most cases a fee of 6% for these services. These
funds are extended on agreed rates to stirulate activities under special Gov-
ernment policies. Outstandíng loans from trust funds for whích BFA is only a
fiscal agent (the Government appraises and approves loans and covers the risk)
rose from SI. 307 million (US$11.5 million) in September 1966 to SI. 1,332
million (US$34.3 million) at December 31, 1971. Of this amount, SI. 857 mil-
lion (US$22.1 million) was for long-term and S/. 475 million (US$12.3 miliíon)
for short-term. BFA also acts as the channel for payment of Agrarian Reform
Bonds which takes limited time but helps BFA in the collection of some old
debts (para. 2.06).
4.05      Non-Banking Operations.  BFA's non-banking activities mainly con-
cern a monopoly on the purchase of wild rubber and import of natural rubber.
Other activities include purchase of jute. Over the past several years, how-
ever, BFA has made little profit or loss on these operations. Total volume
of purchase was about SI. 200 million (UJS85.2 million) in 1971, resulting in
a deficit of S/. 3 militon (US$80,000). In earlier years, there was a similar
volume producing either a small surplus or deficit.  One of BFA's interests,
the Fundo Iberia, a large rubber plantation and agency in a remote part of
the Selva, has been highly unprofitable for many years. In 1971 losses were
about SI. 17.5 million (US$450,000), a figure similar to those recorded for
prevíous years. BFA has for a number of years been trying to get ríd of the
Fundo Iberia. At present, a bill is awaiting cabinet consideration for its
removal from BFA to Governnent. During negotiatíons assurances were obtained
from Government that it would take over the Fundo Iberia and reimburse BFA
for the losses it sustains until this has talcen place.
Financial Situation
4.06      BFA has been making only snall surpluses for a number of years
(Annexes 12 to 13). While BFA lends at fairly low interest rates, its cost
of resources is also very law, 1.2% of all resources, thus allowing a spread
of about 7% on its loan portfo7!o, which is high by most standards. M4ost of
thls spread is taken up in operating costs, TYhich equal about 5% of the loan
portfolio, and allowances for provisíons, mainly bad debts, equal to about 2%
of the loan portfolio.  Income is adversely affected by arrears of interest,
e.g., in 1971 S/. 98 million (USS2.5 million), or 1Si%' of interest due was not                e



- 15 -
collected.  In future years BFA, with an increased loan portfolio and improved
efficiency is expected to make modest surpluses. Annexes 11 to 13 illustrate
the expected results from the proposed loan and other sources.
4.07      BFA has a satisfactory liquidíty position -- current assets (i.e.,
lees than 12 months) excludíng provisíons for bad debts and trust funds were
about SI. 4,100 millon (US$115 míllíon) as compared to corresponding lía-
bílities of about S/. 3,300 million (US$93 million). Its debt equity ratio
of 2.4:1 is fairly low and reflects BFA's limitation on borrowing except when
funds are avaílable at very low interest rates. With low on-lending rates
(para 2.13) for much of its lending, fairly high overheads and large provi-
sions agaínst bad debts, BFA had to keep its financíal costs down to prevent
losses.
4.08      Recovery of loans by BFA has been a problem for miany years.  Over-
dues in the mid 1960's were about 30%; they declined to about 20% in 1967
and subsequently increased to about the present level (27% at June 30, 1972),
which has been faírly constant for the past three years. Reasons for this
increase include-  the effects of Agrarian Reform which has resulted in many
larger farmers and sharefarmers leaving farming, sometimnes without full pay-
ment of debts; firmer BFA policies with regard to recordíng of debts; non
write-off of old debts; natural disasters; Government requíring BFA to defer
payment in certain areas because of natural disasters; and BFA branch managers
giving short-term loans for long-term purposes to overcome shortage of long-
term funds. BFA's provision for bad debts is about 40% of overdues and 11%
of the total portfolio. These are considered to be a realistic estimate of
uncollectibles.
4.09      Three years ago BFA established a special Overdues Department,
reporting to senior management, to improve collections and nany large and
medium overdues are now tnder its control.  VJhíle these constitute only 1,200
(5%) of the 29,000 loans overdue at SeDtember 30, 1972, they include about
45% of the total mnount overdue and about 50% of the amount overdue by more
than nine months.  The Overdues Departnent has been giving priority to the
larger overdues to have a maxiítim fmpact and is progressively reviewing loans
and either taking legal action, agreeing to a rearrangenent (debt still re-
maains as overdue) or recommending a write-off. Although friproving, the pre-
sent rate of progress is slow and nepds to be accelerated.  ITnder the recently
approved InB loan to BFA for on-lending to cooperatives, RFA agreed to reduce
overdues to 147 by June 1974.  This halving of the present level of overdues
will require a major effort by BFA and an increased emphasi.s on loan collection
and wríte-off.  This ls likely to apply particularly to the 24,000 overdues
of small loans which are under the control of branches.  With the conditions
imposed by the IDB loan, there ls limited scope for other requirements.  How-
ever, during negotiations an assurance was obtained that BFA by December
1974, would have fully reviewed all loans overdue as at DeceTnber 31, 1971 (a
total of 16,On0  amounting to SI. 950 million (TTSA25 million)) and after re-
viewing the results with the Bank elther write them off, rearrange on a satis-
factory basis or put under legal action. This would ensure that a revíew of
the many old overdues had been or would be corpleted.

Organization and Management
4.10      BFA's highest authority is its Board, which consists of four
no"'inces of the Ministry of Finance and fouir nominees of the Ministry of
Agriculture. An Executive Conmittee comoosed of the President of BFA,. two
directors and the General Manager handles all matters entrusted to it by
the Board. The Chairman of the Board is the President, who is a full-time
employee of the BFA; he has a key role in matters of general policy. The
General Manager is responsible for the general operations of BFA and is ap-
pointed by the Board. He is assisted by a Central Manager (Senior Credit
Manager) and department managers in charge of: two Credit Departments, each
responsible for credit operations for approximately half the country; Finance,
handling external transactions, deposits and commercial activities (e.g. rub-
ber); Planning and Economic Studies, responsible for planning, and prepara-
tion of requests for external aid; and Technical Development. A number of
sub-managers responsible for Debt Collection, Trust Funds and Internal Audit
report directly to senior management. BFA has wide coverage in Peru, with
14 seni-auitonomous branches controlling a further 42 agencies, which have
functions similar to those of the branches, and 46 inspections which receive
and prepare loan applications for consideration by agencies and branches.
They are well equipped to handle the increased lending volume due to the
project and their authority to approve loans would be raised (para 4.14).
4.11      Under a previous Bank loan, BFA some seven years ago underwent a
reorganization with the assistance of a French consulting finm.  It mainly
strengthened the accounts and separated the banking activities from the non-
banking activities, but the problems BFA has been encountering since 1968 are
rising staff costs while avaílable mediun- and long-term lending funds have
been inadequate. This situation led to a reduction of branch authority for
medium- and long-term loans and gradual centralization to the Lima head office.
lanagement is aware of the problem and with additional funds now available
from Government and under those that would be supplied by the proposed Bank
loan, steady improvements can be expected. Present staff totals 2,186, in-
cluding 247 professional agricultural specialists. Staff numbers have ex-
panded quite sharply in recent years, but despite a substantial expansion in
portfolio, there has been little improvement in efficiency. The central office
staff numbers 468, which is considered high and a reflection of the undue
amount of paper work. Líaison between the head office and branches needs to
be ímproved as there is little personal contact. Key credit personnel from
the head office need to visit branches more often and branch managers and
senior branch staff need more contact with the Departnent of Planning and
Economic Studies and more exposure to field work would benefit both groups.
Assurances u7ere obtained at negotiations that BFA would arrange for more
frequent visits between head office Credit Department staff and branch staff
and that the Department of Planning and Economic Studies Twould be more closely
consulted on sub-loan approval.  In addition, BFA would prepare and discuss
with the Bank by not later than June 30, 1974 an overall and branch,by-branch
review of its operational and administrative costs and a plan of how to im-
prove its efficiency, particularly an outline to reduce such costs as a per-
centage of the loan portfolio.  After the review, a plan, satisfactory to the
Bank, should be put into effect.  During negotiations assurances were obtained
on this matter.

Lending Policies and Procedures
4.12      At present any BFA loan can cover only one category (e.g. cropping
requirenent or livestock or machinery) and is either short, medium or long-
term. Therefore, many borrowers need several individual loans, each separate-
ly recorded and filed. Under BFA's proposed new law, this duplication of
files and work would be largely elimirnated. Short-term loans (up to two years
but most often seasonal loans for annual cropping expenses) of up to
S/. 1,200,000 (IJS$31,000) can be approved at branch level but medium- and long-
term loans can be approved at branch level only to a maximum of S/I. 150,000
(US$3,900). All other applications are appraised and referred to the head
office for approval.  Because of the general shortage of long-term funds, BFA
has not encouraged long-term lending. This limit would be raised under the
Project (see para 4.14).
4.13      BFA's field appraisal methods are generally satisfactory for short-
term loans, but those for long-term loans, while thorough, often fail to re-
quire consideration of the farm as a whole and repayment periods are there-
fore frequently inadequate.  Also the time of appraisal is often long and
has discouraged potential borrowers. Under the Project, technical and fi-
nancial evaluation and assessment of long-term investment effectiveness
would be strengthened. This would be accomplished by engaging a qualified
and experienced credit specialist in long term development lending to coordi-
nate the various BrA departments and give general guidance to management on
appraisal procedures.  Assurances were obtained at negotiation that BFA would
in consultation with the Bank appoint a qualified and experienced credit
specialist. That such a specialist had been assigned or appointed would be a
condition of effectiveness.
4.14      BFA staff would assist applicants in the preparation of detailed
plans including farm plans, income and expenditure estimates and cash flows
and would appraise all sub-projects in terms of incremental returns. Sub-
loans up to S/. 1.2 million (US$31,000) would be approved at branch level
and all others would be referred to the head office; all loans in excess of
US$100,000 and all agro-industrial loans and loans for pig and poultry pro-
duction (para 3.12), regardless of size, would require prior approval of the
Bank. Sugar producing cooperatives would only be elegible for investments in
agro-industries, except sugar production and refining, and for pig and poultry
production. BFA vould make loans to cooperatives only if it was satisfied
with the management and only in cases where those cooperatives do not have
good prospects of securing capital from other sources, including from their
own surpluses, to finance the proposed investment. BFA would lend up to 80%
of total new Investment cost and technical staff would neriodically visit bor-
rowers to ensure that ftnds were being used for the intended purposes. The
above procedures would not be altered without prior approval of the Bank and
assurances were obtained on them during neg,otiations.
4.15      Interest Rates:  In lieu of using the allocation function of the
cost of capital, Covernment has instituted an administrative resources allo-
cation mechanisn under hiich credit is distributed.  BFA's effective interest



- 18 -
rates charged to borrowers vary from 7% to 13%.  The weighted average in 1971                 E
was 10.5% per annum (para 2.13). In spite of these low rates, however, BFA
has continued to show a slight surplus hecause of the low average cost of its
resources and hence adequate spread and the non-assumnption of risk under trust
funds. On the other hand, the financial return of farmers and cooperatives
on additional investmnent indicates that a higher rate of interest would be
well within the debt service capacity of the beneficiaries provided adequate
maturity for loans under the Project were granted. Therefore, in view of the
farmers' ability to pay more and BFA's need to meet increasing demand and im-
ptove its own financial position, assurances were obtained from RFA that its
effective interest rate to cooperatives under the Project would be no less than
9% for a períod of 15 months following loan signing and 10% thereafter, or at
an another rate to be agreed upon by BFA and the Bank, and to individual farmers
no less than 13%. However, should the rate of inflation increase in any FY of
Peru to a level in excess of 9% per annum, BFA, the Government and the Bank
wqould review interest rates charged to suh-borrowers.  Assurances were obtained
on this matter.
4.16      Cash flows of typical investmients under the Project indicate that
the follotiing repayment periods for loans to sub-borrowers would be appro-
priate, but in no case would a sub-loan under the Project be nade for a
period of less than five years:
Grace Period   Repayment Period   Total

1.  Dairy                             5                 7              12
2.  Beef                              5                 7              12

During negotiations, assurances were obtained that these periods wYould not
be exceeded without the Bank's prior approval.
Accounts and Audit
4.17      In general, accounting and auditin" procedures are satisfactory.
llowever, the limited classlfication of ageing of overdue loans and the systen
of multiple loans for individuals are deficiencies which need to be corrected.
The newly appointed external auditors, Alonso, Castro and Associates are an
experienced and well established Lima firm. The Superintendent of Banks peri-
odically audits and reviews part of BFA's activities to ensure compliance
with banking recuirements and to ensure satisfactory standards of practice.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that BFA would keep separate loan
accounts for the proposed Project and that these accounts and its general
accounts would continue to he audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank and
that the audited accotnts and auditors' report yotuld be sent to the Bank with-
in four rmonths of the end of BFA's fiscal vear.

eyV.  MKRKETING AND SUB-BORROWERS' BENEFITS
Marketing
5.01      Under the Project, production generated from investnents would
consist mainly of meat (beef, pork, poultry and mutton), milk, grains (maize
and sorghum), cotton and various fruits (avocados, mangos, olives, grapes,
pineapple, lemons and bananas). Under the National Development Plan, 1971-
75, priority is given to three main groups of agricultural products: (i)
deficit produets or ones which are imported; (ii) regulated products for
which prices are for various reasons controlled; and (iii) export products
which are traditionally exported. Alnost all the products financed under
the Project come under one or another of these groups. Not specially men-
tioned are fruits for which, however, there is a growing internal demand
because of population and income growth, coupled, in certain cases, with
good export possibilities, e.g. lemon oil.  Following drainage investments,
higher cotton yields per ha are expected; on the other hand, perennial crops
to be established under the Project will replace some cotton production.
Therefore, total cotton production is not expected to rise as a result of
Project investnents and this is in line with National Development Plan targets.
5.02      At full development, about five years after investment, it is
estimated that farmers and cooperatives would produce íncremnental amounts
_        due to Project investments of about:  10,700 tons of beef, pork and poultry
(liveweight), 75,000 tons of fruits, 60,000 tons of feed grains and 35,000
tona of potatoes.
5.03      It is Government's policy to support agricultural production by
maintaining producer prices at reasonable levels for those crops for which
there is a good demand, either internally or externally. However, recent Bank
survey reports on Peru have stressed the need for the adoption of more appro-
priate price and import policies to give a greater incentive impact to the
production program set out in the National Development Plan 1971-1975. Prior
to 1967, policy was directed towards maintaining low prices to urban consumers
and duty-free imports (particularly of neat) were relatively freely admitted,
often at the cost of weakening production incentives. In 1967, the devalua-
tion of the Peruvian Sol (from S/. 26.80 to the US$ to SI. 38.70) improved the
terms of trade for agricultural producers. Since 1969, imports, now entirely
under Governnent control, have been restricted and have not been allomed to
affect adversely producer prices. The Governnent ¡a now considering adopting
a strategy, which would involve a balancing of competing objectives, such as,
the desire to atimulate production of certain products, to raise incomes of
the rural population, and to keep urban cost of living from rising too rapidly.
The Bank intends to continue closely to follow the question of agrícultural
policy in Peru and to review with the Government the need to give high priority
to production objectives whenever these objectives are not accorded adequate
weight.
5.04      Iniplementation of this policy remains, however, uneven.  While, in
general termis, producer prices are satisfactory and provide sufficient incen-
tives to farmers and cooperatives, as indicated by the financial rates of



- 20 -
e
return on the farm models set out in Annex 14, controlled prices for beef at
S/. 35 per kg ungraded at wholesale market are low compared wlth current w,orld
príces (S/. 108 equivalent per kg U.K. wholesale market for Argentinian chilled
rump boneless and SI. 50 per kg c.i.f. any U.S. port of entry for imported
boneless manufacturfng frozen beef).  In fact, however, effective prices to
both producers and consumers are considerably higher than the control price
level. For young animals classed as "extra," the producer gets about SI. 30
per kg liveweíg.t (= SI. 62 per kg deadweight), whereas prime beef cuts are
retailed at over S/. 100 per kg. Government has its livestock price policy
currently under review, but apart from the problem of having to balance con-
sumner and producer interest, there are unusual complications in the present
situation in Peru. On the one hand, because beef imports on Government ac-
cotnt are sold at the controlled price, a heavy and increasing subsidy to the
consumer is involved in these transactions; on the other hand, as the con-
trolled price is used as the basis for the assessment of livestock compensa-
tion payments under the land reform, any increase ln its level would automatí-
cally raise compensation costs which have to be paid in cash. In addítion,
Government keeps beef prices under control to prevent inflationary prices at
times of short supply, and it has introduced 15 beef meatless days per month.
5.05      For miost other commodities, Peruvian prices are roughly in line
with world market prices. In the case of rice, however, artificially high
-?rices are paid to producers. The price for paddy delivered rice mill ls
S/. 5,000 per ton, which gíves an equivalent f.o.b. price for milled rice
of approximately SI. 9,000 or US$232 per ton.  Comparable f.o.b. world
mtnrket prices (August, 1972) wjere US$141.7 per ton for Thai rice (5% broken)
and TIS$79.3 per ton for Burmese rice (42% broken), showing that the Peruvian
price is two to three times hiíher than world market price levels.  However,
these world marked prices have, lately, also risen considerably; i.e. Thai
rice up to UJS$192 per ton. The high local. nrice, nevertheless, has led to
a 65% increase in paddy output during the last decade, enabling Peru to
achieve self-sufficíency in rice in 197n, largely at the expense of a reduc-
tion in cotton plantings and production.
5.06      The existíng agricultural marketin- system should he able to handle,
wdithiott d<ificulty, the increased production -enerated by the Project, tYhich
at most will anount to 27 of nresent agricultiral output.  Moreover, existing
narketint  deficiencies are knov7n and considerable puhlic expenditure (T,S~22.6
mi1lion) is projected for markcting infrastructure improvements under the
National Develonment Plan 1Q71-1975.  This will be complemented by private
investment under the Project in on-farn storage and  in processing.
Sub)-borrowxers' Benefits
5.07      On the basis of investment costs, vield and price assumptions,
five illustrative investment nodels (Anne- 14) have been workced out to
analyze the financial benefits expected fror d4fferent iters to be financed
tuder the proposea Project.  The financial rates of return t.Tould be 24% for
dairy farming, 10% for beef farring,, 35% for pig enterprises, 39% for mixed
farnin- and 27% for perennial crop production.  This is considered to be



- 21 -
very satisfactory, assuring incentives to prospective investors under the
Project. To test the sensitivity of financial returns against varying costs,
alternative assumptions haye also been used which show the following rates
in comparison to the `best estimate":  if annual cost would be 10% higher
than estimated and all other incomes =nd costs do not change, the financial
rates of return would drop as follows- dairy farming from 24% to 19%, beef
farming from 19% to 17%, pig enterprises from 35% to 31%, mixed farming from
39% to 27% and perennial crops from 26% to 17%. A slightly greater reduc-
tion, but etill acceptable rates of return, would be obtained if sales,
dropped by 10%, because of price or yield reductions, while all other assump-
tions remained. Thus, it can be concluded that returna should provide suf-
ficient incentives to producers to make the intended investments.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Bank loan would enable BFA to provide medium- and long-term credit
facilities to small farmers (including cooperatives) and to medium-size farmers
to enable them to make long delayed investments and expand their operations,
specífically in cattle, pig, poultry and agro-industrial activities. Such
investments have, in the recent past, not been made because of a climate of
uncertainty following the agrarian reform law of 1969, and because of an
acute shortage óf funde in BFA, the major source of long-term agricultural
credit in Peru.  The demand for such credit is now increasing, however, from
-_-       both individual farmere and cooperatives.  The demand for loans to finance
investments undertaken by cooperatives is expected to grow rapidly. This
sector occupies presently about one-fourth of Peru's agricultural land, but
this portion le growing.  Cooperatives already receive preferential treatment
under BFA's lending policy using ita on resources and Government trust funds
for financing their investment plans. In addition, an US$12 million IDB loan
ls financing such investments. Taking the above into account, 50% of the
proposed loan has been allocated for the cooperative sector. Individual
farmers, who farm presently three-fourths of Peru's agricultural land, would
recelve the remaining 50% of the proposed loan. Their investment neadb haye
been neglected in the past. This has been due to uncertainty inmediately
after the land reform and BFA's preference for cooperatives.  The demand of
these individual farmere, however, in considerable, because long delayed ín-
vest ente are now urgently required and those farmers not affected by land
reform measures are regaining confidence. The Project would assist Govern-
ment efforts to provide investment credit to these types of agricultural
producers, which would finally result in raising their living standards.
6.02      The more efficíent land use and a better income distríbution
through agrarian reform has become the established polícy of the Government
*          of Peru.  The recent experience indicates that the rate of implementation
so far has had no detrimental effects on production and in certain crops
production has increased. Appraisal indicates that the new system as
presently set up can raise agricultural production. Attentíon should be drawn
to the fact that so far satisfactory results haye been achieved because of



- 22 -
e
a pragimatic and reasonable rate of implementation adjusted with available
resources. However, in such a far reaching and sensitive program, the
medium and long-term effects are inevitably difficult to foresee and the
possibility must be recognized that an accelerated redistribution of pro-
ductive resources and/or a less flexible approach to production, supply and
narketing patterns could cause serious disruptiona in output. Nevertheless,
the performance of the Government to date and their stated policies for the
future supports the confidence that the present reasonable approach will be
maintained.
6.03      Agricultural growth has lagged significantly behind the overall
economic growth of the econony and it also has been less than population
growth. Investments of the kind to be financed under the Project would help
raise agricultural productivity in selected priority products in accordance
with the targets of the National Development Plan 1971-1975. The resultíng
increased production would help ímprove Peru's balance of payment position,
mainly by import substitution (meat, milk products and grains).  Annual net
foreign exchange savings and, to some extent, earnings attributable to the
Project would reach about US$11 míllíon equivalent annually, after taking
into account the cost of imported inputs (estimated about US$4 míllion) at
the Project's full developrient. Annual debt servíce would amount to about
US$3.0 million. Additional, but non-quantifiable, benefits would also re-
sult from ínstitutional improvements of BFA, improvement in the employment
situation and the demonstration effect on non-Project farmers and cooperatives.
6.04      The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
predicted world market prices for 1975, plus an allowance for transportation
cost for the major agricultural products expected to be produced under the
Project, with the exception of pork, milk and potatoes. The latter are
regarded as `non-tradeable" commodities for which current Peruvian prices
have been used. The Project's overall rate of return to the economy i8
estirmated at 26% (Annex 15).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  the Government would provide BFA with a capital contribution
of SI. 323 million on an agreed time schedule and bear the
exchange risk (paras 3.13 and 3.14);
(b)  BFA would review its overdue loan portfolio, endeavour to reduce
its administrative coats and appoint a credit specialist
(paras 4.09, 4.11 and 4.13);



- 23 -
(c) BFA would exclude from financíng under the Project such
production cooperatives which have good prospects of securing
capital. from other sources, including from their own surplus,
to finance their proposed investments (para 4.14); and
(d)  BFA would finance up to 80% of investnent costs and charge an
effective interest rate of 13% to individual farmers and an
initial 9% to cooperatives, which would be raised to 10%,
or another rate to be agreed upon by RFA and the Bank, after
15 months (para 4.14 and 4.15).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be (i) that Govern-
ment has paid a capital contribution of SI. 100 million to BFA's project
account; and (ii) BFA has appointed a credit specialist (paras 3.13 and 4.13).
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to BFA of US$25 million for a term of 18 years, including a five-year grace
period.

PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECr
Agrícultural Background
General
1.        Bordered on the north by Ecuador and Colombia, on the east by Brazil
and Bolivia and to the south by Chile, Peru lies between the equator and lati-
tude 180 21' S. with a coastline of some 3,000 km on the Pacific Ocean. Of
the total land area of 128.5 million ha, cultivated land accounts for only
2.2 million ha (1.7%), natural pastures cover 27.1 million ha (21.1%) and the
balance (77.2%) is either land of nc agricultural use, forest or undeveloped
land (see para. 3). The total population is estimated at 15 million.
2.        To bring out the range of geographical conditions existing in Peru,
it is necessary to break down the aggregate figures shown above, and, for
this purpose, it is customary to divide the country into the following three
zones:
(a)  Coastal Zone
This area, between the Pacífic Ocean and the 2,300 m contour
contains 10.6% of the country, and because of minimal rain-
fall, its agriculture is completely dependent on irrigation.
In 52 valleys containing for the most part fertile soils,
some 650,000 ha of irrigated land (5% of total coastal zone)
produce the bulk of the sugar, cotton, maize, rice and fruit.
The valleys are separated by stretches of sand dunes and hílls,
affording meager natural pasture.
(b) The Sierra
Comprising over 30% of the total area of Peru, the Sierra zone
embraces the Andean mountain region where, in valleys below
3,500 m, sumer rainfall of 300 to 900 mm permits the culti-
vation of temperate crops (potatoes, wheat, maize and barley)
on relatively fertile land totalling 1,500,000 ha about a
quarter of which is irrigated by small-scale irrigation systems.
This cultivated land represents only 3% of the total area of
the zone, but an additional 24 million ha (61%) are natural
pastures, making the Sierra the principal livestock area in
e                   Peru.  In the Sierra the majority of the population is living
under low standard subsistence economy conditions.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
(c) The Selva
Made up of the eastern slopes of the Andes below 2,000 m and
Peru's share of the Amazonian jungle, the Selva is largely
undeveloped. Although it accounts for 58.8% of the total area
of Peru, the present area of cultivated land is estimated at
less than 500,000 ha. In addition to its isolation, it has
disadvantages of relatively poor soils and a humid tropical
climate with high rainfall.

Agriculture in the Economy
4.        Between 1960 and 1970, agriculture's share of GNP fell from 20.3%
to 14%, the proportion of the labor force employed in agriculture declined
from 52.8% to 48.4%. During the last two decades, while Peru's population
has increased at about 3% per annum and its annual economic growth rate has
been 5%; the growth rate of the agricultural sector, however, has been less
than 2% per year.
5.        The relative stagnation in agricultural production indicated by these
trends at Table 1 to this Annex has reduced Peru's favorable agricultural
balance of payments. Excluding fishmeal, agricultural exports exceeded im-
ports by US$100 million in 1963 but by 1971 this surplus had been reduced to
.

US$16 million. Sugar, cotton and coffee dominate agricultural exports,
valued at US$159.2 and constituted 18% of total exports in 1971. By the same
date, agricultural importa (of which wheat, meat and dairy products together
account for 60% of the total) had risen in value to US$143.6 million, or 19%
of total importa.

7.        During the last decade, the main trends in the production of the
major crops have been reductions in barley and wheat (11% and 15% respectively)
with a compensatory rise in maize production (30%); and a 65% expansion in
paddy production (in response to artificially high producer prices) which has
led to self-sufficiency in rice at the expense of a drop of about 36% in both
area and production of cotton (Table 1 to this Annex and Annex 4).



ANNEX 1
Page 4                      l
8.        Livestock.  The livestock production figures in Table 1 show that,
apart from poultry meat and eggs, where output doubled, annual rates of pro-
duction increase for other livestock items in the decade 1960-69 were low.
Overall, by value, the increase was 2.9% Der annum, less than the rate of
population growth (estimated at 3.1%). However, the comparable statistics
for 1970 and 1971 show increases of nearly 10% per annum for beef production,
probably reflecting increased slaughteríngs as an indirect result of the land
rciorm rather than any real improvement in production. During the same period
(1970-1971), there were considerable imports of líve animals intended to
assist in the re-building of the national herd (Annex 3).
9.        Irrigation.  Under a new law 1/, private water rights have been
abolished, and water is regarded as the property of the state, to be allo-
cated for use according to social needs. Each farm unit created or recognized
under the land reform is to receive water according to an approved cropping
pattern, while water charges are to be inereased to reflect more accurately
the real costs of providing irrigation water. The change to this new system
has just started.
10.       The National Development Plan continues to make provision for new
large-scale projects, which combined would add about 150,000 ha of new irri-
gated land with improved water supplies on a further 100,000 ha. The high
cost of some of these schemes, lack of capital and skilled manpower, and the
additional burdens thrown on the Irrigation Department by the new water law,
make the achievement of these targets unlikely and underline the fact that
the greatest short-term increases are likely to come from an improvement in
water use in existing irriRation areas. Provision for such small-scale works
as planned in 1970 accounts for only 20% of projected expenditures on irriga-
tion totalling S/. 6,095 million (US$160 million) or 52% of total public ex-
penditure on agriculture from 1971 to 1975.
11.       Inputs.  Fertilizer use expanded by over 50% between 1966 and 1970,
with imported urea largely replacing guano as the nitrogen component. Price
ratios (about 3:1 between crop and nitrogen) are favorable. Current usage
represents 25% of the optimum and is largely concentrated on irrigated land
in the coast, particularly for sugar and cotton crops. The risk element in-
volved with uncertain rainfall is the major deterrent to the spread of ferti-
lizer use in the Sierra.
12.       The use of other cash inputs is also largely restricted to the more
advanced coastal areas. The number of tractors in operation grew by about 50%
over the last 10 years, while imported pesticides are used chiefly on the
cotton crop.
13.       The use of improved seeds increased only slightly from 1960 to 1967,
rising from 22.6% to 25.4%. Progress in the use of such seeds is greatest
in sugarcane, cotton and maize production, but research efforts are being
intensified in all priority crops.

Agricultural Services
14.       In 1969, a reorganization of public services concentrated responsi-
bility for the formulation and execution of policy within the agricultural
sector in the Ministry of Agriculture 1/, and a number of previously semi-
autonomous agencies were incorporated within the Ministry's framework. Under
a Director Superior, six main executive general directorates deal with Water
and Irrigation, Forestry, Agricultural Production, Agrarian Reform (including
Land Settlement), Research and Marketing. Of the advisory branches to the
Ministry, the Agricultural Sector Planning Office (Oficina Sectorial de
Planificacion Agraria - OPSA), with direct links to the National Planning
Institute (Instituto Nacional de Planificacion), is the most important.
15.       Peru is divided into 12 agrarian zones and in each of these is a
replica of the national level organization. Under the Agriculture Director
for the zone, there are directorates for each of the six executive branches
of the Ministry together with a zonal planning office. Each zone is sub-
divided into sectora, corresponding to natural regions, and these, in turn,
are subdivided into sub-sectors to facilitate the planning of integrated
settlement projects (Projectos Integrales de Asentamiento Rural - PIAR). Re-
sponsibility for both planning and implementation of agricultural development,
within the general framework of approved national plans, is vested in the
agrarian zone director and the zonal agricultural staff. This decentralization
gives the necessary executive flexibility to vary policy implementation accord-
ing to local priorities, as in the case of land reform.
16.       Of most direct concern to the project are the General Directorates
of Agricultural Production and of Land Reform. The former has a total staff
of about 4,000, of whom 50% are professional and technical personnel and 6%
are at Lima. Their responsibilities include extension, training, and super-
vision of inputs, while specíal branches deal with livestock and cooperatives.
The Directorate General of Land Reform and Settlement (DGRA y AR), primarily
responsible for the implementation of the land reform law, has a staff of
2,000, 50% of whom are professional and technical and 30% are working at head-
quarters. In general, the staff of these key departments are both committed
and competent but, as explained in Annex 2, are facing increasingly complicated
problems as the land reform progresses.
Basic Problems of Agriculture in Peru
17.       The basic problems facing agriculture in Peru include:
(a) the demographic pressure on land actually cultivated which,
at about 0.38 ha per rural person and 0.18 ha per inhabitant,
ia the highest ín Latin America;
1/   Decreto Ley 17533 of March 25, 1969.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
(b) the fact, that the average production per worker in
agriculture is less than one-fifth the average output
per worker in all other sectors;
(c) regional disparities, in particular, the low output and
poor living standards of most of the rural population of
the Sierra who are still in a virtually subsistence economy;
(d) the high cost of land development, whether by irrigation
on the coast or settlement in the Selva;
(e)  pressure to increase food imports because the domestic
demand for foodstuffs is increasing faster than supply,
followed by a deterioration in the agricultural balance of
trade; and
(f) under- and unemployment in the rural sector, estimated
at about 30% in 1970, and leading to considerable migra-
tion, particularly from the Sierra to the cities, notably
Lima, aggravating already difficult socio-economic
conditions.
18.       To this formidable list, it would have been necessary to add prior
to 1969, the acute mal-distribution of land, involving the existence of both
minifundio and latifundio holdings and of many feudal and sharecropping types
of land tenure, which together constituted major obstacles to the irmprovement
of the level of rural income.
National Development Plan
19.       In the agricultural sector, the National Development Plan 1971-75
has as its main objects:
(a)  implementation of the land reform law of 1969 1/ to
create a new agrarian structure made up of various kinds
of cooperative organizations formed either to (i) to con-
tinue the operation of existing large units (e.g. sugar
plantation complexes on the coast and extensive ranches
in the Sierra) or (ii) operate as a new production unit
on lands where smaller holdings (or parts of them) have
been expropriated, where minifundio holdings have been
integrated or new settlement schemes have been estab-
lished, plus the remaining medium- and small-scale
individual farmers who conform to the terms of the land
reform law in respect of size of holding, efficiency of
operations and compliance with social and labor legislation;
1/   Por details, see Annex 2.



ANNEX 1

e
(b) through the new cooperative units, to combine efficient
working and economies of scale with the settlement of the
maximum numbers of families on the land and the promotion
of worker participation in management so as to achieve
higher output, higher rural living standards and a more
equitable distribution of rural incomes;
(c) through the planned and controlled use of land, under the
new agrarian structure, and water, under the equally far-
reaching new water law (para 9 above) to concentrate pro-
duction promotion on specific categories of products, with
emphasis on import substitution wherever practicable; and
(d) the reduction in the level of unemployment in the rural
sector from 31% in 1970 to 23% in 1975.
20.       The plan target 13 an overall annual growth rate of 4.2% over
the period 1971-75. This ranges from less than 1% annually for sugarcane to
more than 20% annually for eggs and poultry meat. Pork and milk are expected
to grow at 8% per annum, with beef and mutton increasing at the annual aver-
age rate. Cotton and coffee, which together with sugar, constitute the main
export crops are expected to grow at about 2% and the major food staples of
maize, rice and potatoes at about the annual average rate. Since the popula-
tion growth is estimated at 3.1% per annum, achievement of the projected
annual growth rate of 4.2% would restore the agricultural balance of payments
surplus to its 1970 level of US$31 million.
21.       To achieve these production targets, reliance is placed on:
(a) detailed planning and control at all levels;
(b) provision of maximum technical assistance, particularly to
the new cooperative units emerging from the land reform;
(c) concentration of these promotional activities in integrated
schemes in priority areas 1/ (Areas de Accion Directa), which
are planned to expand from 133,000 ha in 1971 to 298,000 ha
in 1975;
(d) increased output per man and per hectare; there is con-
siderable potential for yield increases in certain crops,
notably barley, maize and wheat, as shown by the following
table where average yields in Peru are compared with those
in other Latin American countries (average world yields are
also given).

Fertilizer and improved seed use is only about 26% of optimum
although utilization is proportionately higher on more tech-
nically advanced farms in the coastal region. Increases in
livestock production depend more on management and pasture
improvement;
(e)  controlled supply of inputs, such as water, fertilizer,
improved seed, and credit in conformity with production
priorities, again with preference given to the new co-
operative organizations; and
(f) improvement of marketing facilities;
22.       The cost of providing supporting government services on the scale
called for under the plan is high, as is shown by the fact that expenditures
on the administration of land reform (excluding compensation payments to pre-
vious owners), extension and promotion, and on marketing for the period 1971-75
are projected at S/. 3,481 million (US$90 míllion), which is 30% of total pub-
lic expenditure in the agricultural sector during the period.

Recent Performance and Future Prospects
23.       Production figures for 1970 and 1971 given in Table 1 to this Annex
represent an annual increase by value of the order of 1%, which is less than
planned targets. It must, however, be remembered that these two years have
been particularly unfavorable for agriculture. Unusually heavy summer raíns
affected crops especially in the northern coastal area where flooding and
landslides caused heavy losses, and unseasonal frosts in the Sierra adversely
affected the potato crop there.
24.       Precise evaluation of recent performance is made more difficult by
the fact that figures for the base year (1970) used in plan projections appear
to be lower than actual production for that year as published by the statistics
office of the Ministry of Agriculture. This applies particularly in the case
of livestock, where special condítions existed (para 8 above and Annex 3).
Revised demand/supply projections for all sectors of agriculture are now being
forrmulated as part of the compilation of the biennial budget 1973-74. These
new forecasts, based on actual experience and built up from data compiled by
the zone offices, are likely to be more realistic and show some reduction in
previous target levels. In particular, recognition of the need for more grain
imports to support livestock expansion is leading to the conclusion that there
may well be a further fall in the agricultural balance of payvTents to US$7.6
million in 1974.
25.       However, the fact that significant production increases were regis-
tered in 1970 and 1971, at a time when sweeping changes were being implemented
under the land reform and under generally unfavorable climatic conditions,
augurs well for the future productivity of the new agrarian structure. While,
in the longer run, the role of agriculture in Peru's future economic growth
may be a diminishing one, further increases in agricultural output and produc-
tivity are essential in the short term to meet as much as possible of the coun-
try's growing food demands so as to avoid any undue increase in agricultural
imports that would jeopardize the balance of payments position.
26.       More detaíled reviews of future prospects, with particular reference
to comnodities to be produced under the proposed Project are given in Annexes
3 and 4. Price policy and marketing implications are outlined in Annex 5.

PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Land Reform and Cooperatives
Introduction
1.        The results of the agricultural census of 1961 highlighted the
tremendous disparity in the size and number of land holdings then existing
in Peru. At one end of the scale, only 1.3% of the farms exceeded 100 ha in
size, yet their total area covered 84% of the land farmed; at the other end,
over 69% of holdings were of less than 3 ha, and accounted for less than 4%
of the total farmed area. Peru had thus a land tenure structure embracing
both latifundio and minifundio (Table 1).
2.        The first agrarian reform law (Decreto Lay No. 15037 of May 31, 1964)
was solely a land redistribution measure.  Implemented only in four provinces
e          (Cuzco, Puno, Pasco and Junin) in the Sierra region, it resulted in the expro-
priation of 1.5 million ha made up of 795 inefficiently managed latifundio,
together with 270,000 head of livestock, and their reallocation to 19,820
family holdings. Although no attempt was made to implement the maximum re-
tainable limits laid down by the law for different categories of land in the
coastal region, some medium-sized farmers took steps to bring their holdings
within these limits.
The Agrarian Reform of 1969
3.        The new agrarian reform, introduced under Decreto Ley No. 17716 of
June 24, 1969, is a much more comprehensive measure than the 1964 law.
Firstly, its definitions of maximum land holdings, of valuation bases and of
compensation payments, are stricter (Table 2). Secondly, its implementation
has been progressively extended so that it now covers virtually all the coast-
al and Sierra regions. (A separate law governing the Selva region is expected
to be promulgated shortly.) Thirdly, and most fundamental, the new law goes
beyond land redistribution and aims at securing the emergence of viable new
production units, intended to be instruments capable of achieving the produc-
tion targets set under the Development Plan (Annex 1).
4.        Reflecting this comprehensive approach, the provisions of Decreto
Ley No. 17716 apply not only to lands expropriated under the law, but also
to idle and abandoned lands, land under public ownership and areas reclaimed
and improved for agricultural productions under State-financed irrigation



ANNEX 2
Page 2
and drainage schemes. In addition to concentration of land ownership
("latifundio") and fragmentation of holdings ("minifundio"), legal justifí-
cation for expropriation of land is created by the abandonment or inefficient
management of lands, and by the existence of anti-social or feudatory land
use systems or of unjust or unlawful labor conditions.
5.        The maximum permitted owner-operated land holdings are:
(a)  Coastal Region Arable Farms
150 ha of cultivated irrigated lands or
300 ha of non-irrigated land.
Livestock Units
1,500 ha of natural pasiture.
(b) Sierra
Arable Farms
varying from 15 to 55 ha of cultivated irrigated lands
according to district, or
varying from 30 to 110 ha of cultivated non-irrigated
lands according to district.
Livestock Units
the area necessary to support 5,000 head of sheep at
shearing time.
6.        In all categories, these limits may be substantially increased
(provided the public interest allows) where specified technical conditions
have been met, including the payment of wages at least 10% higher than legal
minimum rates, compliance with social legislation requirements and the opera-
tion of profit sharing schemes. Equally, the limits may be reduced or can-
celled when labor regulations have not been observed.
7.        Agro-industrial complexes (such as sugar plantations and mills)
are to be taken over as units under conditions to ensure the continuity of
management and operations. The law makes special provision for the concen-
tration of small holdings (minifundio) into viable family units and for the
regulation of leasehold agreements and of agro-industrial contracts, involv-
ing the supply of agricultural raw material to processing industries.
8.        While compensation for land and fixed assets expropriated is based
on previous tax declarations and assessments, livestock and permanent planta-
tions are assessed on a current market price basis. In compensation for ex-
propridted property, the former owner is entitled to receive payment in cash
and bonds on the following bases.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(a) efficient owner operated farms -- up to S/. 100,000 in
cash and the balance in Class "A" bonds bearing interest
at 6% per annum and repayable over 20 years;
(b)  inefficient owner operated units and rented lands -- up
to SI. 50,000 in cash and the balance in Class "B" bonds
bearing ínterest at 5% per annum and repayable over 25
years;
(e) indirectly cultivated or idle lands -- up to S/. 25,000
in cash and the balance in Class "C" bonda bearing interest
at 4% and repayable over 30 years;
(d) livestock compensation ls paid ln cash; and
(e)  capital equipment compensation is paid ín cash up
to a limit of S/. 1,000,000, and the balance ín bonds
of the appropriate Class.
9.        Under Decreto Ley No. 17716, the authorized limit for the issue of
all classes of Agrarian Debt Bonds ls SI. 15,000 million. The bonds are non-
negotiable, carry the guarantee of the State and, together with their lnterest,
are exempt from taxes. Payment of annual amortizations and interest is made
ín cash up to a limit (currently about SI. 25,000) varying with the cost of
living index and the balance in shares (valued at market prices) ín industrial
enterprises which are to be supplied by the Banco Industrial del Peru. Agrarian
Debt Bonds of all classes are to be accepted at their nominal value when ac-
companied by an equal cash payment for investment for a minimum period of 10
years in a duly qualified industrial enterprise.
10.       The Banco de Fomento Agropecuario del Peru (BFA), as the trustee
for Agrarian Debt Bonds, acts as agent for interest and amortízation payments
as well as for the collection of payments to be made by beneficiaries of the
land reform in settlement of the agreed purchase price.
Methods of Implementation
11.       Main responsibility and powers for the execution of the land re-
distribution provisions of the law are vested in the Direccion General de
Reforma Agraria y Asentamiento Rural (DGRA y AR) under the Ministry of Agri-
culture.
12.       As part of the Governnment's decentralízation policy, Peru has been
divided into 12 agrarian zones (cee Map), intended to correspond as far as
possible with geographical regions, although other consideratíons (notably
conmunications) have had to be taken into account.  In consequence, although
Zones I to VII cover the coastal regíon, they also include some of the Sierra
and even, in the case of Zone II, a portion of the Selva. Zones X, XI and
XII constitute the bulk of the Sierra and Zones XIII and IX most of the Selva.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
13.       In each agrarian zone, all branches of the Ministry of Agriculture,
including the Agrarian Reform branch, come under the control of the director
of the zone, who is responsible for the planning and execution of the agrí-
cultural development of the zone in accordance with the targets and guidelines
set out in the National Development Plan. The speed and scope of land reform
actions is thus coordinated with the general development of the zone.
14.       Land reform actions involve the following main four processes:
(a) Declaration of an 'Agrarian Reform Zone". When zonal plans
have been finalized for the restructuring and resettlement
of an area (which may be the whole agrarian zone or a speci-
fied part of it), taking all factors into account, a Supreme
Decree is pronulgated declaring the area to be an "Agrarian
Reform Zone."
(b) Expropriation. Once an Agrarian Reform Zone has been
so declared, detailed expropriation plans are published
and affected owners have an opportunity to submit obser-
vations on the proposals. After these have been con-
sidered, the Zonal branch of the DGRA y AR announces its
decision in a resolution, which has subsequently to be
confirmed by Supreme Decree.  Streamlined procedures
for land acquisition compel awners to supply maps, titles                  e
and other papers on demand. Appeals are limited to com-
pensation issues and are not permitted to delay expropria-
tion procedures.
(c) Interim Arrangements. Between their expropriation and
transfer to new owners, holdings may be and usually are
managed by Administrative Committees. These are of
two kinds:
(1)  Special Committees.  These consist of Government
officials and representatives of the workers,
have all the necessary legal powers to carry
on the operation of the holding, are expected to
assist in the process of determining the appropri-
ate form of organization for the new unit and can
operate for up to a maximum period of two years.
(ií) Provisional Committees. These are formed where it
ls considered necessary to make a provisional land
transfer. Such committees are made up of not more
than five or less than three workers, have the same
powers as special committees and may not operate
for more than two years and lead up to a definitive
transfer to the type of cooperative organization
eventually chosen for the unit.



ANNNEX 2
Page 5
(d)  Transfer of Ownership.  Expropriated land may be transferred
by the DGRA y AR to various forms of cooperative and
Sociedades Agricolas de Interes Social (SAIS) and to qualified
individuals or family farm units, under integrated rural set-
tlement projects (PIAR). Beneficiaries contract to purchase
the new holdings at an economic price payable in 20 annual
instalments with up to five years of grace.
15.       Beneficiaries under the land reform are given preference in the
provision of technical assistance from the various departments of the Ministry
of Agriculture and of credit supplied through the State banking system. At
the same time, this assistance is provided within the context of and to attain
the production targets laid down in regional development plans.  Private
arrangements to redistribute land holdings are encouraged, provided they are
carried out with the approval of the DGRA y AR.
16.       To deal expeditiously with all disputes arising from the implemen-
tation of the land reform, a special branch of the judiciary has been esta-
blished, consisting of a land judge in each agrarian zone and an agrarial
tribunal, acting as a final court of appeal.
Cooperative Organizations
17.       Of the 361 cooperatives registered up to the end of 1969, some 227
are still in existence. All of these represent voluntary associations under
standard-type cooperative legislation (e.g. Ley General No. 15260 of 1964)
formed mainly for such purposes as bulk buying of inputs, processing, storage
and marketing.  Some of these cooperatives (notably rice milling cooperatives)
have been successful, but the overall "casualty rate` (37%) has been high,
although land reform has adversely affected many of these cooperatives.  Many
had disappeared before 1969 because they were ill-defined from the beginning,
had no leadership and their members were initially only thinking of taking
advantage of the then comperative law which provided some subsidies.
18.       Under land reform legislation (principally Decreto Ley No. 17716
and Decreto Supremo 240-69-AP of November 4, 1969), new kinds of cooperative
organizations were set up for the dual purpose of restructuring agrarian
society and implementating agricultural development plans.  Although the
basic rules applying to these new organizations are essentially cooperative
in character (their standard organizational structure is as shown at Table 3),
their autonomy is strictly limited. Not only are they subject to the over-
riding control of the zonal authorities in production planning and control,
but in the first stage of their existence, under the supervision of Govern-
ment advisers, the directing bodies have been appointed rather than elected
and the employment of technical managers has been controlled.  In addition,
the distribution of annual net profits has to conform to the following con-
ditions:
(a)  not less than 10% to the Reserve Fund;
(b) not less than 5% to the Education Fund;



ANNEX 2
Page 6
(c) not less than 10% to the Social Provision Fund;
(d)  not less than 15% to the Investment Fund;
(e)  not less than 5% to the Cooperative Development Fund;
Note: allocations under (a) - (e) may not exceed 70% of
the net annual profits.
(f)  interest payment not exceeding 2% per annum on members'
contributions; and
(g)  the resultant balance is distributed amongst members
according to time worked or use made of the services of
the cooperative; not less than 25% will be compulsorily
capitalized and added to the members' share holding and
the balance paid in cash.
19.       The following are the types of cooperative organization set up
under the land reform legislation:
(a)  Production Cooperatives  (Cooperativas Agrarias de Produccion).
These are associations for exploitation of the land in
common, where the land and all other related property                       e
(livestock, installations, equipment and plant) belongs
to the cooperative and there are no individual rights of
ownership. This type of cooperative has been formed to
take over the sugar plantation complexes and other large
estates expropriated in the coastal region. In addition
to the agricultural workers of such estates, industrial
workers and management staff are eligible for membership.
(b)  Minifundio Land Consolidation Cooperatives (Cooperativas
Agrarias de Integracion Parcelaria) In areas where minifundio
problems exist, these are formed with the object of establish-
ing viable production units. Members transfer to the coopera-
tive either property rights in all or part of their land or
the right of usage over it as their contribution to the co-
operative funds, under terms authorized by the DGRA y AR.
Thereafter the exploitation of the whole area is on a common
basis, with priority for working on the cooperative land
given to those who have given up all their land.
(c)  Service Cooperatives (Cooperativas Agrarias de Servicios).
The object of these cooperatives is to supply services to
their members, particularly in such fields as input supply
(fertiíizers, machinery equipment, credit, irrigation, and the
like), marketing, storage and processing. M-embership of ser-
vice cooperatives is limited to owners of holdings of land not              l



ANNEX 2
Page 7
e
exceeding three times the size of the family unit (i.e. 45 ha
in the coast and 90 ha in the Sierra) and not employlng more
than six permanent workers.
(d)  Communal Cooperatives (Cooperativas Comunales).  There are
intended to be the eventual socio-economic structure for the
peasant communities in the Sierra. They will take over the
existing community lands and those added to them under the
agrarian reform and provide organizations for their exploita-
tion in comon and for the provision of common services.
(e)  Sociedades Agricolas de Interes Social (SAIS).  Under the
agrarian reform legislation, the DGRA y AR may, whenever
necessary, authorize the establishment of these looser forms
of pre-cooperative; this concept has, in fact, been applied
where large extensive ranches have been expropriated in the
Sierra. Cooperative membership of each SAIS is made up of the
communities surrounding the production unit, together with
the cooperative of the production unit (usually the ex-
propriated hacienda).
(f)  Central Cooperatives (Centrales de Cooperativas).  All the
organizations described in sub-paras (a) through (e) above
_may form second-degree or central cooperatives in order to
procure supplies, market and process products, conduct credit
transactions aud organize other common services for their
affiliated bodies. The most important of these Central Co-
operatives is the Central de Cooperativas Agrarias de Pro-
duccion Azucareras (CECOAAP), which effectively controls the
operational and planning policy of the 12 expropriated sugar
estates in the coastal region.
20.       As already stressed, all the new cooperative organizations are re-
quired to work within the framework of the production development plans and
must do so to qualify for preference in the supply of inputs, such as water
under the new water laws, and credit from the State banking system. In
addition, from the administrative and financial point of view, they are subject
to the controls imposed by cooperative legislatíon. Previously, these controls
were exercised by the National Office for Cooperative Development (Oficina
Nacional de Desarollo Cooperativo - ONDECOOP), an autonomous agency under
the Prime Mlinister's office, by the National Center for Cooperative Training
(Centro Nacional de Capacitacion Cooperativa - CENACOOP); and by the Coopera-
tive Auditors (Auditores de Cooperativas - AUDICOOP). In 1971, when the
Sistema Nacional de Apoyo a la Mobilizacion Social (SINAMOS) was created as
a special arm of the administration to promote public participation in the
development process, these organizations were transferred to its control, and
under Decreto Ley 19352 of April 4, 1972, their functions were integrated in
the new SINAMOS organization. Administrative and accounting control of
cooperatives now vests with the Direccion General de Apoyo Externo of ONAMOS

Progress in Land Reform
21.       As of August 31, 1972, .the following position had been reached in
implementing the land reform measures:
Percentage of
Target as stated
Expropriations                                in National Plan
Number of holdings
expropriated                    2,169                8.3%
Land (in ha)                4,228,439               33.4%
Compensation (in S/.
Million)                       7,405              41.0%
Allocations to new owners
Land (in ha)                2,356,480               18.5%
Number of families
involved                     102,325              30.5%
The compensation figure given above (SI. 7,405 million = US$191 million) re-
lates to land and installations only and was paid 5% in cash, 35% in "A" bonds,
46% in "B" bonds and 14% in "C" bonds (para 8 above). In addition, SI. 1,115
million (US$29 million) had been paid in cash for more than 1.5 million live-
stock expropriated. Estimates of the total cost of completing the land reform
vary greatly and the figure of SI. 18,050 million (US$466 million) is pro-
bably on the low side. To it, in any case, has to be added livestock compen-
sation costs (estimated at S/. 4,600 million (US$119 million) and administra-
tion costs, projected for the period 1971-75 at S/. 1,992 million (US$51 mil-
lion).
22.       In terms of land, therefore, one-third of the "expropriable" area
has been taken over.  However, within this average for the country as a whole,
there are considerable regional variations (Table 4).   For example, in the
Sierra (Agrarian Zones X, XI, and XII) an area totalling 2,970,000 ha has
been expropriated, but half of this (1,470,000 ha) had already been taken
over under the earlier agrarian reform. The higher than average percentages
for the value of expropriated property in Zones II and III (Chiclayo and
Trujillo) is due to the fact that the larger sugar plantation complexes were
in this area.  In Zone VI (Arequipa), only 1.7% of the units have been ex-
propriated because the main problem is one of mínifundio, and the concentra-

tion of holdings, some as small as 0.3 ha, presents enormous social and admin-
istrative difficulties. On the other hand, in Zone I (Piura) nearly 58% of
"expropriable" holdings have already been taken over since, because of the
pressure of population and shortage of cultivable land, the Zonal policy is
to settle as many families as possible in new cooperative units.
23.       As regards allocations to new owners, from the detailed breakdawn
given in the following table, it will be seen that only 5.6% of the total
land affected under agrarian reform measures was transferred to individual
ownership, and the balance to the various forms of cooperative organizations
already described. The 11 SAIS (Sociedades Agricolas de Interes Social) and
the 12 sugar cooperatives together account for more than 50% of the land
transferred under agrarian reform. In the case of land settlement schemes,
the former policy accounts for the preponderance of individual onership; in
new schemes since 1969, however, cooperative organizations are being formed.

The figures in the last column headed "ha per family" show that, in the case
of production cooperatives, the size of an individual member's share in the
total cooperative land holding is less than 20 ha. When allowance is made
for the fact that the proportion of cultivated land to the total is about 12%
(para 33 below), it is clear that a policy of maximrnum settlement has been
followed, and these cooperatives can rightly be regarded as groupings of small
farmers.
24.       As of August 31, 1972, expropriations exceeded allocations by
1,872,000 ha.  Of this, some 700,000 ha represent unused land that will con-
tinue in Governnent ownership; the balance (1,172,000 ha) was under the
temporary administration of Special Committees and Provisional Committees
(para 14 (c)), and represents, in effect, what is in the "administrative
pipeline." This naturally varies according to the relative speed of the ex-
propriation and transfer processes. By October 12, 1972, this "pipeline`
amounted to 1,097,799 ha, made up as follows:
(i)  29 Special Committees administering 346 holdings covering
514,053 ha; and
(íi)  155 Provisional Committees, covering 13,352 families on
583,746 ha.
25.       What has been, by any standards, a major restructuring of Peruvian
agriculture, with the largest units and one-third of the land in the coastal
and Sierra regions already affected, has been carried through without any
apparent adverse effect on production in 1970 and 1971, even when due allow-
ance is made for other factors (such as climate and world prices) (Annex 1).
26.       In this respect, the results of the 12 sugar cooperatives operating
under the control of the Central de Cooperativas Agrarias de Produccion Azucare-
ras del Peru (CECOAAP) are most striking. In 1971, the 8.3 miillion tons sugar-
cane milled was a record; the area cultivated (83,575 ha) had risen to pre-
1967 levels; and sugar production (913,274 tons) was 18.9% above the aver-
age for the five years 1967-71. Yields at 120.6 tons of cane per ha per
year and mill extraction rates at 92.82% were the highest for the past five
years. Here, too, production was undoubtedly favored by good climatie condi-
tions, but the all-round improvement is a tribute to the smoothness of the
take-over of the sugar estates immediately after the passing of the land reform
law (24 June 1969) and to the technical management provided, both on the estates
and at CECOAAP.
27.       Thanks to these successful operations, the sugar cooperatives are
building up their financial resources. The coordination of their operations
by CECOAAP enables them to reduce to a minimum their dependence on external
sources for short-term loans. Again under centralized planning and super-
vision by CECOAAP, the sugar cooperatives are investing in much-needed plant
replacement (some suppliers credit has been obtained for this purpose) and                 w
have a livestock diversification plan, involving 30 individual projects in

Page 11
1973-75, at an estimated total cost of SI. 284 million (US$7.3 million), for
which they intend to contribute 20% from their awn resources and borrow the
balance from the BFA under the proposed project. At present, the more pros-
perous cooperatives are providing financial assistance to the "poorer` units --
thus givíng tangible expression to the theme of mutual aid that is underlined
in the National Development Plan.  It should, hawever, be stressed that, out-
side the sugar cooperatives, no comparable form of central or second-tier
organization as yet exists.
Future Trends
28.       Land Reform.  In the light of experience, there has already been
some scaling down of the targets for future land reform operations. Against
the 25,886 units covering nearly 12 million ha expected to be expropriated
by December 31, 1975, according to the National Development Plan 1971-75,
revised projections (as of October 18, 1972) set lower targets of 9,552 units
covering 9,830,000 ha (Annexes 2 to 5). In units, the main reductions are in
Agrarian Zones VI (Arequipa) and VII (Taena) at the southern end of the coast-
al region, while there are also notable falls in area targets in Zones IV
(Lima) and VII (Taena).
2°.       The following table sets out the actual and latest projections of
land expropriations, according to information supplied by the DORA y AR:

/3 Projections.
e



ANNEX 2
Page 12                   U
Against the projections of 1,355 units and 1,093,000 ha to be expropriated in
calendar year 1972, during the first eight months (January to August), ex-
propriations covered only 659 units and 553,000 ha, which casts some doubt on
the validity of the revised projections.
30.       It would appear that the agrarian reform process is necessarily
entering a new phase. During the initial períod, action was concentrated on
a small number of large units and the success achieved so far owes much to
the facc that "going concerns" were taken over and their technical management
maintained (as in the case of the sugar plantations and other large estates
in the coastal region and the large cattle and sheep ranches in the Sierra).
This is borne out by the fact that the average size of the units expropriated
up to August 31, 1972, was 6,500 ha. Even on the basis of the revised targets,
the average size of the unit to be expropriated between September 1, 1972 and
December 31, 1975, is 750 ha. Taking the average distribution for the country
as a whole, such a holding can be expected to be made up of:
ha
Irrigated-cultivated land             45
Non-irrigated cultivated land         75
Natural pastures                     405
Other                                225
Total:       750
Even af ter allowance is made for the effect of minifundio on this average,
it seems clear that the land reform process is nearing a stage where it will
be dealing principally with large numbers of medium-size farmers. In such
cases, not only are the expropriation procedures more numerous (and more
difficult when partial expropriation is involved), but there is also a
formidable administrative task in forming a new cooperative for what is
essentially a new unit and area of production, as well as in ensuring that
it has the right management and technical assistance.
31.       At the other end of the scale, where minifundio is the main problem
as, for example, in Arequipa, progress in the integration of small holdings
is necessarily slow. It depends not merely on the redistribution of such
holdings but also on the provision of alternative employment (either in land
settlement schemes or in other sectors than agriculture) for those for whom
no work can be provided in the new integrated production unit.
32.       In a recent statement, the Minister of Agriculture stressed that
99% of the expropriations have been from farmers larger than 150 ha and that
already 4,000 ha of land in the 10 to 150-ha unit range have been declared
"unaffected" by the land reform as against 17,252 ha expropriated from the              e

same range of holdings.  There are indications that, by the end of 1972, land
reform in the coastal region will be regarded as completed. On the other
hand, there are demands for the process to be speeded up particularly where
there is pressure for the settlement of more familles on the land.  H,wever,
in addition to the growing administrative complicatíons already mentiened,
there are other factors that may well be taken into account.  Indirectly, the
agrarian reform has already encouraged a number of voluntary land transfers
and it has forced medium-síze farmers to comply with social and labor legis-
lation, notably in the provision of housing and in the operation of profit-
sharing schemes.  In other words, some of the main aíms of the agrarían re-
forms are being achieved without resort to expropriation and redistribution
of land.
33.       The following table compares expropriatíons in the various categories
of land:

Total:       12.677        100                  4,228         100
Unfortunately, no breakdown by land category is avallable for the projections
of expropriations, but it is considered that they will be roughly proportionate
to the classification of total expropriable land, as they have been in the
past.
34.       As of August 31, 1972, 526,000 ha of cultivated land had been expro-
priated out of a total of 2,189,000 ha, so that 76% still remained in the hands
of individual owners. Should the revised projections of expropriations set
out  in para 29 be achíeved, this proportion will have dropped to about 25% by
the end of 1975.  If in practice land reform progresses at a slower rate, then
the proportion remaining in the hands of individual farmers by the end of 1975
may well be between one-third and one-half.
35.       Cooperatives.  At the outset, two general points need to be stressed.
Tle first is that the cooperative organizations being established under the
e



ANNEX 2
Page 14
agrarian reform are not so much cooperatives as "self-governing units"
(empresas autogestionarías). As such, they form an integral part in the
highly planned and supervised structure that has been set up to achieve the
agricultural produiction targets set out in the National Development Plan.
Second, this framework has its ideological origins in the patterns of Inca
society 1/. In this lies its appeal to and likely acceptance by all levels
in the pyramidical structure, including the workers who form its base.
36.        . of August 31, 1972, out of the total of 202 production coopera-
tives 2/, 68 were concerned with land settlement and 134 had been formed to
take over 868,000 ha under the land reform, giving an average unit size of
6,500 ha. This, of course, reflects what has been described above as the
first phase of the land reform, i.e., the period during which large `going
concerns" (like the sugar plantations and, more recently, the vineyards in
the Ica zone) have been taken over in their entirety and reconstituted as
cooperatives, with virtually the same technical management as under their
previous owners.
37.       With this class of cooperative, the main problem is one of the
relationship between the workers and the technicians. In certain cases,
there have been considerable difficulties and friction, leading to the re-
signation of numbers of technicians, including 173 in the sugar cooperatives.
But the success, already noted, of these units suggests that such difficulties
are being overcome. The workers and their representatives on the various
cooperative committees are being "educated" in the need to pay proper salaries
to technicians and there are crash programs for the training of both management
and supervisory personnel, operated by the National Center for Agrarian Reform
Research and Training (Centro Nacional de Capacitacion e Investigacion de
Reforma Agraria - CENCIRA) with UNDP assistance, and by the National Center
for Cooperative Training (CENACOOP), now part of SINAMOS (para 23).
38.       As the land reform enters its second phase, the problems of forming
and managing new cooperatives will deepen because members will increas-
ingly include previously independent farmers who may well be less adaptable
to outside control than the labor forces of the latifundio. Under the land
reform administration, much time and care is taken to ensure that the right
kind of cooperative organization is chosen for a given situation and in the
choice of its first leaders. Despite the undoubted enthusiasm of the admlni-
strative staffs and the emphasis being placed on training and education, it
would seem that the present rate of formation of production cooperatives (about
50 per year) cannot be increased, since to do so would risk the lowering of
standards of operating efficiency, which would be contrary to Government's
policy. This factor constitutes a further constraint on the speed at which
future land reform operations can be executed.

39.       A limited number (about 20) of new service cooperatives have been
formed since the implementation of the agrarian reform. If, however, the
future trend is a slowing down in the projected rate of expropriation, then
this might well be accompanied by measures encouraging individual farmers
to form service cooperatives for the supply of inputs (fertilizer, credit and
machinery) and for marketing and processing. Here too, there would be problems
of management and supervision, ao past experience in Peru has shown (para 17
and Annexes 5 and 8).
40.       Taking all the above factors into account, it is estimated that,
by the end of 1975, the number of cooperatives in existence, by catégory,
is likely to be as follows:
1. Production Cooperatives
(a)  formed under Land Reform operations
(50 per year for six years)                  300
(b) formed under Settlement Schemes

3.  Communal Cooperatives                               80
4. Service Cooperatives

Total:                 700
Implications for Agricultural Credit
41.       Under the old agrarian structure, the large private estates were,
in general, able to finance their operations and meet their investirent needs
out of their own resources or by borrowing from commercial banks, while the
main source of short- and long-term credit for small and medium size farmers
was the Banco de Fomento Agropecuario (BFA). As a result of the major changes
in the agrarian structure already made by the land reform, however, this pat-
tern has been radically altered.  The new cooperatives that have taken over



ANNEX 2
Page 16
the large estates are dependent upon the BFA for both short- and long-term
credit and, under Government policy, receive preference in the provision of
scarce long-term funds.  This trend is illustrated by the figures for BFA
crop lending given below:

42.       Moreover, the implementation of the land reform has meant deferment
of most intended investments. In the case of the new cooperatives, their
first task was to ensure that current operations were maintained and they are
only now beginning to implement new investment programs. For instance, as
already mentioned in para 27, the sugar cooperatives have a livestock and
processing diversification program for 1973-75 involving investments total-
ling S/. 284 million (US$7.3 million). In the case of Individual farmers,
in order to avoid a prolonged state of uncertainty, the Government intends to
decide by end 1972 which properties will be subject to expropriation in the
key areas in the coastal region, where, on account of demographic pressures
and social tensions, land reform implementation has priority. Those not af-
fected will be given certificates of "inafectacion" and the issue of such
certificates has already started.  This should lead to a growing demand for
medium- and long-term credit, particularly from medium-size farmers wishing
to invest in land improvement (irrigation, drainage, levelling, and such), in
mechanization and in livestock development. Those whose holdings have been
reduced in size are likely to be forced to intensify ín order to maintain
their previous income levels, while the rise in effective wage rates, because
of the standards set in the cooperatives, is providing an additional incentive
to mechanization.



ANNEX 2
Page 17
.
43.       The creditworthiness of the new cooperatives, both production and
service, will depend upon the extent to which they have been able to bulild
up reserves for investment and have demonstrated their capacity for efficient
management. Those production cooperatíves formed out of existing enterprises
are more likely to be able to accumulate investment reserves than those formed
ab novo, as the sugar cooperatives have already shown. Both types, however,
are subject to legal restrictions as to the proportion of any annual surplus
that may be allocated for investment (para 18) and both have, after a maxi-
mum grace period of five years, to meet annual instalments in payment of the
agreed price of their land. 1/
44.       As regards management, again it is the cooperative formed to take
over an existing enterprise that has the advantage because of the relative
ease of ensuring continuity of technical management. For this reason, it
will be necessary to examine closely the farm development plans and to assess
the capability of the management at the time of appraisal of all loans to
production cooperatives.
1/   As of March 31, 1972, the sugar cooperatives had already paid to the
BFA SI. 236 million (US$6 million) in such instalments.

Production
1.        In 1970, dairy milk production totalled approxinately 600,000 tons 1/,
31% of which was produced from intensive dairy installations in the coastal
and Sierra (highland) regions and 69% from cattle mostly owned by small farmers
(prior to the land reform) in the Sierra.  The estimated total of cows in milk
was 700,000. About one-half of this milk production is used to mnake cheese
and butter, particularly in the Sierra where antiquated processing predomi-
nates; the other half is consumed as milk, either evaporated, processed or
fresh. Much of this milk production is consumed within the subsistence eco-
nomy that characterizes the Sierra.
2.        Dairy units supplying the main population centers in the coastal
region utilize high-yielding milk cattle such as Holstein and Brown Swiss
with good average yields. Most are stabled continuously, and fed on chopped
green maize, sorghum, maize stover, and silage, with molasses, rice bran and
cotton seed cake as concentrates; in the southern coastal region, however,
dairy cattle are normally tethered and grazed on irrigated alfalfa. Produc-
tion in the Sierra is based on dual-purpose native breeds, with low yields
and short lactation period (180 to 200 days).
3.        Production fipures given in Annex 1, Table 1, show' an uneven growth
in milk production (10% per annum fromn 1960 to 1964, then stagnation at about
the 759,000-ton level between 1966 and 1969, followed by spurts to 830,000
tons and 897,000 tons in 1970 ancl 1971 respectively).  This unevenness is
probably due to statisticnl vagaries and production is more likely to have
grown at a steady rate of about 4% per annum over the past decade. In any
event, it was insufficient to meet denand during the period 1965 to 1969,
when imports of milk products averaged 20,000 tons and butter imports aver-
aged 9,000 tons. Both import categories were reduced considerably in 1970
and 1971 under stricter Government controls (Table 1).

Development Pros pects
4.        The National Developrment Plan 1971-1975 projected a production in-
crease for milk of the order of 10%, but revised estimates suggest that an-
nual growth rate will be about 2.5 percent.  Thus the need for imports seems
certain to continue, but the future trend depends much on whether the higher
produiction levels of 1970 and 1971 are sustained.
5.        In the Sierra (a major producing area), stocking rates are already
iigh and the bulk of t'ne cattle Is in the hands of smnall producers hardly
emerging from a subsistence economv.  To sPeed Up this process, such farmers
are being organized3 in various forms of cooperative and community units
(Annex 2), to facilitate extension efforts and the spread of new technology,
such as dairy production based on irrigated pastures of ryegrass and white
clover, as demonstrated by the work of the FAO/IVITA 1/ project at Huancayo.
Because of the inherent difficulties, however, such developments are unlikely
to show imiiediate results.
6.        In the short term, the best prospects of increasing milk production
lie in tlhe expansion of the stall-fed herds in the northern and central coastal
areas anci in the dairy cattle grazed on irrigated pastures and in the Andean
vallevs of the Sierra.
Prices and 1larketing 
7.        Controls are imposed on milk prices with varying effectiveness.
Industrial plants pay on the basis of a controlled price of SI. 5.00 per litre,
wvith variations according to quality (butterfat content) and deductions for
collection costs. Elsewhere, particularly near urban centers on the coast,
the official producer and retail prices for fresh milk are frequently exceeded.
Five major milk processing plants, not all working to full capacity, are al-
ready in existence; and plans exist for the establishment of nine more plants
in new areas of production.  Although, there is much room for inprovement in
present milk marketing system (Annex 5), it should be able to handle the
additional production to be generated by the Project without difficulty. In
addition, some of the agro-industrial investment under the project is ex-
pected to be used for milk processing (Annex 8).
Project Considerations
8.        It is expected that, under the Project, investrnents in dairy produc-
tion would be made in all three regions of Peru, but principally in the Andean
valleys where there are major concentrations of milk cattle. Here and in the
southern coastal zone, small farmers with no more than 10 animals are likely
to be the maln sub-borrowers. Therefore, a model has been developed based on
a small farm of 15 ha of pasture, of which 7.5 ha would be renewed completely
by sowing grass and clovers and the remaining 7.5 ha would be improved by
resowing and fertilizing.  Part of the investrnent cost involved in pasture
improvement would be for land preparation, plowing, and such and appears under             e
the heading of "machinery."

9.         Other projected investments ínclude fencing to divide the grazing
land into small plots to permít pasture rotatíon and a 50% increase in the
stocking capaclty (to 1.5 animal units per ha); constructions to facílítate
herd handling; the purchase of cows and a pure-bred bull (or, alternatively
artificial insemination). With these improvements, coupled with the supplemen-
tary use of concentrates and better management, the farm would reach full pro-
duction of milk and animals in the seventh year, when yields of milk per year
and per lactation period should rise to 3.660 liters.
B. Meat
Background
10.       The demand for meat in Peru has long exceeded national production
and imports to fill the gap more than doubled between 1965 and 1969 (6,400 tons
of beef and 3,900 tons of mutton in 1965 against 14,000 tons of beef and 8,300
tons of mutton in 1969) 1/. According to the latest projections, the total
demand for meat is expected to continue expanding at a rate of about 5.5% per
annum.
11.       Within these aggregate figures, however, changes in the pattern of
consumption have already taken place. As the following table shows, between
1961 and 1970, beef's declining share of total expenditure on animal proteina
was compensated for by rises in the proportiona of poultry meat and fish.
Pork and mutton registered small increases in quantities consumed but, in
term8 of money their shares of total consumption declined.

ANNEX 3
Page 4
Furthermore, Government's policy of limiting beef imports and reducing con-
sumption through tlhe imposition of "meatless" days is likely,to accentuate
these trends (Annex 5). It is against this general background therefore,
that the prospects for each of the major types of livestock production in-
cluded in the project are examined.
Beef Cattle
12.       Production.  The production figures given in Table 1 show an uneven
upward grawth from 1960 to 1971 at an average annual rate of 1%. But these
statistics are based on registered slaughterings and the higher levels of
1970 and 1971 may be partly attributable to the effects of the land reforn.
Under the National Development Plan, production increases of the order of 7%
per annum were Drojected, but these targets are being revised downwards and
the new rate suggested is 4.8%.
13.       Of the total national herd, estimated at abotut 3.5 millíon, nearly
three-quarters are concentrated in the central and southern Sierra. Current
policies impose price ceilings only on meat from animals three years of age
and older, thus encouraginc the sale of younger animals at hip,her prices to
feed-lot operators in the coastal region. This is more economic than continu-
ing to range-fed old steers in the Sierra and the operation could be further
encouraged by strengthening the marketing facilities for the purchase of                 e
young animals.-
14.       Beef cattle fattening in feed lot operations on the coast has been
stimu]ated by prices above the official control level (Annex 5). Constraints
to the expansion of the system, however, are shortage of good quality youn-
cattle and seasona1 shortages of cottonseed cake but there is scope for ex-
panding the feed base by using molasses and fishmeal, which is being intro-
dtuced by so-me sugar cooperatives. To take advantage of temporary pastures
which have appeared near Piura as a result of the abnorrmally heavy rains,
sone 40,000 heifers and 16,000 steers are being imported under a Government
scheme that is intended to help increase the supply of cattle for fattening.
15.       Beef cattle production will undoubtedly provide one of the main
bases for the development of the Selva and some schemes are already being
starteÉd both by Government and private enterprise.
16.       Project Considerations.  Beef production in Peru is based on a
mixed breeding systems in the Sierra and on feed lot production in the coastal
region, utilizing all types of cattle, principally native and dairy breeds.
Specialized beef cattle types are bred and fattened in the north of the coun-
try anrl in the Selva.  There is a denand for medíum-and long-term credit to
extend and intensifv al.l these operations, particularly production of beef
cattle in the Sierra and Selva.
17.       A farm operating under conditions similar to tliose found in the
Selva has been chosen to serve as an illustrative model, but with minor va-              e
riations, it would be applicable for other regions. Investrent costs in this



ANNEX 3
Page 5
model include the establishment of new and improvement of existing pastures
(utilizing fertilizers and legumes), machinery to maintain them in optimum
condition and purchase of good quality breeding stock. The size of the farm
is considered to be 110 ha, capable of susstainíng 164 animal units (1.5
AU/ha). At full development, from the eighth year, when annual production
would level out at 26 fattened steers from 24 to 40 months old weighing 400 kg;
14 replacement heifers of various ages; and nine culled cows of 400 kg weight.
With the proposed investments and improved management it should be easy to
reach these targets, giving calf crops of 70%.
Sheep
18.       Production.  Between 1964 and 1971, mutton production grew at only
a little over 1% per annum to reach 23,600 tons, whereas imports increased
from 5,100 tons to 8,800 tons. Of the estimated total production of 10,000
tons of wool, some 2,500 tons were used in the cottage industry, 2,000 tons
in the Peruvian woollen industries, and the balance (5,500 tons) exported.
19.       The total number of sheep in Peru is estimated at above 17 million,
the bulk of which is grazed extensively on natural pastures especially in
the central and southern Sierra. Under the land reform, new forms of
cooperative and community organizations have taken over the large sheep
haciendas and it i through these new units that it is hoped present produc-
tion methods will be improved, particularly under Programs of Direct Action
(Programas de Accion Directa) in Zones IV, VI, X and XII. Revised product-
ion projections for 1973/74 put the annual rates of increase at 4.8% for
mutton and 1.6% for wool.
20.       Prolect Consideratíons.  It is considered that loans for sheep de-
velopment under the Project will be relatively few, mainly because, in the
chief sheep-growing areas (the central and southern Sierra) and elsewhere,
the BFA has access to other sources of funds, such as the recent IDB loan, to
finance the cooperative organizations involved. Nevertheless, some demand
may arise from individual or cooperative enterprises in Zones V, VI and VII
to which the IDB loan does not apply. The investments involved are not ex-
pected to be large, however, no special sheep farm model has been prepared.
zims
21.       Production.  After a rapid expansion in the 1950's, national produc-
tion of píg meat grew only at 1% per annum between 1960 and 1970 to a total
of 46,500 tons, but it jumped in 1971 to 53,600 tone in response to higher
prices following the shortage of red meat. Imports of pig meat are negligible.
22.       Operations in the pig industry consist of:  (i) commercial inten-
sive units on the coast, utilizing imported strains and supplying Lima and the
other main urban centers; (ii) extensive rearing of native breeds in the
Sierra mainly for auto-consumption; and (iMi) a growing production in the
Selva. The present national herd includes nearly 2 million. A 6.6% annual
growth rate has been forecast, involving mainly expansion in the commercial
sector, but this will call for better conversion ratios and at least mainten-
ance, if not improvement, of current feed/selling price relationships.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
23.       Project Consíderations.  As far as pigs are concerned, Government
policy favors the development of vertically integrated enterprises that in-
clude meat processing so as to extend the overall market for fresh pork and
raise consumption levels.  The farm model in Annex 14 is based on a herd of
315 sows, subdivided into three production lines of 105 sows each, utilizing
buildings specially designed and constructed for intensive-type operations.
Production would be not less than 4,000 pigs of 100 kg liveweight, some of
which would be processed in the sausage factory to be built as the second
stage of the sub-project.
24.       In view of the scale of operations involved, this type of pig pro-
duction would likely be undertaken only by cooperative units, with the trust
of such loans probably going to sugar cooperatives to support their livestock
diversification prograns.  The central organization for the sugar cooperatives
(CECOAAP) has the necessary technical resources to ensure proper planning and
management of proposed pig production units.
Poultry
25.       Production.  Commiercial production of poultry meat and eggs is con-
centrated near urban centers of the coastal region, which in 1970 accounted
for 96.5% and 67.5%, of total production respectively. In rural areas, some
poultry ís kept on free range to supply the farmer s own needs.  Within the
last decade, prodtlction of poultry meat and eggs has doubled reaching 53,600
tons and 30,000 tons respectively in 1971 1/, and imports have ceased. This
expansion took place entirely in the comntercial sector, with intensive pro-
duction based initially on imported strains and made poultry the fastest
growing component of the iivestock sector. The controlled prices for poultry
meat compare favorably with other meat prices and as a result, such produce
now accounts by value for 25% of total expenditure on animal protein (para 11).
26.       National Development Plan projections involve a further doubling
of poultry meat and egg production during the period 1971 to 1975, to help
counterbalance the slower rate of growth expected in the other livestock
sectors. Constraints on further expansion at this rate, however, include:
(a) a decline in feed quality in face of price controls on
millers' sales, despite maintenance of fixed price for
locally produced maize 2/;
(b) the need to import maize and other feedstuffs to supplement
national production; and
(c)  marketing deficiencies and the need for more slaughtering
and refrigerated storage capacity.
1/   Giving per capital consumption rates of 3.8 kg of poultry meat and 2.0 kg
for eggs.
2j   Of the 20 compound feed mills in Peru, four produce 85% of total output.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
27.       Proíect Considerations.  Under the diversification program for the
sugar cooperatives, the Central Agency for Supar Production Cooperatives
(Central de Cooperativas Agrarias de Produccion Azucarera - (CECOAAP)) is
planning to establish some vertically integrated units for the production of
both eggs and poultry neat. These units would be sited next to the intensive
pig units outlined in para 23 in order to share the samne infrastructure (roads,
water and power supply) and would include feed mills, slaughterhouse, and cold
storage and rmarketing facilities, as well as the poultrv production units.
Such enterprises would probably be considered, at least in Dart, as coning
under the category of agro-industrial investment for financing under the
Project.
28.       Because such projects are onlv identified and not prepared ín
detaíl and because their size and character would require that specific loan
applications be referred to the Bank for prior approval, no project model has
been prepared.
Llamas and Alpacas
29.       Production.  Fron an estimiated national flock of llamas and alpacas,
totalling 3 million, somie 1Q,000 tons of meat and 3,500 tons of hi¡h grade
wool is obtained. All the mneat and about 10% of the wool is consumed in the
proCucing areas, wbich are mainly in the central and soutihern Sierra.  Tle
rest of the x7ool is exported at a prpmium price because of its special quallties.
30.      lUnder the National Development Plan, it is hoped that production,
which has been stagnant, can be increased at the rate of 2.7% per annurm,
principally through the Introductlon of teclhnical improvements on the new
production units established under the lánd reform.
31.       Pro ect Considerations.  Almost all the llamas and alpacas are bred
in the altiplano of Agrarian Zones X, XI and XII, and Covernment funds have
been allocated for financing the cooperative organizations involved in their
production.  There may, hoT.zever, be a small demand for credit from other types
of producers and, for this reason, these animals have been included in the
livestock lending categorv.
C. Animal Health
Ceneral
32.       Livestock in Peru are afflicted by foot and mouth disease, swine
fever, liver fluke and some other diseases resulting from parasite infection.
The incidence rate ís being reduced, however, through regular protective
treatment encouraged by the veterinary service.
e



A.NEX 3
Page 8
33.  42.  In the daíry cattle industry, wide use is made of artfical in-
semination under services provided by both the Government and the private
Livestock Associations, although the latter are currently in the process of
reorganization.
Research
34.       Livestock research, together with the operation of breeding pro-
grams and demonstration farms, is carried out by IVITA, as well as by Govern-
ment research stations and the Agricultural University of La Nolina. Although
it covers all three natural regions of the country, the national research pro-
gram is giving special attention to the animal health problems of the Sierra,
where the largest potential for improvement exists. Recently, in view of the
likelihood of future livestock expansion in the Selva, research work in the
diseases of wild jungle animals that could be transmitted to cattle, sheep
and poultry has also been intensified. Under the National Development Plan
for 1971-1975, some 33 new agricultural research stations are to be estab-
lished on a regional basis and will include veterinary divisions wherever
livestock production is important.
Extension
35.       Livestock technical assistance services new form part of the
integrated organization of each Agrarian Zone 1/ and are backed up by the
speciaiísts at the Ministrv of Agriculture and the research stations. With
this strengthened and improved technical assistance, borrowers for livestock
investments under the Project should be able to prevent undue disease losses.

Annual Crop Production
General
1.        The crops to be discussed herein are not actually financed under
the Project but will benefit from investnents in mechanization, drainage,
and on-fari  improvements as described in Annex 6.  Major annual crops most
effected by the Project would be corn, cotton, potatoes, sorghum, and other
field crops. In the past, irrigated crop land in the coast that developed
salinity problems as a result of the high water table was abandoned for
other available land close by. Careless use of water aggravated the water
table problen and existing drainage facilities were, in most cases, not
maintained properly. Improper land leveling also accounted for excess water
use and loss. The salinity, high water table, and poor irrigation, plus a
low level, both in quantity and quality, of inputs such as seeds, fertilizers,
and insecticides, resulted in a poor productivity record.
Up qrading
2.        Backed up by agrarian reforxn and because it is aware that water
is the liniting factor in the expansion of agriculture in the very produc-
tive coastal area, Governrnent is taking steps to prevent poor utilization
of irrigation water. Farmers that do not increase their production to ac-
ceptable levels may lose their water allotments and their farms.  With these
incentives, plus the need for increased profits, farmers and cooperatives are
now prepared to make the needed capital investments to improve efficiency and
increase yields.
Crop Status
3.        Corn.  Corn was grown on about 374,000 ha in 1971, with about 46%
of the crop being irrigated. The average coastal yield was 3.2 tons per ha,
but with the use of hybrid seed and proper inputs, some farmers reported yields
of over 6 tons per ha. Corn, as well as other feed grains, are in short sup-
ply and Government promotes investments aimed at improving yields.  The aver-
age price received in the coastal area was S/. 3,500 per ton, which ls above
the equivalent world market price of S/. 2,600 per ton.
4.        Sorghum.  Sorghumn occupies some 7,500 ha, a re]atively s allU area
in Peru. About 76% of the crop is harvested for grain and the rest for
e



ANNEX 4
Page 2
fodder. Sorghunm can be used in double cropping with corn or two crops can
be taken by irrigating after the first harvest and letting the sorghum head
out again. Yields average 3.1 tons per ha, but, at research stations, they
have reached 4.2 tons per ha and yields should continue to rise. One of the
biggest problems has been the birds that eat the grain before it can be
harvested.  Prices paid to farmers for sorghum have been lower than those
paid for corn and amount to only S/. 2,800 per ton; however, the importance
of the crop as a foodgrain is expected to grow.
5.        Cotton.  Land farmed to cotton in 1971 totaled 136,000 ha, produc-
ing an average yield of 1.7 tons per ha. The long staple type, Tanguís, is
the mnost popular variety, with Pima next. The major portion of the crop is
grown under irrigation in the north and central coastal areas, but cotton
hectarage has been dropping steadily, with some 32,000 ha having gone out
of production over the 1969-71 period. Low prices and low yields are the
primre reasons for this decrease and even though prices have shown some im-
provenent recently (the average price was S/. 11,600 per ton in 1971), it
is expected that the amount of land devoted to cotton will continue to go
down.  Government, however, is interested in maintaining production for the
foreign exchange to be gained through export. In 1970, 73% of the crop was
exported and in 1971, 62%.
6.        Potatoes.  Potatoes occupied some 320,000 ha in 1971, with average
yields ranging fron 3.7 ton per ha at Ayacucho in the Sierra zoné wíthout
irrigation te 20 tons per ha at Lima and Callao in the coastal zone with
írrigation. The average price received in 1971 was S/. 2,290 per ton, and,
even though prices are set by the Governnent, large variations occur between
periods of over supply and short supply.
Farm Model
7.        The annual crop farm model (Annex 14, Table 2) is similar to some
of the farms found in the north and central coastal region where sorne water
table and salinity problemis exist. One-third of the land of the farm in the
model was not farmed because, In the past, it was easier to abandon land than
to correct the problens.  In addition, yields were affected on the remaining
land.  New, under the agrarian reform law, farmers are strongly encouraged
to reclaim or improve the land they are responsible for. Twentv percent of
the farTn required sub-surface drainage, at a cost of SI. 4,257 per ha; land
tevelilng xwould bp necessary on 30% of the farm, at a cost of S/. 9,675 per
ha- anc 5,000 mn of the main distribution dítch would be lined to eliminate
seep,ge, at a cost of S/. 120 per mi. As a resuilt of the reclamnation of
abandoned I.and and the need for better land utilization through double
cropping of sone crops, additional investment in tractors and implements
would be made. Cropping intensity, 91% before the investment, would in-
crease to 166% pt ful1 uroductioni. In tlie first year after investment, the
land brought back into production would prcbably yield less than that part
of the farm which was being used  but sone improvemrent could be expected e
in the yiclds the second year.  Then, in the third and fourth years, with



ANNEX 4
Page 3
e
increased levels of inputs, yields t7ould continue to increase, and, in the
fifth year, full production could be reached. Income values of full pro-
duction income used in the model were 35% the first year, 50% the second
year, 70% the third year, 90% the fourth, and full value the fifth year and
onward. The financial rate of return has been estinated at 39% over a 20-
year period, with reinvesttent for equipment in the llth year.  Project con-
siderations and investment costa are discussed in Annex 6.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Marketing of Products to be Financed Under the Project
Introduction
1.        Production generated from investments under the Project would
consist mainly of:
(a) Fruits (including avccados, mangos, bananas, olives,
grapes, pineapple and lemons);
(b) Maize and sorghum;
(c) Cotton;
(d) Potatoes;
(e) Meat; and
e                  (f)  Milk.
Attention ls therefore focussed on the marketing arrangements for these
products, although it is necessary first to give some general background
information on price and marketing policies and problems in Peru.
General Productíon and Price Polícy
2.        Under the National Development Plan 1971-1975, priority treatment
is accorded to the following three main groups of agricultural products:
(a) Deficit products (including wheat, vegetable oils and oilseeds,
meat and milk) which traditionally Peru has had to import
to meet consumption needs.  Here, the emphasis is on expanding
production in order to keep imports within bounds in the face
of rising demand.
(b) Regulated products (rice, maize, potatoes, vegetables and
poultry), where, for varying reasons controlled expansion is
called for. In the case of rice, for example, self-sufficiency
has already been reached at levels above world market price,
while increased maize production, although needed for livestock
(particularly poultry) expansion, has to be kept in balance
with cotton in the coastal region.
e



ANNEX 5

(c)  Export products, including not only the traditional export
crops (cotton, sugar, coffee, wool and fibers) but also new
products, particularly fruit and vegetables, where, in
addition to an expanding internal demand, export market
possibilities may exist.
Almost all the products to be financed under the Project come under one or
another of these priority groups.
3.        Recent Bank survey reports on Peru 1/ have stressed the need for
the adoption of more appropriate price and import policies to give a greater
incentive impact to the production program set out in the National Develop-
ment Plan 1971-1975. Prior to 1967, policy was directed towards maintaining
low prices to urban consumers and duty-free imports (particularly of meat)
were relatively freely admitted, often at the cost of weakening production
incentives. In 1967, the devaluation of the Peruvian Sol (from SI/ 26.80
to the US$ to S/. 38.70) improved the terms of trade for agricultural pro-
ducers. Since 1969, imports, now entirely under Government control, have
been restricted and have not been allowed to affect adversely producer prices.
The Government is now consideríng adopting a strategy, which would involve a
balancing of competing objectives, such as, the desire to stimulate production
of certain products, to raise incomes of the rural population, and to keep
urban cost of living from rising too rapidly. The Bank intends to continue
closely to follow the question of agricultural policy in Peru and to review
the Government the need to give high priority to production objectives when-
ever these objectives are not accorded adequate weight.
4.        Implementation of this policy remains, however, uneven.  While, in
general terms, producer prices are at satisfactory levels, as indicated by
the financial rates of return on the farm models set out in Annex 14. Con-
trolled prices for beef at S/. 35 per kg ungraded at wholesale market are
low compared with current world prices (S/. 108 equivalent per kg U.K.
c.i.f. any U.S. port of entry for imported boneless manufacturing frozen
beef). In fact, however, effective prices to both producers and consumers
are considerably higher than the control price level. For young animals
classed as "extra," the producer gets about S/. 30 per kg liveweight (=S/.
62 per kg deadweight), whereas prime beef cuts are retailed at over SI. 100
per kg. Government has its livestock price policy currently under review,
but apart from the problem of having to balance consumer and producer in-
terest, there are unusual complications in the present situation in Peru.
On the one hand, because beef imports on Government account are sold at the
controlled price, a heavy and increasing subsidy to the consumer is involved
in these transactions (para 6); on the other hand, as the controlled price
is used as the basis for the assessment of livestock compensation payments
under the land reform, any increase in its level would automatically raise
compensation costs which have to be paid in cash.

5.        For most other commodities, Peruvian prices are roughly in líne
with world market prices.  In the case of rice, however, artificially high
prices are paid to producers. The price for paddy delivered rice mill is
S/. 5,000 per ton, which gives an equivalent f.o.b. price for milled rice
of approximately S/. 9,000 or US$232 per ton. Comparable f.o.b. world
market prices (August, 1972) were US$141.7 per ton for Thai rice (5% broken)
and US$79.3 per ton for Burmese rice (42% broken), showing that the Peruviai
price is two to three times higher than world market price levels. This high
price has led to a 65% increase in paddy output during the last decade,
enabling Peru to achieve self-sufficiency in rice in 1970, largely at the
expense of a reduction in cotton plantings and production.
6.        To mitigate the effect of this price policy on consumers, rice is
sold by Government at a loss of 74 centavos per kg in Lima/Callao. The grow-
ing cost of this and other subsidies is shown by the figures given below:
Product         Type of                Period          Estimated Cost'

As this represents nearly 11% of total planned expenditures in the agricul-
tural sector during the five years 1971-75 (excluding compensation payments
under the land reform), it seems clear that limits will have to be set soon
on this charge on budget funds.
Price Control Mechanisms and Agencies
7.        Price control regulations cover some producer prices and most whole-
sale and retail market transactions. Measures affecting producer prices fall
into three main categories:
(a) fixed prices applying to rice and milk;
(b) support prices intended to even out seasonal fluctuations
in the case of potatoes and beans (the floor price for
wheat is nominal); and
(c) contract prices for maize, vegetable, and oils and oilseeds,
between producers and mills, which have to be approved by
the Ministry of Agriculture.
e



ANNEX 5
Page 4
8.        In the main wholesale and retail markets, maximum prices for
virtually all commodities are fixed at fortnightly intervals by local
Price Commissions (Juntas de Regulacion de Precios Agropecuarios, JURPA),
but despite enforcement efforts, these price controls are frequently ignored
whenever scarcities develop.
9.        The key agency in the implementation of Government's policy for
the regulation of prices, imports and marketing is the Agricultural Service
Enterprise (Empresa Publica de Servicios Agropecuarios, EPSA), formed in
1969 to combine a number of separate agencies operating in these fields
often under the control of different ministries. As an autonomous agency
under the Ministry of Agriculture, EPSA is responsible for the purchase,
milling and sale of the whole rice crop and for support price purchase of
potatoes and beans. It handles all meat imports and is responsible for the
National Slaughterhouse and Storage Unit (Frigorifico Nacional) at Callao,
which has the largest slaughtering and refrigerating capacity in the country.
EPSA also operates some rice mills and fertilizer plants, runs the Govern-
mentes agricultural machinery pools and supervises wholesale market install-
ations and cattle fairs. Recent additions to EPSA's functions include the
operation of a Government scheme involving the importation of some 40,000
cattle and their initial fattening on temporary pastures that have appeared
in Piura as a result of abnormally heavy rains, and the operation of a chain
of 14 supermarkets in Lima, previously owned by a private company that went
bankrupt.
Marketing Arrangements with Special Reference to Products to be Financed
under the Project
10.       Excluding the large estates, agricultural marketing in Peru has
been characterized by the weak selling position of small and scattered
producers, absence of grading and packing standards, high transport costs,
rudimentary processing facilities to deal with seasonal surpluses (Annex 8),
deficient dissemination of market information, and, on the consumption side,
by the existence of not so much a national market as a number of separate
and partially isolated markets, corresponding to the main centers of pop-
ulation. The concentration of one quarter of the population of the whole
country in the area of metropolitan Lima makes that, of course, the preponderant
market. In Lima and other towns, the low income of the majority of the pop-
ulation limits the size of their purchases at any one time and so keeps in
existence a mass of small shops relying on high margins rather than large
turnover for their profits.  Complicated market channels and excessive num-
bers of intermediaries inevitably add to costs. Specific price and marketing
considerations for commodities to be produced under the Project are examined
in the succeeding paragraphs.
11.       Fruits.  Fruit growing accounts for approximately 262,000 ha or 11%
of the total ctltivated area of the country. There is, however, considerable
scope for production increases in project commodities as indicated by the
demand/supply projections given below:

12.       Since all the problems noted in para 10 above apply in the marketing
of fruit, there are wide margins between producer and consumer prices, high
seasonal price variations (the highest price for lemons in November can be
as much as four times higher than the lowest price in June), and different
price levels for the same product on the same day in different localities
in excess of those justified by transport costs.
13.       Maize and Sorghum.  The livestock expansion program will generate
a rapidly increasing demand for maize and sorghum, which can only partially
be met by increasing local production, as the following table indicates:

14.       In the coastal region, maize and cotton are competing crops for
the same scarce irrigated land. Since cotton ¡a a major export crop and maige
can be imported relatively easily, world market price trenda and relative pro-
duction costs are being taken into account by Government before deciding
whether the maize area should be increased; in the meantime, the emphasis in
production plana ¡a on increasing yields per ha through the apread of the use
of hybrid varieties.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
15.       Cotton.  Peruvian cotton, of long and extra-long staple, is the
second largest agrícultural export (after sugar and excluding fishmeal).
In 1971, production of cotton lint totalled 80,000 tons, of which 52,250
tons (or 65%) were exported, and the balance used jn the local textile in-
dustry. Cottonseea ís the chief source of vegetable oil in Peru and imports
of edible olls and fats are íncreasing. While a steady increase ín local
demand ls expected, world market prospects rule out any major change in
cotton export levels, and targets ln the National Development Plan envisage
modest íncreases ín output from higher yielding varieties on a reduced area.
16.       Ginneríes are privately owned and prices paid to producers for seed
cotton, which have to be approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, vary with
changes in world market prices for lint. The payment of an incentive subsidy
by Goverament to producers is under consíderation.
17.       Potatoes.  Potatoes are one of Peru's most important crops, account-
ing in 1971 for 300,000 ha or 13.5% of total cultivated area and a total pro-
duction of 1,968,000 tonas. The bulk of the planted area is ln the Sierra,
where unimproved varieties and heavy losses due to pesta and diseases result
in low yields; production in the coastal area, although smaller, is rela-
tively important because it is virtually all marketed, has higher yields
and, by virtue of differing harvesting perioda, complementa the Sierra pro-
duction in supplying the Lima market.  The abnormally cold weather ln the
first quarter of 1972 affected both seed supplies from the Sierra and the
harvest in the coastal regíon, so that a fall in production of about 250,000
tons ls forecast for 1972. Overall, however, a growth rate of 6% per annum
is projected for the plan period 1971-75.
18.       In an endeavor to even out fluctuations, retail prices are offi-
cially controlled at S/. 4.20 per kg throughout the year. In fact, this
control (which has cost EPSA SI. 49 million, or US$1.3 million, to operate)
has failed both to provide a floor príce to producers in time of surplus
production and to prevent consumer prices from rising on the `black market"t
in time of scarcity.
19.       Meat.  Meat production has falled to keep up with a rising demand
and imports have been necessary to meet the deficit, as the following figures
for 1970 show:
Species             Production       Demand      Deficít      Imports

ANNEX 5
Page 7
All imports of meat are now handled by EPSA, and the higher cost of beef im-
ports, due to rising world market prices, has led to some substitution of
mutton for beef in an endeavor to save foreign exchange and reduce subsidy
costs (para 6). It has been possible to keep imports at a lower level than
the estimated deficit because of:
(a)  restriction of the demand for beef by the imposition of
meatless days (15 per month in Lima) when the sale of red
meat ¡s prohibited; 1/
(b) substitution of poultry meát and eggs; and
(c) increasing fish consumption.
20.       In the case of poultry, it is assumed that per capita consumption
of chicken and eggs will expand more rapidly than in the past, particularly
in the urban areas.  Provided there is improvement in marketing facilities,
including the provision of more refrigerated storage, and expansion of feed-
ing stuff manufacture, production in 1975 could be more than the 1970 level
of 50,000 tons of poultry meat and 26,000 tons of eggs.
21.       With rising population and living standards, the demand for beef,
mutton and pork is expected to continue to outstrip national production, so
the National Development Plan gives priority to livestock development meas-
ures.  Revised forecasts of production increases made by the Oficina Sectorial
de Planificacion Agraria are as follows:
1971           1974
Actual    Revised Forecast
----(in '000 tons)
Beef                       67              80
Mutton                     20              29
Pork                       43              54
In the achievement of targets of this magnitude, it is recognized that im-
provements in the present price and marketing arrangements will have to be
effected.
22.       As regards price policy, the official market price for beef
(S/. 35 per kg) has not been allowed to rise since 1969. However, the fact
that the controlled price relates to non-classified meat ("cabeceada") makes
it easy for much higher prices to be charged for quality cuts, and effective
produces prices are also at higher levels (para 4).
1/   Peru's per capita consumption of beef and veal (15.3 kg carcass weight
e        -    equivalent) is already the lowest in Latin America.



ANNEX 5
Page 8
23.       On the marketing side, there is a particular need to create more
livestock markets, to facilitate the movement of animals from breeding grounds
in the Sierra to fattening lots in the coastal region and to extend and im-
prove slaughtering, refrigeration and transport facilities.
24.       Milk.  During the four-year period 1966-69, total milk production
remained at around the 750,000-ton level making imports of dry milk neces-
sary.  However, in 1970 and 1971, production rose to 825,000 tons and 897,000
tons respectively, and imports were curtailed. Cow milk accounts for 70% of
the total production and ís the fastest growing section.  In the National
Development Plan 1971-75 demand for cow's milk was estimated to rise from
600,000 in 1970 to over 900,000 in 1975, but revised projections suggest
that the rate of production increase will be of the order of 2.5% per annum.
25.       The producer price for mílk is officially fixed at SI. 5.00 per
litre; and while this is effective for milk produced in the Sierra for indus-
trial use, it is frequently exceeded in the coastal region. The absence of
any quality control. and grading system, the shortage of refrigerated storage
and transport, and the sale of reconstituted milk (made up partly of imported
powder and partly of fresh milk) are recognized marketíng problems that
affect the quality of milk sold to the consumaer and adversely affect demand.
Future Trends
26.       As already noted in para 3, there has been a najor change of em-
phasis in agricultural price policy towards the maíntenance of producer
prices at levels that will provide reasonable returns to efficient produc-
tion units, and so, through changes induced by the land reform, help raise
the living standards of the mass of the rural population. With some excep-
tions, notably rice prices, which are above, and official beef prices whlch
are below, current Peruvian agricultural prices are roughly in line with
world market levels. The successful maíntenance of this price policy will
depend on whether the new Peruvian agrarian structure can produce on such
competitive terms, and this, in turn, will be contingent upon increasing
productivity in terms of output per ha and per man. This policy will be
tested as the duties on agricultural products between member countries of
the Andean Pact are progreasively reduced and finally abolished by 1980.
At the moment, Peru has only invoked safeguard clauses under the Cartagena
Agreement in respect of bananas from Ecuador and apples from Chile.
27.       The Governnment 1s aware that more than just agricultural issues
are involved, slince increases in agricultural prices would lead to pressures
on the cost of living, on wages and on industrial costs, affecting Peru's
competitiveness in export markets.  While the effect of such increases can
be masked by consumer price subsidies, this involves not only strict price
and marketing regulation but also a burden on budgetary funda (para 6). On
the other hand, without an increased growth rate in agriculture, more imports
will be necessary and the balance of payments will be threatened.



ANNEX 5
Page 9
e
28.       lf some of the marketing deficiencies mentioned above could be
improved, the resulting reduction in distribution costs would partially
contribute to the solution of the problem of balancing producer and consumar
prices. This ís fully recognized by the Government. Much ínvestigation and
planning of marketing improvements is being undertaken and in the National
Development Plan 1971-1975, SI. 874 million (US$22.6 million, has been al-
located for investment in marketing lmprovementa.
29.       The cooperatives emerging from the land reform are likely to play
an increasingly important part in the marketing improvement process. At the
moment, they are concentrating on production problema and, for the most part,
continuing to use traditional marketing channels. In the next phase of their
operations, they may be expected to develop new marketing channels, such as,
for example, direct supply contracts with supermarkets, either those privately
owned or those recently taken over the EPSA. The creation of such alternative
distribution channels will not only benefit the participanta but also provide
the necessary competitive spur to improvements in the traditional marketing
system.
30.       Apart from public investment in marketing infrastructure, there
will be a growing demand, particularly from production and service coopera-
tives, for long-term credit to finance the installation of on-farm storage,
and provision for this type of lending has been included in the proposed
project.

A. Mechanization
Introduction
1.        Tractors and other machinery have been used in Peru in limited
sectors, such as the sugar plantations, for over 30 years. Fifteen-year
records of tractor imports for agriculture show that, for the seven-year
period from 1957 through 1964, an average of 465 tractors were brought in
annually. For the three-year period, 1965 to 1967, this average jumped to
768 agricultural wheel tractors annually, with the year 1966 peaking out at
820 units. Demands for agricultural tractors, however, fell to 212 in 1968
as a result of devaluation in September of 1967 and a period of uncertainty
before the change in Government on October 3, 1968. With the agrarian
reform law coming into effect June 24, 1969, the period of indecision con-
tinued for the farmer, with tractor importa remaining low--about 300 units
in 1969. Then in 1970, imports doubled, jumpíng to over 600, and, in 1971,
they settled back to 450 units. Current estimates place the active Peruvian
agricultural wheel tractor fleet at 6,000 units.
Representation
2.        All major tractor manufacturers are represented in Peru and
dealerships are generally well staffed and have good service departments.
The four major countries in order of numibers of tractors supplied, are:
Great Britain, USA, Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy. At least 12
different tractor brands are represented, with some dealers able to offer
the same brand from manufacturers in three different countries.
Import License
3.        Since May 1971 1/, all imports of wheel tractors must be authorized
by license from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC). A quota to
allow importation of 1,100 units per year has been established and allotments
for supply of 860 are understood to have been distributed as follows:

4.        Other companies currently supplying tractors to Peru but not men-
tioned in the unofficial quota are Leyland (U.K.), Deutz (Federal Republic
of Germany), and Allis Chalmers (USA). Since the allotment does not dis-
tribute all of the quota of 1,100 units, dealers who have used their quota
have had little difficulty in getting additional license for importation.
Additionally, the 1,100-unit quota is below the official estimated 1972 mar-
ket of 1,500 tractors which was included in the S.D. 984/71.
Custom Duties
5.        All agricultural wheel tractors and implements are fully exempt
from customs duties.
Implements
6.        Most implements are available from all parts of the world.  However,
any implements such as the three-point hitch plows (2,3,4, and 5 disks) and
disk harrows that are manufactured locally are prohibited from importation
as long as supplies are adequate.

Tractor Plant Tender
7.        On March 2, 1971, MIC published a call for international tenders
for a tractor, assembly plant to be located at Trujillo. The purpose of the
plant as stated was to manufacture agricultural tractors in Peru in quantities
sufficient to supply fully the requirements of the domestic market and to
export the surplus. The demand for agricultural tractors is estinated at
1,500 units per year in the national market and 6,000 units per year in the
market of the Andean Group. The tractor models to be manufactured in Peru
are as follows:
Model                                Number
40-50 Hp                         800 units per year
60-70 Hp                       1,000 units per year
80-90 Hp                        200 units per year
Present Status
S..       The contract for the establishment of a tractor plant has finally
been awarded in late 1972. It is estimated that it would take a minimím of
36 months after signing before production would get underway.
Project Portion
9.        If the 15-year average of agricultural wheel tractor sales (about
510 units a year) continues, the proposed project would finance about 12% of
the tractors bought over the four-year disbursement period. Based on the
Government's estimated need of 1,500 tractors a year, the percentage of
tractors financed under the proposed loan would fall to about 4%.
B. Irrigation
Water Use
10.       Some 90% of the water consumed in Peru is used for agricultural
purposes but water is the principal limiting factor in agricultural develop-
ment. In the past, little attention was given to actual crop requirements,
efficient use of water, maximum development of a `catchment area," charac-
teristics of a given ground water supply, or national needs, but Government
now recognizes that a well planned program for utilization of water, as
well as land resources, is essential to the successful adjustment of national
ouitput based on national demand.
e



ANNEX 6
Page 4
Water Law
11.       A new water code came into effect on July 24, 1969 with the pub-
lication of Decree-law No. 17752, which revokes the 1902 code and a whole
seríes of other legal provisions and gives the State absolute ownership of
water in all forms and locations. Government is free to determine its use,
with human and animal consumption having the overriding priority, followed
by agriculture, power, industrial, mining and other sectors defined in the
code. Permits are issued on the basis of the end use and period of utilization.
Technical Information and Planning
12.       As a direct result of agrarian reform, the Direccion General de
Aguas e Irrigacion and other departments in the Ministry of Agriculture have
had great demands put on them to supply technical information to aid in
planning. A rapid expansion has therefore taken place in the Directorate
of Water and in the rest of the departments of the Ministry. USAID and other
foreign government assistance, both technical and financial, is also being
utilized.
13.       Cultivation and irrigation plans are to be prepared for each
Irrigation District by the water authorities, working in association with
all other officials in the agrarian zone, and are to be coordinated with
representatives of users through the so-called "Committee of Users." Forty-
three basin studies in 56 valleys are now underway--16 are to be in detail,
four semi-detailed, and 23 exploratory--and ground water studies have recently
started, with water depths in 56 valleys to be monitored throughout the year.
Additional studies ranging from soil moisture relationships to irrigated
crop production are also underway. Government is aware that the objectives
of the new water code cannot be implemented overnight, considering the scale
of studies and works, the major investment needed, and the change in attitudes
required both by thlose who manage water and by those who use it, but it is
nevertheless, intended to accomplish its purposes as quickly as possible.
Some agrarian regions of the north coast have already initiated allotment of
irrigation water based on the crops needed as specified in the National Plan.
A farmer in one of these zones must have his cropping plan approved by the
local "Committee of Users" before he can receive crop financing or his water
allotment.
Water Charges
14.       Water charges of S/.220 per ha (US$57) semi-annually have been set
for surface water, but, due to various natural disasters such as floods and
earthquakes, few collections have been made. Individual water users are
responsible for maintaining and cleaning lateral ditches which may service
several farms and days are set aside periodically when the affected farmers
join together to perform the necessary work.  While measuring devices are now
available in the existing irrigation systems, all water will in future be                e
allocated on a measured basis. Cooperatives will need to install control



ANNEX 6
Page 5
.
devices and measuring flumes to allocate their water to the varlous fields,
while individual landholders will be responsible for measuring devices from
the lateral ditches to their holdings and for those required for proper dis-
tributíon on their farms. Improper water use, as well as other poor farming
practices, can result in an individual's farm being redistributed under the
agrarian reform program.
15.       Cooperatives put together from a number of smaller units will require
realignment of irrigation water distribution systems and other physical layouts.
Under agrarian reform procedures, a complete physical inventory and a farm
plan, including timetable budgets and financial requirements, is drawn up on
a new farming unit before it is turned over to the new owners and managers.
A large amount of capital ís needed to inilement these farm plans and initially
Government has helped with the needed investment costs. However, as the unit
becoomes viable, it is up to cooperative managers to find appropriate sources
of finance.  Some of the proposed project loans will come from this demand
for long-tenn capital.
Wells and Pumps
16.       A linited nuiber of new wells will be permitted in specific areas
by the Ground Water Directorate.  Some of these wells will be in the north
coast area, west of Piura, an area of high water table and others will be in
areas where exploitation of underground supplies is justified. Some reworking
of existing wells will be included where supplies are not adequate and where
ground water conditions warrant it. There are now about 9,000 wells in Peru,
but this number may be increased to from 12,000 to 15,000, pending the results
of the current ground water studies. There are a number of well drillers in
Peru, using both percussion and rotary-type well rigs, and steel well casings,
as well as steel columns and shafting, are imported.
Irrigation Pumps and Mbtors
17.       Centrifugal and turbine pumps are manufactured in Peru as well as
in some of the other countries of the Andean Group. All motors for irrigation
pumps are imported.
C. Land Reclamation
Drainage
18.       Reclamation needs arise from a variety of causes, such as poor
irrigation practices, lack of sufficient natural drainage, improper main-
tenance of existing drainage systems, flood damage, ungraded fields, poorly
leveled land, improper farm layout, or the joining together of small holdings
that were previously farmed separately.
e 



ANNEX 6
Page 6
19.       Little has been done in the past about drainage in Peru.  A few open
drains were constructed but maintenance was neglected in most cases.  Some of
the large plantations put in limited underground drainage tied in with open
drains, but for the most part, areas where drainage became a problem were
abandoned, some as long ago as 40 years. In 1971, the Arena Pilot Drainage
Project was started west of Piura on land that had been abandoned many years
ago because of high water table and resulting salinity. Variation in surface
and underground spacing of drains is being evaluated and improvement in first-
year rice crops is already apparent. A shallow underground water supply makes
this an attractive area for reclamation if costs are not prohibitve.
20.       For example at the Cayalti Sugar Cooperative (near Chiclayo), it is
considered that about 20% of the land in this area needs subsurface drainage
to eliminate surface salt accumulation and that some lands that are no longer
farmed could be brought back into production with a limited investment in
drainage facilities. To avoid inefficient irrigation and future drainage
problems, the land benefiting from irrigation projects like Tinajones, close
to Chiclayo, is surveyed and mapped.  Farms should be laid out with irrigation
distribution sYstem, main drainage systems, and proper land leveling before
any farming is allowed.
Land Level_ng
21.       Many farmers are attempting to upgrade their farming techniques
by leveling their fields to facilitate better water application and utiliza-
tion. The land leveling component of the Project would also be necessary
where new lands are coming into production, where releveling is required for
tree crops, and where abandoned land is being reclaimed.
Flood Protection
22.       Many of the farms of Peru are adjacent to streans which occasionally
cause flooding. This situation has resulted in a demand by farmers for long-
term capital to cover investments in flood protection.
D. Project Considerations
23.       Due to the shortage of medium- and long-term funds over the last
few years, many on-farm improvements have been neglected, which now must be
attended to.  Also, long-term plans of cooperatives are ready for implementa-
tion and require capital funds for fulfillment. These needs, coupled with
the pressure applied by agrarian reform for improved yields and better water
and land use, have caused management personnel to accelerate the pace of in-
vestment. The need for additional mechanization has increased, partly because
newly formed cooperatives in some areas have reduced the labor available to in-
dependent farmers.  About 250, 60- to 70-hp wheel tractors with the necessary



ANNEX 6
Page 7
ímplements are included in the project.  Tractor and implemnent loans are
expected to be made to production cooperatíves, service cooperatives (rental
eqtuipment pools), and farmers who nav or may not do some outside customn tractor
work.  Other medium- and long--term financing is included for wells, pumps,
motors, on-farm irrigation facilities, drainage, minor flood control protection,
land levelling and other minor improvements.  Some loans would be for only
one item but most would probably be for a combination of improvements.  Me-
chanization, irrigation, and reclamation have a combined investment cost of
S/.402 million, or 25% of the total lending program. An investment model
has been developed (Annex 14, Table 2) which shows a financial rate of return
of 39%. The investment 1/ includes drainage, land levelling, lining of main
irrigation distribution ditches, and mechanization.

PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Perennal Crops to be Financed under the Pro_ect
General
1.        Fruit crops occupy about 11% (262,000 ha) of the cultivated area,
having an investment value estimated at S/. 20 billion (US$5i7 millíon) and
a 1972 production value of over SI. 3.6 billion (US$93 millíon). Fruit im-
ports in 1970 ran to about SI. 249 million (US$6.4 million) and demand/supply
(Annex 5) projections in 1972/74 show deficits in supply for all major fruit
except oranges. Furthermore, demand is expected to increase with prospects
of exports developing under the Andean Pact Trade Agreements in which Peru
has special clauses protecting her domestic market from Ecuadorian bananas
and Chilean apples.  Summaries of major perennial crops likely to be included
in BFA's future lending program are given below.
Lemons
2.        Lemons are grown under both irrigated and rainfed conditions, with
the largest group (47% of the area) located primarily on the north coast under
írrigation. The second group (36% of the area) is scattered through the Selva,
grown mostly under nonirrigated conditions. There are about 6,500 ha of
lemons in Peru, 1,200 ha in new plantings.  The lemons are spaced 10 m x 10 m
(100 trees/ha) and come into bearing in the fourth and fifth years, with a
return above annual cost occurring in the sixth year. The biggest annual
cost, besides harvesting and packing, is pruning, whlch is extremely impor-
tant if yields are to be kept to a maximum. Yields in 1971 under irrigated
conditions averaged 11.7 tons/ha and under nonirrigation, 10.5 toms/ha.
Lemons are harvested the year around, with peak production occurrlng in
June.  Lemon oil plants process the surplus fruit during this peak period
and new plants are under construction.  The national production of lema»ns
in 1971 was 60,000 tons at a farm-gate value of SI. 86 million. Lemona for
the fresh market are graded and packed in wooden boxes adjacent to the grove.
Olives
3.        All of the olives in Peru are irrigated and 70% are located on
the south coast. Trees on half of the 4,900 ha are less than eight years
old and average yíelds are 3.7 tons/ha, with some from older trees reaching
4.7 tons/ha. Most of the olives are processed in wooden barrels at the grove
and marketed in Lima but some interest has been shown by USA buyers. Quality
e



ANNEX 7
Page 2
is difficult to control, however, with the present batch method. Olive oil
is made primarily out of cull olives, but growers who do not process their
own receive l very low price fromn wholesale buyers. Since lack of processing
facilities is also one of the factors limiting new plantings, growers plan to
build a plant of their own.
Bananas
4.        Bananas occupy the largest portion--70,981 ha-- of the land devoted
to fruit. About 78% of the plantings are in the Selva, mostly in the south
part of Peru. The 15% grown on the coast are irrigated, primarily in the
north near Piura and Tumbes. Most of the plantings are not resistant to "Mal
de Panama" or Moko disease but, as a result of problems in recent years, the
BFA finances only resistant varieties. Plantings in the Province of Moropon
(near Piura) are recording yields of 27 tons/ha while average yields in
nonresistant plantations are only around half of that figure (14 tons). If
bananas are planted at the right time of the year, a 30% crop or better can
be expected in the first year, with the next year yielding at least 70% of
the yield of a mature plantation. Many of the new plantings are going to
higher density, running from 1,600 to 2,500 per ha. The yield (20 tons/ha)
used in the farm model is based on a plant population of 1,875 palms per ha.
The price of bananas roadside at the plantation is about SI. 2,000 per ton,
compared with the world market price of SI. 2,500 per ton.
Avocados
5.        Avocados total about 10,260 ha bearing and 1,750 ha nonbearing,
with 50% grown in the Selva without irrigation and 35% in the coastal region
with írrigation. Two-thirds of the plantings are in the central part of Peru
and a large portion of the remaining third is located in the north. Normal
plantings use 120 trees/ha although some experimental plantings have been
made at a higher density to gain an earlier commercial yield. Avocados in
Peru start producing around the fifth or sixth year, with commercial produc-
tion by the seventh year. National average production is 10.3 tons/ha, al-
though much higher yields are possible, as shown by 26.3 tons/ha recorded for
75 ha in the Province of Lambayeque has showed. Fruit is packed in the
orchard and the farm-gate price averages about SI. 6,000 per ton but varíes
during the year.  Supply and demand projections show a growing deficit, reach-
ing 22,000 tons in 1974, or a need for an additional 1,500 to 2,000 ha, and
considerable interest exists to expand plantations, provided long-term credits
could be provided.
Apples
6.        Almost all of the apples grown in Peru are irrigated, with 85% of
the 8,100 ha devoted to the crop located in the central part of the country
around Lima. The coastal area has 60% of the orchards and the rest are
in the Sierra.  Almost 1,400 ha were nonbearing in 1971.  Coastal yields
average around 12.6 tons/ha while the average yield in the Sierra is 9.3 tons/
ha. The farm price in 1971 averaged S/. 2,870 per ton.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
Mango
7.        About 72% of the mango groves in Peru are located in the coastal
area and are irrígated. These groves are concentrated in the north around
Piura, with the major portion north of Lima. Some 23% of the orchards are
ín the Selva where they grow without irrigation. Out of the total 7,057
ha used for mangos, about 26% are young trees and classed as nonbearing.
Mangos start producing in the fifth year and continue to increase in yields
at least through the 10th year.  Although good mature groves average 10 to
12 tons/ha, a 45-ha planting in the Province of Lambayeque prod!uced an aver-
age of 20 tons/ha in 1971. For the most part, the picker sorts and packs the
mangos in the area of harvest. Prices vary throughout the harvest period
but average about SI. 5,000 per ton.
Pineapples
8.        Pineapples are primarily grown without irrigation in the southern
Selva, with some 83% of the 4,390 ha of plantings located south of Lima. The
main coastal plantings, all of which are under irrigation, are at La Libertad.
Yields of both the Selva and coastal area average around 15 tons per ha.
Prices vary considerably, probably due to transportation problems, but the
average 1971 prices for the Selva were S/. 1,270 per ton, while coastal
areas received an average of S/. 2,900 per ton. Considerable interest exist
for new plantings in the north coastal area.
Grapes
9.        The commercial grape growing area is confined to the irrigated
central coastal area, with 85% of the total 12,000 ha located in the Ica,
Lima, and Callao areas. About 20% of this hectarage has not yet come into
bearing. Commercial production starts in the fourth year but 25 to 30% of
a normal crop can be harvested in the third year, depending on date of plant-
ing. Yields of mature vines range around 6.4 tons per ha and 1971 prices
averaged SI. 6,260 per ton. Grapes are marketed fresh to the winery or the
distillery. The national liquor, 'pisco," is distilled from grapes and has
found favor ín the export market. Plane for 1975 call for the exporting of
26,700 Uters.
Other Perennial Crope
10.       Another crop which does well in the coastal area is white asparagus,
but only 570 ha are planted under irrigation in this region.  Another 400 ha
in the La Libertad area produce crops of excellent eating quality. The yields
range from 4 to 5 tons/ha and are marketed fresh or to the cannery. The
cannery in Trujillo ¡a paying an average of S/. 5,000 per ton delivered.
Project Considerations
11.       BFA has been financing the establishment costs of the perennial
crops but a shortage of medium- and long-term funda has caused a slowdown



ANNEX 7
Page 4
in planting. The Ministry of Ag-iculture's Department of Planification
shows a defkcit in the production of perennial crops and it is encouraging
expansion by the growers, many of whom are ready to diversífy since they
feel that present annual crops such as cotton are not producing a suffi-
cient income. The farm model (Annex 14, Table 2) depicts a farm, formerly
producing cotton, corn, and sorghum, on which one-third of the area would
be converted to perennmal crops, replacing part of the cotton hectarage.
Bananas and mangos were selected for the model, but any of the other peren-
nial crops discussed could have been used. The financíal rate of return for
the model is estimated to be 26%. The Project would provide medium- and long-
term Financing for any of the perennial crops as long as investments could be
justified on the basis of commercial yields and a proven market and assurance
that other BFA requirements were met. Investments would be mainly in olives,
lemons, mangos, and bananas. In total about 600 ha of perennial crops, de-
pending on the final mix selected by the farmers, would be financed. Project
funds would cover the first three years of development costs, while BFA
would likely provide further financial assistance as needed until the plant-
ings reached the commercial bearing stage.                     w

PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agro-industry to be Financed under the Project
Background
1.        In general, food factories in Peru are small in scale, involve much
handwork and use makeshift production lines. The number of products is small
and the quality extremely variable but development of more modern and effi-
cient processing plants is constrained by the following factors:
(a) the limited internal market for processed products because
of the low income of the bulk of the population;
(b) the difficulty of maintaining quality control due to the
absence of grading standards for fresh or processed foods,
which gives little opportunity to gain export markets,
although canned asparagus to Europe and lemon oil to the USA
are exceptions;
(c) the relatively high costs of capital, equipment, raw materials
and containers; and
(d) Government's policy on overseas capital investment in industry,
which restricts the possibility of participation with estab-
lished firms operating in international markets.
2.        It is not, therefore, surprising that developments in the agro-
industrial field have been uneven, as the following examples show:
(a)  Maria Laura (Trujillo).  A complete plant for the canning of
asparagus, including can making equipment, was established
on a private estate in 1968 at a capital cost of about S/. 20
million (US$510,000), of which the Banco Industrial del Peru
(BIP) provided S/. 12 million (US$300,000) and the Banco de
Fomento Agropecuario (BFA) SI. 4 million (US$100,000).
Partly because of technical and management defects, but mainly
because the estate was taken over under the land reform and
its production diversifie.d under its new cooperative ownership,
the factory has been closed for over three years.
e



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(b) Freeze Dry Plant (Arequipa). Costing approximately US$20
million, provided by the local regional development corpora-
tion, this plant for the processing of garlic and onions
oparated for only 100 ¿ays and has been closed for two years,
due to faulty forecasting of the availability of both raw
material and potential markets.
(c) Tomato Processing. Efforts by a USA manufacturer to establish
a platt in the Trujillo area to produce tomato paste for the
USA market have failed and three high quality Italian plants
are all working at low capacity because of difficulties in
both the supply of raw materials and in market outlets.
(d) Dairy Plants. Most existing dairy plants (mainly designed to
produce evaporated milk) are operating well below their rated
capacities. Cheese production is almost entirely a cottage
industry.
(e) Meat. Standards of slaughtering and processing of meat are
poor in existing plants but studies are underway to suggest
ways to improve the situation and this is a likely field for
future investment.
(f)  Fruit Processíng.  Under the. National Plan 1971-75, considerable
expansion projected in the production of certain fruits, notably
lemons and mangoes. To counteract seasonal fluctuations in
producer prices some small-scale lemon oíl plants have operated
successfully in the northern coastal area. In anticipation of
the expansion of production, the establishment of more similar
extraction plants is already under consideration.
(g) Rice-milling. Although the majority of mills are in private
hands, an increasing proportion have been established by
service cooperatives, and this trend is likely to be accentuated.
Instituto de Investigaciones Agro-Industriales (IIA)
3.        Recognizing the need to improve developments in the agro-industrial
field, the Government established the Instituto de Investigaciones Agro-
Industriales (IIA) in July 1969 1/. An autonomous agency under the Ministry
of Agriculture, its directing board consists of representatives of the Minis-
try, the Empresa Publica de Servicios Agropecuarios (EPSA), the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, the Banco Industrial del Peru (BIP) and the BFA.
4.        At its site near La Molina University, Lima, the IIA has offices,
laboratories and specialized equipment costing S/. 70 million (US$1,810,000),
of which S/. 48.8 million was provided by Government, S/. 5 million each by
11    ecrto  ey  777 o  Juy 2, 169

BFA and BIP and the balance under a five-year UNDP project due to be completed
in 1974. The latter also provides eight FAO experts to reinforte the 33
professional staff employed by the Institute.
5.        Concentrating in its initial phase of operation on the problers
of the food processing industry, IIA functions include:
(a) laboratory and pilot plant investigations into specific
processing and conserving problems;
(b)  applied research into the conservation of fresh and
processed products during storage, transport and
distríbution;
(c)  economic and feasibility studies, including market
surveys; and
(d) technical assistance to the processing industry,
including training of personnel, designing of plant
and renting of pilot plant for trials runs.
6.        Both from the standpoint of laboratory and pilot plant facilities
and of technical personnel, the IIA is well equipped for its purposes and
although its installations were not completed until 1971, it is already
undertaking investigations on behalf of EPSA, the fishing industry, the BFA
and the BIP as well as private ínterprises. Because of the dearth of reliable
and qualified full-time private consultants, the Institute is likely to play
a major role in future agro-industrial development in Peru.
Finance for Agro-industrial Enterprises
7.        As is to be expected in a borderline field between agriculture and
industry, both State banks--BIP--and the BFA as well as the commercial banks
are sources of long-term finance for agro-industrial enterprises. Because
of its shortage of long-term funds, BFA lending has been small in recent
years (S/. 2.28 million in 1970 and S/. 6 million in 1971), but BIP has been
more active as the following table shows:

These figures probably include loans for enterprises more industrial than
agricultural in character (e.g., ice cream factories under milk products),
but they do show that the average loan size is SI. 350,000 (US$9,000),
reflecting the small size of most existing processing plants.
8.        BIP will normally lend up to 70% of the fixed and liquid assets of
the project and its interest rates, governed by decree, vary between 7% and
9% per annum, according to the size and purpose of the loan. In companies
with foreign participation, BIP can only make loans if the Peruvian share-
holding is 80% or more.
9.        Both BIP and BFA have collaborated in the past in the joint
financing of large projects, which usually involve separate loans for
specific portions of the project because of the differing interest rate
structures of the two banks, but they have recently agreed on new procedures
to speed up the handling of such cases. Although, appraisal is made by their
respective Departments of Economic Studies, use is already being made of the
Instituto de Investigaciones Agro-Industriales, with which both banks are                 e
associated.

Possible Lending under the Project
10.       lecause of the uncertainties created by the agrarian reform, invest-
ment in agro-industry has been limited in the past three years, but already
there is a revival of interest. As a result of the preferences accorded to
cooperatives under Government poiícy, a large proportion of future borrowers
will be service cooperatives, but it is probable that some existing or new
individually owned enterprises will also be able and willing to make new
investments. In the absence of any valid past experience, it is impossible
to forecast what the proportíons between these two types of sub-borrowers
will be.
11.       In its submission, the BFA listed the following as examples of
the type of agro-industrial enterprise for which they would expect to provide
medium- and long-term finance:
Estimated Total Cost
S/. million      US$
(i) Lemon oil extraction plant in
Lambayeque                                 6.00       160,000
(íi)  Milk pasteurization plant in
Trujillo                                 20.75        540,000
(iii) Olive oil extraction plant in
Tacna                                      7.10       180,000
In addition, within the 1973-75 diversification plans of the sugar cooper-
atives, the following agro-industrial projects appear:
Estimated Total Cost
S/. million     US$
(iv) Three sausage making plants
each costing                               7.29       190,000
(v) Three animal feedstuff mills
each costing                               7.75       200,000
Conclusions
12.       Since agro-industrial projects have been identified only by type,
and considering to past experience in this field in Peru, which underlines the
need for proper economic as well as technical appraisal, it is suggested that:
(a)  all such sub-loans should require prior Bank approval;



ANNEX 8
Page 6
(b) a copy of the pre-appraisal report by the Instituto de
Investigaciones Agro-Industriales should accompany the
submission of such loan applications; and
(c) in cases where joint financing with the Banco Industrial
del Peru is involved, full details of both banks'
participation should be provided.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Banco de Fomento Agropecuario del Peru
Background
1.        The Banco de Fomento Agropecuario (BFA) is a Government owned agri-
cultural credit and development institution. Its main function is the pro-
vision of short, medium and long-term loans for financing agriculture and
forestry and it provides about 80% of institutional tredit to this sector.
BFA also has a marketing monopoly on natural rubber and jute.
2.        BFA was established ín 1952 as a successor to the Banco Agricola
del Peru established in 1931. A new basic law governing the Banco was enacted
on August 16, 1968 but since then a number of decrees have affected its status,
organization and operations. These changes have been mainly due to the Agrarian
Reform Law which includes directives on the broad credit policies to be followed
by BFA. Emphasis is to be given to cooperative organizations, which are to re-
ceive priority for credit in a situation where fundo are limited; they are aleo
to receive preferential interest ratea. A new BFA law, under preparation i8
expected to incorporate these modifications and further define BFA's role.
The recent changes have strengthened BFA's role in agricultural lending and
made it more responsive to Government agricultural policies. BFA ¡a respon-
sible to the Ministry of Economy and Finance and by law coordinates its
credit policies with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee of Gov-
ernment Credit Policy.
Resources
3.        The resources of BFA have more than doubled over the last five yeara
and amounted to S/ 8,786 míllion (US$226 million) at December 31, 1971 (Table
1). Paid-up capital (authorized capital la S/ 10,000 mlllion (US$258 million)
comprised SI 1,663 million (US$43 million), an increase of 120% over the last
four years, while reserves were S/ 124 million. Other major resources in-
clude: Central Bank advances of S/ 1,295 million (US$33.5 million) provided
at concessionary discount rate of 2%; curretit deposits, S/ 1,115 million (US$29
million), which are mainly excesa funda of the commercial banks; provisions
S/ 1,081 million (US$27.9 million); an IBRD loan S/ 477 million (US$12.3
million); Government S/ 495 million (US$11.9 million); foreign banks S/155
million (US$4.0 million); savinga deposits S/ 94 million (US$2.4 million);
aud S/ 1,648 million (US$42.6 million) interest free trust funda mainly
from AID and IDB. Government usually provides additional capital based on
BFA's requirements for servicing international borrowings and through bud-
get appropriations calculated every two years. BFA also expects Government
capital contributions to offset bad debts resulting from the Agrarian Reform
and losses resulting from low interest ratea to small farms.

ANNEX 10
Page 2
4.        Use of Resources; Lending Operatíons.  BFA's outstanding loans from
ito own funds (excluding trust funds) increased sharply from just over
SI. 3,000 million (US$112 mllion) iJin 1966 to S/. 6,500 million (US$168
million) in 1971 (Seo Table 2 and Annex 12). However, when viewed against
inflation and high overdues, BFA's annual lending volume in real terms has
increased at only a moderate rate. New long and medium-term loans granted
durlng 1966 were SI. 250 million (US$9.3 million) and increased to only S/. 300
million (US$7.6 million) in 1971, actually a decrease in real teros, reflecting
BFA's lack of long-term resources since IBRD loan funds were fully drawn in
1968. During the fírst six montha of 1972, BFA was able to make only 4% of
ita new loana on medium- and long-term, while 96% was on short term. New
short-term loans, however, rose from S/. 1,780 million (US$66.4 million) in
1966 to SI. 5,000 million (US$129 militon) in 1971 and BFA ís able to meet
most requests for these loans. Increased access to Central Bank funds has
been a major factor in this.
5.        Besides the lendíng operations from its own resoures, BFA admin-
isters the credit aspects of various Government trust funds for the agricul-
tural sector. These funds are extended on agreed rates to stimulate activities
under special Government policies. Outstanding loans from trust funds for
which BFA is only a fiscal agent (the Ministry of Agriculture appraises and
approves loans and covers the risk) rose from SI. 307 million (US$11.5 million)
in September 1966 to SI. 1,332 million (US$34.4 million) at December 31, 1971.
Of this amount, SI. 857 million (US$22.1 million) was for long-term and SI. 475
million (US$12.3 million) for short-term.  During 1971, new short-term loans              e
amounted to S/. 267 milllon (US$6.9 million million) and long-term loans to
SI. 281 militon (US$7.3 million). (See Table 2) While the short-term lend-
ing is small compared to short-term lending from BFA's own funds, the present
rate of long-term lending almost equals that from BFA's own funds. Loan ap-
praisals are carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture. Loans have usually
been made to poorer farmers and those suffering from some natural calamity.
Arrears are about 25% of outstanding loans, but in view of the increases in
lending in recent years it is thought likely that this percentage will in-
crease. This particularly applies to long-term lending. BFA also acts as
the channel for payment of Agrarian Reform Bonds; this does not require a
great deal of time and assists BFA to collect debts in some cases.
6.        Non-Banking Operationa.  BFA's non-banking activities mainly concern
a monopoly on the purchase of wild rubber and import of natural rubber. Other
activities include purchase of jute.  Over the past several years BFA has made
little profít or lasa on these activities. Total volume of purchase was about
SI. 200 million (US$5.2 million) ín 1971, resulting in a deficit of S/. 3 mil-
lion (US$80,000). In earlier years, there was a similar volume producing
either a small surplus or deficit. The Fundo Iberia, a large rubber plantation
and agency in a remote part of the Selva, has been highly unprofitable for many
years. In 1971 losses were about SI 17.5 million (US$450,000) a figure similar
to those recorded for previous years. BFA has for a number of years been try-
tng to get rid of the Fundo Iberia. At present, a bill is awatting cabinet
consideration for ita removal from BFA to Government. The following table
shows BFA'B total losaes for its non-banking operations over the previous
years:

Financial Situation
7.        The BFA has been making only small surpluses for a number of years
(Annex 13). While BFA lends at fairly low interest rates, its cost of re-
sources ís also very low, 1.2% of all resources, thus allowing a spread of
about 7% on its loan portfolio, which ia high by most atandarda. Most of
this apread is taken up in operating costa, which equal about 5% of the loan
portfolio and allowances for provisions, mainly bad debts, equal to about 2%
of the loan portfolio. Income is adversely affected by arrears of interest,
e.g., in 1971 SI. 98 million (US$2.5 million), or 16% of interest due to the
books was not collected. Table 3 to this Annex shows a detailed breakdown
of BFA's íncome and costo on a percentage basis which, amongst others, shows
that non-bankíng activities do not have a major effect on ita overall
activities.
8.        BFA has a satisfactory líquidity position -- at December 31, 1971
its current asaeta (i.e., leas than 12 months) were about S/. 4,100 million
(US$115 million) compared to correspondíng current liabílíties of about
SI. 3,300 million (US$90 million). Ita debt equíty ratio of 2.4:1 ís fairly
low and reflects BFA's limitation on borrowing except when funds are avail-
able at very low interest rates. With low on-lending rates (para 24) for
much of ite lending, fairly high overheads and large provísiona against bad
debts, BFA had to keep ita financial costo down to prevent loases.
9.        Recovery of loans by BFA has been a problem for many years and as
can be seen in the table 4 arrears have been a faírly constant percentage
over the past 3 years. Before that they were as high as 30% in the early
1960's declining to 20% in 1966 before rising again but thís may not be a
true reflection of the position as many loans have been and are rewritten.
At June 30, 1972, overdue loana amounted to 27.1% of the loan portfolio. Of
these amounts 3.3% was due lees than 90 days and a high percentage of this
would be recovered in the near future. However, the position of overdues
over 90 days íB more serious as branches usually extend the date of the
loan before the end of 90 days íf payment la expected shortly. The posítion
of arreara has been aggravated by the Agrarian Reform which has largely
eliminated a free land market.  In addítion, some large scale leasees and
other non-owners sold their produce from their last crop and left without
paying the BFA. BFA expects that Goverament will increase capital contri-
butions to offset these losses. Other reasons for arrears have been, natural
dísasters and Governnent requiring BFA to defer repayments ia case of severe
drought etc. A further reason ia that BFA's branch managers are making short-
term loans for long-term purposes in order to overcome ahortage of long-term



ANNEX 10
Page 4
e
funds, and bypass approval of the head office. BFA's provision for bad debts
is about 40% of overdues and 11% of the total portfolio. These are considered
to be a realistic estimate of uncollectibles.
10.       Three years ago BFA established a special Overdues Department, re-
porting to senior management, to improve collections and many large and medium
overdues are now under its control. While these constitute only 1,200 of the
26,000 loaus overdue they include about 45% of the total amount overdue aud
about 50% of the amount overdue by more than nine months (Table 4). The
Overdues Department has been giving priority to the larger overdues to have
a maximum impact and is progressively reviewing loans and either taking legal
action, agreeing to a rearrangement (debt still remains as overdue) or recom-
mending a write-off. Although improving, the present rate of progress is
slow and needs to be accelerated.
11.       The efficiency of BFA is affected by the physical difficulty of the
country and by the need to provide services to remote and high cost areas.
This is best illustrated by comparing the operating costs of the five lowest
cost branches (all on the coast) with the five highest cost branches (see
Table 5). For one group the administration costs are 3% of BFA's own funds and
in the other 10%. In the highest cost branch (Iquitos), where travelling ís
difficult and all costs are high, operating costs are 2-1/2 times groas in-
come. It ia partly to offset these disad'vantages that Government has in recent
years provided substantial amounts of capital contributions and it is anticipated
that these contributions will continue.  A further reason ís the high overdues              e
which diverts staff from productive work to chasing overdues which in many cases
may give no return. Also, high overheads are common with most Peruvian banks
and reflects the comparatively high wages in Peru in relation to the volume of
work handled per man.
12.       BFA has in recent years increased staff fairly rapidly.  This com-
bined with generally rising salaries (despite a cut back in 1971) has resulted
in operating costs increasing more or less in líne with the loan portfolío.
It should be possible for BFA to streamline its procedures and improve efficí-
ency sufficiently so that staff numbers are kept reasonably atable. The growth
in lending to cooperatives (i.e. large loans) should reduce BFA'8 costs per
million soles and BFA should concentrate its future efforts for improving effi-
ciency on:
(a) reducing the percentage of operating costs by holding
the present costs and increasing the future portfolio;
(b) improving debt collection efforts;
(c) streamlining present procedures.
13.       The BFA has historically lent the greatest amount of its portfolio
to large and medium size individual farmers. The position has altered since
the Agrarian Reform particularly in the last 12 to 18 months and a substantial
part of BFA's loans now go to the cooperatives that have replaced many of the
individual farmera. While BFA now views cooperative lending as lending to



ANNEX 10
Page 5
small farmers (based on the concept of dividing the loan to the cooperative
by the number of members) the Agrarian Reform has not to-date caused a radical
change in either the number of loans or BFA's workload.  The larger sugar and
other cooperatives before they were expropriated generally dealt wlth the com-
mercial banks. Since expropriation they have made limited demando on BFA, but
they are expected to develop a substantial demand for both long and short-term
funds as proposed development plans are carried out. These loans to coopera-
tives will be very large and should lower average operating costa for BFA and
help improve ita efficiency.
Organization and Management
14.       The BFA's highest authority is ita Board which consista of four
nominees of the Ministry of Fínance and four nominees of the Ministry of
Agriculture. All membera are eligible for 2 year terms with the possibility
of re-nomination. The Board la responsIble for policy and for the approval
of loana over SI. 12 million (US$310,000). There is also an Executive Com-
mittee comprised of the President, two directora and the General Manager which
resolves or advises on all matters entrusted to it by the Board. The President
of the Board who is appointed by the Minister of Finance ís a full time em-
ployee of the BFA, and has a key role in matters of general policy.
15.       The General Manager is responsible for the general operations of
BFA and ia appointed by the Board. The present General Manager has been in
office for about two years. The BFA has a Central Manager, (Senior Credit
Manager), and five department managers. There are two Credit Managers each
responsible Lor credit operations for approximately half the country. The
Manager for Finance, handles external transactiona, deposits and commercial
activities (e.g. rubber). The Manager for Planaing and Economnic Studies ls
responsible for planning, preparation of requests for external--aid and assist-
íng in appraisal of large scale loan requests. There la also a Manager for
Technical Development who coordínates technical staff and distributes infor-
mation. Sub-managers responsible for Debt Collection, Trust Funds, and
Internal Audit report directly to seníor management.
16.       The BFA is organized on the basis of 14 semi-autonomous branches
covering the whole of Peru (See Map). Under the control of the branches are
42 agencies, which have functions similar to the branches, and 46 inspec-
tions which receive and prepare loan applications for consideration by agen-
cies and branches and provide asaistance to farmers. The total number of
offices has risen from 92 in 1965 to 100 at present. Coverage ¡a considered
satisfactory. The branches and agencies have considerable autonomy in termas
of short-term loans but little in the case of long-term loans. Personal liaison
between the head offices and branches needs to be improved. Most contact la
through written correspondence. Key credit personnel from the head office need
to visit branches more often and branch managers and senior branch staff need
more contact with the head office and other branches.  The branches have very
little contact with the Department of Planning and Economic Studies and more
exposure would benefit both sides.
.



ANNEX 10
Page 6
17.       Present staff totals 2,186 including 247 professional agricultural
specialists, 55 lawyers, 24 accountants and 6 economists (see Table 6). In-
cluded in the total are about 200 workers, employed on non-banking activities
(i.e. rubber, jute, etc.).  Staff numbers have expanded quite sharply in re-
cent years from 1,788 at May 1969 and 1,925 at September 1970. This is ap-
proximately in line with the expansion in portfolio in real terms and re-
flects little improvement in efficiency. The central office staff of 468 is
considered high and is a reflection of the undue amount of paper work.
18.       Under a previous Bank loan, BFA some seven years ago underwent a
reorganization with the assistance of a French consulting firm. It mainly
strengthened the accounts and separated the banking activities from the non-
banking activities, but the problems BFA has been encountering since 1968 are
rising staff costs while medium-and long-term lending funds decreased con-
siderably. This situation led to a reduction of branch authority and gradual
centralization of the Lima head office. Management is aware of the problem
and with additional funds now available from Government and under those that
would be supplied from the proposed Bank loan, steady improvements can be
expected.
19.       In 1969 BFA concerned with the hígh level of overdues established
a special Department to improve collections. This Department has had most of
the large size overdues transferred to its control but branches have retained
the small overdues. It lF progressively reviewing and either taking legal
action, agreeing to a rearrangement (debt still remains as overdue) or recom-
mending BFA to write-off debta considered uncollectible.  To-date the procesa
has been fairly slow but ls being speeded up witn priority on the larger debts
so as to have a maximum impact. Officers of the Overdues Department have been
stationed  in most branches to improve loan collection and to review overdue
loans.
20.       Under the proposed IDB loan to BFA for cooperatives, signed in
June 1972, the BFA agreed to the following conditions with respect to re-
duction of overdue debts as related to BFA's own portfolio:
(a) wíthin 12 months (June 1973) overdues exceeding 90 days would
be reduced to 18% and those less than 90 days to 6%;
(b) within 20 months (February 1974) overdues exceeding 90 days
would be reduced to 12% and those less than 90 days to 4.5%;
(c)  within 24 months (June 1975) overdues exceeding 90 days
would be reduced to 10% and those less than 90 days to 4%.
21.       To achieve these results BFA needs to make a major and rather
hurried effort.  In recent years there has been little write-off of bad
debts even though the BFA knows it will not collect on many debts. With
the formation of the Overdues Department, BFA is now in a better position
than previously to decide on write-offs. However, the Overdues Department
is only looking at write-off as part of its full review of larger overdues.
While substantially íncreasing provisíons BFA has been reluctant to write-                 e
off debts. This is partly due to its efforts to obtain additional capital



ANNEX 10

from Government as recompense for debts arising from the Agrarian Reform and
other Government aponsored programs and partly to encourage farmers to meet
debts as there is little hope of the debt being written off. The overdues
position i5 a major problem and BFA needs to place continued emphasis on
debt collection, review of the loan portfolio and write-off of uncollectibles.
Lending Policies and Procedures
22.       At present BFA's lending procedures are based on various categories
of loans.  A loan can only cover one category (e.g. cropping requirements or
livestock or machinery) and is either short, medium or long-term. Therefore,
one borrower may have several individual loans, each separately recorded and
filed. This with the various cross references increases BEA's workload for
little gain. Under BFA's proposed new law it is likely that this duplication
of files and work will be largely eliminated and there will only be short-
term and long-term production loans ánd loans for short-term storage of prod-
ucto. BFA divides its present lendíng into four categories which affects in-
terest rates, approving limita, etc. The groups are:
Single Loans (Maximum)    Total Lending
(Maximum 4 loans)
S/.                      SI.
Small farmers               150,000 (US$3,900)         600,000 (US$15,500)
Medium farmers              300,000 (US$7,800)         1,200,000 (US$31,000)
Large farmers               4,500,000 (US$116,000)    18,000,000 (US$465,000)
Cooperatives              No Maximum                 No Maximum
23.       BFA's present policies and procedures for the termz  of loans are
fairly well defined and are as follows:
(a)  Short-term loan--up to 2 years but most often seasonal
loas for annual cropping expenses. On receipt of the
application by the branch or agency a BFA technician vlll
appraise the proposal visiting the property if necessary.
Loan amounts are generally based on standard operating
costa, which are frequently reviewed and generally satisfac-
tory. The technician's recommendation is then reviewed by
an approving officer (usually an agronomist) who has
differa depernding on the size of the loan under consideration
and how many other loans the borrower has. Approving officers'
limito for loans for individual purposes and for individual
borrowers are:

Board                      over  12,000,000       over  12,000,000
In addition to loans made for production, BFA also lends for storage of crop
products with loans being made against varehouse receipts issued by Govern-
ment dr private storage facilities. In general farmera can get decisions on
short-term loans within a short period from the application date:
(b)  Medium and long-term loans--procedures are similar to
short-term loans except the technician almost always
visits the property and prepares an assessment of
prospects in greater detaíl. However, branches can only
approve long-term loans to a maximum of Sl.150,000. All
other applications are recommended and then referred to
the head office for further investigation and decision
Because of the general shortage of long-term funds BFA
has not encouraged long-term lending. The time of
appraisal is often long and this also has discouraged
potential borrowers.
(c)  Trust Funds--in n addition to its own funds BFA administers
the credit aspects of Government trust funds mainly provided
by various international agencies. The Ministry of Agriculture
or other Government agencies appraise and recommend approval.
BFA is responsible for collection of debts but does not' incur
any loss because of default.
Interest Rates
24.       BFA's interest rates for loans from its own funds are based on
the Government's policy of assisting agriculture through low interest rates
and encouraging certain types of food crops. The average rate of interest
on all farm loans made in 1971 was 10.5% and for the first 6 months of 1972,
9.9%.  For lending from its own funds, interest rates for loans are as follows:
e

Small farmers        0 - 50,000 (US$1,300)          7%
50,000 - 100,000
(US$2,600)       9%
100,000 - 150,000
(US$3,900)      10%
Storage of Products                 10%
Medium farmers          150,000 - 300,000           12%
Large farmers           300,000 upward              13% (12% interest +
1% commision)
Loan for basic food crops (e.g. grain) are 7% for loans below S/. 150,000
and 9% for loans between SI. 150,000 and S/. 300,000. Loans in the Selva
(Jungle) area have a maximum rate of 12%. For calculating interest rates
to cooperatives BFA uses the following formulae:
Total loan divided by the number of members in the cooperative.
This figure is applied against the relative loan size and
interest rates for private farmers.  In general interest
rates to cooperatives are 7% to 9%.
Collateral Reguirements
25.       In general BFA's collateral requirements for short-term loans are
mortgages on the goods being produced (i.e. crops or livestock). The amounts
lent may be up to 75 - 80% of the estimated value. Long and medium-term
security is over land, livestock or machinery. Recently land had lesser
security as Agrarian Reform has stopped most land transaction except those
under the Agrarian Reform, where land values are based on taxation values
and payable in bonds at low interest rates. In practice, BFA's ability to
foreclose on cooperative land would be limited.
Accounts and Audit
26.       In general accounting and auditing procedures are satisfactory.
Most information is recorded on a IBM 360 computer and records are up to
date. However, the present limited detail in the ageing of overdue loans
and the system of multiple loans for individual are deficiencies which need
to be corrected. BFA has an adequately staffed internal Audit Department
which is now auditing most branches within each 12 month period. They pro-
duce a report on each branch for the information of management and for fol-
low up of recommendations given.
27.       The external auditors Castro, Alonso and Associates are an experí-
enced Lima firm with well qualified staff. The Superintendency of Banks
periodically reviews part of BFA's activities to ensure compliance with bank-
ing requirements and to ensure satisfactory standard of practices.

PERU
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Econoinc Rtate of Return
1.        The rates of return from the Project to the economy have been
calculated separately for each farm model as shown in the attached table,
on the basis of the following assumptions:
(a) World market prices as projected by the Trade Policies and
Export Projects Division of IBRD's Economic Department have
been used to estimate benefits for all products, except
pork, milk and potatoes, which are regarded as "non-tradeable"
commodities and for which current Peruvian prices have been
applied. In calculating the equivalento of world market
prices, a 2% allowance has been made in favor of imports in
view of their lower average transport cost to Lima, the main
consuming market.
(b) Current price levels have been used for investments with no
allowance for cost increases.
(e)  Deductions have been made in respect of prevaíling taxes
and custons duties on imported items.
(d)  Salvage values proportional to unexpired asset life have
been íncluded where appropriate.
(e) Labor has been costed at current prevailing rates.
2.        When weighted according to the relative share of each model in
total project costa, the average economic rate of return ís 26%.
3.        The following table shows a comparison of local prices and world
market prices whích have been used for calculating the economic rateas of
return.
