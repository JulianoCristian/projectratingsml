While Russia has made a remarkable\n            progress in many respects since the economic crisis of the\n            late 1990s, it struggled to meet its full potential without\n            improving health conditions among its population and\n            restructuring of its health system. Russia Health Reform\n            Implementation Project was launched by World Bank to support\n            efforts to deal with the fragmentation and poor quality of\n            services, shift the balance of care provided from hospitals\n            to outpatient services at the primary level, introduce\n            evidence-based standards for the training of personnel and\n            the delivery of medical care, and adopt measures to ensure\n            continuity of funding and to create incentives for high\n            quality and efficient services to better respond to the\n            needs of the population. The improved response capacity of\n            the emergency medical services allows the regional health\n            systems to timely deal with heart attacks, strokes, road\n            traffic injuries, and other conditions that require\n            immediate care to prevent unnecessary deaths and lasting\n            disabilities. With the replacement and modernization of the\n            ambulance fleet, the establishment of a centralized\n            ambulance dispatcher centers and improved communication\n            systems between ambulances and health facilities, including\n            the use of Global Positioning Systems, and training of\n            medical staff and paramedics in advance and basic life\n            support systems. The results achieved in the two regions\n            were promising and provided clear evidence that health\n            reform, while technically and politically complex across the\n            world, was indeed possible in the Russian Federation."}, "docdt": "2010-06-03T03:33:02Z"}
