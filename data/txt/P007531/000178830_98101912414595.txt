APPRAISAL OF THE LAS TRUCHAS STEEL PROJECT
SUMiARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)   A Bank loan of US$70 million equivalent has been requested to
help finance an integrated iron and steel works on Mexico's Pacific coast,
with Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), the Government development bank,
and Siderurgica Lazaro Cardenas-Las Truchas, S.A. (SICARTSA), a Government-
owned company, as joint borrowers and the Government as guarantor.  In its
first stage, to which the Bank loan would apply, the works will have an
annual capacity conservatively rated at one million tons of light non-flat
finished steel products, with provision made for later expansions to over
5 million annual tons.  Construction is now beginning and the completion
target for Stage I is mid-1976. The works will be located near iron ore
reserves sufficient for at least 25 years of steel production at thie Stage r
level.  Coal supplies will be imported through an adjacent deep-water port
that is being financed and constructed separately by the Government. A new
city to house SICARTSA's employees similarly is being conqstructed by a
Government trust fund.
(ii)   The Government's objectives for the project are twofold:
first, to meet projected increases in domestic non-flat steel demand with a
modern steel works that later can be expanded to produce a full range of
steel products at costs competitive wlth world standards; and secondly, to
further the goal of directing public investment towards under-developed areas
of Mexico and away from the concentrated wealth and economic activity of the
nation's center.  These have proven to be compatible objectives.  Even without
the inclusion of regional benefits or the economies to be expected with later
expansions, the project's viability can be demonstrated, and the Bank's
analysis has been carried out from this perspective.  Neverthel ess, institutional
aspects of the steel industry's growth and its relationship to the Las Truchas
project, as well as regional planning needs, have been central to the Bank's
discussions with the company and Goverrnmert throughout this appraisal, The
Bank's ±nvolvement also has led to improvements in project desIgn anid planni.ng
and has provided a basis for Mexican equipment suppliers to partic1pate in
procurem.ent under internatlonal competitive bidding.
(iii)  Total financing requlired for the project is an estimated
US$679 million, comprising US$636 milion for the iron ore mine, steel works,
and related facilities, US$32 million for interest during construetion, and
US$11 million to cover initial operating cash losses.  It is proposed that
the total be met by US$300 million ifn equity from the major shareholders
(the Government, NAPNSA, and Altos Rornos de Mexico, another Government
steel company), the US$70 million Bank loan, a parallel loan o1 US$54 million
from the Inter-American Development Bank (with which the Bank's ap?raisal has
been closely coordinated), parallel credits totalling about US$180 from the
bilateral financing agencies of nine industrial countries (Austria, Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United
States), and residual loans totalling about US$75 million. from yet-unidentified



- iin 
soZeces,  Th e iCovernment has guaranteed provision of the residual loans, as
well as any additional financing needed to guarantee project completion or to
coer- cost overruns,
(iv)  The project has been designed by SICARTSAts Operating and
Technical Adviser, Brit-sh Steel Corporation (BSC), and comprises facilities
for mining, ore beneficiation and pelletizing, blast furnace iron making,
basic oxygen steel mak±ng, and finished product rolling. Thte latest pollution
control technology has been, incorporatedy and SICARTSA .as shown a cortend-
a* le attitude towards etvironmerta: protection issues.  BSC staff have been
plaecd at various managment and snecialist levels throughout the organiza-
tion and in maxy cases fill functional nositions due to the comparative
ineanerience ofE most of SICARTSA's engineers. The arrangement is running
smoothly and a good project team has beeri assembled.
(,vr)   ICA-RTSA steel products will hae transported primarily by rail,
and a niew railway link w-ill5  be con.structed betvween the p-l ant site and tueva
Italia, where it Ulil  connect with tee ntiational railway system,  Because
thias 1ink will not be completed until 1298, road transport will be used during
the early operating pertlod and addiji onal resources wil'L be committed by the
Government to upgrade t .e existing road infrastructure.
('vi    Mexlno's consumption of finished steel o0roducts has grown at
a-n anrnual rate of 8.3 percsar-t over the past decade, reaehing 3.1 million
tons in 1972.  Appare'nt con-sumptIon of night non-fiat products was 1 2
milljion tons in 1972. reDresenting a 6.8 percent annmial growth rate over the
previaous decade,  BRy 19380  %e-mandi for these products is expected to grow
at a faster 9 i)ercent rate and reach 2.8 aillion tons, of which SICARTSA
will supply just over a third.  ExDorts b.y STCARTSA are not contemplated,
and imports plav on,l  a aineo -role in the nion-flat market   P rtces are subject

- iii -
economic return is projected at 12-13 percent based on the projected cost
of imported steel to Mexico over the 1976-91 period. The return is not
greatly sensitive to possible transport cost variation or to the rate of
production and sales buildup. It is most sensitive to possible increases in
production costs or a startup delay and cost overrun.  In no case, howaver,
does the return drop below 8 percent for the projected range of possibilities,
and even that level would resu'lt only from a combination of unlikely events.
An atceptable economic return exceeding 10 percent therefore is very probable.
Net foreign exchange savings are projected at a minimum of US$111 million per
year, so that the foreign exchange component of capital costs will be covered
in less than three years of full operation.
(ix)   The.Las Truchas project is judged the best of various alternatives
for the next step in Mexico's steel expansion program, but its maximum value
to the economy will be achieved only when the project moves into its second
stage, which will roughly double product capacity and show considerable econ-
omies of scale, as soon as market growth allows. This implies a need for
industry-wide planning that is only beginning in Mexico and has yet to be
firmly established.  A national steel coordinating Commission was formed by
the Government late in 1972 and has authorized a study of the industry now
being carried out by a foreign consulting firm, with results due in late
1973. Subsequently, a Government strategy for steel development is needed.
The Govern=ent has given the Bank assurances that it will take all reasonable
action to coordinate expansion in the inddustry and that it will neither
approve nor support future expansions or new steel works until market demand
and economic justification have been considered -- with the effect on
SICARTSA's second stage included in such consideration. Furthermore, the
Government has agreed to review steel prices in Mexico from time to time and
use its best efforts to maintain them at l.evels reasonable related to produc-
tion costs and world prices, while sharing increased productiorn efficiency
with steel consumers through lower -prices to the extent possible.
(x)   The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$70
milion equivalent for a term of 15 years, includin-g 5 years of grace.

. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Mexican Government development bank, Nacional Financiera,
S,A. (NAFINSA), and Siderurgica Lazaro Cardenas - Las Truchas, S.A.
(SICARTSA), a Goverment-owned company, have applied to the Bank for a
loan of US$70 million equivalent to help fina.nce the construction of the
first stage of an integrated iron and steel works and associated iron ore
mine on the nation's Pacific coast. The loan will be guaranteed by the
Mexican Government. The Las Truchas project, as it is commorn.y known
will be carried out in several stages likely to stretch over 15-20 years;
the first comprising plant and infrastructure needed to produce and ship
one million tons 1/ of light non-flat steel products (wire rods and light
bars and shapes). ?rovision has been made in planning for a technically-
matched second stage to produce steel plate, beginning perhaps 4-5 years
after Stage I startup in 1976. Later expansions into other flat steel
products (coil, sheet, etc.) will yield an ultimate capacity exceeding
1ive million tons of raw steel 2/ per annum.
1 .02      The Bank's appraisal has been predicated upon the need to
demonstrate the techrnical, financial, and economic viab±lity of the initial
stage alone. Nevertheless, because the later expansions will need to be
planned carefully as part of a rational strategy for growth of the entire
Mexican steel industry, one of the primary objectives of the Bank's involve-
ment has been, and should continue to be, to encourage the Government to
establish such a strategy.  Bank participation also has led to improvements
in project design and planning, and will facilitate a wider participation
of Mexican equipment suppliers   .nprocurement than otherwise would be
possible.
1.03       The appraisal has been carried out in close cooperation with the
Inter-American Developmert Bank (IDB), which is preparing a parallel loan
to SICARTSA for US$54 million equivalent. The project has been discussed
with the two banks  or several years, but formal applications £or Fijnancii g
were not made until late-1971. Several project preparation missions visited
Mexico between December 1971 and August 1972, followed by appraisal missions
in November 1972 and April and June 1973.
1.04       The appraisa<; was corducted and this report prepared by Messrs.

iron ore depos-ts of Las Truchas, adjacent to the Balsas River delta on
the Pacific ooast Csee mapE)   A project based on direct reduction of the

the obligations of all shareholders to subscribe and pay in capital as re-
quired by SICARTSA.
III. THE MEXICAN STEEL 12OUSTR, MARKET &VD PRICES
3.01       A detailed a-nalysis of Mexican steel supply, demand, and prices is
contained in Annex 1,
A.    Existing Producers
3.02       Over 80% of Mexico's present crude steel capacity i-s confined to
three fully-integrated producers: AHMSA in Monclova, Fundidora de Fierro y
Acero, S.A. (Fundidora) in Monterrey -- a private company with Government
and 1FC participatior. -- and Fojalata y Lamina, S.A. (HYLSA) -- a private
company with plants in 24onterrey and Puebla. The balance of production
is split amongst a small integrated seamless pipe producer in Veracruz ancd
six semi-integrated plants located mainly in Mexico City.  The industry's
total raw steel capacity is about 5.2 million annual tons and will rise to
5.7 million tons when Fundidora completes an expansion planned to precede
SICARTSA start-up. Historical data of capacity utilization, however, ir-
dicate that the above nominal capacity will yield only about 4.6 mil+ lion
tons of actual o-atput due to technical limitations.  The effective rolling
capacity of the Mexican industry substantially exceeds current steel making
capacity and is estimated at about 5.0 mil'lion tons of finished steel pro-
ducts (2.4 million tons of flat and 2.6 million tons of non-flat).  To fully
utilize this capacity would require about 6.7 milliorn tons of raw steel
input so that the industry still will be short, in nominal terms, by about
onp million tons of raw steel following Fundidora's expansior.
B.    Historical ConsMption
3.03       Apparent censumption 1/ of steel products In Mexico has increased
at an average annual rate of abo7ut 7.2% over the past 20 years and 3.3%
over the past decade, reaching an estimated 3.1 mil ion tons in  g97' --
equivalent to 4.2 million raw steel tons. The product split for 1972 was

The excess supply shown for 1978-79 represents about one yearVs growth in
consumption at that time. Given the conservative assumption of increased
capacity utilization in the existing industry, as veil as the tnrginal
nature of some of the existing rerollers (accounting for about 270,000 tons
of capacity), the projected phasing of SICARTSA's entry into the market is
justified, and SICARTSA's sales growth should not be limited by market
siz%. 1/ This, of course, will require ani effective marketing program.
E.    Steel Prices
3.06       Prices of steel products in Mexico are sutbject to G4overrnment
ceilings wLhich, for non-flat products, have not been raised since 1956.
Actual market prices have been below ceiling levels until comparatively
recently; but, because of recent production cost increases, substantial
pressures now exist for raising the ceilings. It has been assumed for
this appraisal that some increase will be allowed before SICARTSS begins
produttion in 1976 and t1hat real (uninflated) prices at that time will
be about 2-3% above present price levels - which are virtually at the
ceilings. On this basis, the average price (in 1973 currency) for the
assumed SICARTSA product mix will be about US$186 per ton delivered Mexico
City. The price assumptions beyond 1976 are discussed in para 6.05.
3.07       During negotiations, agreseart was reached that tne Gcvernment
would review steel prices in. Memico from time to time and use its best
efforts to maintain prices at levels that (i) are reasonably related to
Mexican production costs and world price levels and 1ii) are ouch as to
allow steel consumers in Mexico to share in any declz.ne in production
costs through reductions in steel prices.
PF    Comarison of Mexican ane World Prices
3,08       A world steel study was carried out by consultants to the Ban.k
early in 1973 in part to determine the likely level of delivered prices
that Mexico would have to pay If it chose to import steel instead oZ pro-
ducing it at Las Truchas. An abridged version of the consultants' study,
together with the Bank's conclusions, is contained in Annex 2.  uropean
export prices have been taken as the primry future influence on. world
prices, as they have been in the past, and a projection of the i'ceLy real
levels they might reach in 1985 has been made, based or, ?rojections of
real production cost increases that the !uropean prod¢ieers wiil 1Lsave to
bear by that time,  It has been concluded that she alverage list grica that
prevailed in Europe durirg 1970/171 for a product mix a>imllar 2o that of
SICARTSA would be the minimum long-term European export price g  3O.B.) that
1/   Imports and exports of the types of products SICXRTSA wi 1 produce havk
been negligible in the past, and no change is ex,ected for  -a -uture,
Hance, they have be-en ignored in the supply/demand projections.

ProjectLO1 perlod,  This iS a conservative judgment, based (i) on the fact
thot this average   ie yielded low profits to European producers under the
co3t structure dur-ing 1970/71 and (ii) evidence that long-term real costs
wil1 rise, not fall so S as to erode that low profitability even further if
roal prsces do not increase. For th^e maximum long-term price, projected
reaz- prouaction cost increases up to 1985 have been superimposed on the
19,v7CA/71 price lever to yield an average price that would approximate the
Europeans' desired avarage price I-evel at that time (based on full-cost
pricing). The range of orces that results, following the above logic,
is US$15i-19i per ton FO.EO Zuro-pe, expressed in constant 1973 dollars
as; based onr early 1973  exchange rates. For purposes of the Bank's economic
ano.lysis) hcrvever, it has beern assumed more conservatively that the most
lLkely average Euz:o'mean F.C.B.  rice over the 1976-91 period -- and there-
Loize the average pzi-ia that Meico ACourd have to pay for large volumes of

3,11       It is imperative that the Commission's work not stop wita the
Battelle study and that an actual Government strategy for steel evolve
from it. Without this, there is no guarantee that new or expansion projects
will not be undertaken unilaterally and that the industry will not be faced
with overcapacity in the late 1970's. Pursuant to this objective, agreement
was reached during negotiations that the Government (1) would take all rea-
sonable action required for coordinating the expansion of steel production
capacity in Mexico and (ii) that before approving or supporting the further
expansion of existing steel companies or the establishment of new steel
compantes, it would consider the market demand and economic justification
foi each, as yell as the impact on the second stage of the project.
IV,  THE PROJECT AND ITS EXECUTION
A.   Technical Description
4.01       A detailed technical description of Stage I of the project is
contained 4-n Annex 4-1 and of Stage II in Annex 4-2,
Technical Concept for Staze I
4.02       The project comprises the establishment and operat-lon of a rnon-
flat steel products plant with an initi-al capacity of about 1 .1 million
tons of raw steel per annum and I . million. tons of finished products.
The plant has been designed by SICARTSA's Operating and Technical Advisor,
British Steel Corporation (BSC), oa the basis of a detailed project review
carried out between May and September 1972. All facilities h.ave beeni laid
out (see Annexes 4-3 and 4-4) in a manner that will permit easy expansion
and diversification of production capacity to more than 5 millio . raw steel
tons per annum, The process route adopted for Las Truchas is based orn the
most modern technology available and is considered appropriate. The main
elements will be:
(i)  Mining and beneficiatLon of the Las Truchas iron ore works,,
with transport of concentrate by slurry pipeline to the steel
works;
(ii)  Agglomeration of the iron ore fines to form self-fluxi-g
pellets;
(iii)  Conventional coke making based on imported coals;
(iv)  Blast furnace iron making;
(v)  Basic oxygen (B.O.F.) steelmaking;
(vi)  Continuous casting of' billets;
(vii)  Rollirng of rod, bar and light sections  n two firishing
mills.

Other IRaw Materials
4.06       Coal will be entirely imported since no suitable coking coals are
available in the vicinity of the project, and transporting Mexico's relatively
low-quality coals from the northern part of the country would be uneconomic.
BSCis assisting SICARTSA in the selection of long-term overseas coal sources
(mo't likely Australia and/or Canada), and no supply problems are anticipated.
Limestone will be obtained from quarries within 50 km of the plant and,
although no firm decisions have been made as to the final loca:ion, problems.
are not anticipated.  Manganese ore, bentonite, and minor raw materials will
be purchased from Mexican sources and no difficulties are foreseen as to their
quality or availability.
B,    The Port of Lazaro Cardenas
4.07       The port, described in detail in Annex 5, is being constructed
by the Ministry of the Navy (Marina) at the mouth of the Balsas River and
comprises a dredged chiannel of 14 meters depth to accommodate 50-80,000 DWT
bulk coal vessels, deep water berths, and ancillary facilities. The Gov-
ement intends this to become a general purpose port and plans to construct
600 meters of quay in the first phase, of which 200 meters are required for
handling initial SICARTSA traffic -- imports of plant and equipment during
the construction phase and coal from 1976 onwards, and outward movement of
roughly 10% of steel product output for coastwise shipment to the north and
south of Mexico. The port plans have been reviewed by the Bank and are
considered technically and economically sound. Construction is well underway
and expected to be completed in time to meet SICARTSA's needs.
C.   Transport of Finished Products
4.08       About 90% of SICARTSA's output, or 900,000 tons per year beginning
in 1979, will need to be moved inland to the principal markets of Mexico
City, Guadalajara and elsewhere. A number of road, rail and sea alterna-
tives exist, requiring varying levels of investment for new facilities or
improvements to existing infrastructure (see Annex 6). Followimg a study
undertaken by consultants to SICARTSA, the Government has decided to construct
a railway link from the plant site to Nueva Italia, where it will connect
with the national railway system and give SICARTSA access by t",is mode to
most of its major markets. Because the link will aet be completed until
1978w however, road transport will be utilized for t.e first two years of
SICARTSA's production - unless studies still in progress demonstrate that it is
preferable to ship part of the steel by sea to Manzanillo during this pericd for
onward transport by rail,  No technical problems are foreseen. and the Govern-
ment has given the Bank appropriate assurances that resources will be commt-
ted as needed to upgrade the road to Nueva Italia and to complete the railway
link at the earliest possible date. SICARTSA alsa has committed itself to sub-
mit to the Bank for comment by September 1974 its onm detailec plbns for steel
product transport, including organizationa<1 arrangements.



ice2 Ci:y a: ;      '~;OCardeinas
A new City, described In detail in Annex 7, will be constructed
-;o provide resldential and commercial facilities for SICARTSA's 4,000-man
Stage I workforce and their families and, later, to serve as the urban
coT:e for a poassibl  90>000 persons who will populate the Las Truchas area
by the year 2000 Kr,nnax '7). Planning for and construction of the city,
o be locatad on 0S6 hectares adjacenz to the steel works, are under the
su-ervision of a u Jvernmai=t Trust Fund tormed for this purpose.  SICARTSA
'aresentcc oT    2u muAts Bard o' DiTectors, but will have no financial
obligation to t'he eity.  Detailed construction plans for housirng and
itn:rastructr.e are -ot yet complete&ee, but the Bank has reviewed the general
seh,za  and found    satisfactory. The implementation schedule, however,

incorporated into &e steel works are contai;ned in Annex 4-1; and the
general objectives fot pollution controa are outlined in Annex 8. The
total capital cost of Identiflable pollution control steps is estimated
dt US$15 million a t &ie adcitior to operating costs at about US$2 per
to:, af steel producc.
During -cozSiatzGfonl  SICARTSLA gave assurances to the Bank that
it would cortiLnul  o carry cut the project with due regard to environmeantal

the direct control co SICSaTSA and are effected by a var-iety of Government
and private agenciec tnv&.ved in Sheir development.  A consulting ecologist
vtz-ted the project regsion for the Bank in August 1972, and conducted a
areral survey of C.s problemas presented by the above infrastructure devel-
qpnant, as we:: as the general ecological effects of building a huge steel
wxks tn this heret_ofore undeveloped area. From his report, it can be

tan,jo tourism project, 100 km down the coast, which the Bank is helDing to
finance. In the project area, however, the consultant identified a number
of,possible hazards, including the destruction of mangrove estuaries through
land-fill operations, upsetting certain natural systems that provide natural
waste treatment and nutrients."foa off-shore marine life, and possible eutro-
phication of the waters withia the new port because of inhibited natural
flusking. action.
4e13       The latter problem seems now to have been resolved through
changes in the port design, but others will remain. Longer-range planning
is needed, and the Bank therefore will encourage the Governrment to prepare
a master land-use plan for the Michoacan/Guerrero coastal region. Insofar
as the Bank is involved in the Las Truchas project and Zihuatanejo tourism
development, and possibly will participate in a proposed forestry project
in Guerrero, a Bank offer of assistance to the Government in drawing up this
plan will be forthcoming.
Pto ect Orga~nizatior. and M4anagement
4.14       Responsibility for project execution rests with SICARTSA, under
its Director General, former cabinet member Ing. Adolfo Orive Alba, and
Project Manager Ing. Carlos Molina, a man with many years of experience
in the Nexican zonstruction industry.  (A chart of SICARTSA's present organ-
ization for the construction period is shown in Annex 9,) They are receiving
substantial assistance from BSC in all technical, financ7al, marketing and
organizational aspects of the project. 1/ BSC at present has about 65 resident
specialists in Mexico, and will continue at this general level of assistance
th,roughout the construction period and into the initial period of operations.
BSC counterpart staff are assigned at various levels throughout the organiza-
t_on, including the general management of the company, and most technical.
areas henve BSC staff in functional, not merely advisory capacities, The
arrangtement appears to be running smoothly and a good technical tearn has been
put togeth.er 
4,15       Overall, SICARTSA's organizational arrangements are considered
eaproptiate to the company's needs, The major weakness has been that the
important financial planning and marketing functions have been contained in
the Economics and Finance Division, where they have not received adequate
attention as comercial (versus economic) subjects.  tDuring negotiations,
howsver, SICARTSA informed the Bank that this division would be split into
separate economic planning, financial planning/control, and sales divisions,
with the latter two headed by qualified executives. These arrangements are
considered satisfactory, as are the procedures SICARTSA has indicated it will
follow to inform the Bank of the professional qualifications of appointees to
these posts, and other executive positions.
I/ The BSC group includes sub-contracted staff from W.S. Atkins & Partners
and 1icLeltan and Partners, both of the United Kingdom. Specialized assistance
in pelletizing has been sub-contracted to Koninklijke NederLandsche Floogovens
en Staalfabricken NV of the Netherlands, and in iron ore exploration and mine
planning to Societe Francaise DtEtudes Minieres (SOFREINES) of France,

Labor Force
4.26       By the end of 1973, approximately 1,750 persons will be working
on construction of the steel works. The work force will increase to about
7,000 by the end of 1974 and peak at 9,300 in 1975. The operational labor
force will total about 3,700 persons, excluding head office and sales per-
sonnel (Annex 10).  Of these, about 7% will be associated with the iron ore
mine and related ore processing and transport facilities. Operating labor
will comprise toughly half of the labor force and maintenance employees a
third. The balance will be supervisory, administrative, ard other salaried
staff.  The total implies a labor productivity of about 8 man-hours per ton
of finished product-  hich is very good by world standards for plants of

4017       Training of the above labor force will be carried out by a new
Training and Development Department as outlined in Annex 10. The program
has been discussed in detail with the Bank and is considered consistent with
tha goal of facil'itating successful start-up and initial operatior. of the
plant. A new training center wlll be financed in part by a grant of
US$500,000 equivalant from the British Overseas Development Administration
(ODA), which also will be applied tovards the cost of training senior
Nexican personnel iv U.2 steel works.

4.18       ?roject completion is planned for mid-1976 in accordance with
tt'e schedule shok-n in Annex 11.  Tbia schedule is tight but achievable if
the momentum estabiished over the pas-- year can be maintained.  This will
require Government cooperation i4 expediting the registration of purchase
contracts and issuace of import licanses, and appropriate assurarnces in
this respect were oiven by the Gpvern-ment during negotiations.  Civil works
are already underway and ini tial letters of intent to place orders for major
equipment packages are beginning to go out. It is expected that the first
firm orders (withi escape clauses) for items the Bank has been asked to
finance (para. 5210) will be placed prior to consideration of the project
b- the 3ank's Board.  In view of the necessity to maintain project schedules,
the Bank has agread to recommend to t"ae Executive Directors retroactive
£inancing of up tD US$3 million (4.3% of the loan) to cover the maximum
projected expenditures <-ior to Loan signing.

5.06       The Bank, IDB and Bilateral loans and credits together constitute
a parallel financing scheme, in which each lender finances separate lists
of goods and services and disbursements are handled independently.  T&-
gether, the Bank and IDB have been asked to provide almost a third of external
financing, and this has been sufficient to give the two institutions a
key role in project planning,
5.07       The Bank loan would be for 15 years, including 5 years of grace,
at the prevailing interest rate of 7-1/4% plus a NAEINSA guarantee fee of
1-3/4%, bringing the total cost to the company to 9%. The IDEB loan would
be on similar terms, but at 8% interest with a single 3/8% payment made
to NAFINSA as a service fee.  Bilateral credit agreements have been final-
ized or are being negotiated with Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the basis of
preliminary commitments made in 1971/72. There is no danger that adequate
bilateral f:inancing will not be available. The terms vary somewhat, but on
average provide for the credits to cover 90% of the c & f value of equipment
from suppliers in the respective countries, plus 15% of this value for Mexican
currency expenditures, for an average of 15 years with 4 years of grace (or
11 years repayment beginning 12-18 months after commissioning of the equip-
ment) at an average cost to SICARTSA of 7%. The company's equity requiremaent
of US$300 million will be met in Mexican currency by the existing shareholders
as described in paragraph 2.03. The equity will be made available during
the construction period, according to a schedule agreed with the Bank during
negotiations.  Together with the above loans and credits, this yields total
financing of US$603.1 million, or US$75.4 million short of total require-
ments,through the construction and initial operating periods. The residual
amount will not be needed until 1976 and 1977, as the financial projections
in Annex 16 indicate, and the source of this financing has not yet been
identified.  Its provision will be adequately covered by the Government's
completion and overrun commitments described below.

The Bank will disburse the full c & f cost of equipment for all items, irre-
Mpeitive of the origin of the goods (excluding non-Batk mmbers),
5.11       The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1977
accor4ing to the schedule shown in Annex 12-4.
B    Other Procurement
5.12       Bilaterally-financed equipment items are being procured under
the same general principles of international competitive bidding as those
followed for the Bank and 1DB' lists, except that credit terms are taken
into consideration during bid evaluations. Mexican sub-suppliers are re-
coiving a similar 152 margin of preference in bid evaluation to encourage
bilateral lenders to allow suppliers in their respective countries to maximize
the use of iMexican resources. About US$30 million of additional equipment
has been reserved for procurement in Mexico. These are sma£ler items,
such as cranes, motors, spumps etc. for which adequate competition can
be pbtained in Mexico, and the arrangements are judged satisfactory. Civil
works and all structures, except for the large rolling mill buildings
contained in the Bank list, are being procured competitively in Mexico
and, like the Mexican equipment, are being financed by equity and the local
components of bilateral credits. The same is true for most of the erection
and commissioning contracts. The lack of international competitive bidding
is not judged likely to raise prices artificially for any of these items.
The Mexican construction Industry is large enough to absorb the project
without overheating, andno problems are anticipated ini obtaineing necessary
labor skills.
VI,  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Projected Revenues
6.o1       The assumed buildup of revenues is shown in Anneax 13 and is
aMsed on SICARTSA's projected commissioning period of 2-1/27years from
startup in mid-1976 to full poduction in 1979. This is considered realistic
for a plant of this type and is achievable if the training and commission-
ing progrms are carried out as planned. In accordance with the conclu-
sions in para. 3.06, the average sales price delivered Mexico City is
US$185,5 per ton of steel product (in constant 1973 currency). After
sales costs, taxes, and discounts, the average net yield to SICARTSA
betomes US$176.3 per ton. Escalation is then applied as show. in
">:ar  6,05.

6.02       Operatingn costs have been estimated on the basis of BSC estimates
of fixed and varicbLe consumptions of raw materials, labor, fuel and energy,
ctableso, main taace materials and sundries for each cost center.  Labor
costs have been based on detailed manning schedules, projected minimum wage
ratvs ln t -.e ,roje st area following plant completion  and analyses of the
pa:roll cost structuras oa other steal companies in Mexico. Materials and
mergy prces hava been taken at preiacling unit rates in Mexico and ad-

tae$hods have been  i:c awad by the Bank &ad are considered acceptable.
6,03       Total oterating costs, excludino depreciation, interest, and
fiAnshed prod-ct C:ram rort, are estimted at US$590.1 per ton of finished
product, of which .iLd costs constit-ate US$15.6 per ton (27%) and variable

The tota. is low by .orle standards, but is considered realistic in view of
the savings to be o& anied by basing the project on local iron ore.  The
projected fuZl cost & firon ore pellets into SICARTSAgs blast furnace is
about US$10 per toa  whi; is at least US$7 below comparable costs to
European and Japanase --oMducers. This implies a total operating cost sav-
inJg  of 'S$11-1'2 pr t'o- of finiahed product, ot about 17% of what total
unit operating cast$3 might be if SiaGTSA had to import iron ore.

qit: be used to all markets -- the most conservative alternative cost-wise.
Tht cost fron Las Truchsas to 'Mexico City is estimated at US$13.6 per ton and
Is considered an appropriate average based on prevailing rates in Mexico.
Since SICARTSA needs to absorb transport costs for only the 60% of its output
act-ally destined 5= ':Axico City (Annex 1), its true road transport cost would
tS otly US$8.2 per ton of total plant output.

D.   Escalation in the Financial Projections
6.05       To provide a reasonably accurate picture of SICARTSA's liquidity
position during the early years of operation, the Bank's financial projec-
tions have been based on operating costs escalated at 3% per annum, repre-
senting a composite of expected rates of increase for the various plant
inputs. With prices it has been assumed that 1976 levels in real (unin-
flated) terms would be about 2-3% above those prevailing in mid-1973 and -that,
subsequently, current prices would increase about 2% per annum, or roughly
1% below the rate of increase for operating costs. Depreciation and finan-
cial charges are not escalated esice they relate to capital costs that re-
main on the books at historical values. The price assumption is conserva-
tive and is intended to demonstrate (i) that SICARTSA can remain financially
viable even if its prices rise at a lower rate than the general rate of in-
flation in Mexico anud (ii) that SICARTSA thereby can be expected to exert
a positive restraining influence on future Mexican steel price increases
under competitive conditions.

The projections show losses for the first 18 months of operation, followed
by a profit of US$24 milliout or 9% of shareholders equity, in 1978. From
1979 through 1983, anmual net income is a very adequate 15-19% of share-
holders equity, but it drops subsequently to about 10% after income
taxes come into full effect in 1984. Prior thereto, SICARTSA will have the
benefit of accelerated tax depreciation given to new enterprises in
specially-designated development regions, the effect of which is to enable
the company to avoid paying taxes until its assets are fully depreciated
on the tax books. Cumulative losses are covered by 1979 and cumulative

,, Sena$tiviy Anlysis
6.08       An analysis has been carried out to determine the sensitivities of
the projected rate of return and various indicators of SICARTSA's financial
position to changes in basic assumptions. Two sets of0 tests have been run,
the first pertaining to the projected production and sales buildup period
of 2-1/2 years (the "A"1 cases) and the second assuming an extended 5-1/2
year buildup period (the "B" cases) that could result if plant commission-
ing were not to proceed as fast or the market were to grow slower than
expected. The former is considered more probable and therefore was chosen
for the preceding financial projections. The results of the sensitivity
analysis are shown in Annex 15-5 and summarized below:

The primay effect of the slower buildup is to reduce surplus cash genera-
tion over the 1976-80 period, and, therefore, the internal resources that
would be available for Stage II expansion.  It does not greatly affect the
rate of return or the early liquidity picture, as shown by debt service
coverage in 1977-78. A further cost/price sqiueeze of 1t per annum (beyond
the 1% squeeze already implicit in the base cases) reduces the rate of re-
turn by about 1% and has a marginal effect on liquidity and cash accumula-
tion. A reduction in capital costs of US$60 million, or about 10%, would
yield significant benefits in all areas with the opposite true for an
equal increase in costs and a one-year startup delay. Operating costs are
important, but not found to be critical within the 15% range of error as-
sumed in Cases 5 A and B. This is considered the most probable of all the
sensitivity cases.

VII. ECONO,MIC JUSTIFTCATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Las Truchas Versus Alternative Steel Expansions
7.01       This issue is addressed in detail in Annex 16-1,  The Las Truchas
project has been chosen from amongst seVeral alternatives for the next
major step in Mexico's steel expansion, among which have been (i) importa-
tion of semi-finished steel products for domestic rolling into finished
products; (ii) production of steel iin electric furnaces, based on sponge
iron and imported scrap; and (iii) fully-integrated steel production
schemes, either as expansions of existing Mexican plants or as new projects
adjacent thereto.  The first route would be impractical as a means of
meeting future demand growth insofar as supplies of semi-finished steel on
world markets would be difficult to obtain on a reliable, long-term basis
and, even if obtainable, would be expensive.  The secornd alternative also is
unattractive as a major production route given Mexico's position as a net
importer of scrap, the unreliability of imported scrap supplies and prices,
and the high opportunity cost of electricity in the country. The third
route implies a number of separate alternatives which basically are less
attractive than Las Truchas because of restraints imposed by their loca-
tions. SICARTSA's location adjacent to its iron ore supply and a deep
water port facility will give it raw material advantages unmatched at any
of the locations of the existing integrated producers. The coastal site is
in keeping with the world-wide pattern in recent years to place new steel
works at sites where they can utilize high-quality imported raw materials
transported from distant locations in large bulk carriers.  In the long run
I esico will need to import iron ore, and when the Las Truchas reserves are
depleted, SICARTSA rill be in a position to import it at far less cost
than the present inland producers.  SICARTSA also is about 30% closer to
the main Mexico City steel market than its major competitors; anad, although
the project will hasten the need for improvements irn tne regional. transport
system, the long-term economic costs of moving its finished products shouid
be lower than those of the existing producers.
B.   Economic Return
7.02       Steel import prices used in the economic return calculation are
those discussed in para. 3.11.  Costs have been based on the financial
estimates, with adjustments made for taxes and higher energy, port, and
transport costs, as shown in Annexes 16-2 and 16-3. Labor costs have
not been shadow-priced. All economic projections have been made on
a constant-price basis. A graphical representation of the economic
return calculations is found in Annex 16-4. The basic return is 12-13%
for the likely range of import prices, assuming the probable 2-1/2
year production buildup period, and from 11-12% for the slower 5-1/2
year buildup. At the maximum vossible long-term price, the return rises
to 15-16%. Increasing the assumed transport cost by 50% -- a level con-
sidered sufficient to take in virtually any transport cost contingency --



24 
lowers the enoromic retu-rin by only 1%, so that it can be concluded that
transport is not a serious economic i3sue.  Combining a 1 5% increase in
operating  and port costs with the above transport increase yields an economic
return range of 8-tt%, simlar to the 8-10% range that results from a
one year startup delay and capital cost overrun of US$60 million.  Trn no
case does the return drop below 8%, and even that level would result only
from a combination of un]ikely events.  If full shadow pricing had been
utilized, it is likkely that these retturns would have been higher, it
therefore is concIUded that the ?robability of an economic return exceeding
10% is very high, nig the project econonicaly viable in the Miexican
contexts
C,   fFor2ign Exchean&e Svigs
7.03       The direct foteign exchange (FE% effects of the project are shown
in Annex 16-5,  Indirect FE effects have been ignored.  Over the 1976-91
operating pei-iod, net FE savingn  are projected at US$1 ,714 million, or an
average savings of JS$111 millit per year, The annual figure implies that
the FE compoaent of capital investment in the project, US$292 million,
will be covered in less tha  three avetage years of operation. The a',ove
estimates are felt to oe conervAtive insofar as the benefit stream 1s
based on the ninimma steel itpcrt Zrice used in. the preceding economic
analysis and therefote reflecto the   rvmun  projected gross FE savinags to
Mexico through import substitution.
D.   Regional IM-DECt of the ?ro.E~it
7.04       Regional or secondary benefits of the project have not been taken
into account in the preceding ecanomxic analysis. Nevertheless, as described
in Annex 17, the project's impact on the surrounding re-ion should be
considerable,  The regional employment effect most likely will be through
SICARTSA's generation of deand for supplies and through the demand of its
employees for constmer goods and services -- so-called "backward` linkages.
"Forward" linkages to ner  industries in the area that will use SICAiTSA's
products are not likely to be larae, particularly in the first stage. An
analysis has been carrieC out of the actual impact the &MiSA steeL plant
hacl on the city of B,orclova following 4ts construction in the 1940's
and the results have been transferred to the Las Truchas case. If this is
any guide -- and there is reason to 'believe it is -- the urban populat iLon
in the Las Truchas area is likel  to rise from the present 15,000 persons
to over 90,000 by the end ofE the century. It could well be higher, given
the other resources ir. t'he regno.

Introduction
1. The Mexican steel indastry traces its modern history back to
1900, when the first integrated iron and steel plant ias established at
Monterrey by Fundidora de Fierro y Acero, S.A. (Fundidora), iwith capacity
for 90,000 tons of ingot steel per year, and a rolling mill -for shapes and
rails.  It produced 11,003 tons of steel in 1903, the first year of produc-
tion, and by 1911 out ut had risen to 72,000 tons. The next major d3velop-
ment took  pLace in 19   5 when Altos Hornos de Meico, S.A. (Pfi2MA) was
formd to set up an integrated steel mill for flat products at Monclova.
The plant was concesived as a wartime measure, to achieve a meaaure of in-
dependence from imports, and was giv-en special facilities for procuring new
and used equipment from the U.S.A.9 it was commssioned for produotion oly,
in 1945. S.nce then the industry has grown considerably, and Miexico Is
present a&nnual capacity for awa steel prodction is estimated at 5 2 million
tons, distributed among the various comanies as shown below:

3. The irstalled capacilt,y for rolling finished products is sub-
stantialIj in excess of the industry's current steel makdng capacity.
SI0LRTSA has estimated the effective rolling capacity of the indufstry at
about 2.4 million tons of flat products, 1.8 million tons of light non-
flat prodccts, 0.6 m=Liorn tons of heavy sections, and 0o.2 million tons of
seanaless pipes  for a total of about 5.0 rillion tons.  This estimte
assumas th  effect:ve rolling capacity of tae integrated mil;ls at 90%S of
n nal cap&-ty,      semfintegrated mills 80%, and the non-itegratd
units 70%. These percentages are considered reasonable as measures of true
capabiities; althcugh they exceed aatual performance to date by any of the
major categories of producers.  Since five million tons of finished prodcucts
would require about 607 million tons o0? raw steel input, and the existing
raw steel capacity is cnI. about 5.2 mllion tons, the country is nomrially
short about I3  mir tons. T is gap will be reduced tuo about 1 illion

4. Appam zt aonxpon  of steel products In Mexico has increased
duxing the past 20 years at an average  nirnual rate of about 7.7%, though it
has fluctulatad suibstan tally from yeaz to year. Apparent consuiuption exceed-
ed 1 .0 million tons eqival-ent for the first time in 1956, and by 1965 had
risen to 2 million  ns, desite four years during which consumption declined
or shawed no appreciable grovth.  Me av,erage annual go-wth rate for 1952-62
was 7.1%; and the record for the following decade was somwhat better, kith
apparent conrsPtion izcaasing from 1Q.4 mLLn tons in 1962 to 3.1 million
tons in 19723 or a, &erage annual grov7th rate of 8.3%. During the 1971
recession, aparen t cornmption dropped to 2.8 million tons. For. details
see Table 1-1.
5. From 1953 onardls, the aron   d Steel Manu:facturere Assoaiation
(C-NI) has maintained continuous detai2ed records of consunption by produLct
group (see Table 1-2,). They indicate that from 1962 to 1972 appa-rent con-
strption of non-flat -prodcuts increased fron 680,000 tons to 1,312,000 t3ons
(6.8% annual rate)  tle that of flat rolled products increased from 566,000
tonrs to 1,552,000 tons (9.9% annual, rate). During the same period, the
apparent consizption of seamless pipe increased very lit-le: fronm 130,00

in recent years.  arst thae BaXnk of Mexico alttepted a proJection for- the
period 1967-76, based on itS expental input-outvuuu model for the 'eican
econov (h5 sectors). This was part of a large exercise for- foecasting
development of the M4xican economry, and was superseced by studies undertaken
by Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NALFNSA), Vnich has a substant.al interest inp
the two largest steel companies, AIfMSA and Fundidora, as well as SICARTSA,
NAFINSA prepared an independenit lon-a-term forecast in 1969 which was updatad
in May 1971. CNIE  also prepared demand forecasts for the period 1971-80 n
1969 and again in 1971. Finaly, takd.n these studies into accow-t. SIW.R*SA
prepared its on forecasts, focusing on demand for the non-rlat prodaots of
the proposed project.
7. NAFINSA's projection of steel demand (1969) was derived frorm
a linear progranming model of the industrial sector. It estimated growth
of demand at an annual average rate of 9.5% through the decade, and was
based on tUie assumption that GDP would grow at 7.1% annually da-rng thre6
period.  The revised 1971 estimate also assumed growth of GDP at 7.1% annually,
but projected growth of demand for steel at 8.9% per year for 1970-75, and
8.7% per year for 1976-80.  Mae changes in the second estimate  eire not fuLly
explainied; they appear to have been infLuenced to some extent by tne actuaL
record of growth in 1969 and 1970, and by the analysis undertaken by SICARrTRAo
8.  TNIHA's 1969 forecast envisaged growth of demand av ar average
annual rate of 11 ,4% for 1971-75 and 10,5% for 1976-80. The revised 1971
forecast offered two projections: a low rate of 6.5%,  =nual growth through
the decade, and a high rate of 9.0%. The differences between the twro fore-
casts, and the assumptions on which the low a=d high growth r-ates o ' the
1971 forecasu are based, were rnot explaized.  However, ONIH. ds;oends to a
large extent upon forecasts made by member fims, and changes -i their ex-
pectations have a direct bearing on the Association estimates for the fiatu::ea
It should be mentioned that a forecast made by CNIMEA staff in ae zrLd-60's;
which estimated raw steel demand in 1970 at 3.84  million tons, tZurned oubt> to
be very close to the actual figure -- 3.89 million tons,- but it was based on
an assuiption that GDP would grow at 6% annually in the years 1965-70, or
about 1% below the actual.  In the end, the wide gap between the .ow,- =d
high projections for the decade of the 70's detracted somewhat 1'rOa the us_-
fulness of the CNIKA forecasts.
9X  SICARTSAs first estimate of demand for steel n_ ,l;xcoc, madc
in 1971, fo7zowed the pattern of eanlier studies by XAFI'INS. and was based
on broad assumptions regarding the rate of growth of MtP, thc- rnpoportion of
gross fixed capital formation (G,'F) in GDP and changes there-in - rou&h
time, the correlation of steel consumption to GFCF and GDP, and c. anges in
the indirect consumption of steel, which is related to import- of capital
goods.  It projected growth of derand in tshe period 1972-7? k,   aabout 70,1
per year and for 1976-80 at 8.6% per year. A second 3ICATS  r& ecton,
made in the light of corsimption deat  for 1971 and part of 1972, envisaged
growth of demand ir, the first half of the decade at soriewhat ^ess than 9%
per year, and for the second half of the decade (1976-80) at 8g5% ?er year!
In terms of produ.ct tons, NexcLco Is demand was estimated at 4.9  llion tons
for 1976, rising to 6.9 million tons in 1980.

10   n        1973, SICA RTSA revised its market projectiorns using
,972 instead of 1970 as the base year and, theraby, refLecting the delay in
dw.aid growLt caausea by the 1971 recession.  Tliis third SICARTSA forecast is
s2i&htly lower than the second one and shows a total demand for 6.2 million
tor4s of raw steel i4 1976) rising to 9.2 million tons in 1980. Demand for
non-flat prodacts of the type SICARTSA will produce is projected at 1.8
million tons in 1976 and 2.8 million tons in 1980, or an annual growth rate
of 9% from the 1972 level. These estimates appear to be based on realistic
a =tions, and are -aed for the Bark market assessment.
11. The incezase in the non-flat grawth rate to 9% from the.6.8%
that prevailed durig the pravicus decade is  ustified in view of the expect-
ed continuatior of the Meican Goveranent's housing and public works programs
that grew very substantially with the comig of the present adminis tration
in t970. A comparative statement of SCIARTSA's three projections and those

If current plans of ex-stirg mLlls for expansion of capacity are car-ied out,
the total rolling czpaoity may rise to about 2.1 million tons by 1980. It
should be noted, hoavevr, that the existing capacity for 1.8 million tons at

in paragrph 103, ar  shown in Table 1-5. The estimated e=ess. rolling capa-
city of 583,000 tons in 1972 is projected to fall to about 255,000 tons in
1976, and actual supply more or less to balance against total demand. There-
after, supply may exceed demand by quantities ranging up to about 275,000
tons per year in 1978 and 1979; but by 1980 demand is expected to catch up
ith supply,  The excess supply anticipated for 1977-79 represents about- one
year's expected growth in conswVtion at that time. Therefore0 given the
conservative assw8ption of increased capacity utilization in the exsting
industry, as well as the margnal nature of some of thae exstizg rerollers,
there appears to be safficient justification for SICARTSA coming into pro d2c-
tion as scheduled. The possible excss of supply between 1976 and 1980
neverthelese emphasizes the need for SICARTSA to build up an effective mar-
keting program if it is to secure the 35% market share represer4ted. by its
projected output in 1980 (1.0 million tons out of an expected demarnd for 2.8
million tona3.
14. Irports and exports in the past of the types of pro.dtcts
SIOARTSA mill produce have been negligible and are not expected to be signi-
f1cant in the future. Therefore, they have been ignored in the above supply/
demand projection.

15. Prices of steel pro&ucts in Nexco are contro1led by the Price
Commission, an agency of the Finistry of Commerce and Industry. In practice,
however, this oontrol has been nominal until recently since ceiling prices
have been fixed at levels seldom achieved in the mareietplace. Ceiaing prices
for non-flat rolled steel products were fixed in 1956 and have not been revised
for the past fifteen years. Moreover, market prices as late as January 1972
for the most imortant categories of products -- reinforcing bars -- were
substantially lower than the permissible ceiling prices. They were almost
at ceiling level in '969% but declined in4 1970 and continued to be depressed
i3 19719. More recent (1973) prices have alimbed back to ceiling 1ievel, and
t1he positive outlook for demand, together with rising production costs iri
Me-xco (as eve ryuhre )  indicate strongly that they will not fa] ; sibstantially
in the fatum.  indeed, there are substantial pressures from the lajor pro-
8ers to have non-flat price ceilings raised by about 15%, but no action is
anticipated until completion of -the Steel Ccmmission study of the Lidustry
(see Anmex 3),
16. Prices of flat-roleId products, also originally fixed. in 1950",

not fLmd and are aeted dirwtl  by competitive conditions, causing net
ex-factory realization often to be loer than the prmissible limit. This
is partiaularly tre for sales in the Federal District of Mexico City and
surrounding area, wich account for over 60% of total steel sales in the
country. In the smallar markets of other reslons, steel producers are more
often able to oharge full p4ces3 plus trwaport costs as we1l; but sales

tions are po¢sable   r-, the first place, tJ2e indiees indicate that the
prices of 'nor-flats products fluctuate more    ly cver time than the com-
posite prico of aJ°i stasl prodcts.  One explaenatcr. may be that .n both
the EC and Ja)an non-flat products, exot -ire rods, are prodaced by
relatiwe2  lsne nmbens of fairly awZ. pzrcO cers sad sold to a large

17,  i  low prices that prevailed from S962 to 1968 are generaJ1r attribtied
to the existence of ewzess prodaction owpacity and intense competition among
steelmakers in all maSmts during the period. in addition, thers is no doubt
that the low nrice le.7el was partially caused by productivtty inoreases in
Japan and a faw minor steel-prooncing nations that continuously eceeded in-

that the d   lopment  described above -- the increasing gap betweer4 Japanese

the European level -- apparentay continued.  Fr instance, the export price
of wire rods of the BC appraised by Metal Bl1etin rose from $123 in March
to $1h5 in December 1972s -ile the Japanese export price of xiee rods quoted
by a major trade firm ancreased from $1117 to $136 during the same period (see
Table 2-10).  In comarison, at the end o Jaauazy 1973, the domestic base
pr.Ce of wi  rodz was $166 in Germany, $157 in France, and $176 in Belgiumi

19. In general , the findings of the previous section stil). hold:
firstly, world steel prices surged u.pwards after 1968; secondlr, begnning
about 1969, Japanese home and export prices have remained beLow European
levels; and thirdly, the diffarentials between Japan and the BE  have been
ider in home prices than in export prices.  In adition, it car be concludsd
that &aropean export prices have been loi-er than home prices in most years,
but that Japanese export prices have beenr hiher than home prices since 1970.

23. World steel prices, masurd in terms of the hope a-,d aport
prices of Japan and the EC fol' owed a declining trend until 19686   Tis is
attributable to excess  orld-ids supply capacity, keen competition in all
markete, and prodctivity increases in Japan. The trend took an xward tu=n
in 1969, iiich hc  persisted until the present me.
2l. Ths fact that world steel prlces d1id not fall e        g-ficantly
during the recession of 1971 -- in thie =m=er they had declined dig preious

reflects, in some degre, the sccess of deLiberate ef2orts undertaken by
Japanese and Europear producers to stabilize prices =z domestic and inter-

25. Home prices of non-flat steel products in Japan were $20 to
$50 lower than those in the EC in 1971, AIthough more recent data are incomplete --
and the long-term effects of recent currency realignments are not imoun, it
appears that the differences betweer. European and Japanese home prices have
videned further since 197:.
26. 0 he differences between Eluropean and Japanese ex-port -rices
were slight in 1971 and have reamained more or less the same up w _th_e present
time.  This phenomenon is partly eplained by the lower export prices thaat
have been cuoted by European producers in 2elation -to homrre pricas, and partly
by the tendency of Japanese producer-s to "alaig" their export -rices to the
European level.  This finding, aside from its own significance, also shows that
any attempt to assess an indwastryfs unit production cost on the sole basis of
its export prices is fraught wit-h peiil.
27. Fina 1lyl  tie stucdy points aot thqat "intezationa- :icesr" are

EroSpean steel-makers have -harged e:a3ort prices which, when reduced to an FOB
level, differ substantially according, to destination.

international steel prices.
Conclusion for Las T¢chas
32. To forecast the long-term opportunity cost for Mexican steel
i-ports to be used in the economic evaluation of the Las Truchas project
(Aznex 16), the Bank has chosen to use an expected range of EC export prices
based on the )ieller/Kawahito pro-ections. This has been based on the
following considerations:
(±) Japan most likely will continuLe to align its export prices
to EC levels as it has in the past0  Hence, the EC figures shLouild be used
as the basis for future projections.
( i) The relatively high home market prices that have prevailed
in Europe since late 1972 are beginning to yield reasonable profits to an
industry that has not been characterized by profitable operations for some
years. Accepting the proposition that some form of internationa3 cooperation
to forestall future overcapacity is likely -- or at least that the depressed
ettuation of recent years will not reoccur -- and recognizing the inevitable
upward pressure on real costs that the industry will face, it can be concluded
that average long-term real       t price s from the EC are very unlikely to
fall below the 1970/71 average 'hnoms prices referred to previously.
33. On the above basis, the Bank's econo2rc evaluation has assuaed
the average minimi real export price from Europe ove- the 1976-91 projection
period will be US$156 per ton FOB Europe, the Mueller/Kawahito estimate of
the home price average for 1970/71, adjusted for exchange rate changes. Tnhe
maximum has been taken as their projected average unit production cost in the
EC for l985, Us$19l per ton. 1/ The most likely average level within this
range is difficult to project. On the one hand, obtaining suppl-es of
upward of one million tons per annum from European exporters probably would
have to be under long-term contract and, therefore, at prices somewhat closer
to full production costs than would be paid by spot buyers of steel. On the
other hard, the historical tendency of steel prices to deviate from ful
production costs makes it imprudent to expect that the upper end of the above
price range would be likely as an average over the projection period.  It
therefore is concluded that the probable long-term price would fall in the
-ower third of the range, or US$156-l68 per ton.

;=3CO -    TRUCl3HAS STEL PROJECT
TECHNICAL DESCRPTIOI OF STAG  I OF TIE  ROJECT
1. The project is for the establishment and operation of a non-
flat steel products plant vith an initial capacity of about 1.1 miLion tons
of raw steel per annum. and 1.0 million tons of finished products.  The plant
flowsheet is shownr in Annex 4-3 and the layout in Annex 4-4. The facilities
have been laid oat and  designed in such a vay as to permit an easy expanSion
and diversification of productfion capacity to more than 5.0 million raw
ateel tons Per alram.
2, The process roate adoptedi for the Las Truchas s-teelworks is
detailed in succeeding sections of this Annex and is suTnmarized below:
(a)  MAining and benzeficiating the Las Truchas iron ore
with transport of concentrate in slurry form to the
plant site;
(b)  Agglomerating the iro-n ore fines to fona self-fluxing
pellets;
(c)  Conventional coke making based on imported coals;
(d) Iron making by the blast furnace method;
(e) Basic oxygen (B.o.,v.) steelmaking;
(f)  Continuous casting of billets;
(g) Rolling cf rod, bar and light sections in two
finishing mills.
(a) Mini4g and Concentration Plant
3. The project is based on the exploitation of the Las Truchas
iron ore deposits, which are located in the vicinity (20 1m) of the plant
site.  The primary deposits are kzown as Ferrotepec in the south and El
Volcan, El Mango, Las Trachas, and Santa Clara in the north (see 4rmap).
The primary ores are of the skarn magnetite type with detemined sulphides
of iron and copper. The northern deposits have been weathered to variable
depths, the effect of which has been to convert much of the magnetite in
the upper layers to hematite (martite).
14. As of the end of Ju1y 1973, geological or in-situu reserves
wsere estim4ted at 76 million tons of measured ore and 12 million tons of
indicated-/ ore with an average soluble iron content of 50O5.%. These esti-
mates are based on an average specific gravity of 4.0 a&-d are considered
conservative.  They take no account of the float ore, -iich covers part of
the deposits and whieh can eventually be used as a direct charge materials.
Nor do taey include potential reserves in soe of the deposits whlch. have
not yet been fully explored. The quant-ties of ore presently in the measvred
category are sufficient for over 30 years  operation of the plant at the
initial level of output, accepting the SICARTSA/BSC exploration team's con-
tention that most of the geological reserves are likely to be economically

(a) produes fJiwd pellets;
(b) add various  wsaste  materials such as BOF slag,

29. The ful injection system will be oapable of a maxim= in-
jection rate of 120 kg/ton of hot metal, although the initial injection rate
ill be 0 kg/ton.
30. The fuzace stockhouse rw311 contain thiree rows of bunkers,
one for coke, one T'or pellets and one for miscellaneous materials. The
total storage capacity for coe,b  pellets and each niscellaneous material
will be approximatly 12, 16 and 24 hours respectively. Each row of bunkers
will discharge onto a corvyor, which in turn discharges into the weigh
hoppers aftsr screezng out the undersized fractions of pellets and coke.
The weigh hoppers will disoharge directly onto the main furnace charging
conveyor which delivers the burden to the receiving hopper or, the furnace
top. The complete charging sequence wil be automatically controlled,
31. The dirty top gases from the furnace rill pass tV.rough a
conventional du8t catcher, to remove the larger fraction of dust partioles,
followed by a double wet scrubbing process.  The system-will clean the gas
dust content to less than 8 mg/Yi5 and reduce the gas temperature to with-
in 5OQ of the available water temperature. The noise level resulting from
the pressmre reduetion and high gas velocities will be restricted to the
maxim 1practical extent and is likely to be about 105 db at a distanece of
1 m from the unit. The dry flue dust extracted will be recycled in the
pellet plant.
32. Ele furnace tw--l be equiped with inst,uirmntation and control
equipment for the measurement, logging and control of all operating para-
mters,  This system will be capable of conversion into an automatic conltroj
system at a future date.
!e) Basic 0lygen Steelmaking Plart
33. The feedstock for the finishing mills takes the form of
billets 115 m and 1215 n  sqaare, and the most econoziicalJ method of providing
these is by contiuous casting from liquid steel.  For reasons discussed in
the following section, each casting machine will be lirited to a ma3imum of
6 strands.  This deoisior, coupled-with the attainable casting rates of 115
rm square billets, effectively deternines the size of the B.O.F. vessels,
Te interaction of vessel heat sizes and casting times for a liqidd steel
prodaction of 1 A v&llion tons per year leads to the selection of 00 ton
vessels and 3 six-strand casting mac.hnes as the optimm facility combiration,
34. Te  iapcity )f the 33F pi-ant has been detenmied on the
basis of 11,,300 !eats 3er ye.ar of 30 weeks., which should be raadily atta-n-
able 4th9Uil 30  znthas of stazrt.-up. This gives a liquid steel pro&dction
somewhat in excess of tLe reqcued 1.1 million tons per annum.  As further
axperiance is gai4ed, an fic:rease to 13,000 heats per year car, be expected,
35. Th  eomsasior4ng strategy for the BOF plant is designed to
achieve as rapid a biad-up of production of liquid steel as possible.  This

computed from the results of detailed sampling.  The sites for inspectio'n,
sampling and meauement are spaced so closely and the geological character
is so mall defined that size, shape and mineral content are well establish-

which are stated, and no suo12 limit is judged to be different from the
computed tonnage or grade by more than 20 percent.
MICAN1D
2  Reserves for which tonnage and grade are computed partly from
specific measurements, samples or production data and part1ly from projection
for a reasonable distance on geological evidence.  The sites available for
inspection, measurement and sampling are too widely or otherwise inarpro-
priately spaced to pe=it the mineral bodies to be outlined campletely or
the grade established throughout.

3. Reserms for hich quantitative estimates are based largely
on broad knowledge of the gaological character of the deposit and for which
there are few, if any, samples or measuremeznts. The estimates are based on
an assumed continuity or repetition, of which there is geological evidence;
this evidence may include comarison writh deposits of similar type. Bodies
that are completely concealed may be included if there is specific geological
evidence of their presence. Estimtes of inferred reserves should include
a statemnt of the spatial limits within which the inferred material may lie.
NOTE
The above definitions have been used by SICARTSA in their calcu-
lations of ore reserves, and have been accepted for the basis of calculations
used in this appraisal.

iXICG - LAS 'thUCUAS ST1S'EE  PRE'2=
T' PORT OF TZARIC CARDENAS
1.  The Tas Truchas steel plant will need to import about 765,000
tons of coal per ann=,. when its first stage reaches full production.  This
amount will more than double with implementation of the second stage.  Pro-
vision for these imports, for the isportation of plant and equipment, and
for coastal shipient of a portion of SICARTSA's output by barge, is being
-made at the port of Lazaro Cardenas now under constraction by the Ministry
of the Navy (flarina) at the mouth of the Balsas River, adjacent to the
plant site.
2. Although SICARTSA initially   ll- be the principal user of the
port, the Governent does not intend this to be a special-purpose oort. . it
is expected that increasing volumes of general. cargo will flo-w through it,
especially after rail shipment between Lazaro Cardenas and I'iexico City is
nade possible with eventual completion of the Lazaro Cardanas/NIueva Italia
rail line (see Annex 06). The Government's general. traffic fore6asts for the
port are, however         t, to be inflated and the Bank therefore has recorend-
ed on several occasions that the port not be overbuilt in the beginning.
3.  A forecast of SICARTSA's port needs -'or the perlod through .983
is shown in Table 5-1.  Me required facilities comprise 200 meters of ouay,
an entrance chnnel to be dredged to 14 meters to accomodate bulk coal
vessels ox' 50-80,000 IWT. nav-igational aids, a breakwater, buildings and
general port infrastructure.  Marina will have complete- construction of
these by 1976, plus an additional 4o0  meters of quagr (two berths) for gen-
eral cargos (which the Bank considers unnecessary in this first stage of port
development).
4. Ca i-al costs for the port total an estimated 1329 million
(US$26,4 million), as shown in Table 5-2.  This includes M$50 million (US$i4
miillion) for the additional two general-cargo berths.  The estimates do not
include the resale value of reclaimed land.
5.  Port charges are to be set so as to recover the economic costs
ol' building and operating the port and will be levried according to gross
registered tonnage, category of ship and type of cargo.  Final agrcement or.
2 tariff has yet to be reached between SICARTSA and Ilarina..  Hoowever, the
Bank has been informed of the general levels being discussed, and considers
t1e-, to be based on overesti--.tes of general cargoes, which the proposed
tLariff assumes  il-11 cover the largest portion of tJPe tort's costs, ,Hence.
rmuch higher levels have been assumed in the economic evaluation of the steel
project, details of which are shown in Annex 16.

TR&4SPORT OF FINI51-M PRODUCTS
1.  The transport of *rne million tons of Las Truchas steel annually
froam the coastal project site to mar-kets in the center of M'xi-co -- principally
the Mexico City region, Guadalajara, and Souther  Mexico -- will be a major
undertaking.  Insuring it., is carried out at thXe lowest economic cost has been
of primary interest- both to SICARTSA and the Goverrnent.
2. In April 1973, SICARTSA contracted a well-Inoi-m consulting fii
to undertake a thorough examination of all alter-native methods of transporting
the steel to markets. A linear programruming nzodel was construtetd a-nd data on
construction, maintenance, eqLi3:pment arnd operating costs and on the capacities
of each route were obtained from the National Railways ana t.he Ministries c'
Public Works, the Prec9idency, and the hSavy. The resul.ts of the study took tne
form of conclusion-a and reconmmendations regarding:
(i     Thie mr ode or modes of transport to be used;
(ii)    Equipment needed;
(iiJ )   The req-ured program for const-uction and
improvemient of needed infrastiructure and
its optimal tinLing; and
(iv)    The total estimated cost and its breakdowr.
3.  The methodology or which the inndel was based aimed to rrinimize
the discounted present cost of moving assumed quantities of steel to specific
markets.  The costs considered included operating, maintenance, equipment pur-
chase, and any reouired construction or improvement of each rou-te.
4. Basically there were Lfive routes examined, although each of these
contained sub-alternatives.  They are as follows:
(i )    By rail to Neuva Ttalia and from there by rail to
Mex-co City and/or Guadalajara (rail-rail';
(ii)    Bwy road to Nueva Italia and from. there by rail to
Mexico City and/or Guadala'ara (road-rail);
(iii)   By sea to Manzanillo and from there by rail to
Mexico City and/or Guadalajara (sea-rail);
(ikv)    By road to Nueva Italia and from there by road
to Mexico City and Guadalajara (road-road);
(v)     By road to Mexico City through Altamirano (MIexico
City demand only -- Guadalajara demand would use
one of the other four rbutes) (road-road).
5.  Sizable investments would be needed for four of the alternatives.
The cost of t2he rail link from Las Truchas to Nueva Italia J.s estimated at
$56 million, and investmients of 71! million would he necessary to imp:rove the
road to Nueva Italia.  The road through ALtamirano does not exi st yet, but
construction to a stanidard high enough for use by hea-urily-loaded trucks would
be more expensive than thlte mere tourist road t; Tihultanejo that has been
planned (US$7(.2 milTi.on)0  New investments for the sea-rail route through
Manzanillo woulid be 'US$9,4. million, but the distance toc Nmexico City is much
longer so that operating costs would be highrr.

6,  Crne of >-e faiL: ngs of previous studies of the transport issue
was to consid-ero that once a route h,ad been chosen there could be -no changes
over -Ut,e liSf of the steel project.  The final7 formulation of the prob7lem
allowed, for changes of mode and roui3es witLin each mode -- e.g. sea-rail for
1976-80 and all rail through .eva Italia from 1981 onwards.
7. For parposes of the economic evaluation of the Las Truchas pro-
ject (Annex 16), the all-road alternative via Nueva Italia has been assumed.
This is considered likel3y to be expensive. since it would involve nrrach higher
operatuing cost's on the Nueva-Italia/XMeco City l-eg than -those of the parallel
rail route.  Ee-nce iiis use in the economicd calculation is conservative,  Me

,. The constraction of a major steel plant in a hitherto lightly
populated region naturally implies the concomitant development of a city to
house and to provide services for -th  employees of SIOARTSA ard any a'Cil lary
industries groi.i  up around it.  Based on the experience of Monclova, in
northern Xexico,J the eventual expansion ofL 0 [CARTSA and the development of
associated industries and services might be expected to result in, a total
population of 90,000 before the year 2000 (see Anrex '7)
2. Planning for the new city of Lazaro Cardenas is well underwaK
and a Trust unmd has been established to oversee its construction.  The city
initially will be economically and legally distinct from the &all tovTn of
10,000 persons (fomerly !mown as MeNlchor Ocampo) uhich now exist'e near the
plant site (see map). Detailed construction planis are only available for
1973, but a longer-term construction program is beirg prepared on the basis
of a general schems which the Bank has reviewed,
3,  Available to the Trust Fund are 696 hectares of land in an o;b-
long tract adjacent to and north-west of the plant site and abo^t 3 kyi inlazd.
About 521 hectares wil be used for residential and service aeas and 59 for
parks and recreation. The final 116 hectares will be reserved for ancillary
industries. At present, no central business district is planned; rather,
service facilities wIl be located in clusters along the main artery of the
city. It has been thought important to separate vehicular from pdestrian
traffic; thus, the town will have vehicular circulation around its perLphery,
%Ith sufficient penetration for services and a network of pedestrian w-alks,
all linked together and leading towards the civic and shopping clusters.
Sinoe so many of the now resildents will be from the countryside and used to
sunshine and oper, spaces, the pedestrian walks also 'will serve as gardens,
playgrounds and shopping malls, At the same time, a high dwelling density
will permit cheaper towm services and land costs per housing unit.  There
will be no concentration of high and low-income dwellings; housing for dif-
ferent income groups will be in close proximity. The Trust Fund believes
that a mixture of incom6 groups and of residences wiLth services dill give
the city more vitality.  Te general plan appears 'well conceived, although
the schedole for its implementation is very tight.
h. The annual housing construction program is showr in the follow-
inag tables
1/  Mionclova is the site of Altos Eornos de Mexico, tie natios lagest
steel producer.  Consturction began there in the early 19L407F and its
popU:Lation has gron from abou-  10,000 in 19L0 to over 860,000 in 1970.

5. Once "51QRTS is in operation, the Trust Fund will rent or sell
hovases, lots and connercial and industrial sitee. The sales prices a=d rentlas
wil- be arranged so as to provide arn adequate return on irvestment and to
subsidize t2ie housing of the poorest inhabitants of the city. Besides build-

eleotricity, sewrage, taleohones and streets.
6. Total costs for the city throughl 1976 ara estimated as Ii455
dillion (US036d4. million) as shown in the table below. This total includas
provision for a 6 percent annual rate of increase in construction costs. Wifth.
out price escalation, the cost in 1973 cunrency is M$422.5 million, (US$33.8
milion) and the present value, assming a 10% cost of capital, is ;386
million (US$30.9 illl.on). Using an astimated  iJfe of 30 years for the installa-
tions and houses and the 10% coat of capital, the equivalent a;nxral cost for
amortizing the oityZs capital investment if K 41.0 million (US$3.3 vCllion).
'Lnce  the total employmnt paymients to be mad  by SICAITSA when the first
stage o.- the steel project is in full operatisor is about M$175 million (us$14

1. In drawing up the tander speciLicationa and in iLnalizing the
scope  of the eqaipm-nt sup0ly contracts the Compy has established the
following obJect+ves egarding pollution control:
(a) To incorporate good proven techniques;
(b) To examine any defermnt options in the light
of present local conditions;
(c) To reflect Msxican Law.
2. Tne layout of the pla.nt will reduce the imact of residual
pollutants; i.e. t-ose emissions  hich remain after cleaizng and control
xlasUres. The locatioi of the plant close to the port area and the short
internal transport lies for raw materials and materials in pro-ess will
refioe the problem of dust control in relation to the surroundig region,
,xhile the location of the blast fna ce, coke ovens and steelmakThg plant
wi111 permit dust fallout to be confined to the plant area   The proidt
of the sea simplifies drainage and reduces the cost of effective disposal
of treated effluent. Main aceess to the steel plant wil be designed to
by-pass the town, with som  resulting benefit so far as noise is concerned.
3. The pollutants which nave the greatest frequency of occurrence
in iron and steelmak1ng and thich require control are summrized below.  It
is the aggregate eissio n levls which the pollution control devices are
&signed to restrict.

US$4 million.
4. Recruitment and traiiing will start in September 1973, although
construction of the training center will noot be corWleted until April 1973.
It is intended that the entire training team. (totallong some 77 instructors)
will be inA a position by twhe second hXalf of 1975. Training requirements
have been based on 4O-hours per week wor1kin in the piant polus an allowance
of 8 percent for absenteeis=. Starting with 254 apprentices and 35 adult
trainees iij Jaz3uary 1974., the program will peak at 630 participants in the
trainirg center at, any one time by early 1975 (see Tabe 10-1 Tin totaL, 
about 5,0 personnel ranging f-om management and s=aff tomaintenanrce and
production t orkers will revire training of some sort through 1978   About
1,300 will receive trairing in the Training Center itself,    It is
recognized that the turnover rate will increase withL rising levelS of skills,
and appropriate provision has been made to take accoint of this -henomenon.
5. Every process departaent initially will have assigned to it
from the Advisor's UIK. staff one manager, two assistance, -and a.ywtere
from four to six shift foremen,  The fLnction of these expatriates Wuill be
to create an operating team and train their Mexican counterparts on the job
site.  They will be phased out in a manner consistent witn smooth handing-
over of the managerial and supervisory functions.  For effective liaison
with works departments, a merber of each department's management team wil
be made responsible for training needs as an addition to his normal resoonsi-
bilit:es.
6,  The entire traning programh'Las been geared towards facilitating
the successful start-up and initial operation of the plant.  The need for in-
depth training at all levels3 including extended assignments of managerial
and supervisory staff tIo the Advisorls or eqaipment suppliers' plants, h.as
been fully acceptsed.  Te arrangements proposed are considered t-o be fally
consistent with the assumed build-up of production and to be sufficiently
flexible to takce care of any, at present unforeseen, eventualities which may
arise as the training program gets underiay.

ANNEX 12-2
IfM0 - LAS TRUCHAS ST1iEL PROJECT
TOTAL CAPITAL REQUEUDNTS CCMPAPQ WITH WORLD STANARDS
1. Comparing the estimated capital cost of the las Trachas project
with the costs of other plants that appear in published literature can be
misleading if a number of factors are not considered. First, published data
appear to be based largely on idealized costs rather than on actual construc-
tion costs, and figures quoted usually are several years old, requiring
escalation to reflect present-day costs. Second, the currency realignments
of 1971 and 1973 have tended to increase equipment costs fraa Japanese and
European suppliers expressed in dollar terms (although not in direct propor-
tion to the changes in parities). Tird, published cost data refer to plants
from the raw material preparation stage onward and thus exclude the cost of
mining and ore beneficiation facilities (such as the Las Truchas project
contains). The cost of a pellet plant also would not be included normally
in published data, but that of a sinter plant would. Since the cost of
these two facilities is approximately the same, the comiparison of Las Truchas
with published data should be made on the basis of total fixed asse-t costs
less the cost of the iron ore and limestone mines and the ore beneficiation
facilities. Fourth, published figures probably do not fully reflect the
cost of anti-pollution devices which are fast becoming standard features of
modern steel plants. Fifth, insufficient or no allaowance is made in most
published data for pre-operating expanses, engineerizg fees, working capital,
start-up costs and initial operating losses. Sixth, site conditions,
specifically the need for piling, have a significant effect on total conistruc-
tion costs and cause wide variations in "standard" figures. Seventh, the
capacity of a plant is somewhat subjective assessment which depends to a
large extent on the skill o it3s management and labor force. Differences
in estimating the capacity of a given plant can amount to as mch as 20%,
with a corresponding effect on unit costs,
2. As Annex 12-1 indicates, the total fixed asset cost of the
Las Tzmchas project is US$199.3 million and the total project cost (without
escalation) Us$597(3 million. A modified estimate, which can be compaed
with published estimates for other plants, is developed as folloas:

ANNEX 12-2
3. Takng the achievable capacity of the plant as 1.3 million
tons of rzw steel per annum (as opposed to the more conservative planning
figure of 151 million to ns used elseihere in this report), the modified
total implies a capital cost for Las Truchas of about US$395 per annual ton of
raw steel. his is considered very reasonable by world standards for a
plant of this type -- particularly for one that will be remote from exist-
ing maintenance and repair facilities and will be operated by a cozpara-
tively inexperienced work force, both of which necessitate rather more
conservative (and therefore more expensive) design, engineering  ard con-
struction practice than might be possible elsewhere.
4. The scale of the las Truchas operation, particularly in its
first stage, militates agaimst the very high capital productivity achieved
in some of the giant modern work}s of Japan and Europe. It is necessary,
however, to view economies of scale in this context somewhat moore closely
than is normally done. Economies of scale in steel fall into two quite
distinct categories. The first and more obvious category covers plant
facilities having lower capacities than those curmntly being built in
major steel producing countries. Since capital and operating costs do not
inrease in proportion to capacity, the cost per unit of output produced
in the larger facility will., other things being equal, generally be lower
than that of the smaller one. The second category covers the parallel
operation of two or more similar facilities of mairamm scale. Hence, econom-
ies derive from better production scheduling than is possible with single
units and lower ma:itenance, overhead and administration costs per unit of
output.
.  An analysis of SICARTSA's major production facilities along
these lines shows that, in fact, only the blast furace, with a maximum
rated output of 4,100 tons per day, might be placed in the first category.
Even though this is a large furnace, it will be appreciably smaller than a
few blast furnaces in Japan and Europe, which have rated capacities of up
to 10,000 tons per day (but are not part of non-flat steel works). The
balance of the facilities fall into the second category; for exam:ple, the
BOF and continuous casting plant iich, for purposes of this analysis, can
be considered a single enrltity. Given the present state of the art of con-
tinuous casting, 6 strands represent the upper limit for biUlet casters,
if temperature and expansion proble,us are to be avoided. Also, current
practice is to cast 115 mm square billets at a rate of 3 m per minute, Com-
bining the r:xitr, ziumber of strands per machine with the maximu casting
rate shows that t->s appropriate BOF vessel size is 100 tons.  Therefore,
although BOF vesssls -with a capacity of 300 tons are currently in operation,
they are used only in conjunctior, with ingot or continuous slab casting,
not With billet castingc  Silarlyr, the two rolling Mnlls -- the rod and
bar rll and the bar and light section mill -- represent the largest mills
of their resDective type currently being installed -world-wide. Given the
projected product mix, rolling capacity Could be increased only by the
installation of a tird mil.
6. It follows from this brief analysis that the proposed projeot
is of an economic size for a non-flat steel works, even in the context of
the latest developments in the iron and steel industry.

2/  Includes Us$0.2 for port charges.
3/ Assumes quoted road haulage rate of US$13.60 per ton for shipments from
plant to Mexico City, an approximate average haul.  Of this amount,
SCGARTSA must absorb only transport costs for 60% of sales that actually
go to Mexico City markets. Elsewhere in country, customer absorbs
transport costs. Hence transport cost to SICARTSA = 13.6 x 0.6 = 8.2.

Total is amortized over 10 years (10% p.a.)
6e        Investments - Surplus cash generated but not requi-"ed for day-to-
day operations will be invested either in short-tern securities or in plant
expansion.  In either case the return is assumed to be 10% per annum (simple).
7.        Interest - Assumed average for all loans.  See Note 11 below.
8.        Taxes - SICARTSA normally would be required to pay income tas at
the rate of2, but since th.e pro,,ect is located in a desi&nated development
area, the company can depreciate its assets for tax purposes at the most
convenient rate possible,  Hence, no income taxes are pro,ected uztil 1983
since tax depreciation will be taken at the rate necessary to keep net tax-
able profits at thwe zero level until the plant is fl-ully depreciated on the
tax books.
9.        Dividends - Although no dividend policy has been decided, it has
been assumed forillustrative pgaposes Ithat a dividend equal to 10, of paid-
in capital, but not exceeding 50% of net income, -will be paid out once  2he
Debt/Equity ratio drops below 505/G0

ANNEX 16-l
MEXICO - LAS TRUCGAS STEEL PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Introduction
1. The Bank's economic evaluation of the project addresses two
basic questions:  (i) Is the Las Truchas project the appropriate next major
step in Mexico's steel expansion program,, and (ii) will the project be
economically viable in an absolute sense? The first question has been viewed
in mostly qualitative terms insofar as detailed cost data on the ecisting
industry have not been available. This situation is expected to irnrove with
completion of the Battelle nridustry study for the Steel Co=mission Annex 3-2).
The second question has been viewed in traditional Bank terms, excluding the
regional benefits of the project that clearly form a major part of the
Government's rationale for undertaking this project in the chosen location.
Our analysis considers the project siiply in terms of its import sabstitution
effect. The regional issue is not ignored, however, and is examined separately
in Annex l7.
A. Las Truchas Versus Other Alternatives
Available 2etions
2. There are three basic routes that Mexico could have chosen to
fill the steel demand/supply gap projected for the late l970's (see Annex 1:
(i)  Importation of semi-finished steel products (billets and
slabs) for domestic rolling into finished products;
(ii) Production of steel in electric furnaces, based on sponge
iron and imported scrap, followed by the rolling of products;
(iii) Fully itegrated steel production using domestic or imported
coal and iron ore.
3. It would not be practical for Mexico to attempt to meet future
growth of demand on a long-term basis via imports of steel billets aId sl'abs,
since supplies on such a large scale would be both difficult to obtain ard
expensive.  During the past several years, term contracts for semi-finished
steel supply have not been easily available on the export market, even with
price variation clauses, and fixed price contracts for more than 90 days have
been unusual. Therefore, if Mexico is not to place a major sector of its
economy at the mercy of highly unpredietabl-e world suppliers, it has to produce
raw steel in integrated or semi-integrated plants.
4. The electric furnace route presents d4fficulties i7or large
increases in capacity because of the inherent volatility of the world scrap
market -- particularly with regard to prices -- and the high economic cost
of electricity in Mexico. Today, Zbxico imports about 600,000 tons of scrap
per annum for steel production, and rno doubt there is a continuing role for
scrap-based increases in production capacity of a marginal nature, particularly
for specialty steel.  As a long-term policy, however, Mexico's posi'tion as a net



ANNEX 16-1
Page 2
.porter if scrap and high-cost enez-gy consumer makes this an unattractive
al'rnative.  This leaves fully integrated steel production as the favored
ms-mtod for Yexico to meet projected demand increases -- aside from importing
steel products themselves which the analysis in section B of this Annex
damonstrates to be unattractive.
5. The integrated capacity now planned for Las Truchas could have
been installed at a coastal location, or it might have been provided through
expansion of the existing integrated mils, all of which are located inland.
A further alternative would have been installation of new facilities adjacent
to the existing mills.  The Government's choice of a coastal location is
ju-stified largely because of raw material constraints in the country. It.
follows the dominant pattern established world-wide during recent years to-
wards locatLng new steel facilities at coastal sites to utilize high quality
inported raw materials transportbed from distant locations in large bulk
carriers. While Mexico l11 not be inporting =uch iron ore in the near term,
its limited national reserves make this inevitable within the next 10-15 years.
Iron Ore
6.  Mexico's primary integrated facilities are located in the
Monterrey-Monclova area in the northern State of Nueva Leon and in Puebla,
near Mexico City. The largest producer is AIfSlA irn Monclova, whose crude
steel capacity is 2.5r million tons per annum. The company obtains its iron
ore from the La Perla mine, 403 Im away, but since only about five years of
reserves remain at this location, AIM4SA must obtain its subsequent long-term
ore supplies from the Pena Colorada mine now under development in Colima 1520
km to the southwest on the Pacific coast.  The second major producer is Fundidora
in Monterrey, whose iron ore supplies come 661 km from Cerro de Mercado in
Durango and the more recently developed Hercules mine in Goahuila, 4h64 km to
the north.  FuAndidora plans to exDand its annual capacity to about 1.5 million
tons before 1976, at which rate these iron ore reserves would last for 25 to 30
years.  The third major integrated producer is the HYLSA group, witih plants
in Monterrey and Puebla. These use a gas-based direct reduction process and
electric furnace steel-making and nave a total raw steel capaci-ty ot about
900,3OO tons. HYILSA's iron ore presently is obtained .rom a Encino in Jalisco,
but this resernve will be mined out soon, and the company, like Altos Hornos,
riua-t mve its source to the Pena Colorada mine, 1043 km from Puebla and
1500 km from, the Monterrey plant.
7.        SuDstantial increases in steel production at the present locations
wouLia overload already-strained iron cre supplies. Even if sufficient reserves
were available (Pena Colorada itself has only 90 million tons of reserves),
the economic costs of tneir transport would be high due to the long distances
-.avdyed, particularIy for Au-ISA and HYLSA, -Who are far from their long-term
source at Pena Colorada.  The Las Truchas project, alternatively, is located
virtually next to iron ore reserves that will be able to supply rrre than
30 years of operation at ths initial production level; and, in the long run,



ANNEX 16-1
Page 3
the plant1s location on a deepwater port will facilitate imports of high
quality iron ore from elsewhere in the world.  The existing companies could,
of course, impcrt iron ore; but their inland locations place them at a cost
disadvantage vis-a-v.is the Las Truchas site.
Coal
8. The coal situation is different. Altos lHornos and Fundidora
use Mexican coal from reserves in the northern part of Coahuila, near the
United. States border.  While abundant, this coal is low in quality. When washed
its fixed carbon content averages 62% and^ ash content 16%, compared with 72%
and 8% respectively for the Austral.ian and/or Canadian coals that Las Truchas
wa±.il import.  The higher coking costs these quality di:fferences inply for the
northern producers mst ue weighed against the coal price advantages they
obtain t1uough closer proximity to the coal source -- the Las Tiuchas coal,
of course, carrying subst1antial sea freight charges.  Reliable cost figures
for 3iexican coal are hard to comn by, but there is evidence that a long-term
price delivered to the existing northerr. producers (assumirg economic costs
for rail tra,nsport soire 25% higher than the present rail tariff) would be
around US$18-20 per ton at 1973 prices, conpared with US$20-22 for the coal
to be imported by Las Truchas. The difference is roughly made up by the
lower coking costus for Las Truchas.
9.  Although cost differentials between the existing steel producers'
use of domestic coal and the use of ixorted coal by Las Truchas probably
are small, it should be recognized that the latter is vulnerable to possible
future coal scarci-ty on export markets and, hence, possible long-term cost
increases vis-a-vis the domestic resource.  Furthermore, the use of inmorted
coal represents a very substantial foreign exchange expenditure that should
not be ignored.  Under these circumstances, the coal situation clearly favors
the existing producers;  it is not, however, considered great enough to over-
rilde Las Truchas, advantages in other areas.
Natural Gias
10.  HYLSA's direct reduciuon process uses natural gas as the
redulcing agent instead of coal, with very important economic imlications.
MSA obtaimns the gas from the national oil company, Pemex, at rates which
Pemex maintains are insufficient even to cover production and transmission
expenses, let alone the opportunity cost of the gas itself, which has attrqctive
alternative uses in Mexico.  It is understood that Pemex has refused to increase
InLSA's gas supplies without a very significant increase in the price, and
that this effectively has blocked HYLSA's recent expansion plans.  At economic
gas price levels, substantial increases in hYSA's capacity seem to be out of
the question.
Water
11.  Las Truchas has a Thrther advantaFe in its location alongside
the Rio Balsas, which prlovides a virtually unlimited supply of process water.
HYLSA/Puebla has no water problem, but the AhMISA, Fund- dora and zILSA plants
in the arid northern region must pump water from depths of as much as 2000
meters, at high cost. iFurther expansiori at these sites would only exacerbate
this problem.



ANEX 16-1
Page 4
E-lectric it
12. Electricity for the Las Truchas project will come from the
nearby La Villita hydroelectric plant, with insignificant transmission
losses. This gives Las Truchas a further advantage over the other integrated
producers -- principally HYLSA, which consumes large amounts of power in its
electric furnaces.
Transport of Finished Products
13.  The Las Trachas site is about 700 km from the main steel market
in  e-xico C-ty, versus mXore than 1,000 km for the northern producers. Despite
the fact that the project will hasten the need for iai-rovements in the trans-
port system linking the project region with the development and more-highly-
populated center of the country, the long-term economic costs of transport
from Las Truchas are certain to be lower than those of the more distant
producers.  Only HYLSA/Puebla is an exception, but this is unattractive as a
major expansion alternative for other reasons.
Other Coastal Jocations
14.  The only other potential plant location in Hexico matching the
primary conditions that exist at Las Truchas -- proximity to exploitable
iron ore reserves and an ex2isting or potential deepwater port -- is the
city of Manzanillo, some 250 kmn up the coast. It is 60 km from the Pena
Colorada iron ore reserves (versus 20 km from tne Las Truchas plant site
to its mine) and has an already-developed port and road/rail transport
system connecting with Mexico City that would require less investment than is
being put into the Las Truchas infrastructure. There are a number of operational
disadvantages that would be associated with a Manzanillo site, such as no
suitable open space for development directly adjacent to the port; but, primarily,
Nanzanillo was rejected i favor of Las Truchas as a conscious decision by
the Government to use the steel project as the means of developing the com-
paratively poor coastal area along the Michoacan/Guerrero state border, adding
a new development "pole" in a water-rich area and an improved outlet to the
Pacific for Mexico City.
Conclusion
15.  The above analysis obviously is not rigorous, for it does not
include actual calculations of capital and operating costs for the various
alternatives that might have been possible. A valid conclusion does not,
however, require such rigor. If the Las Truchas project were viewed simply
as a means of adding a million tons to Mexican steel product capacity, it
probably would be a more expensive route than marginal expansions of the
existing producers, whose capital expenditures per ton of additional capacity
and start-ulD costs would be lower.  Wdien one views the situation over a long
time horizon, however, and considers Las Truchas not simply as a million-ton
steel producer but as one with an eventual output of several times that amount,
the short-term capital cost advantages that might have been obtained at the
alternative sites are overwhelmed by the higher operating costs that almost
certainly would have resulted from their raw material and transport disadvantages.



ANNEX l0-1

On this basis, the Las Truchas project, as it has been conceived, is con-
sidered thie appropriate next step to be taken in Mexico's steel expansion
program.
B. Economic Return Calculations
AsTtions
16, The economic cash fjLow has been based on the financial pro-
jections of Annex 15, modified (i) to r=place the comnercial benefit stream
with one based onte  opportunity cos:t of steel imports to !4ex.>o  (ii) to
eliminate internal Mexican taxes from the cost streams,, (iii) to adjust ahe
costs of fuel and electricity upward .O ref"lect the inadequacy an economic
temns o-f present aarket prices for these inputs, (iv) to reflect the economic
cost of SICARTSAfs use of the port, and (v) to incluide the full economic
cost of transporting SICkRT'7As finished products.  No shadow pricing of
labor las been employed.
17.  A suirnary of the adjustments made to the financial cost streams
is shown i, Annex 16-2. All are expressed in constant 1972 dollars, adjusted
for the effe~fTT 73 exchange rate changes.  Comments on the maj-or ajust-
ments are as follows:
(.i) Fuel and Electricity Costs - These have been shadow-priced
respectively at 3   and 407S above their current selling prices in Mexico, in
line with the findings of the Bank's most recent Economic Mission.
(ii)  Port Costs - As noted in Annex 5, the comnnercial port tariff
asswaed by SICARTSA allocates the largest portion of port revenues to general,
non-steel-related traffics which may or may not materialize to the extent prco-
jected. In Annex 16-3, a calculation is made of' the equivalent annual cost
of' buildiing,oeaing and maintaining the port in perpetuity, assuming a 10%
cost of capital, This comes out to US$2.5 million per year. If 85% is
allocated to steel-related traffics, then SICARTSA should carry an annual
economic cost of UT$2.1 million for port services.  This percentage is used
in Bank's analysis, but it should be recognized as very conservative in view
of the likely long-terrm growth of non-steel traffics through the port.
(iii)  Transport Costs - In the base case of the economic analysis
the transport cosfor1 .nTshed products used in the financial asses:sment
havte been increased by 124 to reflect the estimated full economic costs of
transport to the project if trucks were used excl-asively.  The fi_gures were
based on road rates over the entire distance from the Plant to Mexico City
(which is a reasonable average distance from the plant in addition to being
the principal steel market) and estimates made during the course of the trB:s-
port study carried out for S1C,ALTSA and described in Annex 6. In using these
figures, the implicit assumption is msade that a more economic long-term forn
of transport than road will be possible and that the estimates therefore can
be considered conservative.  To provide a fhritier chec-k on the assumptions,
a sensitivity test ha.s been carried out assuming a 50% increase in the traais-  0
port cost strea3 used in the base case.



ANNEX 16-1
Page 6
(iv) Revenues - The benefit stream in the economic projection
comprises the expenditures Mexico would have to incur to import similar
quantities of steel products if it chose not to produce steel domestically
at Las Truchas. The long-term projections for average European export
prices, as developed in Annex 2, have been used for this calculation, with
the addition of sea freight, port handling and inland transport expenditures
to move the steel from Europe to Mexico City. The resulting range of deliver-
ed import proces is as follows:
LONG TERM4 STEEL IMPORT PRICES

(1973 Us$/ton)
Probable Probable
Average Cost FOB Europe          H i                   M
Sea Freight                                 20          20
Port Handling                                4           4

Delivered Price Mexico City                188        200
1/
The sea freight cost is based on the Mzeller/Kawahit/ estimate of likely
rates for Europe/Mexico charters in the early 1980's; port handling and
inland transport costs are based on assessments of actual costs in Mexico
today, and are considered conservative.
Results
18.  The economic benefit and cost streams described above, have
been subjected to a computer sensitivity analysis, the results of which are
shown graphicaUly in Annex 16-4. Two sets of projections have been made, one
for the expected production buildup period of 21 years (corresponding to the
"A" cases of the financial sensitivity analysis in Annex   )  and the
other for a slow buildup period of S½ years (corresponding to the "B" finaraci..l
cases). In each set, the sensitivity of the project's economic return is
measured against variations in (i) the import price for steel, (ii) transport
costs for finished products, (iii) operating and port costs, (iv) a Conmletion
delay and cost overrun, and (v) combinations thereof.
19. The results of the sensitivity analysis covering the probable
range of import prices defined in paragraph 17 are as follows:

9millon oost overrun                 9-10                 8-9
20, Tri probable ec.onomic retar5n of the project can be seen to
range from 12 to 13%,, dependJng on the steel price. At the mao.muDi possible
price, the return rises to 15-16%. The retarn is fairly insensitive to a
50% increase in the assmd costs of transport, tending to diminish the
importance of this '.nput .ram arn economic viewpoint -- al.thoug  not from an
operational perspective.  Mhe 15% increase in operating and port costs --
mhch is sufficient to cover most contingencies in this categony    reduces
the retuxn by up to twr percentage points; taken together with the tranaport
increase tle retu=n goes down by an additional percentage point. riailar
results are obtained from the completion dela,y and cost overr0 n. In the
worst cases, the return drops to 8%, but the combinations of adverse eirum-
stances that these cases represent are considered unlikely.
21. Had fll shadow pricing of all inThts been used in the above
&nalysis, instead of the partial shadow pricing actually employed, the cal-
culated returns no doubt would have been higher. Capital costs, for example,
are made up mainly of imported machinery and local construction. Shadow
pricing of foreign exchange would raise the costs of the fornr and shadow
pricing of labor would slightly lover the latter, vith the zet remaut un-
likely to be a significant ohange one way or another in the return, In
operating the plant, the unskilled portion of labor costs will not be large,
and using shadow prices for it would have little effect. Material costs
would go up with the assuned pre:iwa on foreign e=change -- for coal and oil
in particular -- but total materials costs would go up by less than  this
premium, Transport costs also might rise with higher fuel costs, but, as
seen above, the return is not greatly sensitive to even a 50% increase in
total traxasport costs.
22. The principal effect of shadow pricing would be on the value
of the steel produced, which would rise by the full amount of the premiwa
on foreign exchange. Since this increase would be greater Ln total than the
sum of arq similarly-caused incr'aees in input costs, the ret result would
be a higher rate of reta=. :fence, the reurn estimates calculated above
can be considered conservative.



ANX O 6-1
23. 3:t is concludad that the probability of an economic ret=
azeding 10% is verY h , ad, that on this basis, the project is econom-
iA fll viable in the l4eGcan oontezt. Again it should be noted that none
of these figres tabs secondary benefits of the project into account; nor
do tbe consider the economies of scale that Mill be possible in the second
and subequent stages of the project, with resulting increases in the real
retai  of the projet to the 1b.can econoV over the long run.

M=CO - LAS TRUCHAS STEEL PROJECT
R:EGIONAL IFWACT OF THE PROJECT
1. The project is located at the muth of the Balsas River on
the border between the States of Guerrero and Michoachan. Both states
have been identified by the Government as development areas based on the
potential of± their natural resources.  The Governument is becoming increasingly
concermed with the concentration of wealth and economic activity in the
traditional central triangle of the coantry defined by Mexico City, GuadalaJara,
and Monterrey, and a strategy of decentralization is being effected (i) to
direct public investmenrIt towards non-traditional regions., and (ii; t,o give
incentives to firms locating away from the three largest cities. As part of
this strategy, the Government intends for the Lazaro Cardenas zone to
serve as a "1growth pole" which will (incrementally) attract steel-related
industries and othler activities away from the traditional centers.
2.        An inventor,y of the natural and man-made resources of the region
gives grounds for believing that the growth objectives for Iazaro Cardenas
can be met,.
Natural Resources
(i)  Iron Ore: It was, of course, the Las Truchas iron ore resources
of the reoion, in close proximity to the sea, which first suggested Lazaro
Cardenas (then Melchor Ocanqo) as the site for a major steel project.
(ii) Forests:  Extensive areas of both Guerrero and Yelchoachan are
covered by forests. The Guerrero reserves are the basis for z forest
tiadmtri         project presently being prepared for possible Barnk financing.
(iii) 1iter:  The Balsas River, one of the longest and most voluminous
rivers in Mexico, runs the length of Gierrero. It is used extensively fLor
irrigation and power.
(iv)  Dolomite: This is a clay used principally for refractories;
deposits are located in Guerrero.
(v) Other 14nerals:  Barium oxide, optical calcite, copper,
limestone, silica sand, bentonite.
Infrastructure
1. Roads:  Lazaro Cardenas is conunected to other centers by a
coastal road which soon will connect with Zihuatanejo and Acapulco to the
southeast and, eventually, with Manzanillo to the northwest. Another road
leads inland through Playa Azul to Nlueva Italia and Mexico City through
Morelia. Plans are far advanced for a road from Zihatanejo to Mexico City
through Altamirano and Toluca, which will provide another (and more direct)



ANNEX 1 7
Page 2
road link from Lazaro Cardenas to Mexico City and will pass through the
forestry of Guerrero (see map).
20  Railroads:  No through railroad from Lazaro Cardenas to Mexico
City exists at present, but it is likely that within four or five years of
the beginning of SICARTSA's operations the missing link between Lazaro
Cardenas and Nueva Italia will be constructed (see Annex 6 for further
discussion)    Nanzanillo is already linked by rail to Mexico City through
Guadaljara and much of inland Michoacan is served by a rail network.
3. Power: Two large dams on the Balsas River at La Villita, 15 km
from the project site, and at infernillo, further upstream, make the region
a major supplier of power to the central triangle of the nation.
4. Ports: The Dort of Manzanillo, 250 km up the coast from the
project site, i    xico's main port on the Pacific. Recent capital investrent
there, financed by the Bank, as well as a reorganization of port services
has greatly stimulated its use. The port of Lazaro Cardenas (see Annex 5s, when
completed, will be closer to Mexico City than ManzaniLlo (800 km by rail
compared to 1,100 Laa), and therefore eventually can be expected to become a
primary Pacific outlet for the capital.
5. Agriculture: The varied climatic zones of the two states perxmit
cultivation of many different fruit crops, particularly melons and straw-
berries, and the present value of agriculture production in the two states
is US$160 million annually.  Cattle raising also is important.
6. Tourism: A new Pacific coast tourist center, including a jet
airport is under construction at Zihuatanejo, 100 km down the coast from
Lazaro Cardenas. This project is being financed in part by the Bank and is
expected to draw thousands of foreign tourists and residents iato this hitherto
underdeveloDed area.
Backward and Forward industrial Linkages
3.        An industry which stimulates the growth of other industries
as suppliers is said to have 'backward" linkages;  one which stiniates
industries using its output has "lforward"i linkages. Knowledge of which
industries can be expected to generate forward or backward linkages (and under
what circumstances) is very sketchy and is based almost entirely on comparative
transport and factor oosts.  Some approximations for the Las TrLuchas project
can, nonetheless, be made. Since the non-flat steel output of SICARTSA
1n its first stage will be used principally in the construction industry,
,here is little doublt that the forward linkages of Stage I will be very weak,
except to the extent that construction demand develops in the project region
over time. Experience ln Monolova, the site of the AJiSA steel plant, was
that no forward-linked industry became established there until 1965, 18 years
after AHMSA began full operation.  Hece, during its initial years of operation,
SICARTSA's principal impact is likely to be in generating demand for supplies
and in the demand of its erployees for consumer goods and services.

1/  AHMSA did not get into full operation until the late-19)40's, so that 195c
can be taken as an approximate ecuivalent of SICARTSA's 1976 startup date.
5. There is reason to believe tha-t the backward linkage effect ?'
Iazaro Cardenas will be greater than in Mbnclova since the resource potentn.-il
of the area is greater and more of the demand generated by SICGATSA there'fore
will remain within the region. Similarly, there is evidence that forward
linkages, even though they most likely will have to await the production of
flat products during Stage II of the project, will turn out to be greater in
Lazaro Cardenas than in Monclova.  Bear-ing upon both of these phenomena will
be the following factors:
(i)  During the early years of Iionclova, wages generally were higher
than those in Mecico City.  The opposite is likely to be true for some time
in Lazaro Cardenas since the development, region is starting at very low income
levels.
(i;)  The greater agricultural potential of the Lazaro Cardenas regioc
will tend to hold down living costs and, therefore, wages.
(iii)  TransporL costs froii Lazaro Cardenas to Mexico City in the ion,
rwu  will be lower than those frorn Monclova because of the shorter distance
involved.
(iv)  Government incen',dv's will be available to new industries
locating in the Lazaro Cardenas region.
6.  For the above reasons, it is considered reasonable to nssurie J
somewhat faster growth in secondjry emoloyrnent at Lazaro Cardenas thar. was
experienced at Monclova. This is shown in the following table:

7. The projection indicates that by the end of 20 years of SICARTSA's
operations rougbly two out of every three jobs in the Lazaro Cardenas area
will be outside the steel company itself, compared with six out of ten during a
comparable period at Monlova. With substantial development of forward-linked
industries using the flat-product oatput from the later stages of SICARTSA's
development (the above projections have assumed a second stage of steel pro-
duotion -- yielding a doubled crude steel output -- by 1986 and a similar or
larger third stage by 1996), thia projection could be exceeded. In fact, one
study done for SICARTSA some time ago argued for even higher job creatiorn
rates and projected total employmnt in 1985 at 42S,400 and total population at

and other development program in the surrounding area will be sizable indeed.
