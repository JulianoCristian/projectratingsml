In its first\n            stage, to which the Bank loan will apply, the works will\n            have an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tons of\n            crude steel equalling 1 million tons of light nonflat\n            finished steel products. The works are located near iron ore\n            reserves sufficient for at least 30 years of production at\n            Stage I level. Coal supplies will be imported through an\n            adjacent deep-water port. The new works will include mining\n            equipment and a concentration plant, a concentrate pipeline,\n            a pelletizing plant, a coke oven plant, a blast furnace\n            plant, a basic oxygen steelmaking plant, a continuous\n            casting plant, a rod and bar mill, a bar and light section\n            mill, a power plant, water supply and treatment equipment,\n            an air compressor station, an oxygen plant, and engineering\n            workshops. This report comprises two impact evaluation for\n            the Philippines a Thailand, and an overview which\n            synthesizes the findings of both impac evaluations regarding\n            the extent of, and reasons for, sustainability. compares the\n            impact of irrigation system design on project performance\n            projects consisted of rehabilitation and expansion of\n            existing irrigat schemes and aimed at providing year round\n            and reliable irrigation wate both the wet and dry seasons.\n            These countries were reviewed together they both represent\n            the use of less intensive technology for rice prod Surveys\n            were undertaken in both countries, involving a minimum of\n            300 beneficiaries. Among other things the surveys sought to\n            determine and the beneficiaries' perception of their\n            past and present welfare and qu life. Other areas reviewed\n            by the impact evaluations include : 1) over performance of\n            the irrigation and drainage system; 2) overall economic\n            agricultural performance; 3) institutional performance; 4)\n            social impa 5) environmental impact."}, "docdt": "1973-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
