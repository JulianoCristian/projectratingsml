It also supports a\n            major rehabilitation effort in highways, ports and civil\n            aviation, the backbone of the country's transportation\n            system.  To this end, the project finances (a) the\n            rehabilitation of some 360 km of existing paved roads; (b)\n            the construction of a container berth, a fuel jetty and a\n            siltation prevention dike in Conakry port, and dredging of\n            the port area and access channel; and (c) essential\n            navigational aids and infrastructure rehabilitation at\n            Conakry International Airport and at selected domestic\n            airfields.  Additionally, the project finances technical\n            assistance to establish a regulatory framework for\n            privatized transport sector operations, and to strengthen\n            and improve Government planning and investment selection,\n            pricing policies, manpower development and training\n            sectorwide.  The main benefits of the project are the\n            opening up of areas that now are isolated for several months\n            each year; the protection of the paved highway network from\n            further deterioration and even higher reconstruction costs;\n            and a substantial reduction in road transport costs with\n            direct benefits to both urban and rural populations."}, "docdt": "1987-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
