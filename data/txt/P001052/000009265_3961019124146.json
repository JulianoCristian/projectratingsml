Guinea was satisfactory. The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a broad sector-wide investment operation, in\n            this case a transport sector project covering roads, ports,\n            airports, and overall sector planning and coordination, is\n            an effective instrument for improving the efficiency of\n            transport services and increasing their supply throughout\n            the country. Second, the country team should help ensure\n            that generic country issues, such as counterpart funding,\n            are dealt with in a uniform fashion across the board. Third,\n            addressing sector specific issues through projects is\n            impossible without real political will. Finally, project\n            content should be designed to match actual project\n            management competencies, and the management tools\n            implemented by foreign technical assistance should be fully\n            internalized by users within the existing and sustainable\n            institutional framework."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
