donors, and to\n            stimulate private investment in key sectors of the economy.\n            The project would also help to lay the basis for modest\n            improvements in the organization of some key Ministries\n            which have particularly important roles to play in the\n            short-term rehabilitation of the economy. The project would\n            include the following main components: (a) preparation of a\n            road-rehabilitation program, and preparation and start-up of\n            an integrated cotton/food-crop project; (b) sector studies\n            to review the organizational, financial, and legal setups of\n            the important diamond and forestry sectors; (c) provision of\n            resident technical advisors to assist in the preparation and\n            implementation of development projects, and in monitoring\n            the external debt; (d) vehicles and operating expenses for\n            the resident advisers; (e) an organizational review of the\n            civil service, with recommendations for modest, short-term\n            improvements; and (f) provision of funds for further\n            studies, training, consulting services, and related needs to\n            be identified during project implementation."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
