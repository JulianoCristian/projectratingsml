                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to improve the quality of education as measured by coverage, social participation, and
                         educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II (the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social
                         participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the
                         School Grants to improve public schools' internal efficiency and learning outcomes.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The School-Based Management Project, Phase II (PEC) was approved on June 17, 2010. It finances the Government of Mexico's largest school autonomy program-- PEC. PEC was
                         established in 2001 to introduce school autonomy and improve local participation in education. The Government of Mexico requested Bank support to strengthen both technical and
                         fiduciary aspects of the program.

                         Bank support under the second phase has focused on improving the impact of the program. This includes improving the fiduciary aspects of the program, encouraging exchanges
                         among the different states, and evaluating existing initiatives to improve the delivery of services. With Bank support, PEC is working on a number of different technical studies to
                         understand options to improve its performance and to increase planning at the school level for all programs.

                         The results have been quite positive and the project is close to meeting or exceeding many of its outcome indicators. Currently, 22.3 percent of public schools are in PEC, exceeding
                         the target of 22 percent. PEC has increasingly focused on schools in marginalized areas, which now account for 44 percent of all PEC schools, compared with targets of 45 and 50
                         percent for 2012 and 2013, respectively. Currently, 13.5 percent of PEC schools have a significant indigenous population, exceeding the target of 12 percent for 2012 towards the
                         end target of 15 percent. With regards to Monitoring and Oversight, 31 percent of States currently report Program information on time through a certified MIS, already meeting the end
                         target.
