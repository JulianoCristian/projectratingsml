                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to improve the quality of education as measured by coverage, social participation, and
                         educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II (the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social
                         participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the
                         School Grants to improve public schools' internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project helps finance the Government of Mexico's largest school autonomy program, Programa Escuelas de Calidad (PEC), which was established in 2001 to introduce school
                         autonomy and improve local participation in education. The Project’s results continue to be positive with three out of five Project Development Objective (PDO) outcomes exceeded
                         (in the school year 2011-12, 26.7 percent of Mexico’s public schools were in PEC, exceeding the final target of 23 percent; 20.8 percent of indigenous schools participated in PEC,
                         exceeding the final target of 19.3 percent; and 71.3 percent of school grants were spent on education quality inputs, also exceeding the final target of 66.86). The percentage of PEC

                         schools located in marginalized areas, however, was 44.5 percent, against a 55 percent target by the end of the Project, and the percentage of community members who participated
                         in the design of the school plan (PETE), declined slightly from 74.2 percent in 2008-9 to 72.7 percent for the 2011-12 school year. However, this difference was not found statistically
                         significant by the firm that conducted the second round of the survey and, even with this decline, it is likely that the 75% target will be achieved by the end of the Project.

                         The Project was restructured on April 25, 2013 to: (i) drop Component 3 (Policy Development and Evaluation) since most activities under this component were financed outside of the
                         Project; and move the impact evaluation originally under Component 3.1 to Component 2, which was also revised to include assistance to states to improve prioritization of
                         indigenous schools and schools in marginalized areas, dissemination of the simplified school planning instrument, and to carry out a survey to collect data on intermediate indicators;
                         (ii) adjust the results matrix to ensure full measurement of the PDO and revise a number of intermediate indicators; (iii) reallocate part of Category 2 (Operation Costs) and 3
                         (Consultant Services) funds to Category 1 (Goods, Works and Consultant Services financed under School Grants) to increase the number of beneficiary schools; and, (iv) extend the
                         closing date by one year to June 2014 to make up for delays in signing and effectiveness, to extend the period of disbursement of school grants and to allow for second rounds of
                         the M&E survey and the impact evaluation.
