                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to improve the quality of education as measured by coverage, social participation, and
                         educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II (the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social
                         participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the
                         School Grants to improve public schools' internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project helps finance the Government of Mexico's school autonomy program, Programa Escuelas de Calidad (PEC), which was established in 2001 to introduce school
                         autonomy and improve local participation in education. The target of 23 percent of PEC schools as a percentage of the total number of basic education schools and the 66.86 percent
                         of the grants spent on education quality inputs have been met with 23.85 and 74.54 percent, respectively, for the 2012-13 school year. The percentage of indigenous schools
                         increased from the baseline of 15.5 percent to 18 percent, but fell short of the 19.3 percent target and PEC schools in highly marginalized and marginalized areas reached 46 percent

                         PEC has put more emphasis on marginalized schools and indigenous population and continues to give them priority when there is demand. However, the Project fell short of the
                         targets for these two indicators because of the introduction of programs (for instance, Programa Escuelas de Tiempo Completo, PETC) that target rural, marginalized and indigenous
                         schools with the aim of providing them with a tailored and comprehensive package of education services and resources that include direct transfers for implementing their school
                         plans.
