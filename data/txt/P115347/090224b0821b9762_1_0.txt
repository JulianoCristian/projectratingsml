                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective (PDO) of this Adaptable Program Lending is to improve the quality of education as measured by coverage, social participation, and
                         educational outcomes. Consistent with its development objective, the PDO for Phase II (the Project) is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social
                         participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the
                         School Grants to improve public schools' internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project helps finance the Government of Mexico's school autonomy program, Programa Escuelas de Calidad (PEC), which was established in 2001 to introduce school
                         autonomy and improve local participation in education. Information for the school year 2012-13 is not yet available. However, and as reported in the previous ISR, in 2011-12 school
                         year three out of the five Project’s targets were exceeded. The Project has been especially successful in reaching indigenous schools ( an important goal of the pogram). In addition,
                         the percentage of school grants spent on education quality inputs has been exceeded. In the same period, social participation has increased as reflected by a reasonable amount of

                         Most intermediate output indicators have also been achieved. For instance, the percentage of community members that observe: (i) that parents are informed about student

                         performance; (ii) that teachers encourage the active participation of students; and, participatory decision making between parents, teachers, and principal about school affairs have
                         been met, reflecting that community members perceive increased social participation at the school level. The total hours of technical assistance per year provided by the federal
                         government to the states and the percentage of financed PEC schools that report financial information on time to PEC's National Management Information System have also been
                         exceeded. In addition, the simplified school planning tool has been broadly disseminated and is been use by most PEC schools and PEC continues with a communications campaign
                         to disseminate the objectives, activities and results of the Project. Only two intermediate output indicators are yet to be achieved: the percentage of community members that are
                         familiar with the PETE and the percentage that observe teachers encouraging and supporting student performance.
