F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from the Loan Agreement)

The objective of the Project is to strengthen PEC by increasing overall coverage and social
participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools
and on the indigenous population, as well as a reorientation of the direct support to schools to
improve public schools’ internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

                                              xi
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

A. Country and sector issues
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Improving basic educational attainment and learning outcomes for all was, and still
is, central to improving Mexico’s competitiveness in the global economy and to decrease
inequality. At the time of the Project’s Appraisal (May 2010), Mexico was the world’s fourteenth
largest economy, yet it was ranked 60th in terms of global competitiveness, one of the lowest for
an OECD country and below several other countries in the region (Global Competitiveness Report
2009-10). Mexico’s labor productivity was low compared to other OECD countries and in 2011
was even below its level in 1995. Therefore, Mexican labor was not able to compete with low cost
producers in Asia and Central America. Mexico thus needed to focus more on moving from a low-
cost labor-based economy to a knowledge-based economy. In addition, Mexico ranked 56th in the
Human Development Index (HDI), the second lowest score among OECD countries, and had a
significant percentage of its population living in moderate and extreme poverty in 2010: 51 and 19
percent, respectively.

2.      The quality of education faced important challenges. Mexico’s performance in the
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) was the lowest among OECD countries. In
PISA 2009 (with an average of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100), Mexico achieved a
greater total of 425 points in reading, 419 points in math, and 416 points in science. By comparison,
the United States, one of Mexico’s main commercial competitors, performed 69 points higher in
math. Learning outcomes, as measured by the national standardized test ENLACE (Evaluación
Nacional del Logro Académico en Centros Escolares), were also low, especially among the poor.
Although test scores have generally increased over time for all students (including indigenous and
disadvantaged students), consistent disparities remain. Students from public schools performed
lower than those from private schools by 0.6 standard deviations (60 points) in ENLACE 2010
(with an average of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100), with this gap increasing for
indigenous and disadvantaged students. In addition, while educational enrollments were
increasing, those that remained outside of the system were mainly poor or indigenous. For
instance, the percentage of net enrollment in 9th grade in 2010 was 87 percent; however, the net
enrollment for the same grade was only 75.30 percent for students living in highly disadvantaged
localities and 85 percent for indigenous students.

3.     To address these challenges, the Alliance for Education Quality (La Alianza para la
Calidad de la Educación) was created through a formal agreement between the Federal
Government and the largest National Teacher’s Union (Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores
de Educación, SNTE). The Alliance sought to improve student learning in basic education via the
mobilization of civil society and state governments, improved participation of all stakeholders,
and the transformation of management and service delivery in education. In this context, the
Quality Schools Program (Programa Escuelas de Calidad, PEC), created in 2001 and supported
by the Bank since 2006, that focused mainly on the peri-urban poor became even more relevant to
advance the country’s education agenda by increasing school autonomy and social participation.




                                                 1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The Loan Agreement (LA) states that the objective of the Project is to “strengthen PEC by
increasing overall coverage and social participation in Eligible Schools while putting greater
emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the indigenous population, as well as a
reorientation of the direct support to schools1 to improve public schools’ internal efficiency and
learning outcomes.” The objective on the LA differs from the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).
The main inconsistency is that the PAD makes it clear that the long term development objective
of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) is “to improve the quality of education as measured by
coverage, social participation, and educational outcomes” and that educational outcomes were not
Project specific objectives as implied by the PDO in the Loan Agreement.

5.       The Key Outcome Indicators of the Project as stated on page 33 of the PAD were:

        Number of schools participating in PEC as percentage of the total number of basic
         education schools (from 18 in 2009 to 22 percent in 2013);
        Total number of basic education schools participating in PEC (from 39,180 in 2009 to
         50,000 in 2013);
        Commitment to the goals and activities of the Strategic School Transformation Plan (Plan
         Estratégico de Transformación Escolar, PETE) (as expressed by parental participation in
         PETE design or adjustment (as percentage of total parents) (from 74.2 percent in 2009 to
         80 percent in 2013);
        Percentage of PEC schools in highly marginalized and marginalized areas (from 40 percent
         in 2009 to 50 percent in 2013); and
        Percentage of PEC schools with indigenous students (from 7 percent in 2009 to 15 percent
         in 2013).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.     The PDO was not revised. In the April 2013 restructuring, three out of five key indicators
were revised, one dropped (due to repetition), and one added to ensure the full measurement of the
PDO achievement. The following are the revised/added key indicators:

        Percent of basic and special education schools participating in PEC (from 20.3 in 2009 to
         23 percent in 2013). Revised to clarify its meaning, includes an explicit reference to special
         education schools (also covered by PEC).
        Percentage of school community members who participate in the design of the PETE (from
         74.2 in 2009 to 75 percent in 2013). Revised because baseline data reflected the
         participation of community members, not parents.
        Percentage of Indigenous modality schools participating in PEC (from 15.4 in 2009 to
         19.35 percent in 2013). Revised to better reflect the Project’s impact on PEC’s reach to the


1
 School Grants, originally used in the PDO, has been replaced with the term “direct support to schools” at the request
of the Borrower

                                                          2
       indigenous population. Under the original indicator, a PEC school was counted if it had
       only one indigenous student.
      Percentage of direct support to schools spent on education quality inputs (from 59.7 in
       2009 to 66.86 percent in 2013). Added to measure the reorientation of the direct support to
       schools.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.     The Project benefited public basic education (pre-primary, primary and lower secondary)
schools participating in PEC in all 31 states and the Federal District while putting greater emphasis
on marginalized areas and on the indigenous population. Principals, parents, teachers, and students
in approximately 49,000 PEC schools and 7,669,759 students (annual average) benefited through
the provision of direct support to schools and technical assistance to implement school
improvement plans. Indirect Project beneficiaries were education authorities at the state level that
received technical assistance to oversee the Project and improve their prioritization of indigenous
schools and schools in marginalized areas.

1.6 Revised Components

11.    Component 2 was amended in the April 2013 restructuring to: (i) specify the provision of
technical assistance to the states to improve their prioritization of indigenous schools and schools
in marginalized areas and monitor their adherence to the PEC Operating Rules; (ii) add the
dissemination of the simplified school planning instrument; (iii) add the carrying out of a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) survey to collect data from community members on the strategic
school based management (SBM) model in PEC schools; and (iv) carry out an impact evaluation
and a qualitative evaluation of the Project.

12.    Component 3 was deleted.

1.7 Other significant changes

13.     The April 2013 restructuring also extended the closing date of the Project by one year,
from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014, to allow time for the completion of all Project activities. In
addition, all Project restructurings (April 2013, September 2013, and June 2014) reallocated part
of the Loan Proceeds from Categories 2 (Incremental Project Costs) and/or 3 (Consultant Services)
to Category 1 (Goods, Works and Consultants’ Services under direct support to schools) in order
to increase the number of beneficiary schools and to reflect that the Government was using its own
funds to support the incremental Project costs and consultant services originally planned under the
Project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strengths
     Project preparation took place from May 2009 to June 2010. The Project’s overall focus
       on PEC, which aims to increase school autonomy and social participation, as well as the
       Project’s PDO, which placed greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the
       indigenous population, were well aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
       FY2008-14 (Report No. 42846-MX) objectives of providing comprehensive assistance to
       promote social inclusion and reduce poverty through human development programs.
     Based on the lessons learned from the first phase of the series (Mexico Education Quality
       Project, P088728, Ln. 7347-MX), the new design simplified the school improvement plans
       to increase schools’ and parents’ participation.
     The Project design took into account most of the potential risks in achieving the PDO. The
       main risks considered were: inertia to school management and social participation, lack of
       information on what happens at the school level, complexity in the supervision of funds as
       they flow into schools, and the risk that schools with indigenous children or in low income
       households would not benefit from PEC. The necessary actions to mitigate these risks were
       also considered. The Project design incorporated: (i) specific dissemination and capacity
       building activities to reach the most disadvantaged schools; (ii) technical assistance to
       states so that they could help schools gradually change their culture and increase parental
       participation; (iii) prioritization of indigenous and marginalized schools in PEC Operating

                                                 4
       Rules; and (iv) smaller/rural schools benefited from a less complex school planning
       instrument, among others.
      The Project design focused on increasing the active role of the school community by,
       among others, providing direct support to schools only when the school improvement plans
       were developed by a school community that received capacity building in this area.

Weaknesses
   The PDO was poorly articulated. It was hard to understand what the Project strove to
      achieve. Increasing PEC’s coverage meant expanding SBM to more schools but was not
      explicitly mentioned. Likewise, social participation meant community participation in
      different aspects of the school life (participation in the school council, in the decision
      process to use the direct support to schools, and in developing and implementing projects).
   The PDO in the LA was inconsistent with the PAD, including long term development
      objectives such as improvements in internal efficiency and learning outcomes indicating
      insufficient quality control. The PAD documentation indicated these objectives were for
      the end of the APL series, not for the Project.
   Some lessons regarding the challenges of undertaking rigorous impact evaluations of PEC
      due to the self-selection bias of schools were overseen in the Project’s design. The Project
      could have embedded an Impact Evaluation Strategy, including technical support to
      develop the design and the rest of the impact evaluation stages.
   The challenges associated with the procurement of technical assistance under the first
      phase of the APL, mainly related to the client’s preference to follow local procedures were
      not taken into account. In this regard, better specifications of the procurement processes
      and guidelines, as well as allowing more time to carry out these processes would have been
      helpful.
   The PAD’s economic analysis did not explore the Internal Economic Rate of Return
      (IERR) of the Project or any other cost-effectiveness methodology.

2.2 Implementation

14.     Component 1 was disbursed in a timely manner and was, by far, the largest in terms of
Bank support, with 99.3 percent of the loan allocated to it by the end of the Project. Overall, the
Project supported approximately 75 percent of the total direct support to schools, since schools
received additional funds from states with a federal to state contribution of 3 to 1. Even with
increased federal budget in the first years of the Project, SEP was able to transfer resources to the
National Trust Fund (Fideicomiso Nacional de Escuelas de Calidad, FNEC) efficiently and from
the FNEC to the State Trust Funds (Fideicomisos Estatales de Escuelas de Calidad, FEEC) as
soon as the states deposited their counterpart funding. All 31 states in Mexico and the Federal
District participated in PEC, with the exception of Sonora and Veracruz in the 2012-13 school year
and Chiapas and Veracruz in 2013-14, due to their financial circumstances.

15.     The main challenge faced under this Component was that in some cases, the direct support
to schools arrived late in the school year, preventing them from implementing their Annual Work
Plan (Programa Anual de Trabajo, PAT) as planned. The delays were due to some states’ inability
to make their deposits to the FEEC on time. To try to ensure that schools received the direct support
at the beginning of the school year, SEP, the implementing agency: (i) shortened the deadlines for

                                                 5
states’ deposits in the Operating Rules (as early as June 30 when the school year starts in mid-
August); (ii) built a system of incentives where states that made their deposits on time were able
to get additional federal resources; and (iii) sent official letters (“oficios”) and continuous
reminders to prompt states to deposit in a timely manner. In 2012, 15 states did not disburse direct
support to schools’ funds on time (by September); in 2013, only 10 states exceeded the time on
the disbursement of these funds.

16.     Component 2 (Monitoring and Oversight). Despite the variety of ways in which the states
reported their information to SEP, the Federal authority had enough capacity to aggregate the data
to generate a dataset with sufficient information to monitor the performance of the Project and
PEC. However, the continuous operation, maintenance and upgrading of the Information System
for the Quality Schools Program (Sistema de Información del Programa Escuelas de Calidad,
SIPEC) and compatible state systems faced important challenges, mainly due to the disparity
among the states’ institutional capacity, technical glitches, and the server’s low capacity. San Luis
Potosí, Michoacán, Estado de México, and Guanajuato were able to smoothly run their information
systems from the beginning of the Project, ensuring that schools reported information on-line to
feed the SIPEC. The rest of the states continued to use outdated methods of data collection and
analysis, such as pen and paper instruments or basic excel sheets. In an effort to help states with
M&E shortcomings, SEP customized and targeted its support to weaker states, resulting in overall
strengthening of these states’ M&E capacity. However, the large degree of heterogeneity in terms
of the reliability and frequency at which states report data persists. In 2014, the Bank provided
technical assistance to review the PEC national databases and recommended harmonizing all
historical information to develop one single data set of PEC schools over time.2

17.     After the April 2013 restructuring, SEP began targeting technical assistance to the states to
particularly improve the prioritization of indigenous schools and marginalized areas. For instance,
the last PEC Annual Meetings focused, among others, on targeting criteria and states’ adherence
to the PEC Operating Rules. In addition, SEP started formally reviewing the states’ calls for
proposals for PEC and the explicit inclusion of prioritization criteria for schools located in
indigenous and marginalized communities.

18.     The impact evaluation was delayed due to the difficulty in reconciling certain
administrative requirements with the requirements of the Bank’s procurement procedures;
nevertheless, this activity was not crucial to the achievement of the PDO. However, SEP was
successful in the implementation of an information campaign to disseminate the Project’s
objectives, activities and results. The dissemination of the simplified school planning instrument
was carried out through the Project and reinforced in the last year and was critical to boosting
participation of more disadvantaged schools in PEC and to increasing social participation among
school stakeholders.

19.    Component 3 (Policy Development and Evaluation). The implementation of the activities
under this Component proved challenging because the Government was undertaking most of the


2
  The Bank also recommended distinguishing PEC schools receiving only technical assistance from those receiving
technical assistance and direct support. Aside from these efforts, the information on the roster of schools participating
in PEC continues to suffer from the lack of information from a few schools.

                                                           6
activities with their own budgetary funds outside of the Project. For instance, the external
evaluation of PEC’s performance and preparation of an annual report was developed by the
National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Consejo Nacional de la
Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social, CONEVAL) through annual reports in different
areas including design, objectives, performance and consistency and results. In the April 2013
restructuring, this Component was eliminated because none of the activities (apart from the impact
evaluation of the program, which was moved to Component 2) were critical to the achievement of
the PDO.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20.     Design: The Project’s Results Framework (PRF) was not fully developed. The key
indicators did not measure all aspects of the PDO achievement. In other cases, indicators were
repetitive or lacked clarity. The PAD also had a lack of consistency regarding key indicators in
different sections of the document (page 7 and page 33). It integrated an indicator to measure
learning outcomes, one of the long term objectives after Project closing, but not an indicator on
internal efficiency, the other long term goal. The PRF included outcome indicators that were more
aligned with the Project’s PDO and activities than others and some that were broad and difficult
to measure. Not all aspects of the PDO were covered by the original key indicators; in particular,
the reorientation of direct support to schools. The original data collection methods explanations
lacked clarity and were in some instances absent from the PAD or other Project documents, and
several baselines were estimated with preliminary data.

21.     Implementation: Data was collected and reported periodically throughout the Project’s
implementation. However, M&E remained a weakness throughout most of the Project until the
April 2013 restructuring, where indicators were revised and the necessary arrangements and
clarifications were made to start collecting data to gather information for some indicators. With
the April 2013 restructuring, many of the shortcomings at design were addressed. In particular, the
restructuring added an indicator to fully measure the PDO and clarified methodologies and
resources for collecting data and tracking Project indicators. For example, an M&E survey to
collect data from community members on the strategic SBM model in PEC schools was explicitly
included in Component 2 to ensure that it was implemented. The M&E survey was carried out
once and could be compared to a previous survey conducted by SEP; however, the second round
of the survey has not been conducted because SEP was unable to contract the firm to undertake
this activity due to the long administrative process it entailed, including the reconciliation of the
Bank’s procurement guidelines with internal administrative procedures. Additionally, the lack of
timely information from a few states to the Federal Government prevented SEP from updating the
PRF on some occasions. In any case, the biannual Project Implementation Reports and
implementation support missions were always useful and provided enough information to
understand the status of the Project.

22.     Utilization: The implementing agency and the Bank constantly assessed and used Project
data to inform decision-making and resource allocation. For instance, information was used to
constantly revise the PEC Operating Rules, which experienced various changes such as: (i)
changes in the timing in which states needed to deposit their counterpart funds in the FNEC; (ii)
changes to further stress marginalized and indigenous schools prioritization; and (iii) changes in

                                                 7
the percentages of direct supports to schools to be spent on education quality inputs, to name a
few. In addition, the M&E information was also useful to provide just in time support and
information to states and indigenous and marginalized schools in order to ensure that they applied
for entry into the program and benefited from it.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23.    Environmental and social safeguards: The Project had an environmental category C. In
some cases, PEC schools conducted minor rehabilitation works that did not entail a negative
environmental impact. The Project also triggered OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples). The
Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) Plan Indígena Programa Escuelas de Calidad 2010 (published on
the Bank’s and SEP’s webpages) was based on an evaluation of PEC execution in indigenous
schools and consultations with stakeholders. The IPP was implemented adequately, ensuring that
indigenous schools participated and benefited from the Project and reaching 7 percent of
indigenous schools as a proportion of the total number of schools in the program in the school year
2013-2014, when the target set in the IPP was of only 4 percent.

24.    Financial Management (FM): The Project’s FM arrangements were adequate to provide
reasonable assurance that Project funds were used for the purposes intended. Minor shortcomings
in FM existed, but did not prevent the timely and reliable provision of information required to
manage and monitor Project implementation. Project audit reports were delivered on time
throughout the life of the Project and were considered acceptable to the Bank.

25.    Procurement: Ex-post reviews of PEC schools’ procurement were carried out in
Guanajuato, Michoacán, Puebla, State of Mexico, Tlaxcala and Aguascalientes. Minor
procurement weaknesses were identified, mainly in the integration of records, requests for
quotations, and schools investments. These shortcomings did not have material impacts on
compliance with procurement policy requirements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

26.     PEC is a top priority for SEP, as it is seen as the program for spearheading the
implementation of an ambitious Reform launched in 2013 to improve the quality of education
through, among others, strengthening SBM. The SBM policy is currently implemented through
different national programs such as PEC, PETC and Support for School Management (Apoyos a
la Gestión Escolar, AGE – managed by the National Council for Education Development, Consejo
Nacional de Fomento Educativo, CONAFE). In 2007-08, SEP introduced PETC in basic education
to increase the number of school-day hours and promote SBM following the PEC scheme. The
PETC’s SBM component is exactly the same as PEC’s. These programs share the goal of
contributing to students’ learning within a framework of more school autonomy and social
participation. In addition, based on the lessons learned from this Project, the use of evaluations to
improve pedagogical strategies and managerial capacities at the school level are being introduced.
The Bank is supporting the Government with a new School Based Management Project (P147185,
Ln. 8446-MX, approved by the Board on October 24, 2014) which will provide support to PEC
and PETC. The development objective of this operation is to improve schools’ managerial capacity
and parental participation to reduce dropout, repetition and failure rates among schools

                                                 8
participating in PEC and PETC.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – High / Post April 2013 Restructuring High

27.     The relevance of the PDO is deemed to be High pre and post the April 2013 restructuring.
The Project objectives are relevant to the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY14-FY19 (Report No. 83496) and fit under the CPS theme II “Increasing Social Prosperity,”
under the fifth area of engagement “Promoting Labor Markets for Inclusive Growth.” One of the
main priorities for Mexico’s growth and development, emphasized both in the reform process and
in the National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013-18, is improving the quality of education, which
is consistent with the Project’s long term objective of improving learning outcomes. The NDP also
focuses on reducing the achievement gaps between rich and poor to increase productivity and long-
term growth while reducing social inequalities, which is consistent with the PDO’s focus on
indigenous and marginalized populations. In addition, the 2013 constitutional mandate and the
Education Sector Program 2013-18 (Plan Sectorial de Educación, PSE) put schools at the center
of the education system by fostering national strategies to, among others: introduce mechanisms
to allocate direct support to schools and increase schools’ management capacity; strengthen the
relationship between the school, parents, and the broader community to collaborate with the
school; and increase transparency and accountability, all of which are consistent with the Project’s
objectives of expanding the PEC SBM model and increasing social participation to eventually
improve public schools’ internal efficiency and learning outcomes.

Design
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial

28.      The Project design is considered Substantial before and after the April 2013 restructuring.
The Project mainly focused on providing direct support to schools to implement their school
improvement plans and providing technical assistance to states, crucial activities to expand the
PEC SBM model to more schools. Project activities such as the dissemination of the simplified
school planning instrument were highly relevant to increase participation of schools located in
indigenous communities and marginalized areas and increase social participation. The provision
of technical assistance and guidance to develop school improvement plans in a collaborative way
(by the school director, teachers, parents, the community and the students) was crucial to build the
schools capacity to spend the direct support in education quality inputs while increasing
community participation in different aspects of the school life. Technical assistance for an M&E
survey to collect data on social participation and an impact evaluation was included. While not
critical to the achievement of the PDO, this technical assistance was instrumental in measuring
PDO achievement and in providing stronger evidence of impact that could inform future
interventions. The design had minor shortcomings, for example, it could have included technical
assistance to design an evaluation strategy and to explicitly train principals at the school level.

29.     There is emerging literature that SBM can lead to improved learning outcomes and internal
efficiency.3 Three impact evaluations show significant reductions in dropout and repetition rates
and increments in pass rates in PEC schools (Skoufias and Shapiro 2006, Murnane, Willet and
Cardenas 2006, C230 Consultores, 2012).

  Evidence of links between SBM and improved learning outcomes is mixed. Evidence from Kenya shows that parent-
teacher associations lead to better learning outcomes (Duflo et al 2014) when parents are empowered through specific
capacity building. In The Gambia, SBM was shown to reduce student and teacher absenteeism; SBM only had a
positive effect on learning outcomes in communities with high literacy, otherwise the effect could be potentially
negative in communities with low literacy (Blimpo, Evans 2011). In Indonesia, SBM was found to have links to
improved learning outcomes only when school based management is complemented by linkages between the school
committee (Pradhan et al. 2014). Evidence also shows that SBM has improved social participation, governance,
transparency, and accountability, leading to lower dropout and repetition rates (Gertler et al 2012). A recent
observational study suggests that school autonomy may lead to improved learning outcomes when strong central
institutions are in place, but otherwise possibly detrimental (Hanushek et al. 2012). Finally, another study argues that
SBM programs need to be in place for at least 5 years to achieve significant results and at least 8 years to “transform”
schools (Borman et al. 2003).

Strengthen PEC by increasing its overall coverage
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – High / Post April 2013 Restructuring – High

31.     The number of schools operating under the PEC SBM model increased from 20.30 percent
of the total of basic and special education schools to 23.85 percent in the 2013-14 school year,
exceeding both the original target of 22 percent and the revised target of 23 percent. Almost 10,000
additional schools participated in the program, from 40,790 in 2008-9 to 50,624 in 2013-14, also
exceeding the 50,000 PEC schools target set at Appraisal.

32.     The Project contributed to increasing the coverage of eligible schools by offering direct
support to all new schools entering the program. Having a school improvement plan developed by
the school community was mandatory to access the direct school support that was then used to
support activities related the school improvement plan at each school (which vary considerably
depending on specific schools’ needs). Aggregate numbers for 2012-13 show that most of the
direct support to schools (39.4 percent) was spent on schools’ technical equipment and furniture
and on teaching materials (18.5 percent). Schools also used direct support for rehabilitation (15.3),
school materials (8.8 percent), minor constructions (5 percent), capacity building activities (1.5
percent), and others (11.5 percent). Direct support to schools average around US$4,000 per year


                                                              11
and, while small compared to the total costs of running schools, are not insignificant when
compared to the budget managed directly by the schools.

33.     The Project also helped ensure the participation of a higher number of schools through the
simplification of the schools’ application process and the school planning instrument (PETE). In
addition, the design and implementation of the information campaign to disseminate PEC’s
objectives, activities and results contributed by increasing awareness. Finally, the Project
supported technical assistance to the states, which strengthened their capacity to reach out to a
greater number of schools and encouraged them to apply to and stay in the Program.

Strengthen PEC by increasing overall social participation
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Modest / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Modest

34.     The percentage of surveyed school community members who participated in the design of
the school planning instrument (PETE) remained at around 73 percent throughout the Project and
the pre and post restructuring targets of 80 and 75 percent, respectively, were not achieved. On the
other hand, the percentage of surveyed school community members that observe participatory
decision-making between parents, teachers and principals increased from an already high 90.2 in
2008-9 to 93.5 percent in 2012-13, exceeding the original target of 93 and the restructured target
of 91 percent.

35.     The Project, through PEC, helped improve parental participation by providing
supplemental direct support to schools that mobilized additional local resources to implement their
school plans. The supplemental supports matched the amount of local resources raised by the
school. This worked as an incentive for parents and the community to work together to raise funds
for the school and become more involved in the development of school plans and their
implementation. In addition, the Project engaged parents and community members to actively
participate in the school self-evaluation, planning, and implementation processes by enforcing the
collaborative development of school improvement plans and building the capacity of school
communities on collaborative SBM. The dissemination of the simplified school planning
instrument (consisting of a manual with a series of recommendations intended to make the school
planning process clearer, easier, and more efficient for schools while easily explaining the role of
different stakeholders in collaborative SBM) was also critical to encouraging greater participation
of parents and the school community in school affairs since it allowed poorly educated parents to
better understand the school planning processes and thus, be better able to contribute to them.

Greater emphasis on marginalized schools
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial

36.     The percentage of PEC schools in marginalized and highly marginalized areas increased
from 38.4 percent in 2009-10 to 51.35 percent in the 201-14 school year; exceeding the original
target and almost meeting the revised target, which was 93 percent achieved. The percentage of
PEC schools located in areas with a medium level of marginalization (that still face important
socioeconomic challenges) and in highly and very highly marginalized areas reached 78 percent
in 2012-13, compared to only 65.3 percent in the school year 2009-10. One of the major factors
affecting the full achievement of the target was that Chiapas and Veracruz, two of the states with

                                                12
a higher percentage of schools located in marginalized and indigenous communities, were not able
to participate in the last year of the Project due mainly to their financial circumstances, preventing
participation of an important percentage of marginalized schools.

37.     The Project contributed to increasing the participation of marginalized schools by
constantly revising the PEC Operating Rules to stress prioritization of schools located in
indigenous and marginalized communities and by providing technical assistance to the states to
improve their prioritization of these schools. Specific activities supported under the Project were:
(i) regular supervision visits to all states to ensure that prioritization of schools in indigenous and
marginalized areas was made adequately; (ii) the organization of capacity building activities at the
state level to build the states’ capacity to manage the program and better select schools; and (iii)
regional and national meetings by federal and state authorities. In addition, the Project contributed
to increasing the number of PEC schools located in marginalized communities by supporting the
dissemination of the simplified school planning instrument, which helped school directors, parents,
teachers, and students be more aware of and better understand the simplified instrument, put
together their school plans even with low capacity and resources, apply to PEC, and increase their
chances of being selected.

Greater emphasis on the Indigenous Population
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial

38.     The number of PEC schools that reported to have one or more indigenous students
increased from 7 percent in the school year 2009-10 to 13.5 percent in the school year 2011-12,
meeting 90 percent of the original target. As for the percentage of indigenous modality schools
participating in PEC (indicator introduced at restructuring), 18 percent of indigenous modality
schools participated in the last year of the Project, meeting 93 percent of the revised target.
However, one year earlier, 20.8 percent of indigenous schools participated in PEC, surpassing this
target.

39.     The Project contributed in the same way to achieving this objective as to the objective of
greater emphasis on marginalized schools.

Reorientation of the Direct Support to Schools
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – High / Post April 2013 Restructuring – High

40.     The percentage of direct support to schools spent on education quality inputs increased
from 59.70 percent in the school year 2009-10 to 74.54 percent in the 2012-13 school year, widely
exceeding the 66.86 percent target set during the April 2013 restructuring. Education quality
inputs included furniture and technical equipment, teaching materials, school materials, and
capacity building. The Project helped reorient direct school support to education quality inputs by
providing the necessary technical assistance to the states and schools to make adequate and
informed choices when preparing and implementing their school plans with PEC resources. For
instance, the Project strengthened states’ capacity building on the consolidation of the Modelo de
Gestión Escolar con Enfoque Estratégico (MGEE), a SBM model that helps the school community
use local information in a systematic way to use PEC support to prioritize needs that are more
correlated with student learning. In addition, the Project contributed to reorienting direct support

                                                  13
to schools to education quality inputs by incorporating specific percentages of the direct school
support to be allocated by schools to certain categories. For instance, through the Project’s length,
newly incorporated schools should spend 30 percent of their direct school support on the
improvement of students’ learning processes, which includes teachers’, school directors’, and
parents’ capacity building activities and the acquisition of school materials; schools with more
years in the program should spend 50 percent in the same category.

Improved public schools’ internal efficiency
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Substantial

41.     This ICR defines the schools’ internal efficiency as the schools’ ability to retain students
and ensure that they advance through the education system as planned. Average dropout rates for
PEC primary schools decreased from 0.041 to 0.038 percent from 2008-9 to 2012-13 and from
0.054 to 0.052 percent for secondary schools. Average pass rates in PEC primary schools increased
from 96 percent in 2008-9 to 99 percent in 2012-13 and from 89 to 92 percent in PEC secondary
schools. Both rates are better for PEC than for non-PEC schools.

42.    To contribute to the improvement of the internal efficiency of PEC schools, the Project
helped increase school autonomy in managing the direct support to schools, as well as in spending
the direct support on education quality inputs. The Project’s efforts to increase community
members’ participation in the school improvement plans led to greater engagement in school life,
and there is evidence that these efforts have also led to greater teacher accountability. For example,
the percentage of community members that observed that parents were informed about student
performance increased from 99 to 99.80 percent. In addition, the percentage of parents that
observe: (i) teachers encouraging and supporting students’ performance increased from 90.20 to
93.50; and (ii) teacher encouraging the active participation of students increased from 66.90 to
91.50.

Improved public schools’ learning outcomes
Rating: Pre April 2013 Restructuring – Modest / Post April 2013 Restructuring – Modest

43.     PEC schools improved their ENLACE results with greater gains in Mathematics. ENLACE
results in math went from 503 and 494 in the 2008-09 school year for primary and secondary,
respectively, to 506 and 537 in 2012-13. In the same time period, Spanish ENLACE results for
primary improved from 498 to 534 and remained stable at the secondary level.

44.   The Project contributed in the same way to achieving this objective as it did to meeting the
improved public schools’ internal efficiency.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Pre-2013 restructuring – Modest / Post-2013 restructuring – Modest

45.    According to the economic analysis in the PAD, the increase in the participation of
indigenous and marginalized schools in PEC should help to better target the disadvantaged
population in Mexico and thus improve the equity of basic education. This was confirmed during
the 2010-13 period, when PEC indigenous schools decreased their failure rate by 4.5 percent,

                                                 14
producing an increase in indigenous students’ years of schooling of 0.045 for each PEC cohort
during the same period. When these individuals enter the labor market, the increased years of
education will result in an increase of 0.225 percent in their monthly salary. During the same period,
failure rates decreased by 3.4 for disadvantaged students in PEC, producing an increase in these
students’ years of schooling of 0.034. When these individuals enter the labor market, the increased
years of education will result in an increment of 0.187 percent in their monthly salary (see Annex
3 for further details).

46.    In addition, secondary schools increased math achievement by 0.30 standard deviation in
3 years (during the Project), from an average PISA score of 355 to 385. Using the estimates and
methodology elaborated by De Hoyos (2010) to measure the economic benefits of increased
learning outcomes, the result could be translated into an increase of 16 percent of the annual
income of Mexican families in 2010, which translates to a decrease in poverty of 3.88 million
inhabitants in Mexico. While the result is for all the secondary schools in Mexico, PEC schools
have contributed to this result (PEC schools outperformed other schools in ENLACE in the same
period of time).

47.      Although no IERR was calculated at Appraisal, the Project’s economic efficiency is also
illustrated by the results from recent economic analysis of the program, which yields a 6.5 percent
IERR. The costs of the Project were US$366.66 million for the four years of the Project, or an
average of US$91.66 million per year. The average federal annual unit cost per school decreased
over the life of the Project because each year more schools were accepted into PEC (from 40,790
in 2009 to 50,624 in 2014, exceeding the original target of 50,000) while the budget increased only
slightly from MX$1,477,418,501 in 2009 to MX$1,515,911,529 in 2014. The annual cost per
school and student at the end of the Project were lower than at Appraisal (US$1,873 now versus
US$2,247 at Appraisal and US$14 now versus US$16 at Appraisal, respectively). Therefore,
efficiency increased through the Project’s life. In addition, a comparison of PEC’s student unit
cost to other education interventions shows that PEC is relatively inexpensive and renders
important gains in terms of improved public schools’ internal efficiency. This cost is lower than the
unit cost per student of PETC, where the cost per student in 2012 was US$167.

48.     Other aspects of efficiency that have to be taken into account are the one year extension of
the Project’s closing date and the states’ delays in depositing their contributions for the direct
support to schools. The former illustrates modest inefficiencies in completing the Project in a
timely manner, while the latter reflects some inefficiency (around 10 out of 32 states delayed their
funding in 2013, an improvement from the 15 that had delayed in 2012) in ensuring that the direct
support to schools reached them in time to implement their school plans in an effective and
efficient way.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.    Relevance ratings for objectives are High for both the pre- and post-2013 restructuring
periods. The relevance rating for design pre and post restructuring is Substantial. Efficacy ratings
are Substantial for both periods. Finally, the Efficiency rating is Modest for both periods. The
combination of these ratings yields an overall Moderately Satisfactory rating for both periods

                                                 15
(Table 2). In turn, the overall ratings for the two periods are weighted by the disbursement
percentages prior to and following the April 2013 restructuring, yielding an overall weighted rating
of 4.0–equivalent to Moderately Satisfactory.

*This is a long term objective, beyond the scope of the Project. As such, the ICR does report on and rate progress, but the overall
rating puts less weight on this objective.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

50.     The Project contributes to the Bank’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity by contributing to the long-term objectives of improving learning
outcomes and retention rates among students in public schools, particularly those from
marginalized areas, through strengthened SBM. Recent evidence shows that SBM programs can
be an effective strategy to increase parental participation in school decisions; reduce dropout,
repetition and failure rates and, under certain conditions, increase learning outcomes.

51.    At the macro level, a society with more human capital–measured, for instance, by years of
schooling or learning outcomes (long term objectives to which the Project contributed to) in a
standardized test—enjoys higher rates of long term economic growth. Conversely, from the micro
perspective, more human capital translates into higher personal or household incomes, less poverty


                                                               16
and, if the increases in human capital take place among disadvantaged households (which is the
case in this Project), less income inequality.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening
N/A

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

52.    The transformation of the PEC program into a nationwide school autonomy policy was an
unintended outcome of this Project. This policy decision has also contributed to the expansion of
PETC.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

53.     The 2013 education reform has reinforced the policy to strengthen school autonomy,
allowing SEP to expand the number of public schools that receive support following PEC’s design
in all public programs in basic education that have a SBM and autonomy component. The overall
number of basic education schools with support to increase school autonomy is expected to expand
considerably with the implementation of the reform. In consequence, social participation, the
reorientation of direct support to schools to education quality inputs, schools’ internal efficiency
and learning outcomes are expected to continue to improve in all schools benefiting from the PEC
SBM model expanded by the new SBM policy. In addition, the new School Based Management
Project (P147185, Ln. 8446-MX) will help foster the autonomy policy through the provision of
support to PEC and PETC in order to ensure that the development outcomes of PEC (Phase II) are
maintained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54.     The Bank provided assistance to the Government to prepare a Project that was relevant and
strategic for the Mexican context. The Project design also took into account poverty and social
development aspects, putting greater emphasis on public marginalized schools and on the
indigenous population. The major shortcomings were the poor articulation of the PDO and the
weaknesses of the PRF. In addition, the Bank did not foresee the technical, administrative and
procurement challenges related to undertaking a rigorous impact evaluation of PEC and other
technical assistance, which had also emerged in the first phase of the APL. Hence, many of the
technical assistance activities designed at Appraisal, including the impact evaluation, could not be
finalized as part of the Project, though others were carried out as they were part of the activities

                                                17
that the Government undertakes regularly through their own budget resources. These activities and
the impact evaluation were not critical to the achievement of the PDO. In terms of FM, the Project
was designed in a way that made the flow of funds quite complex for the Government and the
Bank. The economic analysis did not present an IERR or any methodology to measure the cost-
effectiveness of the Project.

(c)    Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55.     The Bank conducted regular implementation support missions that included meetings with
the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, SHCP),
National Financial Development Bank (Nacional Financiera, S.N.C., I.B.D, NAFIN) and SEP, as
well as field visits to PEC schools in different states and in the Federal District. It also sustained a
close and continuous dialogue with the Subsecretariat of Basic Education (Subsecretaría de
Educación Básica, SEB), which facilitated the close monitoring of Project implementation. Bank
implementation support helped identify the challenges being faced at various stages of Project
implementation in a timely manner. For instance, it was aware of the delays in the states’ payments
and helped the implementing agency find, implement and follow up on alternatives to solve this
challenge. The Bank also provided key technical assistance when needed. For instance, it provided
feedback to the impact evaluation design and organized a conference on quality of education and
SBM to reflect on the achievements of the PEC model and to learn from international experiences
to improve Project implementation and the new SBM reform. The Bank processed a useful Level
2 restructuring that helped ensure that the PDO was well measured and targets on indicators
achieved. The safeguards and fiduciary teams continuously supervised and developed follow-up
reports regarding the implementation of the IPP and followed up on detailed aspects of
disbursements of direct support to schools, audits, etc. while building staff capacity in the
Directorate of School Management (Dirección General Adjunta de Gestión, DGAG) in both
fiduciary and technical aspects. There were moderate shortcomings. To address design and
weaknesses in M&E, the restructuring should have been conducted much earlier and the PDO
should have been revised to make it clear that learning outcomes and internal efficiency were
objectives beyond the scope of the Project.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.     Given that Bank performance was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory at Ensuring Quality at
Entry and Moderately Satisfactory at Quality of Supervision, the Bank’s overall performance is
considered Moderately Satisfactory, taking into account the outcome rating of Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                  18
57.     The Government showed ownership of the Project and commitment to achieving its
development objectives. Throughout the duration of the Project, SHCP provided enough budget
to SEP, and PEC in particular, and ensured that the loan was fully disbursed by its revised closing
date, with most of the funds reaching the schools directly through the direct supports to schools.
SHCP continuously followed up with the Bank, the implementing agency, and NAFIN to ensure
that the Project worked as planned, including overseeing the Project implementation arrangements,
the implementing agency capacity, and addressing challenges to the successful achievement of the
Project’s objectives. Despite a change in the administration (and political parties) in December
2012, the Government ensured the continuity of PEC and requested Bank support for a new project
in order to develop activities to foster and expand SBM and autonomy through PEC and PETC.
NAFIN also performed well in its role of fiduciary agent of the Government for the Loan, ensuring
that FM, governance, provision of counterpart funding, procurement, reimbursements, and
compliance with covenants were followed.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.      SEP, through the General Directorate of School Management and Education Innovation
(Dirección General de Desarrollo de la Gestión e Innovación Educativa, DGDGIE), and in
particular the DGAG, executed PEC’s budget in a timely fashion and ensured that most of the
Project activities were implemented as planned. In close collaboration with the states, SEP ensured
the expansion of PEC in general and of PEC schools located in indigenous and marginalized areas
in particular. The adequate use of direct support to schools and the enhancement of social
participation at the school level were also a top priority for the implementing agency. SEP provided
technical assistance to the states so that they could run the program as specified in the Operating
Rules, including better prioritization of vulnerable schools. There were moderate shortcomings.
The main challenge that SEP faced was to ensure that M&E arrangements were in place at the
state level. In addition, although SEP made an effort to execute the studies envisioned in the Project,
it was not always able to expedite administrative and procurement procedures to ensure that these
activities took place on time and with Project funds. In particular, greater attention to the
implementation of the impact evaluation would have been desirable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.       The overall rating for Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

         Early adjustment of PDO and PRF is desirable.
         A rigorous impact evaluation of PEC is crucial to understand the effect of the program on
          learning outcomes. Undertaking rigorous impact evaluations of programs with a voluntary
          enrollment nature, such as PEC, has been challenging, mainly due to the schools’ self-
          selection biases introduced to conventional non-randomized evaluation approaches. In the
          case of PEC, an impact evaluation should only be supported in future Projects if the


                                                 19
       necessary technical assistance is provided to develop the evaluation’s design and if states
       commit to operate PEC in a different manner to comply with randomization criteria.
      Local Education Authorities (Autoridades Educativas Locales, AELs) play an important
       role in planning and implementing federal programs on the ground. It is important to find
       compelling ways to ensure that all states provide their PEC counterpart financing in a
       timely manner and comply with MIS that are compatible with the federal MIS. It is also
       crucial to ensure that states comply with the rules and criteria to guide the program while
       taking into account the disparities regarding the institutional capacity among states to
       distribute federal resources and technical assistance. It is important to provide each state
       with a suite of services to implement school autonomy and accountability initiatives,
       according to their particular needs and shortcomings.
      In future operations, Project procurement and FM should be simplified in regards to the
       direct support to schools to avoid burdening schools with excessive administrative
       requirements and delays in the reporting of disbursements and proof of expenditures from
       the Government to the Bank.
      Moving into country systems in countries with a solid fiduciary structure (such as Mexico)
       could help expedite technical assistance procurement processes and ensure that countries
       benefit from the technical assistance built into the project designs without necessarily
       compromising healthy procurement procedures.
      The simplification and dissemination of school planning instruments help disadvantaged
       schools put together initial school improvement plans and therefore allow them to benefit
       more frequently from programs such as PEC. It is crucial, however, to provide schools with
       the resources and technical assistance to develop their plans to ensure that they design and
       implement plans that actually improve student learning.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     De Hoyos (2010) analyzes the consequences of the lack of education reforms that could
have increased education quality during the 1970s in Mexico. The author argues that if an
educational reform had happened during the 1970s, it would have increased PISA educational
achievement by half of a standard deviation in 10 years from an average PISA score of 406 to 456.
The result would have been an increase of 28% in the annual income of Mexican families by 2010,
which translates to a decrease in poverty of 6.8 million Mexicans.

2.     In addition, secondary schools increased math achievement by 0.30 standard deviation in
3 years (during the Project) from an average PISA score of 355 to 385. Using the estimates and
methodology elaborated by De Hoyos (2010) to measure the economic benefits of increased
learning outcomes, the result could be translated to an increase of 16 percent of the annual income
of Mexican families in 2010, which translates to a decrease in poverty of 3.88 million inhabitants
in Mexico. While the result is for all the secondary schools in Mexico, PEC schools have
contributed to this result (PEC schools outperformed other schools in ENLACE in the same period
of time).

3.      The incremental participation of indigenous and marginalized schools in PEC should help
to better target the disadvantaged population in Mexico and thus improve the equity of basic
education. During the 2010 to 2013 period, PEC indigenous schools decreased their failure rate
by 4.5 percent, producing an increase in indigenous students’ years of schooling of 0.045 for each
PEC cohort during the same period.

4.     With the expansion of PEC and its potential effects on indigenous students, the average
worker will have an additional 0.045 years of schooling in 2037, reaching 7.5 years of schooling,
according to our calculations. Although this seems to be a small change, it is far from trivial. For
instance, according to the ENIGH 2012, the average annual household per capita income in urban,
semi-urban and semi-rural areas in Mexico is MX$144,525.7 pesos of 2012. Assuming a return to
the additional year of schooling in these localities of 5 percent, every generation of project
beneficiaries would experience an average increase of MX$325.18 (=MX$144,525*0.045*0.05)
per year vis-à-vis the labor remuneration that the same generation would have obtained in the
absence of the Project. The monetary effects for the affected fraction of the workforce of the
increase years of schooling brought about by the expansion of the Project is defined by the
following expression:

                                      B     Y ∗ β ∗ ∆S ∗ P

5.      Where B is the monetary benefits of the Project at time “t”, P is the workforce, ∆ is a
change operator capturing the effects of the Project. Using the expression and assumptions above,
plus the workforce of 59.0 million, in 2022 around 2.48 million will be affected by the expansion
of PEC in indigenous schools. Additionally, the monetary benefits of the Project after one year of
completion are equal to MX$806 thousands pesos (=MX$144,525*0.045*0.002*2.48 million) at
2012 prices. The sum of the flows of economic benefits up to 2037 amount to MX$12.1 million
or US$896 thousand dollars at the official exchange rate of MX$13.5 per dollar (May 22, 2014).


                                                25
6.       During the same period, failure rate decreased by 3.4 percent for disadvantaged students in
PEC, producing an increase in these students’ years of schooling of 0.034. When these individuals
enter the labor market, the increased years of education will result in an increment of 0.187 percent
in their monthly salary.

7.      Finally, the costs of the Project were US$366.66 million (including counterpart funding)
for the four years of the Project, or an average of US$91.66 million per year. The average federal
annual unity cost per school decreased from Appraisal to Project closing because each year more
schools were accepted into PEC (from 40,790 in 2009 to 50,624 in 2014, exceeding the original
target of 50,000) while the budget increased only slightly from 1,477,418,501 in 2010 to
1,515,911,529 in 2014. The cost per school and student at the end of the Project were lower than
at Appraisal (US$1,873 now versus US$2,247 at Appraisal and US$14 now versus US$16 at
Appraisal, respectively). Therefore, efficiency increased through the Project’s life. In addition,
comparing PEC’s student unit cost to other similar education interventions shows that PEC is
relatively inexpensive and renders important gains in terms of improved public schools’ internal
efficiency. This cost is considerably lower than the unit cost per student of PETC (which includes
PEC’s SBM component and an extended school day, among others) where the cost per student in
2012 was US$167.

A. ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
This section describes the Project Development Objective and its components.

B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
The long term development objective specified that the Project should improve quality of
education as measured by three indicators: Coverage of PEC, Social Participation, and Educational
Outcomes.

Coverage: As shown in the Figure 1, the target of the percentage of schools participating in PEC
was exceeded in all years. The Project’s restructuring set a goal for 2013, which follows the trend
of steady growth projected in previous years. In 2009, when the baseline was established, the
number of schools in PEC was preliminary with a figure of 39,180; however, this baseline was
adjusted in the April 2013 restructuring to 40,790 so the percentage of participating schools was
20.3 percent, rather than 18 percent as initially calculated.

Social Participation: Data was collected in 2009 (baseline) and in 2012 (follow up). The data was
collected through a survey administered to a representative sample of randomly selected schools
nationwide. The main results are presented in Table 1.

      25% (from 39,180 in 2009 to
                                                 Program met its objective of increasing from 39,180 in 2009 to 50,624 in
      approximately 50,000 in 2013)

                                                 aimed for a third round of data collection to better inform these results, but,
                                                 the administrative process to obtain the required budget for this exercise has

       increases from 7% in 2009 to 15% in         students that participated in PEC was 17% and for the school year 2013-14
       2013.                                       that percentage was of 19.3%.
 * These figures were obtained with the M-U-R-CIA (Marginación Urbana Rural establecida por la Coordinación de Información y
 Análisis) method, which uses the urban level of marginalization determined by AGEBs (Áreas Geoestadísticas Básicas) and the level of
 marginalization by locality according to information from the national census. The method prioritized the urban level of marginalization
 in those schools where there is no marginalization level and put in second place the level of marginalization by locality.

Achievements by Component

Component 1: Direct Support to Schools
PEC Phase X, for the 2010-11 school year. This phase involved 32 states that made their
contributions according to PEC’s Operating Rules in an amount of MX$386,642,367.00. The
Federal Government contributions were of MX$1,159,927,101.00. Some states also made
additional contributions in the amount of MX$130,811,497.30, receiving a federal match of
MX$154, 357,566.00 at a rate of 1.18 federal Mexican Pesos per each state’s Mexican Peso.

PEC Phase XI, for the 2011-12 school year. This phase involved 32 states that made their
contributions according to PEC’s Operating Rules in the amount of MX$416,795,291.00, with a
federal match of MX$1,250,385,873.00. In this period, states also made additional contributions
of MX$84,247,146.00, receiving a federal match of MX$151,644,862.80, at a rate of MX$1.80
for every state Peso contributed.

PEC Phase XII, for the 2012-13 school year. This phase only involved 30 states that made their
contributions according to PEC’s Operating Rules in the amount of MX$362,425,019.00,
receiving a federal match of MX$1,087,275,056.89. In this period, states contributed additional
resources in the amount of MX$95,936,053.00, receiving a federal counterpart of
MX$95,936,053.00, at a rate of MX$1.00 for every state Peso contributed. Note that in this phase,
Sonora and Veracruz did not participate in PEC.

PEC Phase XIII, for the 2013-2014 school year. This phase only involved 30 states that made
their contributions according to PEC’s Operating Rules in the amount of MX$459,406,529.00,
receiving a federal match of MX$1,378,219,586.80. In this period, states made additional
contributions in the amount of MX$31,808,411.04, receiving a federal counterpart amount of
MX$31,808,411.04, at a rate of MX$1.00 for every state Peso contributed. Note that in this phase,
Chiapas and Veracruz did not participate in PEC.

Component 2: Monitoring and Oversight
The Project supported the delivery of technical assistance to the 32 states that included:

1. Advisory Services. Provided relevant technical assistance for the effective implementation of
   the different operational processes of PEC, such as Operating Rules, calls for proposals, review
   process, incorporation, follow-up, assessment, transparency and accountability.
2. Accompanying Services. In states that required assistance from PEC’s national coordination
   unit, CNPEC worked closely with the PEC state coordination to ensure the adequate

                                                                      33
   implementation of the Project.
3. Supervision Visits. In states where areas of improvement were identified, mainly due to
   constant changes in state personnel, the Federal Government made several visits to provide
   support to the states on administrative, technical, and operational shortcomings.
4. Capacity Building Events. Initiatives at both the national and state level to foster stakeholder
   competencies in educational management and the leadership of supervisors and school
   directors of participating schools.
5. National and regional meetings. With the goal of following up, providing feedback, and
   sharing good practices, national and regional meetings were held with state teams and, in some
   cases, school directors and supervisors, parents, and education authorities.

Other activities under this Component were financed with Government resources.

Component 3: Policy Development and Evaluation
This component was eliminated in the restructuring approved by the Bank on May 2, 2013.
However, many of the activities envisioned were undertaken using non-Project resources. Among
others:
 Annual External Evaluation Reports were conducted by CONEVAL.
 The Centro de Estudios Educativos, A. C. performed the Feasibility Analysis for PEC’s Impact
    Assessment and concluded that the program has the necessary and sufficient characteristics to
    measure its impact on student learning.
 A meeting with staff of the General Directorate of Indigenous Education (Dirección General
    de Educación Indígena, DGEI) was conducted to present the origins, history, evolution, and
    main guidelines of PEC and its Strategic Model of School Based Management (MGEE), the
    simplified PETE, to implement the Indigenous Peoples Plan and promote increased
    participation of indigenous schools in PEC.
 In 2012, the Centro de Estudios Educativos, A. C. conducted a study to integrate a State of the
    Art of the Strategic and Participatory Management Process of the PEC and Escuela Segura
    programs.
 A Beneficiary Satisfaction Survey was conducted in 2012 by the DGAG to explore the degree
    of satisfaction of school directors, in terms of the goods and services that PEC provided to
    schools.
 PEC was assessed as a federal program with a “high potential of performance” by the
    Performance Index of Federal Public Programs (Índice de Desempeño de los Programas
    Públicos Federales, INDEP 2012), meaning that it has a sound design and that it has
    adequately achieved its goals, but might lack enough resources to attend all its potential
    beneficiaries.

C. MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT

Factors outside the control of the Government and/or PEC. Although the educational
federalism and autonomy exercised by the states has strengthened the program, it has also resulted
in a number of drawbacks in its implementation and monitoring:
  (i) Budget planning in the states has caused delays in the definition of participating schools,
        and even non-participation in the program, at certain stages of its implementation.


                                                34
 (ii)  In some cases, the extensions granted for delivery of the matching resources from states
       have delayed the access of schools to federal resources and PEC resources in some states.
 (iii) The lack of uniformity in the implementation and dispersion of resources subject to state
       matching complicates the periodic reconciliation of the amounts at the central level and the
       timely delivery of resources to schools, often causing panic buying and poor strategy
       implementation and reporting at the school level.
 (iv) The resistance of some agencies involved in implementing the program, such as teachers’
       unions, which have resisted, in some states, the application of standardized assessments
       and consolidation of the Program.
 (v) The Execution System for the Procurement Plan (Sistema de Ejecución para el Plan de
       Adquisiciones, SEPA) should improve efficiency in procurement and serve as a tool to
       promote transparency and strengthen accountability instead of an obstacle.

Factors generally subject to the Government.
 (i) The rotation of mid-level managers and operational staff caused by the instability of their
      working conditions, both at the federal and state level, have caused a lack of continuity and
      adequate follow-up and monitoring processes and integration of program information.
 (ii) The lack of personnel in the state and the national coordination units to support the
      implementation of PEC in schools in remote areas.

Factors generally subject to PEC. The Information System, SIPEC, was not as effective and
efficient as expected in recording, organizing, and exploiting information from the participating
schools due to technical failures, server capacity, compatibility, operation and maintenance.

Costs and Project Financing
(i) Specify the date of the last disbursement of the Bank loan. Letter ICL-413-2014 dated June 18,
     2014 issued by NAFIN notified that the Bank completed Disbursement Request No. 8, thereby
     disbursing the full amount of Loan 7948-MX.

(ii) Comments on the loan disbursement schedule. Although SEB sought to comply with the
      disbursement projections established in the PAD, they were not met mainly due to a delay in
      signing of the Loan Agreement. This did not, however, present any difficulty to SEB in
      executing the entire loan and only involved a change in the amounts to be disbursed for the
      fiscal year, as per the table below.
                         Years               PAD Estimates         Actual Disbursement
                         2010                               0.00           44,550,000.00
                         2011                     116,000,000.00           70,305,704.90
                         2012                      72,000,000.00           73,657,750.47
                         2013                       3,200,000.00           30,763,060.48
                         2014                               0.00              723,484.15

(iii) Comments regarding the availability of funds. National counterpart funding was considered
      exclusively for Category 1 (Goods, Works and Consultant’s Services supported under direct
      support to schools). This represented 10% of the total eligible resources for this Category.

(iv) Summarize the results of the Project audits and the level of compliance with the audit
     recommendations. The Borrower’s Informe de Cierre provides a detailed explanation of

                                                35
    audits: 2/2012 for the execution of 2011 funds; 5/2013 for the execution of 2012 funds; 2/2014
    for the execution of 2013 funds; 234 for the Fideicomiso Fondo Nacional para Escuelas de
    Calidad; and Auditoría Externa for the Fideicomiso Fondo Nacional para Escuelas de
    Calidad.

(v) Evaluate the system of accounting and financial control of the Project
    (Coordination of Financial Management). The Coordination of Financial Management (CGF)
    at all times complied with the goals and commitments outlined in the Loan Agreement and its
    Annexes, the Operational Manual, and the Contrato de Mandato, in coordination with each
    of the participants in the Project implementation areas. This unit (CGF) was responsible for
    implementing transfers to the states, requesting disbursements, and compiling quarterly and
    semiannual monitoring reports while ensuring effective and appropriate management of
    resources and information systems. Some systems implemented during project execution
    were:
     Planning system: based on the Expenditure Budget of the Federation (PEF) for each fiscal
       year, as well as financial planning as established in the PAD.
     Cash Flow System: Using defined processes for transfers to states that allowed the
       monitoring and recording of financial transactions.
     Information system: The CGF was responsible for compiling the quarterly, semi-annual,
       and monitoring reports describing the financial and operating performance of the Project
       in a given period in relation to the components.
     Control System: physical and electronic records were generated of all documents related
       to the Loan for internal control and audits carried out for the Project.

In regards to contractual and statutory obligations of the Loan, the SEB complied every time and
always under the accompaniment of NAFIN.

(vi) Assess the procurement system. The SEPA web-based system was used for the reporting of
     the Procurement Plan. The information was uploaded into the system according to DGDGIE’s
     planning for transfers and procurement. No consulting services were carried out under Bank
     procurement processes. SEB, therefore, requested a reallocation of Loan proceeds to increase
     the amount allocated to Category 1 (Goods, Works and Consultant’s Services supported under
     direct support to schools) in order to increase the number of beneficiary schools. This also
     reflected SEB’s inability to exercise all of the resources for Category 2 (Incremental Project
     Costs) and Category 3 (Consultant Services). It is important to note that consulting services
     were carried out under national processes. The inability to perform these services was due
     mainly to issues that did not depend directly on the implementing agency.

D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
The Project is financially sustainable, derived from the interest of the SEB to continue receiving
the Bank’s support and technical assistance.

PEC is a SEP initiative aimed at strengthening basic education and SBM as part of the provisions
of Articles 3. of the Constitution; 77 of the Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility; 176 of the
Rules; 30, 31 and 40 and Annex 24 of the Expenditure Budget of the Federation for Fiscal Year
2015. The Government has the obligation of improving educational processes and outcomes. It is
necessary to provide an inclusive education that respects and values diversity sustained in
intercultural relations, which successfully combines fairness with quality in the pursuit of greater
equality of opportunity for all Mexicans. In the Decree of Articles 3 and 73 of the Constitution
posted February 26, 2013 in their Fifth Transitory, Section III, paragraph a) is amended,
establishing the need to "strengthen the autonomy of school management in order to improve its
infrastructure, purchase educational materials, solve problems and promote basic operating
conditions of participation for students, teachers and parents, under the leadership of the director,
be involved in resolving the challenges that each school faces.” In this context, Constitutional
Article 3 adds, among other things: "The State shall guarantee the quality of compulsory education
so that the educational materials and methods, school organization, educational infrastructure and
the adequacy of teachers and managers ensure crowning achievement of student learning." The
General Education Law, Rules 12, Section V and XII Bis; 25 and 28 Bis establishes guidelines for
the Program to reorient their strategies and actions to contribute to the fulfillment of the
constitutional mandate for autonomy in school management. The National Development Plan
2013-18 establishes as a national goal “Mexico with Quality Education.” (A comprehensive
account of the Plan and its relation to school autonomy and SBM is also provided in this section –
not included in this translation).

In this context, the Program compiles the experience and lessons learned from recent years that
has driven the transformation of the management of public elementary schools. The goal is to
reorient their strategies and actions to help achieve the constitutional mandate for autonomy in
school management, as well as to strengthen actions leading to the formation of the Basic
Education System and the provision of technical and financial support to public elementary schools
in the creation and consolidation of conditions that enable them to strengthen their organizational
culture and performance through the development of school management and autonomy capacities.

E. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
This section summarizes the available evidence and information from external evaluations and
studies of PEC since the beginning of the Second Phase of the School Based Management Project.

Program Strengths
 Coverage and Targeting. There is great progress in terms of coverage (schools in 90% of
  municipalities nationwide participate in the program) (PEC, 2012). In recent years, targeting
  efforts increased participation of indigenous schools and schools in areas of high and very
  high marginalization. (World Bank, 2012)
 Training and Continuous Professional Development. School directors and other project
  beneficiaries received training for the development of the PETE and the PAT. (Mayaink, 2008)



                                                 37
 Achievement and School Performance. The Program reduced dropout rates and decreased
  student failure and repetition rates (C230 AC, 2012).
 Communication and Dissemination. The Program offers vast public information on the
  regulations, beneficiaries, and main results, which can be found on PEC’s website. (Bracho
  González, 2008)
 Operation of the Program. The Program has documented procedures and mechanisms for its
  operation, such as receipt, recording and processing of applications; the selection of
  beneficiaries; and the granting of school support at every stage. (White 2011-2012). SEP had
  steady and constant support from the Bank throughout Project implementation. Monitoring and
  support was provided by each of the three Task Team Leaders and their teams. The Bank also
  provided technical assistance to solve problems arising from Project implementation. The Bank
  played an active role in detecting, reporting and working in those areas that needed
  improvement. This observation applies equally to the financial agent, NAFIN, which was key
  to Project performance through the provision of strategic support when needed.

Program Weaknesses
 Coverage and Targeting. Targeting criteria was limited by the selection criteria, which included
  all public schools located in areas of "Very High, High, Medium, Low, and Very Low
  marginalization” (Briefing Note, Target Population. CNPEC 2011 and White, 2011-2012).
  There is no strategic planning related to the Program’s coverage, at least in the short and
  medium term (White 2011-2012).
 School Management and Strategic Planning. The Program can create an administrative and
  academic overload to the schools (Miranda Lopez, 2008 and Centre for Educational Studies,
  2012).
 Training and Continuous Professional Development. Insufficient training and technical,
  academic, and institutional support for developing the necessary theoretical and practical skills
  directly related to school management. (Velázquez, 2010). Lack of knowledge regarding the
  adequacy and usefulness of the training received by school directors in the development of
  PETE and PAT. (White 2011-2012)
 Achievement and School Performance. The impact of the Program on educational achievement
  and teacher performance does not grow in relation to the number of participating schools and
  school directors trained in strategic management. (CONEVAL, 2008)
 Perception of the Value and Utility of PEC. Information related to the perceptions about PEC
  of General Directors in each state are collected, but not about the perception of direct
  beneficiaries. (White 2011-2012)
 Program Operation. There is a lack of effective engagement of Supervisors and Technical
  Educational Consultants (ATP) to provide advice and support in the Program’s operation at the
  school level (Centre for Educational Studies, 2012). The positive experiences of the
  participating schools are not exploited. The schools’ technical and pedagogical reports are not
  used adequately to better understand the problems they face (in particular for the urban and
  marginalized schools) (Bracho González, 2008). Lack of stability of PEC staff and high
  uncertainty in job permanency and job benefits. Particularly in the case of ATPs. (Bracho
  Gonzalez, 2008)
 Accountability. Failure in measuring activity level indicators for the components in the MIR
  (White 2011-2012). Need of end of Project indicators to measure the improvement in learning
  outcomes comparing PEC schools vs non-PEC schools (White 2011-2012). There are problems

                                                38
  of consistency in the Operating Rules indicators. Formulas are not sufficiently clear or relevant,
  or have no relevance for measuring institutional program objectives (CONEVAL, 2008).
 Information systems and evaluation. The Program needs a comprehensive set of indicators that
  cover various aspects of school planning and can be measured through surveys administered to
  representative samples of schools (Bracho González, 2003) (White, 2011-2012). There are
  limitations to reach valid conclusions about the education system since most data comes from
  the first years of operation of PEC. (White 2011-2012) There are not sufficient monitoring
  actions to update the Program’s indicator matrix and insufficient monitoring of the institutional
  objectives of PEC at the federal and state levels. (Bracho González, 2008). SIPEC fails to
  provide timely and relevant information. The SIPEC has limitations in monitoring the operation
  and results of the program. ((Bracho González, 2008 and Santibanez, 2008). The user of SIPEC
  or the general public cannot verify the source of information with which the application is built
  and no information on updating databases is provided (White 2011-2012). The databases are
  disjointed and decentralized, causing confusion and inaccuracies in the data at the national level,
  entity and program phase (White 2011-2012). Few qualitative studies (different impact
  assessment) on some of the crucial processes of the program: training of school personnel,
  processes and formulation of PETE and PAT and their implementation in the schools, social
  participation and pedagogical changes (White 2011-2012). Lack of and impact evaluation to
  identify the causal effects of the program with data covering all years of operation (Santibanez,
  2008). The Project could not use the funds under the Category 3 of the Bank Loan (Consultant
  Services) for activities under Component 3 of the Project (Development and Policy Evaluation)
  and needed to restructure the Project to reallocate from Categories 3 and 2 to 1. This was due
  to internal administrative obstacles to proceed with the Bank’s procurement guidelines.

Program Opportunities
 In Relation to the Education System. The contribution of the Program to improve quality of
  basic education is complemented with other federal programs that address various issues and
  efforts to improve educational conditions for students such as Escuela siempre abierta and
  Oportunidades (White 2011-2012). PEC has the potential to articulate and coordinate all
  educational actions at the school level from the local to the federal levels. (CONEVAL, 2010)

Risks to the Program
 School Management and Strategic Planning. Schools have limited autonomy in terms of
  personnel management (World Bank, 2012)
 Education System Facts that Affect PEC’s functioning. The education system does not have a
  comprehensive database of schools, the population served, and the communities where they are
  located (Centre for Educational Studies, 2012). At the federal level, there is a lack of articulation
  between the programs that aim to reach schools and the state teams have limitations for training
  and providing support to PEC schools (Centre for Educational Studies, 2012). ENLACE shows
  limitations to measure the specific impact of PEC in students’ educational attainment over time
  (Bracho González, 2008 and Center for Educational Studies, 2012).
 School-level Facts that Affect PEC’s functioning. There are important challenges to build a
  common vision that gives identity and helps school stakeholders commit to school-based
  management (Miranda Lopez, 2008). Schools have weak capacities to build a shared vision and
  act collectively, identify and prioritize school problems, articulate effective and collective



                                                  39
  interventions to solve those problems, and lack feedback and evaluation mechanisms. (Miranda
  Lopez, 2008).
 State-level Facts that Affect PEC’s functioning. In some cases, noncompliance of the national
  selection and targeting criteria by the state education authorities result in a large variation in the
  understanding of the program and its institutional objectives (Abreu, 2010).

F. LESSONS LEARNED

The 4 years of operation of Phase II of PEC have produced important lessons learned that have
made the Program and education policies around it evolve, including:
 PEC X contributed to the improvement of educational attainment through fostering strategic
   educational management;
 PEC XI established strategic educational management to strengthen the organizational culture
   and functioning of schools, focusing on students’ needs in order to contribute to improved
   learning outcomes;
 PEC XII helped improve the academic achievement of students in public elementary schools,
   sharpening targeting criteria (equity) and establishing a regional vision; and,
 PEC XIII strengthened autonomy and SBM and encouraged collaboration of the school
   community in solving the challenges faced by each school for the improvement of learning
   outcomes.

PEC established a model of SBM based on democratic principles that identify the school as the
center of all educational initiatives and drives on the school community to strengthen autonomy,
as well as the principles of equity, relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency to promote quality of
education through various elements. Among these are shared leadership, collaborative work,
strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation for continuous improvement, responsible social
participation, shared decision making, flexible practices and relationships, project financing, and
transparency and accountability.

The development of these elements in PEC participating schools have created a more effective use
of resources and better identification of school needs. Ultimately, PEC has helped improve the
quality of education as a result of a more efficient and transparent use of resources to generate
more relevant and contextualized actions at the school level. PEC has contributed to a more open
and welcoming school environment because the community is involved in its administration.
Increased participation of all local stakeholders in decision-making processes also encourages
more participatory, collaborative decision-making; greater satisfaction for all students; better
student performance as a result of lower repetition and dropout rates, and eventually better learning
outcomes.

Finally, it should be noted that these lessons are players in the current educational reform to
strengthen autonomy and school management. In addition, basic education schools have a school
organization that ensures maximum learning achievement for all students by ensuring the
effectiveness and efficiency of educational services provided in schools.
