Nearly 90 percent of\n            project investment is targeted to help families whose\n            incomes are below Guayaquil's absolute poverty\n            threshold. The project includes three major components:\n            loans and technical assistance to small-scale enterprises,\n            slum upgrading plus sites-and-services development, and\n            loans for housing construction and improvement. Since a\n            multi-sector urban project of this nature has not been\n            implemented before in Ecuador, there is a risk that\n            management problems might occur due to inexperience.\n            However, technical assistance and close supervision have\n            been built into project design to reduce this risk."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
