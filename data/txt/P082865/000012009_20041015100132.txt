                              LOAN PROGRAMSUMMARY
                                    AND

Borrower:         Republic of Colombia

Implementing      Ministry o f Finance
Agency:

Poverty Category: Poverty Targeted Intervention

Amount:           US$200million

Terms:            Fixed Spread Loan payable in 13.5 years, including 9 years of grace, with
                  commitment linked and a tailored repayment structure.

Commitment Fee:   0.85% on undisbursed loan balances for the first four years and 0.75% on
                  undisbursed loan balances thereafter.

Front-EndFee:     0.5% of the loan amount

Objective:        The proposed Second Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural
                  Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL 11) will support the Government o f Colombia's
                  (GOC) objectives to: (a) increase employment; (b) raise human capital formation;
                  and (c) strengthen social protection. These objectives would be achieved by: (i)
                  supporting the reform of the GOC's labor regulations under Law 789 and
                  improved training schemes; (ii)implementing Law 715 that amends the rules
                  regarding the decentralization of education and health services while introducing
                  incentives to enhance and measure quality; and (iii) developing an integrated and
                  more efficient social protection system, including the establishment o f institutions
                  for regular impact evaluation and public oversight of social protection programs.

Description:      The PLaRSSAL I1operation focuses on development impact, primarily through
                  producing measurable results/outcomes.       This impact would be achieved by
                  implementing those labor and training laws that were regulated in the PLaRSSAL
                  I,and advancing the education, health, and social protection reforms, in
                  accordance with Laws 789 and 715 so that they produce quantifiable results.

                  The PLaRSSAL I1focuses specifically on:

                  (i) labordemandviaemployerincentivesandareductioninlegalbarriers
                     greater
                  to employment; (ii)increased coverage, efficiency, and targeting of social
                  protection programs, including the health sector, the Znstituto Colombiano de
                  Bienestar Familiar (Colombian Institute for Family Welfare, ICBF) and the
                  Sewicio Nacional de Apreizdizaje (National Training Program, SENA); (iii)
                  quality and coverage improvements in the education sector; and (iv) impact
                  evaluation and social oversight of major social programs.

                  The amount of the PLaRSSAL was increased to US$200 million (from US$lSO
                  million) due to exceptional progress in the reform program, both in fulfillment of
                  those actions identified in the matrix, with more than expected achievements in

             some areas, and in the development and implementation of additional actions that
             were not envisioned during the PLaRSSAL Ipreparation, including: (i)greater
             progress than expected in the expansion of the health insurance system for the
             poor; (ii)results orientated programming, including evaluation and re-design of
             new programs not having intended effects; (iii)more stringent quality controls in
             the health sector; (iv) improved information systems with audits; and (v) creation
             of a new social benefit targeting system. The increase in the loan amount also fits
             better with the Government's debt management requirements. The $50 million
             increase would be offset by a decrease in the proposed loan amount of a future
             structural adjustment loan, thus maintaining lending amounts within the CAS
             envelope.

Benefits:    Social Targets. The PLaRSSAL Program would increase the coverage and
             quality of the benefits offered by the labor and social reforms. Key expected
             intermediate outcomes from the program, i.e. those observed two years into the
             four year reform program adopted by the Uribe Administration, include:
             0       Increasedemployment between 2002 and 2004, due to the labor reform;
             0       Increase in the number of students trained by SENA by nearly 50%
                     (450,000 students) from its given resources between 2002 and 2004;
             0       Increased number of individuals benefiting from apprenticeship
                     experiences (from a base of 33,000 in 2002) due to changes in the labor
                     law;
             0       Increased access of poor children to ICBF nutrition services by 300,000
                     between 2002 and 2004, from a base of 78,000;
             0       90 percent coverage rates for DF'T, polio, and Triple Viral for childrenage
                     0-1 between 2003 and 2004, from a base of 80 percent in 2002;
             0       800,000 newly affiliated poor people in the Subsidized (Health Insurance)
                     Regime between 2002 and 2004, from a base of 10.7 million; and
             0       Increase in enrollments by 500,000 additional students between 2002 and
                     2004, in addition to the 7.8 million existing spaces.

             Even greater benefits are expected from the program over the longer term, since it
             would institute structural reforms in labor, training, health, education, social
             protection, and childdevelopment that will persist beyondthe period of the
             operation.

             Poverty Impact. The social targets have clear poverty implications since most
             of them are investments in the future productivity of low-income individuals.
             The increase in the quantity of education and job training, access to health care,
             immunizations, and early childhood development programs will increase
             opportunities to earn the higher rates of return that elude those with less human
             capital. Additionally, the actions in the loan would contribute to the positive non-
             monetary benefits associated with more human capital, such as: longevity,
             decreased risk of poverty, healthier children, etc. In the short-run, the program
             supports employment for low-skilled and hard-to-employ groups, thus moving
             them into the labor market and earning an income.

Risks:       Several risks were identified: (i) the overall political context, na,melythe intemal
             conflict and violence associated with illegal drug activity, which continues to
             divert resources and attention from the Government while aggravating the social
              situation, and the current debate about a second Presidential term, which may
              affect the pace of the implementation of difficult reforms; (ii)the fiscal pressures,
              which were exacerbated by the failure of a Referendum in 2003 that would have
             restrained spending and raised taxes; (iii) the external economic and political

                 shocks that can affect a well-functioning Colombian economy, due to the entire
                 Region's susceptibility to international trade and financial shocks and difficult
                 political situations in some countries that may affect investor expectations for the
                 Region; (iv) the complexity of the reform process that will require a large,
                 sophisticated, innovative and dedicated staff to be successful; (v) the upcoming
                 review o f the labor reform which, if not well managed, could result in the
                 premature reversal of sections of the Labor Reform Law; (vi) opposition by
                 special interest groups who disagree with the targeting and competition
                 introduced to further implement the labor and training reforms; (vii) the financial
                 viability of the health reform; and (viii) the sustainability of reforms that incur
                 costs in the short-run, with benefits only appearing in the longer-run.

                 Throughout the reform process several actions are being undertaken to mitigate
                 these risks. These include: (i)complementary actions in other sectors to support
                 the development o f a stronger foundation for peace and reforms to liberate
                 resources to be used for the transition to a post-conflict Colombia and active
                 implementation o f the reform program to protect against the risk of reversal of
                 the program should the Uribe re-election not be successful; (ii)focused efforts to
                 control spending, including the reform of the Budget Statute; (iii)fiscal, pension,
                 financial, and institutional reforms supported by the IMF, the Bank, and the `IDB
                 to mitigate the contagion effects from Regional crises; (iv) a Bank-sponsored
                 Technical Assistance Loan to support the strategic development of the complex
                 reform process; (v) technical assistance by the Bank to understand the impacts of
                 the Labor Reform Law and strategies to improve its design; (vi) development of
                 M&E systems to better inform the public of the quality of labor and social
                 programs and a staging o f the reform process to win buy-in of pressure groups;
                 (vii) IDB and Bank loans, studies, and technical assistance to support the
                 complicated health sector reform; and (viii) Bank and IDB support via projects,
                 technical assistance, and studies to measure the impacts of social programs,
                 promote the result for better program design and management, and disseminate
                 the findings to the public to strengthen the citizen's support of the reform
                 program.

                                            PROJECTDOCUMENT

    I. Introduction

1. Colombiais emergingfrom the worst crisis that it has suffered since the early part of the 20h Century.
Economic growth is resuming, at over 3 percent annually, and unemployment has fallen by 3 percentage
points, to 14 percent. Poverty rates have begun to decline for the first time in seven years, and the
coverage of social programs continues to increase, as the Government's aggressive social reform agenda
advances, with the support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The
Government continues to address the civil violence issue successfully, with encouraging results, as the
number of kidnappings has decreased and security forces are increasingly present in the more violent
regions of the country.

2. Despite these positive trends, and the Uribe Administration's skillful management of the immediate
challenges, deeper structural weaknesses impede greater social and economic gains. While poverty rates
are on the decline, Colombia continues to suffer from high levels of poverty. Many children remain
vulnerable to illness and while substantial resources are spent on health, a high proportion of families still
do not have adequate protection against financial losses from illness nor access to good quality basic
health services. Moreover, Colombia lags behind other comparable countries in terms of the level and
quality of education and training, undermining its prospects for greater long-term competitiveness and
growth. Complicating the situation is the violent conflict, which continues to consume a large portion of
the budget and leads to social strife by displacing thousands of citizens from their homes and increasing
the burden on the country's still inadequate social protection system.

3. To address these challenges, the Government of Colombia (GOC), under reform-oriented Resident
Uribe, has developed an ambitious labor and social reform program (see GOC's Letter of Development
Policy in Annex 11). The implementation of these reforms i s expected to increase employment, improve
education and training, and strengthen human capital accumulation. Since employment and education are
key pathways through which poor families are able to raise their incomes and exit poverty, the program i s
also expected to reduce poverty. Despite the positive environment for reform, the political and economic
complexities of the program require persistent and consistent efforts that are necessary to build the
economic and social foundations for a peaceful society.

4. The Bank is well-positioned to encourage and help Colombia reform its health, education, training,
labor, and social protection systems. Since 1998, the GOC, the Bank, and the IDB have been closely
collaborating on labor and social sector reform issues. This collaboration, which has been sustained by
the current Uribe Administration, has taken various forms, including two Bank investment loans' to
support the Red de Apoyo Social (Social Safet Net, RAS) program, a Social Sector Adjustment Loan
project - hereafter referred to as the SECAL, - and a series of analytical studies on poverty, social
                                                  Y

Bank's continuous support, as expressed in the Letter of Development Policy and in the government's
favorable views expressedin the SECAL's ICR.4

5. The Colombia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the Executive Directors on January
9, 2003, proposed continued support via an Adjustment Lending program to the social and labor reform
agenda of the new Uribe Administration, as outlined in the GOC's Development Plan 2002-2006.             The
GOC and the Bank agreed that a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan would be the most
appropriate tool to provide: (i)    reliable financial support for the implementation of a medium-term
strategy for sustained expansion of employment, faster human capital accumulation, and better social
protection of the population, particularly the poor and vulnerable; (ii)  flexibility as the strategy develops
and expectations are modified; and (iii)     continuous dialogue between the Bank and the GOC as the
strategy unfolds.    The medium-term strategy was designed to promote structural changes that are
expected to have long-term implications.

6. The first Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL I)was
approved by the Bank in September 2003, as the first of a two-part program to support structural reforms
in health, education, training, early child development, and labor. The single tranche operation for
US$200 million supported the establishment of a legal framework for labor market reforms, a deepening
of health and early child development actions and reforms to reach the neediest individuals more
efficiently, and an expansion of education reform with a focus on quality enhancement and a continued
expansion of service provision. The objectives of the first operation were met; the draft ICR proposes an
overall "Satisfactory" outcome rating and at least a "Satisfactory" rating for each of the individual reform
objectives.

7. Since the completion of the PLaRSSAL I,the Government has continued to progress along their
reform path, with no substantial deviations to the program that was described in the Letter of
Development Policy that accompanied the PLaRSSAL I.The Government and the Bank have worked to
continue the labor and social reform program and meet the trigger and prior actions that were anticipated
for the secondphaseof the Bank program, the PLaRSSAL 11.

8. This document proposes the second phase of the Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural
Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL II), the amount of US$200 million, in a single tranche. While the loan
                                     for
was originally programmed for $150 million, a $50 million addition is proposed due to exceptional
progress in the implementation of the reform agenda and due to the Government's debt management
requirements. The increase in the loan amount would not affect the CAS envelope as it would be offset
by a decrease inthe amount of a future adjustment loan. The PLaRSSAL I1would continue to support the
efforts initiated in the PLaRSSAL Ithrough continuation of the implementation of the labor market
reforms and of the social reform initiatives initiated with the first operation, with expected quantifiable
impacts by the end of the programby the third quarter of 2004. Concurrently, capacity buildingthrough a
technical assistance loan (TAL) will continue to set the framework for sustainability of the reform process
initiatedunder the PLaRSSAL.

9. The potential risks identified in the first phase of the PLaRSSAL did not occur, and those identified
for the second phase are expected to be moderate, if they are well managed. The potential risks identified
for the first phase - escalation of the internal conflict that would drain resources from the social budget, a
deterioration of the fiscal situation due to external economic shocks or the failure of the October 2003
Referendum to restrain spending and raise taxes, difficulty inregulating the Law 789 on labor regulations
due to political constraints and special-interest groups, and lack of technical capacity to implement the
reformprocess-either were not realized, or were sufficiently managed and did not intermpt the labor and

social reformprocess. For the second phase of the PLaRSSAL operation, general and sector specific risks
should be recognized.      The general risks - internal, fiscal, and exogenous economic shocks - are
moderate due to the effective macroeconomic management and increased control over the conflict.
However, the current debate to change the Constitution to allow for a Presidential re-election may affect
the pace of the implementation of some of the more difficult reforms. Thus far, the indications are that
the Government intends to continue the social reform agenda, but the political situation i s being
continuously monitored. Also, the external risks continue to exist, due to the economic and political
instability in several key countries in the Region, which could affect the Colombian economy. The
specific risks to social and labor reform are the complexity of the reform process, the implications of a
law that requires a short-term evaluation of the impact of the new labor law that could be used as a pretext
by some for reversing portions of the reform, special interest group blockage of reforms, the viability of
the financing system fundingthe health reform, and sustainability of the reform process. While steps are
being taken to mitigate these risks, there i s a possibility that these measures may only be moderately
successful. These issues are discussedin detail in Chapter V.

10. This report is organized in the following way: Chapter I1presents the macroeconomic environment, a
key condition of this operation, and the challenges Colombia faces regarding labor and social issues.
Chapter I11presentsthe GOC's reform agenda and discusses the measures it has already taken to meet the
challenges it faces. Chapter IV reviews the PLaRSSAL program and the first phaseof said program. The
final chapter details the specific objectives of the second phase of the program - namely the PLaRSSAL
11- the policy matrix, the GOC's progress in meeting the PLaRSSAL I1triggers and other prior actions,
impact and risk analysis, and other aspects of the final lendingoperation inthis program.

11.          The Macroeconomic, Labor Market, andSocial Context

11. This chapter provides the context for the labor and social reform program that the Government
designed in 2002 upon taking office and recent background events - particularly in the macroeconomic
and fiscal performance - that may be relevant to the continuation of the reform program and the Bank's
support of this program. The full description of the Government's programto address the labor and social
challenges i s contained in Chapter 111.
             -
A.       Macroeconomic Environment, 2002-2004

12. Macroeconomic Performance. The economic recovery continues and confidence is growing after
near stagnation during 1998-2002. The economy grew by 3.6 percent in 2003, due to accelerated growth
in the last quarter of 2003.      The economic improvement has been accompanied by lower crime:
kidnappings fell by 26 percent between 2002 and 2003. At the same time, the Departamento Nacional de
Planeacidn (National Planning Department, DNP) releasedconsolidated fiscal deficit figures for 2003 of
2.9 percent, only slightly above the 2.8 percent revised International Monetary Fund (IMF)target. Given
these fiscal improvements, the government expects growth of 3.8 percent in 2004. The higher than
expected growth, strength of the peso, and ample liquidity in the TES (Colombia Treasury Bonds)
market, are expected to help alleviate some of the fiscal pressures (with less reliance on investment cuts)
and stabilize the public debt dynamics for 2004.

 13. As of mid-2004, total investment i s about 17.3 percent of GDP, with private investment at about 11.6
percent, which is almost two times higher than it was in 2003. Strong retail sales in January 2004 also
reflect the building economic momentum, rising 8.9 percent yoy (year-on-year) in January (excluding
fuel) and signal strong consumer spending. Indeed, consumer spending surged 3.5 percent yoy in Q4
2003. Private consumption i s expected to remain robust and support GDP growth in 2004. In addition,
inflation fell to 6 percent in 2003, from 6.5 percent in 2002, and i s expected to decrease further to 5
percent in2004.

14. Colombia's exports increased 5.6 percent in 2003, mostly due to oil exports. While the country's
nontraditional exports, mainly manufactured goods and cut flowers, performed well in recent years and
now amount to over half of all merchandise exports, the appreciation of the peso and the slow economic
recovery in the UnitedStates and other major trading partners adversely affected export growth in 2003.
Despite export growth, imports have increasedat a faster pace and, as a consequence, the trade deficit has
widened. The current account deficit was about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2003, compared to 2 percent in
2002.

15. Fiscal Performance. Over the past five years, new realities have emerged in Colombia's fiscal
accounts, including significant deficits and large future liabilities. The rapid expansion of public sector
spending over the last decade (from 25 percent of GDP in 1990 to over a third today), combined with
growing pension and other liabilities, has led to significant and persistent structural deficits. As public
spending rapidly outstripped revenue-generating capacity, much of the fiscal deficit was increasingly
financed with debt, domestic and external. Today, total public sector debt in Colombia i s over 50 percent
of GDP. The deficit in the consolidated public sector for 2003 was 2.9 percent of GDP, which includes
about 1percent of GDP in security spending.

16. The UribeAdministration is committed to continuing the fiscal adjustment efforts that began with the
previous administration. The fiscal deficit for the combined public sector came down to 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2003, but the government failed to meet its IMFtarget of about 2.5 percent of GDP -due to the
failure of a fiscal referendumin late 2003 that was designed to reduce spending and increasethe tax base.
Nonetheless, on December 29,2003, Congress approved a tax package to fillpart of the fiscal gap left by
the unexpected rejection of the referendum. The government sought, and was granted, a waiver of
performance criteria from the IMFas a result of the fiscal slippage.

17. Congress passed two key structural reforms: (i)   pension reform (Law 797 in January 2003) to address
the looming deficits of the social security sector, Colombia's largest future fiscal liability (the
government's outstanding liabilities to the social security system i s estimated to be about 170 percent of
GDP); and (ii) reform(Law 789 in December 2002) to increase flexibility inColombia's rigid labor
                labor
market. InJune 2003, the GOC passed a reform of the Znstituto de Seguridad Social (Social Security
Institute, ISS), which includes the separation of health service provision and financing, and Congress also
approved a fiscal responsibility law. Inaddition a restructuringof the public sector is underway.

18. The External Environment. Colombia's vulnerability to external shocks has fallen since early 2003,
but the country still faces significant challenges. Although its sovereign debt spreads have narrowed
substantially since the beginning of the year in absolute and relative terms compared to the emerging
market average, Colombia i s still susceptible to the uncertainty surrounding its domestic security
problems and the political and economic situation in Venezuela (its largest export market). Nonetheless,
given its floating exchange rate, falling inflation, improving growth, and adequate international reserves,
Colombia should be well equippedto deal with moderate shocks as it undertakes the fiscal adjustment.

B.       Povertyand Labor Market Challenges

19. Povertv. The Uribe Administration inherited a difficult and growing poverty and inequality situation
when it took office in 2002, but evidence from 2003 suggests that the situation may be improving, partly
due to the Government's reform efforts. Between 1996 and 2002, the national poverty rate increased by
7.2 percentagepoints, largely erasing the gains made in the early 1990s (Table l),    with the rural poverty
rate increasing 10 percentagepoints over this period. Between 2002 and 2003, poverty rates declined by
about 4 percent, with larger declines in rural areas (6.5 percent), perhaps due to Government initiatives,
described inthe next chapter.

20. Extreme poverty rates fluctuated even more over this period. The national extreme poverty rate
increased by 39 percent in 1996-2002, with a decline of nearly 18 percent between 2002 and 2003. The


                                                      4

increasewas largely due to increased impoverishment in urban areas; extreme poverty rates in rural areas
changed little between 1997 and 2002. However, extreme poverty rates in rural areas remain almost
double those inurban areas (Table 1).

 21. Income inequality also increased during the recession. The Gini coefficient was 0.50 in 1996, but
 reached 0.56 by 2002, with a decrease to 0.55 in 2003. Most of the increase during the recessionary and
 post-recessionary periods was due to a larger dispersion of wages within regions, rather than an increase
 in the wage gap between regions. The increased wage dispersion in urban areas is attributed to the
 increased dispersion in educational attainment and returns to education and to greater informal sector
 employment, where remunerations have a higher variance than in the formal sector. Since the arrival of
 the Uribe Administration, there has been some decline in wage dispersion, but it still remains above its
 levels in the early 1990s.

 22. Labor Market and Job Traininn. After years of good performance, the Colombian labor market
 declined between 1995 and 2002. A modest recovery i s observed in 2003, partly due to the improving
 economic situation and partly due to the GOC's reform efforts, discussed in the next chapter, but
 worrisome trends remain:

     e   Unemployment rates arefalling, but still remain high. The average unemployment rate for 2003
         was 14 percent, down from 15.7 percent in 2002, despite the entrance of 600,000 new people to
         the labor market. The average employment rate increased from 52.6 to 53.3 percent over the
         same period, equivalent to 0.9 million additional people employed injust one year. The majority
         of the unemployed previously worked inthe informal sector.

     e   A rise in informal sector employment. Since the mid-l990s, the proportion of workers who own
         their firms or are employed in firms that do not pay worker benefits has increased. By June 2000,
         over 60 percent of jobs in urban Colombia and 91 percent in rural areas were in the informal
         sector, the highest proportion ever. Among urban informal sector workers, 60 percent are self-
         employed, 40 percent are informal employees, and a small proportion i s unpaid?

     e   Stagnant wages. Although average wages increased throughout the 1990s, the trend hides the
         fact that wages of low- and semi-skilled workers did not. Low-skilled workers' wage growth
         stagnated over the period, and the wages of semi-skilled workers fell almost 15 percent between
          1996 and 2000, while wages of the most skilled workers, who were also the most highly paid,

         increased rapidly in the period 1990-2001, reflecting increasing returns to higher education?
         Informalsector wages, relative to formal sector wages, decreased steeply in 1999-2002.'


     0   Vulnerable groups. Certain groups are more vulnerable to poverty through unemployment and
         low wages. Youth (age 18-25) and women are entering the labor market at a faster rate,
         particularly in responseto the economic crisis. Over 60 percent of poor urban youth claim to be
         unemployed and women report rates that are more than a third higher than those of men. While
         youth and (married) female unemployment is higher than male adult unemployment throughout
         the world and across time, the employment gaps in Colombia have become particularly wide.
         Recent initiatives have focused on the special circumstances of these groups (see next chapter).
         The internallydisplacedpopulations-individuals who have abandonedtheir assets inconflict
         regions and moved to new labor markets in which they have few skills and networks -is                 a
         growin group that does not have the skills to integrate into the urban labor markets in their new
         homes.    F

23. Both supply and demand factors were responsible for the troubling labor market trends observeduntil
2002. On the supply side, youth and women were rapidly entering the labor force to serve as "safety
nets" for their families during the crisis. These groups tended to have difficulty findingemployment due
to their scarce or intermittentjob experience and competing demands on their time, whether from school
or family.      On the demand side, key factors included: firm down-sizing and cost-cutting to remain
competitive in the global economy;" a decrease in aggregate demand exacerbatedby the external shocks,
fiscal imbalance, and the increasedincidence of violence, which were the basis of the 1999 recession; and
obsolescence of skills as technological advancesand information transform the global economy."

24. The recent economic growth and decline in violence have contributed to a slow resurgence in labor
demand, but the recent successes are fragile and employer response remains tepid. Perhaps the most
important constraint to labor demand is the generous increases in real minimum wages following the
inflationary period, which have resulted in higher wages throughout the economy'* and an increased
burden for employers, whose tax contributions are based on the wage level, thereby constraining labor
demand in an already fragile economic en~ironment.'~Rather than engaging in a difficult, prolonged
battle to change legislation to moderate the minimumwage,14 the Government strategy i s to chip away at

l4 The minimum wage is set annually by a committee composed of trade unions, employer guilds, and the
Government (MSP, DNP, and Ministry of Finance and Credit). Low-skilled workers and the unemployed are not
separately represented. For the Government to change the method for setting the minimum wage, the new
legislation would have to overturn the existing system and present a carefully designed alternative that includes
checks and balances such that no special interests or collusion can hijack the process. Such an ideal alternative

the labor demand-reducing implications of the high minimum wage by waiving a portion of the firm's
required tax payments for those segments of the population who experience the highest unemployment,
including youth and female household heads, a key strategy of the Uribe Administration, discussed in the
next section.

25. Training and the Labor Market. The high youth employment rates and the lagging skill level of the
workforce are particularly troublesome given the existence of a large and well-funded public job training
program. The Sewicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (National Training Service, SENA) trains more than one
million students annually, with a budget equal to two percent of all payroll tax (0.3 percent of GDP).
However, its programs are not targeted to the poor, who most lack human capital, and the demand for job
training i s much larger, with more than 60 percent of job training services provided by the unregulated
private sector, and another 20 percent provided through other public programs. Studies suggest that
SENA is highly inefficient, as indicatedby training services that are more costly, on a per unit basis, than
equivalent private sector training firms.15 Overhead costs are high, due to a large administrative staff and
physical plant; redirecting these expenditures toward training services would allow for greater coverage.
Recently, the quality of SENA training programs has come into question, as rates of return to their
training have declined over time and employers and workers argue that publicly-provided job training
programs are increasingly unable to provide competencies inemerging industries.16

C.        Social Sector Issues

26. This section briefly reviews the issues facing Colombia in the social sectors - social protection,
healthcare, early child development (Znstituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, Colombian Institute for
Family Welfare, ICBF), education, and social oversight - when the Uribe Administration took office and
developed their National Development Plan (basis of the PLaRSSALProgram) and points to those issues
that are being addressed by the Administration, the specifics of which will be discussed in the next
chapter. Annex I11presents a more detailed discussion of these issues.

27. Social Protection. In 2002, the Pastrana Administration approved Consejo Nacional de Politica
Econdmica y Social (Nacional Council of Economic and Social Policy, CONPES)17documents 314.4 and
3187 outlining a Social Risk Management Framework (Sistema Social de Riesgo, SSR) and social
protection strategy, which: (i)       established a framework for social protection policies, focusing on risk
prevention, mitigation, and coping mechanisms -as highlighted in the Bank's Securing our Future and
 Colombia Social Safety Net reports; (ii) for a reorganization of RAS programs, ICBF, SENA, and
                                                 called
other agencies to respond to social protection needs better and more efficiently; and (iii)          assigned to said
programs and agencies social protection functions that address both crisis periods and the chronically
poor and displaced populations. This framework is the basis of the current Administration's strategy
 (discussedinthe next chapter).

 28. Unz$ed social protection strategy. Colombia's diverse set of social protection programs emerged in
 an ad hoc manner, leadingto a duplication of programs, poor targeting of services, competing incentives,
 and general inefficiency. To organize and streamline the social protection system, the CONPES directed
 the creation of a single Ministry of Social Protection that would be charged with developing a risk


 system, particularly one that manages Colombia's particular mixture o f institutional and labor market constraints,
 has not been developed elsewhere in the world.

management strategy that encompasses the existing institutions (SENA, ICBF) and programs and
consolidates the many social protection programs under this umbrella. The Uribe Administration is
responsible for implementingthis strategy.

29. Counter-cyclical social protection expenditures. Colombia lacks an effective system for protecting
the poor and vulnerable during crises and addressing the needs of the chronically poor during normal
times.    Most social insurance and assistance programs are financed by payroll contributions
@arafiscales), which are pro-cyclical and some (such as Cajas de Compensacidn Familar, Family
Compensation Associations, CCF) only serve families of formal sector workers - who tend to be less
exposed to risk. Inresponse, a Social Safety Net Program (Red de Apoyo Social, RAS) was created to
cope with the recent recession, but questions regarding how to institutionalize the safety nets are a
challenge for the current Administration.

30. ICBF Reform. The ICBF serves, among others, one of the most vulnerable groups in Colombia -
children younger than age seven from poor families. In 2002, ICBF programs benefited nearly one
million children -85 percent of whom attended community childcare centers (Hogares Comunitarios de
Bienestar, HCB) - and distributed food supplements to 2.3 million children on a regular basis. The
impressive coverage rates during the 1990s masked the fact that: (i)        targeting of ICBF pro rams to poor
families decreasedafter 1991; (ii)    coverage rates fell by 10 percent between 1998 and 2002;?8 and (iii)        the
quality of inputs, and thus the quality of services, was considered to be low throughout the 1990s." Since
2002, targeting, coverage, and quality are improving (as discussedin the next two chapters).

31. Important efforts on the part of the ICBF led to improved quality of services, but the scheme to
finance the HCB i s not well monitored, leading to potential leakage in funds. In a period of increasing
resource constraints" and increased demand for social services due to the economic volatility and the
continued violence that adds to the displaced population, a focused strategy for quality service delivery to
the poorest clients and transparency in program outputs (impact evaluation and cost-effectiveness
analysis) and expenditures is crucial.

32. Health Reform. The Uribe administration faces the challenge of completing the implementation of
the health system reform of 1993 (Law 100193) to expand health care insurance, particularly among the
poor, and to separate health care finance from the provision of services:l             as well as returning the
vaccination rates to their peak levels in 1995.

33. Universal vaccination. In 1995, Colombia had achieved immunization coverage levels of over 90
percent for all routine vaccines. However, by 2002, coverage levels for most vaccines hovered around 80
percent. Both financial and institutional factors appear to be the underlying causes for the decline. The
financial constraints were caused by the fiscal tightening necessary to combat the recession and
ministerial decisions to use health resources to fund other reforms in the sector. Since 2002, budgetary
resources have been better allocated, and an aggressive strategy has been implemented to increase
vaccination rates (see the next chapter).

2oThree percent of payroll tax is earmarked to fund ICBF programs. The total value of these taxes has decreased in
recent years due to the recession, which decreased the size of the payroll.
21The reform was expected be fully implemented by 1999, but economic and financial circumstances delayed the
process. In the late 1990s,the internal conflict escalated, thus complicating decentralization - a key factor of the
reform. Political capital was dedicated to the conflict and economic stability during this period, and so was not
available to spend on interest groups and their political supporters in convincing them to abandon the existing
system in favor of consumer choice and competition. The recession caused a fall in tax revenues, including flows to
the Contributory Regime, so there were fewer resources to use to expand coverage of the Subsidized Regime.
Recently, as the conflict and economic situations have come under control, resources, political will, and institutions
are again available to resume the reform process.

34. The institutional factors were based on confusion about responsibility for immunizations. Insurance
companies were originally responsible for carrying out vaccination campaigns, but they were slow to
undertake this task, leading to a low demand for immunizations. Government supervision and control
mechanisms were not sufficient to ensure that the insurance companies fulfilled this responsibility.
Additionally, a large portion of the population was still not covered by insurance, so this was not an
effective channel through which to achieve universal vaccination. Finally, the division of responsibilities
between the national government, sub-national governments, and private sector were not well defined.
Law 715 of 2001 clarified the roles and responsibilities of concerned government agencies regarding the
funding and implementation of the Expanded Immunization Program (Programa Ampliuda de
Zmmunizaciones, PAI): the central government i s responsible for the purchase of vaccines and syringes
through the PA1 program, while the municipalities are responsible for the immunization itself. This
distribution of responsibilities was fully operating by 2002, as described inthe next chapter.

35. Universal health insurance and eficiency in service provision. The health system reform called for a
transformation of the health care financing scheme from supply side financing -where public hospitals
are directly funded by the government - to demand side financing where all individuals hold health
insurance and are free to select their healthcare providers. The non-poor pay into the Contributory
Regime (Re'gimen Contributivo) and are insured by companies that are collectively known as Empresas
Promotoras de Salud (Insurance Entitiesof Contributory Regimes, EPSs), while the poor are eligible for
the Subsidized Regime (Re'gimenSubsidiado), which is paid partly via taxes from those who contribute in
the Contributory Regime and partly by government transfer to a fund, and are insured by firms that are
collectively known as Administradoras del Regimen Subsidiado (Insurance Entities of Subsidized
Regimes, ARSs). Hospitals and clinics receive their income by selling health care services to the EPSs
and ARSs, who then cover the medical expenses of their affiliates, according to the insurance plan. This
system has two benefits. First, poor individuals are fully covered by a public subsidy to their insurance.
Second, the quality and efficiency of hospital services will likely increase as providers earn their income
according to services delivered instead of receiving an historical budget level that does not necessarily
reflect output.

36. The transformation of the system continues, though it remains difficult. The number of affiliates of
the Subsidized Regime needs to be increased from 10.7 million to 13.7 million to reach the target of 33
percent coverage of the whole population in 2006 (the remaining two-thirds of the population will be
covered by the Contributory Regime). Many resources to fund new affiliates via the Subsidized Regime
are instead being spent on the financing of public hospital services for uninsured individuals. Public
hospitals and their politically strong unions, are not eager to adopt the new system that would require
them to compete for their income, so they have been blocking the transformation of some public
hospitals. Surmounting these challenges i s a key element of the Uribe Administration's reform strategy,
as outlinedinthe next chapter.

37. Education. The interaction between education, training and technology is the key to economic
growth, but Colombia i s unlikely to benefit fully from technological innovations in the global economy
due to its inefficient and under-performingeducation andtraining systems.

38. Coverage. Although the average education level of adults increased 11 percent between 1996 and
2001, recent trends among children suggest that achievement could be higher, particularly in rural areas.
Colombian adults (age 15 and older) have an average of 5.3 years of education, compared to 8.8 years in
Argentina, 8.6 years in Panama, and 7.6 years in Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Net enrollment rates for
primary, secondary, and higher education are 82 percent, 63 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. While
promotion rates from the first to second grade have increased over time, they are still only 73 percent and
repetition rates at the first grade are nearly ten percent, an increase from previous years. There are also
large disparitiesbetween rural and urban outcomes.

39. Quality. Achievement tests show that Colombian students may be on par with Latin American
countries, but they lag compared to other middle income countries. Colombia ranked second to last
among the 40 countries participating in the 1995 TIMSS (Third International Math and Science Study).
Colombian students showed a similar low ranking on the PIRLS (Progress in International Reading
Literacy Study) in 2001. Even more worrisome i s that these numbersrepresenta decline inthe quality of
education inpublic schools relative to the 1980s.

40. Low Eflciency. Low coverage and poor quality of education services are particularly disappointing
since Colombia already spends a substantial amount of resources on education. Education spending
accounts for 4.1 percent of GDP, which is similar to average spending by middle income countries, such
as Argentina (4.5 percent), Chile (4.2 percent), and Mexico (4.4 percent), though still below the OECD
average of 5 percent. The Uribe Administration's Ministry of Education has developed an aggressive
strategy to attack the troublesome trends in coverage, quality, and efficiency, as described in the next
chapter.

41. Transparencv and Social Control. To increase the efficiency of social expenditures, monitoring and
evaluation and transparency in public spending are necessary. The public perceives that the lack of
monitoring and evaluation, transparency, and internal controls are the principal causes of misallocated
federal resources, whether due to waste or corruption. The poor particularly do not have access to
information regarding resource allocation criteria, and the mechanisms to feed their concerns into the
decision-making system are weak.

42. Periodic Impact Evaluations of Social Programs. Colombia has a weak culture of evaluation, leading
to inefficient social spending and difficulties in identifying and designing program improvements, which
are particularly important in the current fiscally constrained environment. Some government officials
perceive that evaluation and dissemination are costly, and thus not feasible in the current fiscal situation,
leading to resistancefrom those most concerned with short-run fiscal balances.22Implementation of such
a system i s also resisted by some, since impact evaluation i s often perceived as a tool to eliminate, rather
than improve, the evaluated program. Nonetheless, recent achievements in monitoring and evaluati~n?~
have demonstratedthat confronting the challenges i s worthwhile.

43. Citizen's Oversight. A national system of citizen's oversight of social programs exists, but it can be
strengthened. Currently, the system has two parts. First, a National Planning Council (NPC), composed
of civil society representativesfrom territorial sub-councils, i s responsible for monitoring progress on the
Government's National Development Plan. The NPC reviews the Plan before it i s presentedto Congress
and prepares a two year review, drawing on information from the territorial and municipal planning
councils. While the structure of the system i s solid, the effectiveness of the NPC i s limited due to low
technical capacity (particularly of many sub-national councils) and the attention to only the National
Development Plan, rather than all Government programs and policies. Second, the Government produces
information about the performance of its social programs and other development initiatives andposts it on
the web, which is notable, but has several shortcomings. First,the quality of the results is unknown since
the Government is evaluating its own programs; independent oversight of the process would ensure that
the evaluation results are not biased. Second, internet access i s limited, particularly to the poor and to

22 Several recent impact evaluations have given the impression that such exercises are necessarily costly and
lengthy. Part of the reason for the high cost is the lack of continuous and strategic data collection for upcoming
impact evaluation, and no synergies with existing data collection and analysis efforts, such as through DANE.
However, the use of the findings from the impact evaluations to improve the efficiency of social programs will lead
to long-term savings. Unfortunately, the value of the long-term savings are discounted by those who manage short-
term fiscal balances.

those who do not have the skills to understand the technical government reports. Third, the flow of
information i s one way - from the Government to the public - which does not give the public a
mechanism to respond to the information. Fourth, the Government, not the citizens, decides which
informationto collect and disseminate.

44. In 1997, civil society developed an innovative model for social control Bogota', Como
Vumos?(BogotA, How Are We Doing?), which was intended to monitor and evaluate the delivery of
government services in Bogota and to strengthen the public's participation in the supervision of
government services. To this end, the program has two strategies: to build a set of indicators to track the
performance of government services that are most important to the citizens of BogotB, and to disseminate
these indicators and promote debate around them in order to improve the quality of services. The
definition of relevant indicators and the collection of information are done by specialized private sector
contracting firms, thus avoiding several of the shortcomings mentioned above. The program has been
highly successful and a national version of the model i s being developed by the Uribe Administration, as
discussed inthe next chapter.

111.          Labor and Social Reform Program: Strategy and Recent Actions

45. The Government's labor and social reform agendafocuses on increasing efficiency in markets and in
social expenditures in order to expand coverage and improve quality of services. The labor and social
development targets for the 2002-2006 period of the Administration, as stated in the National
Development Planand Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1I) include:

                 Creation of 350,000 new jobs, above those created through normal growth, and reduce
                 the unemployment rate from 15.7 to 12.1 percent;

                  Doubling of the number of annual SENA graduates from a base of 1million students and
                  increaseinthe annual number of apprenticeships by 288,000, from a base of 33,000;

                  Creation of an effectively functioning Ministryof Social Protection;

                  400,000, from a base of 78,000 in 2002;

                  Increase in DPT, Triple Viral, and polio vaccinations of the population age 0-5 from 80
                  percent to 95 percent, resulting in 3.6 million new children ~accinated;'~

                  Increase by three million the number of poor people affiliated with the Subsidized
                  Regime, from a base of 10.7 millionin 2002;

46. While ambitious, the agenda i s focused, and significant progress has been made in meeting the
Administration's goals. This section discusses the government program and progress, as of September
2003, and the challenges facing the GOC until 2006. The achievements between September 2003 and
August 2004 are detailed in the next chapter, as they serve as evidence to support a proposed second
phaseof the PLaRSSAL operation.

workers, increasing social protection tools for workers, and improving employment opportunities in the
short andlong runfor hard-to-employ groups.

48. Kev Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. In the first year of the administration, the GOC began to
reform the policy framework that excludes individuals from the labor market, by approving the Labor
Reform Law (789/02) in December, 2002, reforming labor market programs, and introducing innovative
policies and programs to improve the SENA. The Labor Reform Law i s breaking new ground by
implementing reforms that have been attempted in very few Latin American countries, namely decreasing
labor market rigidities, including areductioninpayrolltaxes.

49. Labor and Social Protection.' The law i s expected to set conditions for the private sector to create
350,000 new jobs by 2006, through reducing the costs and other barriers to employment.26 It gives
incentives for employers to increaseemployment through:

    The reduction of non-wage labor costs to employers. This provision decreases the disincentives
    created by severance payment schedules; limits retroactivity of severance payments; and waives
    parafiscales (payroll taxes) when hiring, above and beyond the normal workforce, students, the
    young, older workers, and others who are difficult to employ;27

     The reduction of structural ineficiencies to employers. The period of the regular work day was
    extended to allow for two full-time shifts, thus encouraging the hiring of additional employees to fill
    the secondshift; and

     The reduction of wage labor costs to employers. Through the apprenticeship program, employers can
     hire low-skilled apprentices and pay them a training-wage, which i s below the minimum wage.
    Additionally, the premiumto work on holidays and Sundays was decreased.

50. To protect the unemployed, the Law provides for the creation of an unemployment insurance
program, a particular necessity given the persistent unemployment in recent years. Thirty five percent of
these benefits would be targeted to unemployed informal sector workers - defined as not having had a




26The expected number ofjobs createdby the Law was estimated by the DNP (source: CONPES Document#3199)
using an elasticity of labor demand to labor costs equal to -0.3 for year 1, -0.41 inyear 2, and increasing to -0.7 in
year seven (Jairo Nuiiez. La Demanda Laboral en Colombia,mimeo, CEPAL, 2002). These elasticities are applied
to the relevant workers for each Article (for example, Article 25 applies mostly to low-skilled workers, so the
sample used for the calculation is only service workers, rather than the entire working population), and the number
of jobs createdin each year i s estimated.
27The reallocation of funds from the SENA, CCF, and ICBFto employment would havelittle effect on the
programs, as all are workingtowardincreasingefficiency such that the decline inthe (generous) resources would
not affect the coverage or quality of their services.

previous affiliation to a CCF and being registered in the SENA unemployment database. Also, the Law
789 obliges SENA to devote at least 25 percent of its resourcesto train the unemployed.28

51. At the programmatic level, the GOC, with the support of the Bank, has sought to alleviate the
unemployment problem through the development of a public workfare program, Empleo en Accidn,
which was initiated in 2001." After three years, its short-term impact has been largely satisfa~tory,~~            but
the Govemment i s now seeking a more effective and sustainable approach involving the private sector,
via a subsidy to newly-hired private sector workers who are Sistema de Seleccidn de Benefciarios
(System of Beneficiary Selection, SISBEN) 1or 2.3'

52. Job Traininn. The GOC has been working to enhance the targeting of Colombia's training programs
and improve the efficiency of SENA.32 Regarding the targeting, the GOC has recognized the special
circumstances of youth. Two primary initiatives have been implemented:

         Implementation of the Reform of the Apprenticeship program. To improve the quality and
         relevance of vocational education and training and to provide opportunities for matching young
         workers with firms, the Labor Reform Law includes a provision that gives incentives to firms to
         employ apprentices who graduate from SENA or private training programs. Inparticular, firms
         of a certain size are obligated to either employ apprentices or pay to a fundusedto finance micro-
          enterprise efforts by young people. Also, all firms are permitted to employ apprentices at a sub-
          minimumwage andto waive payment of theparafscales (though the apprentices are still eligible
          for these benefits); and

         Institutionalization of Jdvenes en Accidn. InSeptember 2003, SENA adopted this youth training
          program, which was housed in the Presidency for its first two years. The program i s designed to
          pay for three months of training and three months of apprenticeship to SISBEN 1 and 2 youth.
          The training courses are provided by private firms that are certified and supervised by SENA.
          T h i s program could provide the institution with valuable experience on the use of SENA funds to
          hireprivate sector firms to provide demand-driven training services.

53. The National Development Plan 2002-2006 outlined a role for SENA, but the strategy has changed.
Originally, SENA was to be the leader in the (National) Comprehensive Job Training Strategy, which
would expand SENA's responsibilities from provider and financer of training to also include regulation
and certification of private training.       However, in 2003, the Bank, the Departamento Nacional de
Planeacidn (National Planning Department, DNP), the Ministry of Social Protection (MSP), and SENA
jointly developed the study Public Training Reform Issues in Colombia: The Case of SENASSthat assesses
SENA's capacity to respond to the training needs of Colombia's citizens and alternatives to improve
service delivery. The study concludes that an efficient and effective national skills formation system
requires a level playing field among the public and private providers. SENA has been responsible for the
'*Thispolicy      will bring into SENA students who may not have had access in the larger competitive pool. While
some SENA services have questionable benefits, which would argue against an expansion of the number of
beneficiaries, others, such as the Jovenes en Accidn program, are expected to have very high benefits. Also,
affiliating unemployed people with SENA will give them access to the SENA-sponsored, web-based information
system where job seekers and employers register and find matches, which has been proven more effective than
training, in many countries (see Betcherman and Dar, 2003).

30 Alice Mesnard. Familias enAccidn Evaluation:Labor Supply (IFSDNP), inprocess.
31 The Government and the Bank have recently modified the project design to pilot the employment subsidy
program. The pilot would avoid the institutional constraints to the public sector creation o f and administration o f
pbs and materials, by giving incentives to the private sector to createjobs and administer the process with a subsidy.
 2 SENA does not target poor workers; it is geared toward the provision of vocational training for all citizens.
However, it has becomeknown as the "university of the poor," due to its zero-tuition policy.
33 Report No. 27752; under review by the GOC.


                                                         13

accreditation and regulation of private training, the provision of training, and the management of public
funds for training (via the parafiscales), which concentrates all the functions in SENA and creates
incentives to exclude the private sector. To introduce competition to the system, the study recommends a
separationof responsibilities inthe provision, financing, regulation, and accreditation of training services.

54. Previous attempts at reforming SENA have not succeeded since they did not take into account the
public support enjoyed by SENA and its programs. This recent study on SENA can be usedto informthe
debate in public discussions and consultations to gain support for the reforms.                Also, the report
recommends constant re-evaluation and phasing to ensure small successes through the long reform
process.

55. Duringthe process of re-thinkingthe design and transformation of the public training system, SENA
has made efforts to increase the efficiency of its services by downsizing staff and making their contracts
more flexible. While the types of services offered by SENA may change as a result of the revised
strategy, it is likely that the reforms will be gradual and costly, requiring efficiency improvements in
activities that are likely to persist well into the reform or even remain after it, such as the provision of
short duration training courses. In any case, for successful implementation of the reform, it will be key
for SENA to adapt the size and composition of its staff to the changing needs and organization of the
training system.

56. Remaininn Challennes for 2004-2006. To continue the reform process, the Government will
implement the regulations of Law 789, principally those dealing with the apprenticeship program,
unemployment insurance, and incentives to employers to hire hard-to-employ workers.34 In terms of
SENA, the GOC will embark on a process for designingthe new NationalJob Training System-and thus
the new SENA - beginning with the development of a CONPES (Consejo Nacional de Politica
Econdmica y Social) document outlining the new principles, and the creation and implementation of an
action plan for the reform process. The development of information systems will be a key step in this
process.

B.       Social Risk ManagementSystem Development

57. General Strategy for 2002-2006. The current administration views social protection as the efficient
and equitable management of social risks and their consequences, and i s supporting the establishment of
an integrated social risk management system - as mandated under the Pastrana administration via two
CONPES - as the key to more efficient and wider-reaching social protection. The Uribe administration,
recognizingthe desirability of a more integrated and comprehensive approach to social protection, set out
to implementa comprehensive social risk managementsystem.

58. Key Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. There have been several significant advances. First, the
Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) was established in February 2003, through a merger of the Ministries
of Labor and Health, as the institutional backbone of Colombia's evolving social risk management
system. The MSP is charged with consolidation of the existing social protection programs by designing
coordinated strategies and policies through public health, early childhood development, skills training,
unemployment insurance, pension, and other labor-related initiatives. The MSP oversees a variety of
previously uncoordinated agencies that provide the bulk of social assistance and insurance protection in
Colombia, includingICBF, SENA, and CCF. This effort i s expectedto increase efficiency by eliminating
duplication of functions and defining an appropriate division of labor. Currently, the MSP is developing
its mission, strategy, and operating procedures, while bringing in line the various programs and
institutions for which it i s responsible.



34The decreasedcost of employment via a redefinition of overtime pay and adjustment of the severancepay system
to reduce perverse incentives do not need to be regulated, and thus are beingfully implemented.


                                                         14

59. Second, as part of the reform effort to better coordinate social insurance and assistance programs, two
of the three Social Safety Net ( U S ) were transferred from the Presidency to the MSP. The RAS
program, supported by the Bank and IDB, was implemented in 2001 to meet the needs of those
particularly vulnerable to the effects of the recession. Its objective was to provide cash transfers in
exchange for actions that were an investment in human capital.           Three programs were developed:
Familias en Accidn, which exchanges cash transfers for school and health center attendance of children,
Jo'venes en Accidn, which funds scholarship grants to poor youth for skills training, and Empleo en
Accidn, a community-based temporary employment program for the needy. The Jo'venes en Accidn
program was incorporatedinto SENA and the reformed Empleo en Accidn i s beingmanagedby the MSP.
Familias en Accidn has yet to find its permanent institutionalhome and source of funding.

60. Third, a renewed effort to target the poor populations has emerged with the nationwide
implementation of the Sistema de Seleccio'n de Bene$ciarios (System of Beneficiaries Selection,
SISBEN) surveys to update municipal databases (started in 2003). This effort is expected to make the
SISBEN Index significantly more accurate as a poverty status indicator to be used for targeting social
programs, and to improve its administration, auditing, andregulatory framework.

61. Remaining Challenges for 2004-2006. The institutional reform i s proceeding well but it faces
significant challenges over several years that will require skilled leadership and strong technical inputs to
continue building the umbrella ministry and redefining the role of each of the semi-autonomous
institutions. The political challenges will require dedication from all actors to continue defining the
strategy and its implementation. The relationship between the Ministry of Social Protection and its
autonomous departments - SENA, ICBF, ISS, and CCF- i s still being defined, but efforts thus far by the
MSP to define the strategy of each department in relation to the Ministry, have been successful. In
addition, the completion of the new SISBEN i s crucial for improving targeting of MSP programs; if this
i s not done well, there will continue to be low coverage of social programs for the most needy groups.

C.       Early ChildDevelopment          -ICBF
62. General Stratem for 2002-2006. The Uribe Administration intends to continue focusing most of the
ICBF's attention and resources on young children. In response to a decline in coverage in recent years,
the ICBF i s searching for means to increase coverage while addressing some of the problems regarding
the efficiency, equity, and quality of its childcare services.

63. Key Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. The ICBF established a framework to improve the targeting
of its largest programs. Notably, it established a targeting policy, including quantitative targets increasing
the share of ICBFexpenditures going to poor children, particularly among the displaced populations. The
Child Breakfast program is the first to which the targeting will be applied.

64. The ICBF also intends to identify means to improve the efficiency of its major programs via impact
evaluations of its major programs. The results of these evaluations are intended to provide information so
that the Institute can better focus the use of its resources on strategic, high value-added, and pro-poor
programs.

65. As mentioned above, in 2001, the cash transfer program Familias en Accio'n was initiated to provide
incentives and means to families to enhance the education and nutritional status of their children,
particularly during crises.     This program has worked well, and presents an altemative model for
nutritional services for young children in rural areas, who have less access to ICBF programs. There i s a
discussion within the Government regarding whether this should remain an emergency cash transfer
programthat is used in times of crisis, as it was originally designed, or a poverty reduction program with
a permanent role inthe social protection strategy. Given the overlap inthe clientele between the Familias
program and the ICBF, and the GOC's desire to incorporate the Familias program into the MSP,



                                                      15

discussions and information collection are underway about whether the programcan be folded into ICBF,
given existing ICBFresource constraints and the difference in programdesigns.

66. Remaining Challenges for 2004-2006. The ICBF will undertake an impact evaluation of its two
major assistance and prevention programs: Desayunos Znfantiles (Children's Breakfasts) and Hogares
Comunitarios de Bienestar (Community Day Care). Once the evaluations are completed, the ICBF and
the MSP will face the challenging task of reorganizing the Institute's program portfolio to improve and
focus services. Also, the MSP will have the information to determine if it has the capacity to adopt the
Familias en Accidn RAS Program. In the meantime, the ICBF faces the challenge of implementing the
new targeting strategy to shift its attention to the poorest children.

D.       Health Services: Increased Immunization Coverage and Nutrition

67. General Strateav for 2002-2006. The GOC is committed to strengthening public health. A national
priority goal i s the establishment of a 95 percent immunization coverage rate of 0-5 year old children by
2006. The strategy for achieving this goal was defined by an evaluation of the national immunization
program, in collaboration with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). A five-year Action Plan,
including short and medium-term activities, was also developed by the MSPand the ZnstitutoNacional de
Salud (National Institute of Health, INS) to strengthen the PAI, which focuses on immunizing children
age 0-1, with complementary actions for older children with incompleteregimes.

68. A second priority is the continued implementation of the health reform, which was established by
Law 100 in 1993. The key elements for focus are the expansion of health service coverage for the poor
through greater efficiency in the use of public funds earmarked for healthcare, and improved quality of
health services through providing greater information to the public.

69. Kev Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. One of the key elements for success in the immunization
strategy i s protecting the budget for the purchase of syringes and vaccines to cover the annual
immunization targets and reach the 2006 targets. Since 2002, the national authorities have increased PA1
fundingto levels sufficient to meet the immunization needs for 2002-2004 (supported by the PLaRSSAL
Iand10,resultinginimmunizationratesabove90percentinDFT,polio, TripleViral, BCG, and
Hepatitis B for children age 0-1 in 2002-2003. These results have been achieved through a clarification
of institutional roles in vaccination, aggressive vaccination campaigns aimed at the municipal authorities,
and close collaboration between the MSP and the municipal entities, who provide the vaccinations and
house-to-house visits to vaccinate 0-1 year olds and older children that did not have completed
immunization regimes.

70. To reach older children, Decree 2287 of 2002 was approved to request immunization cards for
children enrolled in public and private schools and child-care centers, including HCBs. The Decree does
not require the presentation of the immunization card, since it does not want to induce schools to deny
access to children whose parents may have lost the card. Instead, the Decree i s intended to promote a
culture of public health and the importance of having an immunizationrecord.

71. The Familias en Accidn Program has also been important to the immunization campaign, providing
health subsidies to 269,000 children (age 0-6) in poor families during 2002-2004, with a target of one
million children by 2006. The cash subsidies were providedto poor families, conditional on, among other
things, their children's participation in the Programa de Crecimiento y Desarrollo (Growth and
Development Program), which includes vaccination and nutrition monitoring. Evaluations show that
DPT vaccinations were 12 percent higher among children whose families received the subsidy than
among the control group.

72. Improved quality ofsewices. One of the main goals of Law 100 of 1993 i s to improve the quality of
health services. To attain this goal, the GOC passed Decree 2309 of 2002, "Quality Guarantee"


                                                       16

(Garantia de Calidad), which identifies the National Health Superintendency as the entity responsible for
providing licenses to EPSs and the state (departamento) and district health directorates for providing
licenses to the IPSs (hospitals, clinics, and health care providers). The MSP i s responsible for defining
the standards, mechanisms and procedures for the licensing and accreditation for both insurers and
providers, which it did in 2003, and to implementing the reforms.

73. Since 2003, the MSP i s implementing a process for licensing of IPSs. Resolution 1439 of October
2002 defined quality standards by activity or hospital ward (e.g. cardiology, orthopedics etc). The MSP
requests that all health care providers use a standardized questionnaire to survey the quality of their own
services and to report the results to the MSP. If the services meet the quality standards, the IPS i s
licensed. Otherwise, the facility i s not permitted to operate until the standards are met. The Health
Secretariats(Secretariasde Salud) also visit a random sample of providers to verify the awarded licenses,
to license those units that improve their services and comply with the standards, and to shut down those
IPSs that reported incorrect information or do not comply with the standard^.^' The process is expected to
be completed in 2004.

74. The implementation of the quality assurance system should be complemented by an improved client-
oriented health information system to allow people to make informed choices regarding insurers and
health care providers. One of the actions supported by the SECAL36was the dissemination of information
by the Health Superintendency regarding the performance and finances of EPSs and ARSs, public
hospitals, and Health Secretariats. The MSP plans to introduce a more widely accessible information
system and to measure other indicators, including the ranking of insurers, hospitals, and Health
Secretariats using consumer-friendly criteria, such as waiting time, courtesy in attending the client,
availability of supplies, and overall responsiveness. Before this can be done, however, the MSP must
establish quality criteria and licensingfor IPSs, ARSs, and EPSs.

75. Further transformation of supply to demand subsidies. Law 715 of 2002 mandates the re-initiation of
the transformation of supply to demand subsidies in 2003. The National Council of Social Security in
Health (Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Social en Salud, CNSSS), with the IDB's technical assistance,
recently submitted their plan for the level and pace of the transformation from supply to demand
             In the meantime, there has been an ongoing defacto transformation through the increase of
affiliates of the Subsidized Regime using funds that have been partly secured through the more efficient
use of presentresources in the health sector. As the number of affiliates of the EPSs and APSs continues
to grow, the need for supply subsidies can decrease as public hospitals would be expected to finance half
of their annual budget by selling their services to the affiliates of the Contributory and Subsidized
regimes.

76. Expansion of SubsidizedRegime aflliation. As indicated above, consolidation of the health reform
depends on the expansion of membership in the Subsidized Regime, which the government plans to
continue to the extent that i s financially and politically feasible. According to the Development Plan for
the period between 2002-2006, the national goal is to expand insurance coverage among three million




 35One concern was the impact of hospital closures on the population that they serve. Since there is an
 overabundanceof hospitals in Colombia, the implementation of the Resolution is not expected to eliminate all health
 care from any area. Instead, the other local service providers can attend to the population's needs.
 36Social Sector Adjustment Loan Project (7134-C0), approved August 1,2002.
 37 Departments are responsible for financing hospitals, while municipalities are responsible for increasing health
 insurance coverage by the Subsidized Regime. The distribution of resources between health insurance subsidies and
 direct public hospital financing is based on the number of affiliates and of vinculados (people who are eligible for
 the Subsidized Regime but have not yet beenregistered in the system).


                                                           17

 uninsured.38 The MSP estimatesthat the number of individuals in the Subsidized Regime by 2004 i s 11.8


 77. Recent data from the National Survey of Quality of Life (Encuesta Nacional de Calidad de Vida,
 ENCV) 2003 suggest the presence of some individuals of SISBEN level 4 and 5 within the affiliates of
 the Subsidized Regime, which i s intended primarily for SISBEN 1 and 2 (Table 2):'                Individuals of
 SISBEN 4-6 in the Subsidized Regime represent only 11.2 percent of the total number of affiliates,
 showing that the targeting process, although with certain shortcomings, performs satisfactorily. However,
 there i s room for reallocation of benefits from SISBEN 4-6 families to uncovered SISBEN 1 and 2
 families.

 78. Nofinancial bailoutsfor public hospitals. The GOC and the MSP adopted a policy that no additional
 resources would be allocated to bail out public hospitals in financial deficit, thus giving the incentive to
 public hospitals to be efficient and to compete for health service provision contracts. Public hospitals
 under the health reform program should finance themselves through payments from: (i)contracts with
 health insurers        (APSs, EPSs); and (ii)contracts signed between public hospitals and
 departments/municipalitiesfor the provision of specific services for the poor who are eligible but not yet
 actually covered by the Subsidized Regime (vincul~dos).~~

 79. Remaininn Challennes for 2004-2006. The health reform remains a formidable challenge that will
 only be successful through patience and small steps. The immediate challenges are to expand the number
 of affiliates in the Subsidized Regime, thus transferring more power to the consumer and encouraging
 competition and choice. This will also bring non-affiliates among SISBEN 1-3 families into the system.
 The transformation of the service providers to sellers in the health market will require the GOC to

 out-of-pocketincomparisonwith 84 percent of non-insured individuals. Among those who did pay for
 hospitalization, non-insuredindividualspaid33 percent more, on average, than insuredindividuals.
 39Partial subsidies are being developed to increase coverage in both Regimes, where the cost of health insurance is
 shared betweenthe individuals, the association or group that representsthem, and states/ municipalities where these
 individuals reside. Also, Decree 516 of 2004 encourages independent workers to affiliate to the Contributory
 Regime by requiring contributionon a base of 1.5 minimum monthly salaries, rather than two minimum monthly
 salaries, as does the rest of the population.
 40The law permits enrollment of the population on SISBEN 3 once all those in levels 1 and 2 in the municipality
 have beenaffiliated.
 41Law 715 stipulates that Departments are responsible for the financing of public hospitals. Hospitals should be
 paidbasedon contracts signedwith those territorial entities, except inthe case of some decentralizedmunicipalities,
 where the municipalityreceives the resourcesto finance first-levelhospitals.

implement the hospital restructuringplan and continue the policy of "no bailouts." The licensing and
oversight of the EPSs, ARSs, and IPSs are fundamental to give consumers the information and assurance
that their insurance and health providers are of high quality. A vigorous vaccination strategy must
continue if the GOC is to reach the goal of 95 percent coverage by 2006. This will require continued
guarantee of PAI money and further implementation of the immunization cards, so that all public
childcare and primary school facilities requestthem andprovide parents with the information about where
to get their children vaccinated. The usefulness of the immunization cards can be increased if resources
are made available to vaccinate children whose childcare or primary schools report an incomplete
vaccination regime.

E.       EducationReformImplementation

80. General Strategy for 2002-2006.         The GOC is committed to sustained implementation of the
education reform agenda and has made education development a high priority. The main elements of
Colombia's Revolucidn Educativa (Educational Revolution) are summarized inthe National Development
Plan. The primary strategic results, include:

    0    Greater coverage. Increase coverage by 1.4 million places in basic (includes pre-school and
         primary) and secondary education, through efficiency gains from the reorganization of regional
         systems and the rationalization of resourceuse. Increaseplaces inhigher education by 400,000.

    0    Improved student learning and teachers' performance. Improve education quality so that
         students develop basic competencies and labor market and civics skills through: the regular
         testing of students in all schools to measure their learning achievement and promote social
         accountability; systematic and regular measurement of teacher performance; and performance-
         based incentive schemes to motivate teachers to teach more effectively and utilize training
         courses for skills upgrading. Regardingpost basic education, the goals are to increase the quality
         of low rankinghigher education institutions as measuredby ICFES (ZnstitutoColombian0para el
         Foment0 de la Educacio'n Superior) tests and to provide opportunities for people to achieve
         formal education credits through a certification process basedon equivalency tests.


    0    Better use of education resources.         Full implementation of the new education resource
         distribution formula. Unlike in the past when the transfer of education resources to the territorial
         entities was based on the number of teachers, Law 715 of 2001 mandates that the distribution be
         based on the number of students attending, coverage gaps, and poverty indicators. This requires
         building systems for territorial entities to measure the number of students accurately and to
         reallocate staff or contract private providersfor the more efficient delivery of education services.

81. Key Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. The funding formula - based on number of students rather
than number of teachers - has started to pressure the territorial entities and their schools to enroll more
children or lose money. To ensure that the incentive effect is maintained over time, good information and
verification systems are being developed to support the application of the distribution formula.
Complementing this effort, the Ministry of Education (MEN) i s providing technical assistance to
territorial Secretaries of Education to develop reliable databases for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
The MEN confirms the enrollment information through cross-checking the data with DANE'S,
(Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica, National Administrative Department of
Statistics) data and special audits when MENsuspects inaccurate information.

 82. The MENhas also entered into agreements with Secretaries of Education to help them to restructure
their education systems to increase productivity - concentrating rationalization efforts in 42 decentralized
municipalities with over 10,000 residents (over 70 percent of the student population). Many of these
agreements relate to the process of certification of municipalities, whereby Secretaries, once certified, will


                                                      19

receive their education transfers in a form that allows them to have discretionary authority over those
resources.

83. In addition to this new approach, the MENplans to expand rural education by 60,000 places during
2002-2006 through innovative models such Escuela Nueva (approach to primary education designed for
multi-grade schools in rural areas); Telesecundaria (distance education); and Sistema de Aprendizaje
Tutorial (System of Tutorial Learning, SAT). Thus far, the MEN has achieved important results in this
regard. Innovative methods of teaching were implemented in 110 municipalities in 2003 and even more
are expected in 2004. Inaddition, innovative models have beenpresentedand discussed in more than 200
municipalities during national meetings. A description of these and other innovations i s provided in
Annex IV.

84. Finally, the Familias en Accidn Program has shown to be effective in the promotion of universal
education. The program awards cash transfers to poor families in return for keeping their children in
school.    An impact evaluation of the program shows that two years after implementation, school
attendance among 12-17 year olds increasedby five percentagepoints inurban areas and eight percentage
points inruralareas, as compared to the control

85. Remaining Challenges for 2004-2006. The UribeAdministration has committed itself to increasethe
number of students in the education system within the budget envelope by increasing the efficiency of
service delivery among primary and secondary schools and implementing the new school funding scheme
basedon student enrollment, developing and implementing a systemfor recognition of equivalent degrees
among higher education institutions to allow for movement of students among said institutions, and
sponsoring the implementation of innovative education service delivery mechanisms to reach special
populations. Quality enhancements are anticipated via testing of students, to determine where to focus
the teaching, and by incentives to teachers to perform better, including teacher testing, with programs to
enhance the skills of teachers who lag.          Efficiency gains should result from better, and more
appropriately, trained teachers and through the reorganization of teaching staff to keep student-to-teacher
ratios at the appropriate level.

F.       Transparency and Social Control

86. General Straten for 2002-2006. To improve the functioning of social programs, the Government i s
focused on the creation of scientific information on the quality of publicly-provided services and its
review and dissemination through non-governmental channels. This also entails the cultivation of the
"culture of evaluation," where program information is regularly collected and used by the public for
oversight.

87. Key Actions Undertaken in 2002-2003. The DNP has made progress in the evaluation of several
social programs, including the three RAS programs. These evaluations, undertaken by consultants who
were selected in a competitive biddingprocess, have been important not only for estimating the impacts
of the interventions, but also for demonstrating the value to the government and the public of undertaking
such evaluations. A presentation of the impacts of the Familias en Accidn program given by Sinergia (the
evaluation unit of the DNP) to the President of the Republic in 2003 was met with such enthusiasm that
the GOC is planning to institutionalize an evaluation system, where impact evaluations are conducted
every few years.

88. Sinergia has also undertaken the task of producing impact evaluations and providing technical
assistance, and partnership, to other institutions developingtheir own evaluations. Regular bulletins,with
the latest evaluation information on Government programs, includingthose inthe social sector, have been

                                                     20

regularly distributed and compiled into a book to report on the first year of the Administration's progress.
Additionally, Sinergia is providing support to governmental institutions who wish to undertake impact
evaluations, which rangesfrom review of terms of reference to joint financing.

89. To increase the legitimacy and dissemination of the evaluation results, Sinergia has approachedcivil
society to create a modified version of the successfulBogotd, Como Vamos? program. This i s consistent
with the GOC goal of promoting social audits, which when carried out by citizens can be effective
instrumentsagainst corruption, and improvingefficiency, coverage, and quality of public servicedelivery.
Social audit mechanisms of any Government program or policy would be organized at the national level,
and would involve participation by chambers of commerce, universities and other education institutions,
trade unions, and communities.

90. International experience indicates that a law requiring evaluation of the results and costs of public
programs i s a key factor in the development of results-based management, a culture of transparency, and
social accountability. A CONPES document an evaluation and performance management can make such
evaluations obligatory, without introducingadditional fiscal rigidities.

91. Challenges Remaining for 2004-2006. The institutionalization of a culture of evaluation i s a long-
term process requiring a change in priorities and expectations of Government and the public. The DNP,
through Sinergia, is working toward this end, but the process to strengthen the foundations for a
sustainable monitoring and evaluation system is complex, including: the creation of institutional capacity
to supervise evaluations and in-house technical capacity to carry out evaluations; the generation of
adequate databases and information to cany out monitoring and impact evaluations; and the building of
networks, with civil society, to monitor the process, disseminate findings and establish social control. To
lay the groundwork for this, it i s important to establish a legal basis obligating social Ministries and
Departments to undertake such evaluations and to builda civil constituency who will discuss, check, and
disseminate the evaluation results andthus demand improvements intheir social services.

     IV.     The Programmatic Labor Reformand Social Structural Adjustment Loan, the
             Programand the FirstPhase

92. Summary ofthe Bank's m-ocess and timeline. The Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural
Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL) was designed as a two-phase program to support the labor and social
reform efforts of the GOC, described in the previous chapter. The general program was conceptualized,
and the prior actions for the first phase were approved by the Board on September 9, 2003, with the
PLaRSSAL I.The proposed trigger actions for preparation of the PLaRSSAL I1phase were also included
in the PLaRSSAL IProject Document, accompanied by a full matrix of prior actions for PLaRSSAL 11.
Identifying these actions up-front allowed for a smooth transition between the two phases of the program
and gave clear expectations for future Bank support of the GOC reform process. Following the approval
of the PLaRSSAL I,the Bank continued to work with the GOC to implement the reform program.
During this time, the Government's reform strategy did not change, the reform program progressed
smoothly, risks for longer-term success of the program were identified and mitigated, and the triggers and
other prior actions definedfor the PLaRSSAL I1were completed.

93. This chapter discusses the context and actions that set the stage for the PLaRSSAL 11. First,how the
program contributes to the CAS, and its complementarity to other Bank and multilateral operations i s
presented(sections A and B). Next, the programthat was approved by the Board on September 9,2003 is
discussed (section C). This i s followed by a description of the specific actions taken under PLaRSSAL I,
which were completed by September 9, 2003 (section D). Finally, the lessons learned during the
preparation of the PLaRSSAL I,which were incorporated into the GOC's and Bank's on-going work in
preparation of the second phase of the operation, are presented (section E). The proposed PLaRSSAL I1
 operation is presentedinChapter V.

A.      Linkswith the Bank's AssistanceStrategy

94. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board of Directors on January 9, 2003,
describes the Bank's strategy for Colombia, which focuses on three goals: (i) and sustainablegrowth;
                                                                              fast
(ii) governmentinstitutions;and(iii) thefruitsofgrowth.
   quality                                    sharing

95. The PLaRSSAL Program directly contributes to achieving the CAS objectives:

        Economic growth. For faster and sustained economic growth, Colombia needs to increase
        employment of workers and total factor productivity growth. The labor reforms supported by the
        PLaRSSAL contribute to increased employment. Moreover, the education and training reforms
        advanced by the government and nurtured by these operations increase the pace of the country's
        human capital accumulation and push private sector productivity towards the technological
        frontier. In the Bank's report, Closing the Gap in Education and Technology (2003), these two
        conditions are deemed necessary for sustained and rapid economic growth in the technologically
        changing global economy.

        Building aualitv government. The PLaRSSAL contributes to the development of quality
        government by supporting reforms intended to promote the transparency, social accountability,
        coordination, and rationalization of key social programs and institutions (e.g. MSP, ICBF, SENA,
        and MEN). In addition, the operation enhances the participation of Colombia's citizens and the
        ability of beneficiaries to make choices and informed decisions. Such actions are expected to
        reduce inefficienciesand improve relations between the population and the government.

        Sharing the fruits of growth. The labor, education, training, social assistance, and health reforms
        supported by the PLaRSSAL Program enhance the ability of all people, especially the poor, to
        share in the fruits of economic growth. Employment is the single most important source of
        income for poor people. Hence, reforms that reduce unemployment and underemployment are
        likely to lower poverty and improve income equality. It can also be argued that improved cost-
        effectiveness and targeting of ICBF and SENA programs to low-income people (called for by the
        PLaRSSAL) reduce welfare inequality. Moreover, a movement towards universal access to good
        quality basic education and health services promoted by the PLaRSSAL favors lower income
        children.

96. Linkage Between the PLaRSSALand other Bank Operations. The PLaRSSAL operation is a key part
of the strategy to support the GOC's effort to raise the rate of human capital accumulation, expand
employment, and strengthen Colombia's social protection system. It complements, and i s complemented
by, several other Bank initiatives inthe social and labor sectors.

97. The PLaRSSAL continues, deepens, and expands the reform agenda supported by the Colombia
Social Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL), which was completed in 2001.43 The SECAL was prepared at
the end of the previous administration (1998-2002), when the peace process had broken down, Colombia
was suffering from a protracted economic and social crisis, and the fiscal imbalance with public sector
debt was rapidly rising to 50 percent of GDP. As a single tranche loan, it was designed to establish a
foundation for the expansion of critical reforms that would contributeto the advancement of social sector
strengthening and the political sustainability of fiscal adjustments. The SECAL had three overarching
objectives:

        Consolidate Colombia's Bank-assisted social sector strengthening program by supporting key
        reforms in education, health, and the emerging integrated social risk management strategy;


43Social Sector Adjustment Loan Project (7134-C0), approved August 1,2002.


                                                     22

        Encourage the incoming administration to carry forward the reforms supported by the loan by
        incorporating follow-up activities into its medium-term strategic agenda; and

        Provide the GOC with afinancial cushion and support for social measures to complement the
        fiscal reforms under the Bank-supported Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan.44

98. The SECAL Implementation Completion Report45gave a "Satisfactory" overall performance ratingto
the program supported by the loan, which firmly laid the groundwork for the new administration to
continue, strengthen, and extend reforms aimed at increasing the pace of humancapital accumulation and
the development of a more comprehensive and efficient social protection system. The following lessons
learned from the ICR were taken into account in the preparation of the PLaRSSAL: (i)          focus on high
priority loan conditions; (ii) a solid analytical foundation for the operation; (iii) government
                               ensure                                                    secure
ownership of the policy matrix; (iv) foster strong sectoral collaboration; and (v) consult with experts and
stakeholders outside the government.

99. In addition to deepening the reforms initiated with the SECAL, the PLaRSSAL complements other
Bank operations including:

         Education investment loans. These operations include the Higher Education - ImprovingAccess
         Project, (Loan No. 71550) approved December 23, 2002, the Cundinamarca Education Quality
         Improvement Project (Loan No. 71920) approved August 19, 2003, and the Rural Education
         Project (Loan No. 70120) approved April 11, 2000. The first aims to increase enrollment in
         higher education. The second intends to reform Cundinamarca's education system to increase its
         efficiency, basic education coverage, and quality; it is hoped that this would be a model of how a
         territorial entity can better use its resources and authority under the amendeddecentralization law
         (Law 715). The Rural Education Project intends to strengthen the decentralization effort in rural
         areas.

         Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Program (FIAL). This program seeks to:
         promote reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessary for sustainable macroeconomic stability;
         improve the provision of public services; and establish the institutionalbasis for higher efficiency
         and accountability in public expenditure. The FIAL I1(Loan No. 7201, approved November 20,
         2003) successfully focused on creating incentives for efficiency gains in education and increasing
         transparency in management contracts within the MSP, namely in ICBF and SENA.                    For
         example, the education transfers are now distributed more equitably and seven of the eight
         indicators to measure the transparency in management contracts of SENA are inline with its
         target. FIAL I11(currently under preparation) will continue to work in the reallocationof income
         from royalties to education and inthe transparency inmanagement contracts.

         Investments in Social Safety Net (RAS)Program. The Bank currently finances the Human Capital
         Protection             and Community Works and Employment Project.47 The former provides
         cash transfers to extremely poor families conditional on their children's enrollment in basic
         education and visits to health centers for basic care. The CAS has programmed a follow-up
         operation for FY05. The latter was a workfare program that supported community projects to
         create opportunities for temporary employment for the poor unemployed workers. It has been
         redesigned as a pilot wage subsidy program for employers who hire, in addition to their current
         workforce, unemployedfemale household heads or youth.

        Peace and Development. The Peace and Development Project (Loan No. 7232, approved June
        10, 2004) assists communities in planningand implementingtheir own strategiesfor development
        inthe context of violence andconflict. The finalgoal is to implement an integral strategy inhigh
        violence incidence regions that goes beyond pure assistance for the displaced population, and
        reduces the vulnerability of the population, including the development of productive activities
        expected to lead to economic self-sufficiency and community social capitalbuilding.

        Health. Recent World Bank contributions to the health sector have been through the Adjustment
        Loans. The CAS programs a Health Investment operation for FY05, to further incorporate the
        reforms that were initially supported through the SECAL-PLaRSSAL series of operations.

        Analvtical and Advisory Assistance. Inconsultation with the GOC, several analytical pieces were
        prepared by the Bank which have informed its lending operations and the GOC strategy,
        including: (i)Colombia Poverty Assessment (Report No. 12673-CO); (ii) Safety Net Social
        Assessment (Report No. 22255-CO); (iii)    Colombia: the Economic Foundation of Peace (2003);
        (iv) Public Training Reform Issues in Colombia: the Case of SENA (under review by the
        Government); and (v) Social Sector Efficiency programmatic analytical work on education and
        hospitals (on-going).

B.      Complementarities withOther Institutions'Operations

100.    The GOC continues to coordinate the IDB- and the Bank-financed programs that support the
reform of the social sectors, while the Bank and IDB themselves have developed a close working
relationship on labor and social reform issues. Collaboration in the implementation of the RAS Program,
financed in parallel by both banks, remains strong. A single monitoring and evaluation model of the RAS
Program i s being utilized by the GOC and the Bank and IDB regularly consult each other regarding the
GOC'S social sector reform program, which both institutions support. In December 2003, the IDB
completed a Social Emergency Program(US$1.25 billion), which focused on: (i) protection of key
                                                                                  budget
social programs in education, health, and social assistance; and (ii)social sector efficiency and equity in
severalkey programs, while the Bank's PLaRSSAL emphasizedstrategic planning and policy.

101.    Currently, the MSP is implementing two IDB health loans. The Health Reform Support Program
(Programade Apoyo a la Reforma), which has beenunder implementationfor several years, i s supporting
the design and implementation of an information system for the sector. In early 2004, a Hospital
Restructuring Project was approved (US$72 million) to finance public hospital restructuring processes in
order to make the network of public health care facilities more competitive and able to sell their services
to insurers in both the Subsidized and the Contributory Regimes. Policy development, supported by the
Bank with the second phase of the PLaRSSAL, underpins these loans, namely the PLaRSSAL Iand I1
that support the achievement of immunization rates, the expansion of the Subsidized Regime, and the
licensingand accreditation of hospitals and clinics.

102.    The European Commission (EC) i s also undertaking programs that are complemented by the
PLaRSSAL. While the Bank's operation i s intended to improve the quality and coverage of national
policies and program, the EC i s working to focus and adapt these efforts to the most vulnerable part of the
population - those affected by violence. The EC has developed "Peace Laboratories'' and a community
strengthening program to enhance access to and quality of the main social services - education, health,
and nutrition - and employment for populations living in conflict areas and the populations displaced
from these areas (desplazados).

C.      ProgramObjectives

103.    Objectives.    The Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment operation
(PLaRSSAL) consists of two single-tranche loans.         The PLaRSSAL Program supports the general


                                                    24

government objective of promoting higher employment, increased human capital formation, and
strengthened social protection, especially of the poor and vulnerable. This objective would be achieved
through more efficient and equitable use of social sector resources, improved regulatory environment and
better institutional practices, namely:

         Institution of an effective authority -the Ministryof Social Protection-in charge of developing a
         comprehensive social risk management system to provide efficient and timely protection of the
         poor and vulnerable against the threats and consequences of illness, unemployment, poverty and
         economic volatility;

         Greater access of poor children to ICBF Assistance and Prevention Programs through the
         establishment of an explicit targeting policy and practices to ensure their cost-effectiveness;

         Achievement of at least 95 percent Expanded Programof Immunization (PAI) coverage rate of 0-
         5 year old children by 2006 by protectingPA1fundingand an aggressive vaccination campaign;

         Advances in the implementation of health system reform by further expanding health insurance
         coverage of the poor usingresources from additional funds and the former supply-side subsidies,
         reducing direct subsidies to public hospitals by a "no bailouts'' policy, and ensuring quality of
         services of health insurers andcare providers;

         Implementation of labor and training reforms to reduce the wedge between employers'
         hiringhraining cost and workers' acceptable wage, while improving the social protection of
         vulnerable workers;

         Acceleration of education reforms to provide access to quality education, especially to basic and
         secondary schools, while increasing efficiency; and

         Greater transparency and social control of social programs through their periodic evaluation and
         greater participatory oversight by citizens.

104.     The strategy to attain those objectives includes the actions undertaken in the two phases of the
PLaRSSAL; these actions and the corresponding performance indicators are detailed in Annex I.The
actions for each loan are based on the Government's development plan, and are intended to help meet
their target outcomes and to create a sustainable framework for social and labor gains in the long run.
The target outcomes for the operation are presented in the fourth column of Annex I,and are beingused
to monitor progress of the PLaRSSAL conditions and more generally of the Government's program,
while the Uribe Administration's medium-term goals are presentedinthe last column.

    Social Protection: Created the Ministry of Social Protection by merging the Labor and Health
    Ministries, puttingunder its responsibility autonomous agencies funded by earmarked payroll taxes
    including SENA, ISS and ICBF. Decree Number 205/03 identified the objectives, the structure and
    the functions of the MSP.

    ICBF: (i)Created and approved an explicit targeting policy for ICBF programs benefiting children
    from SISBEN 1and 2 families, with guidelines for the development of quantitative targets, targeting
    methodologies, and M&E systems; and (ii)the DNP and the ICBF committed to periodic Impact
    Evaluation of major ICBF programs.

    Health: (i)  Allocated budget for the PA1for the year 2003 that was sufficient for achieving the 95
    percent coverage target in 2006; (ii)       Signed Resolution No. 1535 of 2002 that requests the
    presentation of a completed immunization card for children entering public or private childcare or
    education services; and (iii)  extended the Subsidized Regime by 323,353 new affiliates between July
    2002 andJuly 2003.50

    Labor and Training: (i)    Improved SENA efficiency, as evidenced by an increase in the number of
    SENA short-course graduates by 450,000 (in the period August 2002-July 2003 as compared to
    August 2001-July 2002) within the resource envelope provided by 2003 General Budget Law, an
    increase of nearly 50 percent; and (ii)   approved Law 789 and issued appropriate regulatory decrees to
    permit implementation o f

        Article 13,which waives the payment ofparafiscales for hardto employ groups, including those
         age 16-25, older than age 50, household heads who are unemployed, and disabled workers
         (Decree No. 2286 of August 12,2003);

         Articles 6-11,which regulate the reform of the CCF (Decree No. 827 of April, 2003), including
         the creation of an unemployment insurance program that covers formal and informal sector
         workers; and

         Articles 12 and 30-38, which expand job training opportunities by increasing the number of
         services providers with public financing of private training firms; make the training system more
         flexible by allowing firms to fund their own training rather than going through SENA; and
         expand the pool of apprentices that firms may hire by allowing firms to hire individuals from any
         (post) secondary school or training program(Decree No. 933 of April 11,2003); and

   Education: (i)  Increased basic and secondary net enrollments by 477,598 new students (July 2002 to
   June 2003) and increased the student-to-teacher ratio by 1.6 students per teacher in the same time
   period (from a base of 26.7 students per teacher);51 (ii)   Presidential Decree signed that requires the
   reorganization of teachers and the education system to provide sufficient teachers to all students; and
   (iii) all5" and9" gradestudentsinmathandlanguage.

E.       Lessons from the PLaRSSAL I

107.     The main lessons of the PLaRSSAL Ithat have been considered in the preparation of the
PLaRSSAL I1are:

    0  Strong and on-going dialogue between the GOC and the Bank through joint high-quality sector
       work on social protectionissues and operations i s valuable for future operations. The PLaRSSAL
       I1continues this practice by buildingon the on-going dialogue around thejoint analyticalwork in
       the training (SENA), education and health sectors, and the continued implementation of the RAS
        investment operations.

    0  Emphasis on outputs, rather than inputs and processes, facilitates monitoring and following up of
        conditions by both the government andthe Bank. Focusingon key program outcomes permits the
        inclusion of many sectors in the operation, which would be difficult to manage in a series of
        operations ifthe outcomes for each sector were not clearly defined and measurable. This also
        permits the inclusion of sectors where reform efforts are more advanced than in others. The
        PLaRSSAL I1intends to push this farther by even more focus on measurable outcomes in various
        sectors.

    0   A series of operations - SECAL, PLaRSSAL I,and PLaRSSAL I1- commits the government to
        stay focused on monitoring progress in outputs of key reform measures over a longer time period
        ina coordinated, formal and systematic way. The common set of outcomes, andthe evaluation of
        these outcome indicators with the beginning of each new operation, allow for changes in the
        strategies to be implemented when the previous strategies do not return the expected results.
        While the institutional reform i s underway, constant collaboration between the GOC, the Bank,
        and other partners i s crucial to developing the new platform upon which the health, education,
        and social reforms will rest. Notably, during the continued engagement with the Bank through
        the series of operations, the DNPhas played a strong coordinatingrole, ensuring that the entities
        involved are making progress in achieving agreed output targets and advancing in meeting the
        trigger actions. This ensures continuation of reform efforts over a long period of time and
        permits detection of delays or problems that need to be addressed.

    V.      Second Phaseof the PLaRSSAL Operation PLaRSSALI1     -
108.    This chapter presents the second phase of the PLaRSSAL Program (PLaRSSAL 11). It describes
the PLaRSSAL I1 and the specific prior actions defined in the policy matrix (section A); the GOC
progress in completing the triggers and prior actions (section B); the Technical Assistance Loan,
requestedby the GOC to increasetechnical support to the complex reform program (section C); safeguard
policies and fiscal issues (section D); the expected benefits from the PLaRSSAL I1operation (section E);
and the risks for reaching the intended program outcomes, as the GOC continues to implement its labor
and social reform strategy (section F).

A.      The PLaRSSAL11: Completionof Triggers andPrior Actions

109.     The Second Phase ofthe PLaRSSAL. The PLaRSSAL I1further implements reforms to meet the
general PLaRSSAL goals and the GOC reformagenda by deepening and widening the implementation of
the labor and social reform agenda described previously. The actions for the PLaRSSAL I1are designed
to be outcomehesults oriented.

110.    Two sets of actions are identified in the loan matrix: triggers and prior actions. Triggers are those
actions that have been complied with prior to the Bank's presentation of this operation to the Board. The
prior actions were also identified in the preparation of the PLaRSSAL I;their completion demonstrates
the Govemment's commitment toward the implementation of their reform program, as identified in the
Letter of Development Policy. While the prior actions are not included inthe loan agreement, satisfactory
evidence has been provided demonstrating the advance of and the Borrower's commitment to the
Program.




                                                     27

111.     The GOC has largely completed the triggers and prior actions identified in the policy matrix.
Only one trigger (Action 2.2(i)) and one prior action (Action 2.9(ii)) were only partially met. The GOC's
success in fulfilling the activities in the PLaRSSAL I1 matrix demonstrates their commitment to the
reform program, and the appropriateness of a flexible Bank tool with a longer-term horizon to support the
Government inthe implementation of difficult reforms with specific goals.

112.     Some of the prior actions, while fully implemented, did not have the expected results (some parts
of Action 2.5, Action 2.8(ii)). However, the GOC has shown its results-management orientation by early
identification of unsatisfactory results, analysis of the factors preventing the outcomes, and re-design of
the instruments in order to produce the desired development outcomes. The Administration's focus on
results, rather than instruments, allows for rapid and flexible redesign of programs.

113.     The triggers, prior actions, and actions undertaken to meet them are as follows (summarized in
Annex 1); all prior actions are underlined and those prior actions that are "triggers" are also inbold:

    Prioraction 2.1: Initialimplementationof the ICBFAgreement, as shown by:

    (i) Implementation of targeting policy [definedin PLaRSSAL I1 in municipalities in which SISBEN
    i s available. The ICBF implemented a targeting policy for the Desuyunos Znfuntiles program. The
    focus municipalities were those that: (i) in conflict areas; (ii) not have the Fumilius en Accidn
                                               are                       do
    program; and (iii) at least 100families classified as SISBEN 1in December 2002. The pilot was
                        had
    carried out in conflict zones and inSeptember 2003, the programwas expanded to municipalities with
    the other characteristics. The focus children were those who: (i) six months to five years old (up
                                                                        were
    to six years old in municipalities that did not offer nutritional programs through ICBF); and (ii) came
    from SISBEN 1 families or, if the family did not have a SISBEN rating, from families that were
    headedby single mothers or unemployed parents. Also, children who were malnourished, at a risk of
    malnutrition, or disabled were targeted. An inventory of the program in 18 departments showed that
    100percent of the children met the criteria laid out inthe ICBF targetingpolicy.

    (ii) Increased coverage of nutritionalprograms: 300,000 additional children younger than 6
    years oldfrom families of SISBEN 1and 2 benefitingfrom ICBF nutritionalprogramsin2003-
    -Thenumber
    2004.                  of children benefiting from ICBF nutritional programs increased by 322,052 in
    2003-2004 (May), from a base of 78,000 in 2002. All new beneficiaries were from families classified
    as SISBEN 1, equivalent to 50 percent of national SISBEN 1 children and 107 percent of the GOC
    goal for the program for 2003. InJuly 2004, an additional 72,343 additional children were affiliated
    with the program, including many in conflict zones and a biddingprocess is underway to expand the
    programby 82,729 new beneficiaries innew municipalities by the end of 2004.

    (iii) Evidence that evaluation of at least two of the ma-iorprograms in the policv document
    [defined in PLaRSSAL 11is in progress. The evaluation of the Desuyunos Znfuntiles program is
    underway: a legal agreementbetween the ICBF (financier) and the INS (financier and researchteam)
    was signed in August 2003, the research methodology was prepared by April 2004, the survey
    instrumentsand manuals were developed by June 2004, a pilot data collection was undertaken inJuly
    2004, and the team will begin to collect the data in mid-August through October 2004. The first
    phase of the impact evaluation of the Hogures Comuniturios program, analyzing the programin rural
    areas, was completed in July 2004, and shows higher nutritional, school attendance and completion,
    and childcare benefits of the program as compared to a control group. The DNP (through Sinergia)
    has initiated a second phase which will expand the analysis to urban areas and explore new aspects of
    the program. By July 2004, a sufficient budget for phase two was allocated, the terms of referencefor
    the consultancy were prepared, andthe biddingprocess will beginin September 2004.

    Prior action2.2: Sustainedprogress inthe implementationof the PAI,as evidencedby:



                                                      28

(i)Achievement of coverage of 90-95 percent of DPT, Triple Viral, and polio immunization for
children age 0-1 (levels as of 2003). This condition originally read: "Achievement of coverage of at
least 90% DPT, 95% Triple Viral, and 90% polio." As of December 2003, the vaccination rates of 0-
1 year olds were 91.9 percent DPT, 92.8 percent Triple Viral, and 92.3 percent polio, exceeding the
trigger targets for DPT and polio, but falling short of the Triple Viral target by 2.2 percentage points.
The shortfall is not deemed a threat to public health, since international evidence shows that 90
percent immunization is sufficient for "herd immunity," Le. enough people are immunized so that if
someone i s afflicted with an illness, too many others are vaccinated for it to become an epidemic.
The statistics show full regimes for 92 percent of the 0-1 population, and other measures are being
undertaken to reach older children (see the next prior action).

(ii)Execution of the Presidential Decree recommending an immunization card for enrolled students.
The decree, prepared and passed as a prior action for the PLaRSSAL I,is being implemented. The
decree recommends that all pre-schools and primary schools request an immunization card upon
enrollment of students. Currently, all the ICBF's childcare centers (Hogares Comuniturios, lactantes
y preescolares,jurdines comuniturios, and hogares infuntiles) are requesting the card. The staff are
trained to read the cards, identify if the immunization regime has been completed, and provide
information to parents on how to complete the regime. Implementation of the decree in primary
schools has been less uniform. Some departments and municipalities, such as Santander and BogotB,
have passed certifications or resolutions requiring their schools to require the cards for enrollment.
Others, however, have been less quick to adopt the measure, instead opting to waive the
immunization card requirement in favor of school attendance. Since the PA1only covers children up
to age 5, if a primary school child does not have a completed immunization regime, there are not
regularly available public funds to provide the vaccinations. This will be less of an issue as the
population ages, due to the aggressive campaign to vaccinate 0-1year olds, but in the meantime, the
Government i s exploring fundingsources to vaccinate older children.

(iii)A certificationbyboththeMinistrv ofSocialProtectionandtheMinistryofFinancethat the
budget allocation for the PA1in the National 2004 Budget approved by Congress is sufficient for
achieving the 95% immunization coverage target by 2006. Both Ministries have certified that the
budget allocationfor 2004 is sufficient to keep the immunization strategy on target.

Prior Action 2.3: Further progress in the implementation of the health reform (Law 100/93), as
evidencedby:

(i) extensionoftheSubsidizedRegimecoverageina12monthperiod(August2003-August
    The
2004) bv 500,000 new affiliates. The Subsidized Regime has been expanded to include 1,094,346
newly-affiliated poor persons between August 2003 and July 2004. Forty percent are new places and
the remaining are re-assignmentsfrom duplications and non-eligible beneficiaries. The rapid increase
was the result of an effort to correct problems with contracts, clean out the registry to eliminate multi-
affiliation and improve targeting, co-financing from municipalities, enforcement of tax collection on
lotteries and alcohol, and new FOSYGA (Fondo de Soliduridud y Garuntiu, Health Care Sector
Fund)money.

(ii)Demonstratedcommitmentofnoadditionalallocationofresourcesto public hospitals outside
regular allocated budget. with the exception of cases of restructuring hospitals or under management
contracts. Between July 2003 and June 2004, no additional allocations were made to public hospitals,
with the exception of the FY04 budget allocated to 27 public institutions to fund their restructuring
efforts.

 (iii)
     Compliance with the timetable defined by the Hospital RestructuringPlan, whose objective i s the
reduction of supply side subsidies up to 20%, as defined by the CNSSS (Conseio Nacional de
SeguridadSocial en Salud) and according to Article 54 of Law 812 of 2003 in restructured hospitals.


                                                 29

The hospital restructuring i s proceeding more quickly than the timetable anticipated. In 2003,
hospital staff was reorganized in 18 hospitals and 1,053 workers were dismissed, and performance
contracts were signed in eight territorial entities for the reorganization of 27 public hospitals (five
more than required by the Hospital Restructuring Plan), which is expected to reduce costs by 20
percent. Further restructuringwill be funded by better collection of taxes on the lottery and alcohol
and through a US$90 million loan from the IDBthat the GOC has recently approved.

Prior Action 2.4: 70 Dercent of third-level hospitals and 50 percent of EPS have been licensed
according to Resolutions 1439 of 2002 and Regulatory Decree 2309 of 2002, respectively. Twenty-
four of the 26 third level hospitals were licensed (92.3 percent of the total). Fourteen of the hospitals
were visited, and two were shut down for non-compliance with the norms. Twenty-seven of the 28
EPSs have been licensed. The remaining EPS had its license revoked for failing to comply with the
norms.

Prior action 2.5: Evidence of imdementation of rewired regulatory decrees of Articles 13, 6-11, 12,
and 30-38 of Law 789 of 2002. The regulatory decrees for Law 789 have been implemented by the
MSP and SENA. In the short-run, many of the policies have had significant impacts and greater
impacts are expected in the future as the newly-created programs become fully operational (most of
the regulations were implemented in the last quarter of 2003). A few of the Articles have had less
impact than expected, but the GOC's results-basedmanagement of the implementationof the law has
ledto an analysis of and plans for improvement of the regulation and implementationof the Articles.
The Law's implementation and results are as follows:

    Articles 6-11: the creation of an unemployment subsidy and a micro-credit program for
    unemployed workers in the formal or informal sectors. Between September 2003 and May 2004,
    unemployment insurance was distributed to 26,450 formal sector workers and 14,583 informal
    sector workers who had lost their jobs.         In the same period, 172 micro-enterprises were
    successfully launched. The GOC i s not satisfied with the low take-up of the latter program and
    has identifiedthat: (i)excessive requirements for participation; and (ii) defined procedures
                                                                               poorly
    for the selection of and work with clients, are key barriers. In response,the MSP is inthe process
    of preparing a decree to remove those requirements that are not necessary for the program and to
    define operating procedures for the executing agencies (CCFs).

    Article 12: more than 25 percent of the SENA budget to fund programs for the unemployed. The
    proportion of SENA's budget targeted toward the unemployed has increased from 20 percent in
    2002 to 25 percent in 2003 and 27 percent in 2004, covering nearly 40 percent of the unemployed
    inColombia.

    Article 13: the creation of a programthat waives parafscales for hard-to-employ groups. Fifteen
    firms, affiliated with two CCFs, created 162 jobs between September 2003 and May 2004
    through this law. The GOC has analyzed the factors behind the low results, attributing them to a
    conflict of interest in the execution of the program by CCFs (which lose revenues through the
    program), poor dissemination of information about the program, and the low value of the subsidy.
    To address these issues, the GOC: i s preparing a Decree to oblige the CCFs to fund the program;
    has designed a plan to disseminate information about the Article through the press, employer
    groups, worker groups, SENA, national events, etc; and has developed and budgeted an
    alternative program (PADE) that will allow for wage subsidies that are greater than the 9 percent
    guaranteed by this law and will be managed by the MSP rather than by an institution whose
    revenuesare directly affected.

    Articles 30-33: the expansion of the apprenticeship program. These articles are responsible for
    72,087 new apprenticeship contracts between September and December 2003 and another 60,970
    between January and June 2004; 12,710 of the latter group are graduates from private (rather than


                                                 30

         SENA) training programs. Part of this growth is due to the tripling of the number of firms that
         hire apprentices, between 2002 and 2004:'

         Articles 37 and 38: approval of private sector programs and dissemination and further regulation
         of a program that reimburses a portion of SENA-related parafiscales payments to firms that train
         their own workers. In2003-2004, 138 training programs were accredited by SENA, but none of
         those firms requested a reimbursement of parufiscules from SENA. SENA and the MSP intend
         to undertake an analysis to understand the reasons for the program results, but initial hypotheses
         include: the short period to implement the newest Decree (signed in December 2003); strict
         eligibility requirements that may exclude micro, small, and medium firms (87 percent of the firm
         population); a conflict of interest with the implementing agency (SENA) which i s responsible for
         certifying and transferring its own resources to its competition; and insufficient dissemination of
         information about the program.          The MSP and SENA will work together to identify the
         shortcomings in the program design and implementation to devise a strategy to generate the
         hoped-for results. Also, the CONPES 81 (July 2004), discussed below, re-assigns the function of
         accreditation of training programs to the MSP - this accreditation is a pre-requisite to
         participation in the program outlined by Article 38 - thus removing the potential conflict of
         interest under the current implementationarrangements.

    In December 2004, the Government, with the assistance of the Bank, will attempt to measure the
    impact of the Law up to that time. This evaluation will estimate the very short-term impacts of the
    law and allow for some immediate adjustments, if needed.

    Prior action 2.6: SENA reform:

    (i)Issuance of a CONPES establishing the policv framework and a Planof Action for a
    National Skills Formation Svstem which: (a) allows for more competition: and (b) separates the
    roles of regulation, accreditation, and actual service provision within said svstem. A CONPES
    document No. 81 for the job training strategy was approved on July 27, 2004. The CONPES: (a)
    defines a National Skills Formation System, including descriptions of the principles on which the
    system i s built and the sub-systems that need be constructed; (b) introduces competition into the
    system by mandating that SENA spend an increasing portion of the resources it receives from
    parufiscules to fund privately provided training services (70 percent by 2006), thus allowing the
    trainees to select their service providers; and (c) reallocates some of SENA's responsibilities to
    prevent a conflict of interest in the assignment of responsibilities by transferring responsibility for
    accreditation to the MSP and regulation to the MSPand MEN. Included inthe CONPES document i s
    a Plan of Action which presents specific actions to be taken, a time frame, and the institutions
    responsible for the correct implementationof the policies mandated by the CONPES.

    (ii) Evidence of implementation of the Plan of Action, including application of SENA's updated and
    integrated information systems for impact evaluation. managerial accounting, and iob search. The
    Bank (FIAS) is working with the DNP and SENA to develop the implementation of the Action Plan.
    A very detailed plan for the implementation of an upgraded information system was prepared in
    October 2003, and i s being implemented. Key results include: a managerial accounting system was
    purchased and staff are being trained to use it; a telephone data collection system, which i s intended
    to provide information for impact evaluations, was implemented in March 2004; and a job search
    information system was launched on the Internet in December 2003 which allows unemployed
    individuals andfirms searching for workers to register and findeach other.



52 Article34 allows for firms to "buy-off' their apprenticeship duties by paying into a fund usedto pay for SENA  .
entrepreneurshipprograms; 1,055 (of the 23,020) firms chose this option, paying a total of COP$28 billion. Articles
35 and 36 defined backgrounddirectives for the implementationof Articles 30 and 31.

Prior Action 2.7: Education coverage:

(i)Increase of basic and secondary enrollments by at least 500,000 additional students.
Enrollments increased by 734,413 students in basic and secondary schools (grades 0-11) between
2002 and 2004 (including the 477,598 enrolled in the PLaRSSAL I,2002-2003 school year). The
MEN continues to increase the enrollments, largely through the expansion of innovative service
delivery programs, and renewed efforts by the municipalities to enroll children, resulting from the
new financing systemthat transfers resourcesbasedon the number of enrolled children.

(ii) inthestudent-to-teacherratiobv1.5studentsbetween2002and2004. Thestudent-to-
     Increase
teacher goal has been met, increasing by 2.6 points to one teacher to every 29.3 students between
2002 and 2004 (1.6 points of the increasewere achieved in2002-2003).

Prior Action 2.8: Dissemination of education innovationsas evidenced by:

(i)Use of at leastone of the following methods: voucher, uostprimaria, EscuelaNueva, SAT,
Telesecundaria, Aceleracio'n del Aurendizaie, CAFAM or SER, in 200 municipalities between 2003-
2004. The alternative schemes were implemented in 146 municipalities in 12 departments in 2003,
benefiting 79,982 students and 211 municipalities in 15 departments in 2004, benefiting 88,685
additional children.

(ii) implementationofthedecreeregulatingLaw749,whichrecomizesequivalentdepreesand
    The
skills. The decrees (2566/03, 3678/03,2216/03, 34663/03) are passedand the MENimplemented the
decrees in the technical and technological institutions in order to recognize equivalent degrees.
Despite a large dissemination campaign and national workshops (in which 200 technical and
technological schools participated) to provide information on the program, participation was very
low, due to particularly stringent requirements. In response, the institutions are reorganizing their
programs in order to meet the requirements, the GOC i s providing training to the institutions to
prepare them for accreditation, and the GOC i s improving some of the regulations in the decree in
order to facilitate the process.

Prior Action 2.9: Further advances in the implementation of the education provisions of Law 715,
and others, as evidenced by:

(i)TheapplicationoftheremlatorvdecreeinaccordancewithLaw715,Article5,Section5.8
regarding the evaluation of teacher performance and testing of student learning achievement in
grade 9 covering competency in civics and science, in at least 90% of the municipalities.
Learning achievement testing of civics and science was applied in grades 5 and 9 in 91 percent of the
municipalities in Colombia. Civics exams were taken by 1,029,146 students and 987,908 took the
science exams (math and language were covered under the PLaRSSALI).        Teacher performance was
tested for 83,377 teachers and 7,692 administrators in all municipalities in the country, except for
those in Nariiio and Valle, which are on a different school academic schedule, and thus will be tested
at the end of their school years.

(ii) oftheincentiveandotherschemesforimprovingteacherperformance. Thepreparations
     Piloting
for a pilot incentive scheme are underway in the Department of Cundinamarca. As a first step, the
Cundinamarca Secretariat of Education analyzed the quality of teacher performance to identify those
areas where they were lagging. Second, it developed a plan for improving teacher performance by
identifying those incentives that would be provided and the implementation plan. The Ministry i s a
step behind Cundinamarca, having completed the analysis and a preliminary identification of
incentive schemes. Also, in several departments, with support from the Ministry, training programs
(some of which are tied to promotions) are being offered to improve teacher and administrator
performance.


                                                32

    (iii) Verification that at least 70% of the municipal staff in certified municipalities have been
    reorganized. Ninety-five percent of the municipalities have adopted plans for reorganization of staff;
    the implementation of the plans i s on-going.

    Prior Action 2.10: Progress in the promotion of transparency and social control of social programs,
    as shown by:

     (i) approvalof instrumentsrequiringregularimpactevaluationofsocialprograms. Article92
         GOC
    of the Organic Budget Law requires periodic impact evaluation of all Government programs. It has
    passed two of its four votes in Congress. The impact evaluations, which include social programs,
    would be financed through the program's own resources in order to not introduce fiscal rigidities to
    the budget. The year of the evaluation would be defined at the beginningof a new Administration,
    via the National Development Plan, thus giving the responsible entity adequate time to plan and carry
     out the evaluation.

     It i s important to note that, this Law i s the result of two initiatives supported by Sinergia - DNP's
    evaluation unit - in 2004. The first i s the development of a National Evaluation Policy, which was a
     direct response to a request by the President for regular impact evaluations, after Sinergia presented
     the Familias en Accibn impact evaluation to him. The second i s COJYPES No. 3294, passedJune 28,
     2004, that created an Evaluation Committee (Comite` Zntersectorial de Evaluacibn y Gestidn por
     Resultados), with representatives from the DNP, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Protection,
     the Presidency, and staff members in charge of evaluation in national sectoral programs. This
     Committee would be responsible for the definition of the pluri-annual agenda of impact evaluations,
     ensuringthat it would respond to the information needs to improvepolicy and fiscal decision-making
     processes ineach evaluated programor institution.

     (ii)  Evidence that the Bogotci Como Vamos?model is being applied in two national programs in
     accordance with agreed list to be provided bv the DNP. Sinergia has been working on several
     fronts to implement a national version of BogotB's successful citizen's oversight program. First,
     Sinergia produced reports evaluating all major education, MSP, and health programs and published
     them in hard copy, with dissemination through internet, mailing lists, and at local book fairs.53
     Second, respected citizens were contracted to review the reports and produce an independent
     assessment of the Government's performance; public dissemination of their final products will begin
     in September 2004. Third, the GOC is utilizing mass communication means to disseminate the
     evaluation findings and to generate discussion around them. On July 24, 2004, the President and his
     Cabinet hosted a day-long televised event in which each Minister presented hisher program -
     including information produced by Sinergia for each Ministry - followed by half hour question-
     answer sessions based on telephone calls from the public. Additionally, Sinergia i s working with the
     Ministry of Communications to carry out a pilot dissemination on a regional basis, using a national
     network of local radio stations; among the applicants, stations were selected that had strong
     connections to the community. Finally, the DNP and civil society have been working together to
     form a partnership that will strengthen civil society oversight of the dissemination of the evaluation
     results. Since early 2004, the DNP (Sinergia) and several civil society groups have been meeting to
     define such a partnership and the processesfor deeper collaboration.

114.       Other accomulishments. Inaddition to those actions defined inthe PLaRSSAL that advanced the
Government's reform agenda, there were other notable, unanticipated activities that were key to
advancing the reform. These were a result of the Government's desire to improve the outcomes of
already successful initiatives. These other accomplishments include:

                                                       33

   Despite recent legislation defining quality standards for insurance companies, the MSP decided to
        create even stricter quality standards. In 2004, a new regulatory decree was approved for ARSs
        and similar legislation has been prepared for EPSs, which i s under discussion in the President's
        office. The decrees establish tougher conditions for EPSs and, particularly ARSs (insurers of the
        Subsidized Regime) regarding financial requirements, capital levels and minimum number of
        affiliates, thus eliminating non-viable insurance entities from the market. The National Health
        Superintendency i s also carrying out inspections that have resulted in, among other actions, new
        regulations for Indigenas ARSs, which were found to have a very low number of indigenous
        affiliates, despite their mandateto insurethis population.

   The MSP has written legislation and is currently working to pass it through Congress, which would
        simplify the process for the transfer of resources from the federal government to the insurance
        companies. The streamlined process is expected to increase efficiency in the process, increase
        transparency, and decreasethe potential for cormption.

    An international conference on impact evaluation in Colombia during September 2-3, 2004, which
        showed the value, importance, and feasibility of impact evaluation under a tight fiscal context;
        and presented international lessons on the design, implementation, and institutionalization of
        periodic impact evaluation. It is anticipated that the Conference would increase the demand for
        impact evaluations.

    The MSP has identified new sources of funding to allow for the particularly rapid expansion of the
        Subsidized Regime. These include: recovery of taxes on lottery profits earmarked to health,
        reducing tax evasion, co-financing from municipalities, reallocation of supply-subsidies to
        insurance, transfers from the Treasury, and renewed access to FOSYGA.

    The DNP and DANE are working with the municipalities to collect the data for a new SISBEN,
        which i s the main targeting mechanism for social programs. Data have been collected in 85
        percent of the municipalities, and the remaining are expected to complete the process by the end
        of 2004.

    The MEN has made a concerted effort to ensure transparency and honesty in the new budget
        allocation scheme.       In addition to implementing an information system and training the
        municipalities on how to use it, they have hired private companies to audit the process, thus
        creating incentives for honest reportingand the proper allocation of funds.

B.      Changes inthe PLaRSSAL Program Since the Approval of PLaRSSAL I

115.    There have not been changes in the PLaRSSAL program since the approval of the first operation,
with the exception of one minor modification to Prior Action 2.2(i). The original trigger condition for
immunizations was a Triple Viral coverage rate of 95 percent and DPT and polio coverage rates of 90
percent. While the DPT and polio immunization rates were met, the Triple Viral coverage only reached
92.8 percent. The lesson i s that setting a target proportion i s risky, particularly in a situation like
Colombia, where the Government does not have access to certain parts of the country due to the conflict
and a Census has not been carried out since 1993 so there i s not a certainty of a good estimate of the
number of children in the country. Instead, it would have been more appropriate to set a target range,
particularly since a rate of 90 percent or greater i s sufficiently high to produce herd immunity. Thus, the
new prior action 2.2(i) reads as follows: "Achievement of coverage of 90-95 percent of DPT, Triple Viral,
and polio immunization for children age 0-1."

116.    While condition 2.9 (ii) "piloting of the incentive and other schemes for improving teacher
                                   -
performance" - was not changed in the matrix, an important lesson was learned. The design and
implementation of the pilot required more time than anticipated. The Government remains committed to


                                                       34

the pilot, as shown by their continued work in preparing background evaluation work to appropriately
design the schemes. The lesson i s that it is preferred to allow time for analysis and quality program
design, rather than quick implementation.

C.       Technical Assistance Loan (TAL)

117.     Duringthe preparation of the PLaRSSAL I, was suggestedto support the reform process via a
                                                      it
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL), which would provide resources for expertise to continue the
implementation of the reform agenda once the PLaRSSAL operation is closed. The Government and the
Bank have prepared a US$2.0 million TAL, which will support the MSP, the MEN, and the DNP in the
design and implementationof the next steps intheir social reform agenda.

118.     The TAL would be implemented after the PLaRSSAL i s disbursed to continue the Bank's support
to the GOC's efforts to implement wide-ranging and profound social reforms that build upon the reform
process supported by the PLaRSSAL. The TAL would focus on institutional development to enhance
capacity to define, implement, monitor and evaluate the reforms. Its main development objectives
include the improvement o f (a) the MSP's capacity to develop and implement a social protection network
to protect the poor and vulnerable, including improvements inthe policy development role of the Ministry
and in the coordination and implementation of programs by each of the entities within the Ministry; (b)
the capacity of the Ministry of Education to better implement new decentralization reforms; and (c) the
DNP's capacity for monitoringand evaluation of social programs.

119.     The specific activities that the TAL would support would enable the implementing agencies to
improve their performance by developing better regulatory decrees and other regulations, design
information systems and tools, and improve targeting and outcomes of the country's key social assistance,
health and education programs.        These technical tools, will be developed by each institution, in
collaboration with external consultants and experts, and are expected to be assimilated in the day-to-day
functioning of the reformed institutions. Additionally, it would permit DNP's Public Policy Evaluation
Unit (Sinergia) to undertake more key evaluation studies and learn from them, develop better monitoring
and evaluation instruments, and institutionalize impact evaluation.

D.       Fiscal Issues & Safeguard Policies

120.     Loan Amount and Disbursements. The two PLaRSSAL operations are proposed for a total of
$400million. The first ($200 million) was disbursed in one tranche in September 2003. The second was
originally $150 million, but due to debt management requirements and the exceptional progress in the
social reform program, the Government requested an increase in the loan amount by $50 million. The
notable reform efforts include: (i) greater progress than expected in the expansion of the health insurance
system for the poor; (ii)results orientated programming, including evaluation and re-design of new
programs not having intended effects; (iii)more stringent quality controls in the health sector; (iv)
improved information systems with audits; and (v) creation of a new benefit targeting system. The
increase in the PLaRSSAL loan amount will be offset by a decreasein another structural adjustment loan,
thus maintainingthe spendingwithin the CAS envelope.

 121.    The second operation in the program, for $200 million, would be in the form of a fixed-spread,
U.S. dollar-denominated loan, made to the Republic of Colombia. Disbursements under the proposed
loan would be made to an account (Deposit Account) of the Republic of Colombia, established at the
Banco de la Repu'blica for this purpose. The loan would be disbursed in one tranche upon Board
approval.     This tranche arrangement reflects the joint assessment of the necessary timing for
implementing the proposed conditions. The timing of the loan i s calibrated to support the government in
its efforts to continue the momentumof its social sector reform program.




                                                     35

122.    Financial Management. In June 2004, the Bank and the IDB jointly delivered a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Colombia, which evaluated the country's capacity and
performance with regard to public sector financial management. The CFAA identified some important
weaknesses in public financial management, but also points to some strengths and, especially, to many
significant efforts to improve the country's financial management institutions, procedures, and
performance. The government has provided comments on the report and final delivery i s expected by
September 2004.

123.    The Bank i s financing the implementation of the MAFPIIProject, which i s a joint effort by the
MHCP, the DNP, and DIAN (Direccidn de Impuestos y Aduanas Nucionales, Directorate of National
Taxes and Customs). Among its key objectives are the modernization of the public procurement process
(including legal reform), review and reform of the budget process, implementation of financial
management information systems, and support to government accounting. Moreover, the policy matrices
of the FIAL programmatic operations support the CFAA findings, specifically by including measures
designed to improve Colombia's public sector procurement and financial management practices over
time. At the level of investment projects, the Bank is supporting the Government's efforts to utilize the
Government's own systems and resources in managing project funds to a greater extent. Overall, the
country's institutions are considered to be sufficiently sound to manage Bank adjustment lending,
includingthis loan.

124.    A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was prepared in March 2001. The report
found that for Bank-financed projects, with few exceptions, procurement was carried out in accordance
with Bank policies and procedures, and procurement performance under these projects has generally been
satisfactory and free of major problems.           The CPAR found that public procurement and contract
management had deficiencies that needed to be addressedthrough capacity buildingand strengthening of
public procurement, in accordance with a plan that was discussed and agreed with the national authorities.
Such a plan would be the basis of an update of the CPAR that the Bank i s preparing for FY05 that is
likely to focus on e-procurement, regulatory body, capacity building, control systems, and would support
actions already taken by Government to reform the national procurement law towards modernizationand
addedtransparency inthe government public procurement.

125.     Fiscal Impact. The program i s within the CAS mandatedFY 2005 limit for lendingto Colombia.
The reform program i s intended to increase coverage and quality of social expenditures without
increasing the total budget envelope, through better allocationand use of resources.

126.     The fiscal cost to the GOC of implementing the reforms in the program is estimated to be
US$995.6 million over the period 2002-2006 (Annex V summarizes the costs, by sector), consisting of
transition costs and new annual                The transition costs, 64 percent of the total, are incurred only in
the short-run, andprimarily are due to the financing of the existing programwhile a new programis being
developed and piloted. Once the transition i s complete, the resources formerly spent on the old program
will fully fund the new program, with no net impact on the GOC's finances.             T h i s i s expected to be the
case for the transition from supply-side financing of public hospitals to the new insurance regimes
(Regimen Subsidiario and Regimen Contribuitivo) and the transition from SENA as the supplier of job
training services to SENA as the manager of a comprehensivejob training system with the private sector
playing a larger role inthe provision of training services. The remaining portion of the costs i s new fiscal
responsibilities that will continue indefinitely. These are high in the short run as the systems are


54 The cost estimates were derived separately for each "prior action" in the policy matrix, and then summed to give
the sector total. For each prior action, the estimates were based on: (i)the observed costs of on-going reforms -
such as the per unit costs of immunizations, student testing, nutritional supplements, Subsidized Regime, training
vouchers, severance pay, and training courses - and best guesses of the number of beneficiaries; (ii)    international
experience of such reforms (reform of the job training system and impact evaluation programs); or (iii) GOC  the
estimates (such as the hospital restructuring).


                                                         36

implemented, but the costs will stabilize at a lower level once the system i s in place. The reforms that
incur the new, annual, recurrent expenditures include the PAI, teacher performance evaluations, student
achievement testing, and impact evaluations of social programs. Although these expenses will appear in
government finances indefinitely, they will have positive rates of return due to the long-term impacts of
higher human capital and more efficient social programs.

127.     The fiscal costs to the reform program are an over-estimate, though, since they do not include the
financial savings of a more efficient social and labor program and the benefits accruing from a healthy,
more skilled, and socially active population. Thus, these financial costs should be interpreted as a short-
term investment liability with a long stream of benefits.

128.     Environmental and Other Safeguard Policies. As a structural adjustment program, the proposed
operation does not trigger OP 4.01, and, as a consequence, i s not subject to safeguard policies.

E.       Benefits

129.     Social Impact. The social impact i s anticipated to be positive and substantial. While important
results of the operation can already be measured, even greater gains are expected by the end of the
Administration due to structural changes being supported by the operation. The estimated benefits for
2006 remain the same as those presented in the PLaRSSAL Idocument, and are based on the
Government's targets for their administration. Key expected outcomes from the proposed operation by
2004 (Annex I),    and expected outcomes by 2006 include?5

         0        Increased employment bv 2004, reaching 350,000 new jobs created, above and beyond
                  those created through normal economic growth by 2006 due to the labor reform and the
                  SENAjob-matching information system;

         0        Increased number of graduates from publicly-funded iob training and a doubling of the
                  number of individuals benefiting from apprenticeship experiences due to changes in the
                  labor law;

         0        Increase the number of students trained bv SENA by 450,000 from its given resources
                  between 2002 and 2004, for a goal of 1 million additional spaces by 2006, due to
                   increased efficiency in the delivery of SENA courses through a reorganization of
                  teaching staff and a decrease in administrative staff;

         0         Increased access of poor children to ICBF nutrition services by 300,000 by 2004, and by
                   400,000 by the end of the Administration (2006), from a base of 78,000, due to the
                   increasedtargeting and efficiency gains through programevaluation and reform;

         0         90 percent coverage rates for DPT, polio, and Triple Viral vaccinations of 0-1 year olds
                   by 2004 and 95 percent (3.6 million new children) of 0-5 year olds with these vaccines by
                   2006 due to an adequate budget allocation, an aggressive vaccination agenda, and
                   immunization cards that offer an alternative means to identify children who have not
                   been ~accinated;~~




 55These impacts are a subset o f the outcomes from the PLaRSSAL since the loan also puts inplace processes, which
 are program outputs, but the impacts are difficult to quantify or will emerge over time. A description of these
 outputs are presentedin column four o f Annex I.
 56This is consistent with the CAS MDGtarget of 90% immunization rates of children age 0-5 by 2006.


                                                          37

        e       800,000 newly-affiliated poor peoule in the Subsidized (Health Insurance) Regime over
                the two Years of the operation, building on a base of 10.7 million affiliates in 2002, to
                reach three million additional affiliates by 2006, due to an allocation of additional
                resources to the Regime and a continued shift from a supply-side financed system of
                health care to a demand-side system, which i s financed through insurance; and

        e       Increase in net enrollments by 500,000 additional students between 2002 and 2004, from
                a base of 7.8 million, due to a reorganization of teaching staff, innovative methods for
                service delivery, a higher student to teacher ratio, and incentives to directors to increase
                enrollments.

130.    The 2006 targets were carefully estimated by the DNP during the preparation of their National
Development Plan 2002-2006. They were based on estimated expected growth rates and assumptions
about how the Colombian economy, world economy, Colombian peace situation, political arena, and all
other factors would behave over the period of the Uribe Administration. Thus far, the expectations are
generally on target, so the assumptions behind these numbers are still reasonable. While the 2006
outcomes are expected to occur under stable assumptions, they may not be met ifunexpected events occur
(see discussion of the possible influence of the other determinants on performance, in the "Risks" section
below).

131.    Povertv Impact. The expected social impacts of the program have clear poverty implications
since most constitute investments in the future productivity of low-income individuals. The increase in
the quantity of education and job training will increase the opportunities for all Colombians to earn the
highrates of returnthat elude the less educatedwhile the higher quality of education andjob training will
be rewarded not only by even higher rates of return, but also by the positive non-monetary benefits
associated with education, such as: longevity, decreased risk of poverty, healthier children, etc. The
expanded immunization program would reduce mortality and illness among poor children, while the other
health measures, particularly the expansion of the Subsidized Regime and the licensing of service and
insurance providers, are expected to protect precious human capital and alleviate the financial
consequences of health risks. Moreover, the poor would receive a greater share of the ICBF and SENA
benefits as a consequence of better targeting and greater efficiency of social assistance programs (e.g.
ICBF). Finally, the poor would benefit from the implementation of Law 789, which modifies many
aspects of the labor contract (firing regulations, payment for overtime, diurnal and nocturnal time, etc.)
and should allow the labor market to function more smoothly and thus generate more employment
opportunities. The law also establishes the spirit of improving labor market conditions for the poor,
which i s the root of the development of other active labor market programs focused on hard-to-employ
groups, most notably the wage subsidy pilot program.

F.      Risks

132.    The proposed program carries varied risks, although overall, risk appears manageable. The risks
can be classified into two categories: general risks, which depend on economic and political management,
and labor and social specific risks, which accrue to the management of the labor and social reform
programsupported by this operation.

133.    General Risks. The general risks include internal, fiscal, and exogenous economic shocks that
would have implications for the labor and social reformprogram.

134.    Zntemal Risks.     The overall political context, including the internal conflict and violence
associated with illegal drug activity, has improved, but it still could negatively impact the continued
implementation of the program. Although Colombia, with international support, is deeply committed to
ending the violence that has plagued the country for decades and is supported by the international
community, the conflict could intensify and thus demand increased attention and resources from the

Government. The Bank's overall country strategy supports the development of a stronger foundation for
peace and encourages reforms that will help liberate resources to address the transition to a post-conflict
situation.

135.     A second internal risk is the electoral situation. The President is supporting a Constitutional
amendment, which would allow for a second term. The effort to pass the amendment, and, if passed,
campaign for re-election may affect the pace of the labor and social reforms, particularly those that create
losers in the short-run. Also, the 2006 elections may give Congress the incentive to be more populist,
thus hindering the forward progress of the same reforms. The former risk appears moderate since the
President has demonstrated his commitment to job creation and social protection since he arrived in
office. As for the latter, much of the hard work for Congress has been done, as the laws have been
passed. Implementation i s the responsibility of the Ministries, so the risk i s minimal. If re-election i s
denied or President Uribe does not win the next election, there is a risk that some of the newer reforms,
which have not hadtime to become entrenched, could be reversed.

136.     Fiscal Situation. Since the October 2003 Referendum was not approved, there i s some risk of
fiscal accounts worsening in the near future. However, the Government i s actively managing the risk.
First, the IMFrecently supervised implementation of their stand-by agreement with the government and
found that most of the indicators and actions were on track, with over-achievement in some of them.
Second, the government i s proceeding with its "plan B" to address the failure of the referendum (and the
failure to meet the IMF fiscal deficit target), which includes several measures in the areas of general
functioning of the budgetary process, pensions, regional transfers, revenues and government staff
adjustments. The proposal to reform the Estututo Orga`nico del Presupuesto (Budget Statute, which
defines how the budget i s generally allocated) is proceeding through Congress and the other bills are
being drafted according to the schedule agreed with the IMF.

137.     Economic shocks. Through external or internal shocks, the fiscal situation may deteriorate,
jeopardizing the macroeconomic situation. Greater volatility and negative shocks inexternal markets will
increase the social protection burden. Since the mid-l990s, Colombia has been more susceptible to
regional (Brazil devaluation, Argentina default) and global (Russian crisis, East Asian Crisis) shocks than
ever before. The political and economic conflicts in the region are still present, therefore there i s the risk
of contagion to Colombia's markets. The various fiscal, pension, financial and institutional reforms
supported by the IMF,the Bank and the IDB are expected to mitigate the consequencesof these risks.

 138.    Specific Risks. The specific risks to the labor and social reform include: the complexity of the
reform process, legislation that requires a short-term re-evaluation of the labor law, special interest group
blockage of reforms, the financing of the health reform, and sustainability of the reform process.

 139.    Comulexih, of the Reform Process.         The reform program i s ambitious and requires deep
institutional reforms in many sectors. Major structural changes are required in the Ministries of Labor
and Health, which have been consolidated into a single new Ministry that i s responsible for overseeing
and coordinating all social protection, health and labor policies, regulations, and programs;
decentralization of health responsibilities via Law 715/01; and the enactment of the labor reform (Law
789 of December 2002), which requires deep changes in SENA and new responsibilitiesfor the MSP and
the CCF. Law 715/01 is also requiring profound changes in the MEN as they decentralize their
responsibilities. Ifproperly implemented, these reforms are expected to produce significant and sustained
improvements in the social protection system, better health and education services, more effective worker
training, and increased employment. While the DNPand Ministries have demonstrated an ability to plan
 and manage such a reform, it remains to be seen if they can complete the reform. The GOC recognizes
the risk in the complexity of the program and the great demands on the staff, and thus has requested a
TAL from the Bank to hire consultants to train staff and jointly develop and implement the reform
programs. Furthermore, institution building i s anticipated in the preparation and implementation of the
 Bank's Human Capital I1loan, expected to be presentedto the Board in the last quarter of FY05.


                                                     39

140.     Labor Reform. Although Congress passed the Labor Reform Law and prepared the regulating
decrees, political skill and honest impact evaluation are necessary to minimize the risk that they will not
be sustained. Articles 45 and 46 of Law 789 create a Commission to evaluate the impact of the reform in
December 2004.57 If the Commission finds that certain provisions have had negative or null effects on
formal employment generation, the Government may prepare and present to Congress a bill modifying or
reversing those articles.

141.     The risk of reversal of the labor reform appears to be moderate. First, even in the very short-run
there i s evidence that the reform i s meeting many of its objectives and the Government i s acting upon
those aspects in which progress has been slow, by writing new decrees and developing new programs.
Second, the nature of Article 46 i s to further the reform process by fostering discussion on improvements
in provisions, which will only strengthen the reform efforts.          Third, any recommendations by the
Commission to modify the Law require nearly two years of legal processes. Fourth, the Government
leads the Commission and is equipped with the technical capacity to generate reliable information and
guide the discussions toward an improvement of the Law.

142.     There i s great scope for the Government and the Bank to work together, not only to mitigate the
riskinvolved inthe evaluation of the reform, but to turnit into an opportunity. Continuous Bank support
of the Government's efforts will ensure persistent progress in the implementation of key regulations
included in the reform and early detection and correction of ineffective regulation. Also, the Bank is
preparing an evaluation to provide unbiased information on the impact of the reform before the
Commission starts working, and recommendations for improvement.

143.     Svecial Interest Grouvs. While there i s always a danger that those who benefit from existing
inefficiencieswill block change, this i s particularly risky inthe reform of the ICBF, SENA, and municipal
education and health programs. All have entrenched staff and constituencies that, in the case of SENA,
were successful in reversing a politically mandated reform process in the early 1990s. As a result, the
GOC is proceeding with a gradual approach that includes building popular support for the reforms, a
strategy for how to work with the special interest groups, and a thoughtful ordering of the reforms to
create a momentum. In terms of generating popular support for reforms, the ICBF, SENA, and the MEN
are upgrading their M&Esystems and undertaking impact evaluations of several programs. They are also
experimenting with alternative service delivery models, most notably the Jdvenes en Accidn (which was
recently extended to rural areas) and nonstandard education delivery methods.                The results of
performance and impact evaluations are important components of the strategy to demonstrate to
constituents which programs are worth eliminating, which staff or facilities are under-performingand can
be improved (in the case of the education or health sectors), and what alternatives would be offered if
these staff were dismissed or facilitiedprograms were closed. Finally, non-threatening reform actions are
already underway. This includes the accreditation and licensing of private sector training firms, which
may one day take over some service delivery from SENA, the conversion of SENA staff to sub-
contracted workers, and teacher testing.

144.     Financing the Health Reform. The transformation from a supply-financed to a demand-financed
health care system is a complex financial process, which i s already incurring very highcosts (8 percent of
GDP58,only surpassed by a few other countries in the world). Simply cutting off subsidies to public
hospitals is not politically feasible (as discussed above) nor practical, since it will take time for the
hospitals to shift their operating procedures to those required under a demand-based health care system.
Already, the Superintendency in the MSPreports that resources are not flowing as expected from the state
coffers to municipal governments, from municipal governments to ARS, or from ARS to hospitals. This
leads to two risks to the reform. First, hospitals continue to rely on supply-side financing to compensate

for unpaid ARS bills, thus slowing down the transformation. Second, some political observers have been
very vocal about their concerns with the quality of the financing system in terms of its adequacy to track
cash-flows, a lack of transparency in the financial system, and the ability of the country to fund two
systems that are both in transition. To lower the threat to the reform process, the system needs: (a) tight
fiscal monitoring to ensure that resources to fund the system are being collected and fully reallocated to
the new system; (b) further development of financial processesat all parts of the resource chain; and (c) a
better understanding of the amount of resources owed at each phase of the resource chain. Already, the
Superintendency i s stepping up the effort to collect more resourcesand to track the flow, and the Ministry
i s sponsoring legislation to simplify the resource flow process. The IDB's recent Health Restructuring
Loan will assist in improving the internal financial processes within hospitals and the upcoming Bank
Health Investment Loan will also assist the Ministry in its simplification process, strengthen the
Superintendency in its efforts to control the financial process, and help the hospitals to utilize said process
inorder to efficiently proceed with the reforms.

145.     Sustuinubilitv of Reforms. The reform process i s a long-term strategy, which incurs short-run
costs, but will not show returns for several years, which threatens the sustainability of reforms. In
addition to the financing issues, some cite the ten years of the health reform as evidence that there should
be a return to the old health delivery system of supply-driven financing of hospitals, no accreditation, and
high inefficiency. The costly impact evaluations to design programs and institutional functions of the
ICBF, the RAS, and SENA (upcoming) are cited by some as a too costly investment, which would
impede the reform process. The reorganization of teaching staff i s a costly process, but i s expected to
lead to long-run benefits. The risks that the short-term costs will lead to a slow-down or reversal of the
reforms are moderate since the current administration i s willing to persist with the reforms in spite of
public pressureand has skillfully continued with the reform process in a period where the benefits are not
yet evident. However, it is crucial that this Administration will institutionalize the reform process to the
extent that it will not be possible to easily reverse it or focus on disseminating the successes in the
reforms, thus requiring a rapidly implemented agenda, constant evaluation of the reform process to
identify the strategies that are not working and correct them early on, and civil oversight to disseminate
the messages of the reform.       The Bank and the IDB are supporting the Government's evaluation
initiatives and efforts to disseminate the successes, via joint studies (in the labor, health, and training
sectors), conferences and workshops, the development of the civil oversight model, partly financed
through the TAL, and the strategic development of the process for the MSP's reform process, partly
financed through the TAL. The institutionalization of new programs will also prevent its reversal if a less
reform-friendly Government takes power in the next election. The institutionalization of the health
reforms i s being addressedthrough the IDB health operations and the upcoming Bank health investment
operation, programmed for FY05, while the Human Capital I1operation, also programmed for FY05, i s
expectedto aid inthe implementationof the MSP's strategy.

                                 Annex 111:Social Issuesand Challenges

T h i s annex presents in greater detail the social issues and challenges discussed in Chapters Iand I1of the
main text of the Program Document, starting with concerns regarding the need to develop the skills and
knowledge of Colombian workers to be competitive in a global economy that i s rapidly changing
technologically.

Job Training Issues

Formal and informal (on-the-job) vocational training are two of the primary sources of labor market
skills, which lead to higher wages for workers and greater productivity for firms. Formaljob training in
Colombia occurs through three primary channels: public training programs, private training programs,
and firms.     Firms pay a tax to the federal government that is earmarked to fund the public training
programs; the benefits of these taxes are returned to the firms and the workers through publicly-provided
human capital accumulation activities, primarily through SENA.6' Although SENA services are enjoyed
by one million workers each year (approximately 20 percent of all job training), the existing vocational
training system, including both public and private entities, faces several shortcomings:

           The skill level of Colombian workers: a constraint to productivity. Half of the employers in
      Colombia believe that the work force is not sufficiently trained. Colombia's increased integration in
      the global economy demands higher skill levels of its workers.62 However, there i s a shortage of
      skilled workers who complement modern production methodologies, as evidenced by the rapid
      increasein the wages of highly-skilled workers and by firmperception surveys.63

          Mismatch between publicly-provided training courses and skill demands. Publicly-provided
      training could better meet the skill demands of the market in various ways. First, course offerings
      could match the skill needs in the modern Colombian economy. For example, SENA's market
      analysis that i s used to select the menu of vocational training course offerings is based on historical
      data, thus reflecting past trends rather than current and future needs of the market. Second, the
      provision of up-to-the-minute vocational training programs i s costly. Skill demands are rapidly
      changing and the technology used in the most lucrative fields i s expensive and quickly evolving.
      Since vocational training must be up-to-date, frequent investments in hardware and software are
      necessary since many specific production methods are obsolete after only a few years. Third,public
      training courses do not consider differential skill demands across Colombia. The types of courses
      offered are largely standardized across the country, which eases course development at the central
      level, but does not meet the local needs of workers or firms. These shortcomings are symptomatic of
      the limited communicationof the needs of firms and workers on one side andthe course offerings and
      curriculum on the other side.

           Financial ineficiencies in public training programs. Current public training programs do not use
      allocated resources efficiently. First, basing budget allocations on historical rather than future
      training demands necessarily leads to a misallocation of resources as new initiatives are under-funded
      while outdatedprograms are well funded. Second, funding based on historical data does not allow for




61SENA, Colombia's largest public training program, was developed in 1964 and designed for a closed economy
that was mostly comprised of agriculture or manufacturing jobs, slow to technological change, and relatively
homogenous. SENA was overhauled in 1991, but it, and public training programs in general, still do not realize
their full potential.

    targeting of specific populations as economic or social situations change. Third, the per student cost
    of public sector training i s higher than private training programs in Colombia.64

         Need to utilize private training programs more. Training by the private sector leads to higher
    rates of return than training by the public sector. The rate of return to training in private institutions is
    greater than that of SENA and other public training courses, which have begun to show low, or even
    negative, returns in recent ~ e a r s . 6The challenge for the GOC is how to take advantage of efficient
                                              ~
    privateproviders to deliver publicly-financed training programs.

         Poor targeting of training programs. Approximately 20 percent of each income quintile has
    taken training courses, with the exception of the top wealth quintile, where 15 percent have taken
    training.    Private training programs tend to attract higher-skilled students from higher income
    quintiles. While public training programs attract a larger number of low-skilled workers, the typical
    student i s 24 years old, more than half have completed secondary school, and 50 percent are from
    families in the top 40 percent of the income distribution - thus missing youth, the poor, and the
    unskilledwho arethe most vulnerable to


    0    Informality of mostjob matching. Training programs are numerous, but information asymmetries
    are prohibitive to job search.          Most jobs are obtained through informal networks, which are
    particularly weak for the young, women, and internally-displaced populations who tendto be less tied
    to their local labor market.67

Overall, a comprehensive skills development strategy i s lacking. Instead, many entities -both public
and private -offer similar service with the associated inefficiencies in financing, service delivery, and
outputs.

Social Protection inan Era of Uncertainty

The administration appropriately considers social protection as a wider concept thanjust social assistance
and envisions the role of the MSP as the efficient and equitable management of all social risks and their
consequences.       Moreover, the optimal management of these risks, which include ill health,
unemployment, declining real wages, and dropping out of school, requires a range of policy actions to
prevent, mitigate, and cope with risk. With this more expansive definition of social risk management, its
implementation i s a challenging task.           Nevertheless, the development of an integrated social risk
managementsystemi s integral to better social protection.

Needfor a uniJied social protection strategy. There are many social protection programs in Colombia.
The main problem is that they do not form one comprehensive and coherent social risk management
system. Instead, they have emerged in an ad hoc manner, leading to duplication of programs, poor
targeting of services, competing incentives, and general inefficiency. Organizing and focusing the
programs are necessary to improve social protection services, particularly given the fiscally-constrained
environment.

Whether the risk i s losing one's health, job, or watching one's real wages erode, the mechanisms to
address these risks are highly inter-connected. The result of treating the labor, health, and social safety

net programs as independent from each other, as Colombia has done until recently, i s competing
incentives and less efficient programs. For example, payroll taxes (parafiscales) that are used to finance
social assistance that do not directly benefit the workers can lead to lower employment. Laws that impose
high minimumwages and disproportionate pensionbenefitsto protect workers from exploitation can lead
to job loss, difficult entry to the labor market (due to a decrease in labor demand), and discouragement
among unskilledlabor. Thus, there i s a need to develop an integrated system for managing these social
risks and their solutions.

For this reason, the Ministry of Social Protection was created by law and its transformation into reality
has now become a practical challenge for the GOC. The new Ministry must: (i)      consolidate the numerous
health, labor, and social programs under one umbrella; (ii)      bring under its purview semi-independent
institutions that have been operating with little central control for decades (ICBF, SENA); (iii)   develop a
risk management strategy that encompasses the different institutions and programs; and (iv) coordinate
the development of institution-specific strategies so they are inline with the overall strategy of the MSP.

Counter-cyclical social protection expenditures. The urgent need for an effective and efficient social
protection system was apparent during the 1996-1999 recession. Emergency measures were instituted
during the recession, but given the increased volatility of the Colombian economy due to external and
internal pressures, it is necessary to develop a system that can respond to negative economic shocks
efficiently and opportunely. The construction of such a system under the present constrained fiscal
conditions requires focus on increased efficiency and wise use of resources, although a Bank report68has
pointed out that the country i s under-spending in social assistance.

Colombia lacks an effective system for protecting the poor and most vulnerable during a crisis and for
addressing the needs of the chronically poor during normal times. Since most social insurance and
assistance programs are financed by payroll contributions (parafiscales), expenditures are highly pro-
cyclical. For instance, the budget of the ICBF declined by over ten percent during the recession of 1999
(a much larger decline than GDP), due to the large increase in unemployment to about 20 percent of the
labor force. Furthermore, the system largely serves those who are formally recognized as workers, thus
excluding those segments of the population that are potentially most at-risk -informal sector workers
and their families, elderly, children, displaced people, and women (who tend to have intermittent labor
force participation). A Social Protection Program (Red de Apoyo Social) was created to cope with the
recession, but the remainingchallenge i s how to institutionalizethe safety nets.

ICBF: InvestinginYoung Children

One of the most vulnerable groups in Colombia is pre-school children younger than seven years of age
belonging to the poorest    fa mi lie^.^'Since 1988, this population group has been partially covered by the
ICBF mostly through Madres Comunitarias (MC) caregivers at Hogares Comunitarios de Bienestar
(community childcare centers, HCB). In 2002, the ICBF was the main government instrument to provide
services for early childhood development and its major programs benefited nearly 950,000 children under
the age of seven (85 percent of whom attended more than 64,000 HCBs). Similarly, more than 2.3
million school children received food supplements on a regular basis. Although these programs achieved
considerable coverage (nearly 100 percent of municipalities), and the number of beneficiary children is
significant, several structural problems limit their impact:

     0   Lack of strategicfocus and prioritization. Historically, the ICBF structure has been reformed in
     an incremental way. As a result, the Institute currently offers dozens of service modalities and

   interventions without policy focus, a clear strategy, or population-group prioritization. Also, the lack
   of an impact evaluation or a cost-effectiveness analysis of ICBF's programs has prevented
   Government and the ICBFfrom makingdecisions about groups to be targeted, programs to continued
   or terminated, and policies to be enforced.

   0    Financing. The ICBF, which has had a budget of about $400 million annually, funded by a three
   percent payroll tax, i s facing a tightening financial situation produced by two developments. First,
   there was a reduction of its budget by more than ten percent in real terms between 1998 and 200270
   due to the economic recession. Second, to promote employment, the labor reform exempts employers
   from paying the payroll tax for certain classes of poor and disadvantaged workers; consequently,
   ICBF funds from payroll taxes will likely be lower than historical levels. This financial situation
   gives urgency to the needfor more focus and efficiency inthe use of ICBF's resources.

   0    Lack of targeting. The targeting scheme, based on open access with self-selection and implicit
   geographical targeting, i s limited. Duringthe 1990s, the increased coverage achieved by HCBs and
   other modalities was concentrated on children from families belonging to the 2ndincome quintiles and

   than 130,000 (i.e. more than 12 percent), while beneficiaries from direct food supplements (children
   of school age) decreasedby more than 270,000 (Le., more than ten percent) (Table 3).

    0   Local control. The strongly centralized system, grounded in administrative deconcentration (i.e.,
   ICBF's field offices directly depend on central headquarters with little relationship with local

    on a formal labor contract thus leading them to sometimes act as "unions" and demand a more formal
    relationship with the ICBF, which constitutes a latent risk for service provision.

Health ReformIssues

The healthreform of 1993 (Law 100/93), amendedrecently by Law 715/02, calls for a transformation of
health services financing and basic services provision. The Uribe administration faces the continuing
challenge of completing the implementation of the envisioned health system reform, which seeks to
separate health care finance from provision of services. In addition, the administration needs to ensure
that it will achieve close to universal immunization of children at the end of its term.

Recovering progress towards universal vaccination. One of the most important public health issues in
Colombia i s the need to strengthen the country's system of protection against communicable diseases. In
the past, Colombia was a leader in prevention activities, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) established
the Expanded Program of Immunization (Programa Ampliado de Znmunizaciones, PAI) as a national
priority. In 1995, Colombia achieved coverage levels of 90 percent or more for all routine vaccines.
However, between 1997 to 2002, coverage levels for all vaccines declined to below 80 percent. Both
financial and institutional factors were the underlying causes for the decline in the performance of the
vaccination program. Inadequate funding for the vaccination effort has resulted in shortages in personnel
and supplies. At the same time, there was a lack of clarity regarding which entity was responsible
(national or territorial) for the implementation of the vaccination program. Since 2001, funds have been
made available to begin to address the problem, and further budget space is sought for future budget years
to regain the high vaccination,rates by 2006. Considerable improvement on immunization rates at the
national level has been achieved during 2003, as a result of the aggressive effort made by the MSP to
improvethe situation since September 2002.

An important issue in establishing correct vaccination coverage rates is the number of children that need
to be vaccinated (denominators). At the national level, this number is established by the National
Statistical Department (DANE) using projections of the 1993 Census. However, empirical evidence from
household surveys carried out in some selected municipalities in Colombia by the MSP and National
Institute of Health (Znstituto Nacional de Salud, INS) shows that the target number of children is
overestimated in some municipalities and underestimated in others, while the national figures suggest an
overestimate of the number of children and thus under-estimated vaccination statistics. The task of
estimating the correct target number of children i s particularly difficult due to the violent conflict and
corresponding migration. The GOC has committed to carry out a new Census in 2005 to address, among
other issues, vaccination target numbers.

Lack of health insurance coveragefor the poor. The health reform calls for a system where the health
care subsidy i s used to finance health insurance coverage for the poor and away from supply subsidies
where hospitals receive public resources based on historical budgets and not in accordance to the level of
output generated. In this scheme, the patient has the freedom to select medical services and payment to
providers will made by the insurers (EPSs and A R S S ) . ~The subsidy to the insurers is provided in
                                                                    ~



72 An evaluation carried out in 1997 showed that only ten percent of HCBs were able to provide children a proper
food supplement (in terms of protein, calories, etc.) using Parents Association's food supply (ICBF. Evaluacio'n de
Impact0 de 10s Hogares Comunitarios de Bienestar, 1997).
73Empresas Promotoras de Salud or EPSs are the insurance entities of the Contributory Regime; Administradoras

accordance with a predeterminedrisk adjusted premiumcalledthe UPC (Unidad de Pagopor Capitacidn,
UPC).

Through 2003, implementation of the transformation moved very slowly due to political pressure to
continue financing public hospitals through supply subsidies. This created a vicious circle since increased
affiliation of the poor to the subsidized health insurance regime was limiteddue to lack of funds, which in
turn were tied to direct hospital subsidies and to the Solidarity account of FOSYGA whose funds for the
extension of coverage of the Subsidized Regime were frozen by the Ministry of Finance to be used as
reserves, despite the fact that the resources were earmarked for health and came from contributions of
those inthe Contributory Regime.

The need to improve the eficiency of public hospitals. Public hospitals, in general, are highly inefficient.
They cost more than private providers and the quality of services i s not better. To improve the efficiency
of public hospitals, the health reform law (Law 100/93) mandates financing operations through the sale of
services to EPSs and ARSs -in competition with private providers. Duringthe transition period, public
hospitals are responsible for the delivery of health care services to poor individuals that have'yet to
affiliate to the ARS. Moreover, public hospitals continue to receive their budgets from the regional
entities (Departamentos), based on the previous year's expenditures, and expect to be bailed out when
they runinto deficits. From 1996to 1999, a total of COP $46,500 million (in 2000 pesos) was transferred
to public hospitals through supply subsidies. These resources represented 51.4 percent of the total
available resources of FOSYGA, the health care sector fund, for the year 2000.~~This type of scheme
does not provide any incentives to public hospitals to reduce costs and/or provide better services.
Breaking out of this vicious circle i s a significant challenge that requires the development of incentives
and the capacity to compete with private providers.

.Needfor client-orientedhealth information system. Public information is a key factor to support the main
principles of the managedcompetition health care systemenvisionedby the health reform law. Under the
system, individuals have the ability to choose their insurer and health care provider (among the network
of providers offered by their insurer). They should also be empowered with appropriate and timely
information to be able to make informed choices. In practice, health care consumers frequently do not
have the information that would allow them to compare different insurers and providers. This is an
important issue since the Colombian system i s basedon quality rather than price ~ompetition.~~

EducationIssues

The Closing the Gap in Education and Technology report (World Bank, 2003) demonstrates that the
interaction between education, job training, and technology i s key for economic growth, suggesting that
Colombia cannot benefit from the technological innovations in the world today if skilled labor to
complement this technology i s not available. Unfortunately, like many other Latin American countries,
the report shows that Colombia lags behindits East Asian competitors in education coverage and quality,
despite the fact that it spends more on education as apercentage of GDP.

The relatively low skills of the labor force and the small marginal gains to educational investments may
be responsible for a "low level technology trap" where the lack of labor discourages investment in
technology, thus limiting economic growth. To break out of the low-level trap, Colombia needs to
increase its secondary education coverage, raise school quality at all levels, and improve complementary
skill training programs to encourage investment in technology and to better benefit from technological
progress. This is a particular challenge since increases in education spending in Colombia seem to have

had little impact on attendance rates or quality. Fundamentally, this means that the GOC has to increase
the efficiency by which existing public resources allocated to education and training are being used.

Colombia lags behind other comparable countries in education coverage and quality, specifically with
lags in secondary education coverage and in student learning a~hievement.~~                   The private returns to
education are high and increa~ing.~~Given the already relatively high percentage of GDP allocated to
education:8   the fundamental challenge is to achieve educational improvements through more effective
and efficient use of existing educational resources.

Coverage, illiteracy, and educational attainment. In general, the GOC recognizes the need to address the
lack of universal basic education coverage and to improve the quality and efficiency of the education
system. While the gross enrollment rate at the primary level was over 100 percent in 2001, the net
primary enrollment rate was only 82.4 percent, down from 84.2 percent in 1999. The net secondary
enrollment rate was only 63.4 percent and only 15.4 percent inhighereducation. Enrollment rates among
children 7-11years of age are high, at 94 percent (slightly higher for females, 95 percent, than for males,
93 percent). However, for 12-17 year-olds, enrollment rates are only 75 percent and have not changed
muchover the last four years.

Worrisome level of promotion rates. While overall promotion rates have been increasing over time, the
transition from first to second grade i s only 72.5 percent. Inurban areas, the promotion rate is almost 86
percent, while in rural areas, it i s only 56 percent. Promotion rates actually declined from 1997-1998 to
1998-1999. Although the rates improved in subsequent years, by that time, repetition and dropout took
their toll. The first grade repetition rate was 9.7 percent in 1999, up from 8.7 percent in 1998. Inrural
areas, the repetition rate was 13 percent, versus seven percent inurban schools. In 1998, the dropout rate
in the first grade was almost 18 percent (19 percent inpublic schools, 13 percent in private schools, eight
percent in urban areas and 31percent inrural schools).

The average level of education continues to increase for the adult population, from 6.7 years in 1996 to
7.4 years in 2001, an 11percent increase. Unfortunately, seven years of schooling compares unfavorably
to more advanced countries, transition countries, and many countries with lower levels of GDP in Latin
America.79 For age 15 and above, average years of education in Colombia i s only 5.3 years, compared to
Argentina with 8.8 years, Panamawith 8.6, and Chile, Peru and Uruguay with 7.6.

Educational equity remains an important issue, although the equity between men and women is
noteworthy. Inregional capitals, the average level of schooling i s 8.4 years, but only 4.6 years in the rest
of the country. Moreover, while the illiteracy rate is only 4.5 percent in regional capitals, it reaches 16
percent inthe rest of the country.

Low quality of education. National achievement test results indicate that quality is decreasing, the quality
of private schools i s better than public schools, and the difference i s widening. The percentage of schools
with low achievement has increased from 30 percent in the 1980s to 50 percent in the 1990s. Of the 186
schools in 1998 in the top decile of the test, 94 percent were private schools. A majority of students in

77The overall rate of return has increased over time, from eight percent in 1982 to over 11percent in 2000. The
returnsto primary education, estimated at 8.6 percent for 2000, have been increasing over time (from 7.4 percent in
1982), while the returns to secondary education have fallen from 8.5 percent in 1982 to 7.7 percent (or five percent
''
according to an alternative analysis); but the highest returns are for tertiary education, estimated to be more than 18
percent per year - this estimate is high from an historical perspective (up from 9 percent in 1982) and a comparative
 erspective (returns to higher education range from 11to 22 percent in some Latin American countries).
  This is reflectedinthe fact that education spending accounts for 4.1 percent of GDP-up from 3.6 percent in 1995
-which comparesto an OECD average of five percent and very similarto average spending by middle-income
countries (Argentina, 4.5 percent; Chile, 4.2 percent; and Mexico, 4.4 percent).

primary schools have an academic level below that of their age level. The performance of Colombian
students on the recent UNESCO/OREALC assessment was broadly on par with their counterparts in
Brazil and Mexico, and in a median position when compared with other countries in the region. Also,
relative to other countries, Colombian education i s much better in rural areas, mainly in math, due in part
to the success of the Escuelu Nueva model.           However, when comparing mathematics scores with
countries outside the region, the standards of the region are considerably low. Colombia participated in
TIMSS (ThirdIntemational Math and Science Study) in 1995 and ranked second to last of 40 countries
participating in math. Reading results are not much better. Colombia also scored near the bottom in
PIRLS (Progress in Intemational Reading Literacy Study) in 2001. The reasons for low education quality
can be summarized as: poor quality of teachers, inadequate pedagogical supervision, need for curriculum
reform, poor quality of school environment, ineffective assessment system, and teacher absenteeism.

ZnefJicient resource use. Schools in Colombia are inefficient in both the production of quality services
(measured by outcomes such as test scores) and quantity (number of students). Public schools produce
lower scores than private schools, even after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Teachers'
education and infrastructure positively affect scores in private schools, but not in public schools,
suggesting inefficiencies inpublic education. Policy variables at the municipal levels do not influence the
efficiency of schools. After controlling for other factors, rural schools are, on average, more efficient
than urban schools. But the largest differences exist between private and public schools. Public schools
are, on average, five percent less efficient than private schools and public school teachers earn 15 percent
more than comparable private school teachers. Therefore, much can be gained by increasing efficiency in
public schools.

Transparency and Social Control

The GOC recently estimated that the cost of corruption in Colombia reached as high as US$2.24 billion,
equivalent to 80 percent of the fiscal deficit or 2.6 percent of GDP in year 2001.80 This high level of
corruption is believed to have contributed to low levels of investment (12.3 percent of GDP) and hence to
a sub-optimal rate of growth, a high unemployment rate, and ultimately inefficient use of resources.

The Office of the President of the Republic recently conducted a survey, with support from the Bank,
showing that the public believes that interest groups, through corrupt practices, influence high-level
government decisions. It also revealed linkages between inefficient (or questionable) use of national
resources and the weakness of monitoring and evaluation, transparency, intemal controls, and autonomy
at the institutional level. While not all public perceptions of corruption can be substantiated, it i s clear
that a significant degree of inefficiency and misallocation of resources exists. Furthermore, the general
public, especially the poor, do not have adequate access to information regarding resource allocation
criteria, the decision-making process, or service coverage and service quality. Mechanisms to feed their
concerns and interests back to the system are also weak. As a result, public services provision suffers
both interms of coverage and quality.

In addition, in spite of Colombia's decentralized political, administrative, and financial systems, it is
believed that the degree of inefficiency and inequity remains at a high level, and that social spending is
not adequately targeted.     For example, although poverty-oriented programs are targeted using the
SISBEN, there have been very few cases of systematic attempts to verify whether resources are indeed
channeled towards intended targets. Furthermore, SISBEN itself i s ten years old and only now i s being
updated and adjustedto maintain its relevance as a poverty-targetinginstrument.

To increase the efficiency of social expenditures, monitoring and evaluation i s necessary. Currently, a
 system of program and impact evaluation i s lacking for all social programs. As a result, information

about the effectiveness of programs is not accessible, producing inefficient social spending and
difficulties in identifying and designing modifications of programs. Although such a monitoring and
evaluation system i s important at any time, it is particularly necessary in a fiscally constrained
environment.

The SECAL encouraged the GOC to adopt periodic impact evaluations and citizens' monitoring of its
social programs. The institutionalization of such a culture i s not a trivial process, but it i s an integral part
of a social development strategy with afocus on efficient resourceuse.

The achievement of the above-mentioned goals is a difficult challenge for two reasons. First, as
mentioned, little additional money i s available due to the extremely constrained fiscal situation.
Consequently, to attain the above objectives, it is necessary to carry out reforms that would increase the
efficiency of social sector resource use. Reports indicate that there are considerable underutilized
resources that can be tapped to achieve the government's human development goals. Second, the
envisioned reforms are quite complicated and thus require extensive technical assistance, political
sensitivity, and consultations with stakeholders.

                Annex IV: Innovative EducationalModels and Service Delivery Schemes

Colombia has successfully experimented with innovative ways of efficiently increasing coverage and
student learning. The government plans to encourage the dissemination of some of these innovative
schemes. Among the interesting schemes that were successfully tested are:


         0   School Vouchers.         The national voucher program for secondary education (PACES)
             increased access by underserved populations and increased educational attainment, while
             maintaining, if not increasing, school effectiveness. The innovative demand-side financing
             program operated through a lottery system, which provided vouchers to students who would
             otherwise not have access to secondary schools, who then could then cash in the vouchers to
             pay private school tuition. Voucher-recipients completed more years of schooling than the
             lottery losers and were less likely to repeat grades (by 5-6 percentage oints). Female lottery
             winners completed more years of schooling (0.14) than boys (0.12)!l                Participation in the
             voucher program raised participants' wages by $36 to $300 per year.                    These benefits
             outweigh program costs. Although the Ministry of Education does not have plans to expand
             PACES to a national level, it i s beingadopted in several territorial entities, and the evaluation
             results continue to be favorable.

         0   School concessions. The Ministry of Education i s instead considering a national program
             modeled on an innovative systemfor the private management of public schools in the capital
             city: the Bogota School Concessions Program. In this program, the Government of Bogota
             transfers the administration of new schools to the private sector. The private schools - or
             concessionaires - have complete autonomy over school management. As of 2003, there are
             23 concession schools; more are expected. The program targets low-income areas in need of
              schools and the municipal education department constructs new, state-of-the-art schools, each
              able to accommodate between 800 and 1,200 students. The opportunity to manage the school
              i s offered in a public procurement process, where bidders (private educational institutions)
              are evaluated on their proposed management plans. Concessionaires are obliged to provide
              educational services to poor children, and inreturn receive remuneration from the department
              on a per-student basis. While the contract establishesclear standards that must be upheld, the
              concessionary has full autonomy over school management and i s evaluated solely on results.
              Concessionaires have already produced striking results in management improvements: they
              allocate on average 55 percent of the per capita remuneration to human resources, well below
              the 90 percent allocation by public schools.            Assuming the government's proposal is
              approved by the referendum, a portion of the revenues from royalties would be allocated to
              education and would be usedto finance this concession schemes.

          0   Escuela Nueva. Colombia's Escuela Nueva movement has improved learning outcomes and
              keeps rural children in school.            Escuela Nueva integrates curricular, community,
              administrative and teacher training strategies in a systematic way. It provides complete
              primary education in rural areas and improves the quality and effectiveness of learning,
              especially in multi-grade environments. Evaluations have consistently shown significant
              achievement results. Childrenfrom Escuela Nueva schools achieve higher scores in language
              and mathematics in the third and fifth grade than do students in traditional schools. Escuela
              Nueva also generates significant private sector participation, namely from the National

    The winners were 13-15 percentage points more likely to finish the 8th grade than losers, primarily due to reduced
repetition. This translates into a 25 percent increase in secondary school completion rates. Voucher-recipients
performed at least as well as students in public schools in both mathematics and language tests. Thus, for about
two-thirds of the per-pupil cost of public school, the program offered many poor students secondary education that
 was comparable in quality to public schools. PACES was a cost-effective means of obtaining additional time in
 school and higher-quality education for participants.

  needs of rural students.

0 Other New Initiatives. Other innovative programs under consideration by the Ministry of
  Education include: (a) Accelerated Schools, which addresses the issue of overage students by
  developing a pedagogical model characterized by a student-centered approach, with
  independent work and special educational material; (b) Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial
  (SAT), which expands secondary education in rural areas based on a local curriculum,
  including improvement of numeration and calculation, scientific thinking, communication,
  technology and community service; and (c) Telesecundaria: this model replicates the
  Mexican experience, a cost-effective approach to expand access to secondary education in
  rural areas.

                                      Colombia: Fund Relations Note


On June 30,2004 the Executive Boardof the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) completed the third
review of Colombia's performance under a two-year, SDR 1.5 billion (about US$2.3 billion) Stand-By
Arrangement, which was approved on January 15,2003 (see Press ReleaseNo. 03/04). The completion
of this review enables the release of SDR 193.5 million (about US$284 million) to Colombia, bringing
the total amount available underthe arrangementto SDR 1.16billion (about US1.70 billion). The
authorities are treating the arrangement as precautionary and they have not made any drawings.

Background

Under the authorities' program, economic performance has improved considerably. Real GDProse by
3.7 percent in 2003 and 4.1 percent inthe first quarter of 2004, while inflation fell to 5.4 percent year-on-
year inMay. Solid export growth, together with improvedconfidence, has strengthened the external
position, despite a moderate appreciation of the peso. Fiscal policy remained on track through March
2004. The Central Bank has purchasedforeign exchangethrough its option-based intervention
mechanism, because of concerns about the effect of currency appreciation on export growth. The health
of the financial systemcontinues to improve, although mortgage lending i s still a concern. Almost all
structural reforms continue to advance as programmed.

Executive Board Assessment at the Completion of the ThirdReview

Colombia's strong policy track record i s bolsteringconfidence and contributingto the economic recovery.
In2004, the macroeconomic framework is basedon a strongincreaseinreal GDPgrowth, further decline
ininflation, and strongexternal sector performance. Colombia is well placedto adjust to a gradual risein
interest rates inthe United States, providedthat economic policies continue to be strong. The main policy
challenge for 2004 is to take advantage of the cyclical upturnin activity to press ahead with reforms that
are crucial to sustain the economic recovery.

Demandpolicies are set to remain prudent. The authorities are strongly committed to keepingfiscal
policy on a pathto reduce public debt over the medium term. The combined public sector deficit is
targeted to decline in 2004, with some roomto accommodate additional investment financed by non-debt-
creating flows. The government intends to submit to Congress a budget for 2005 that provides for a
combined public sector deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP. Monetary policy will remain directed at reducing
inflation further, inthe context of the inflation-targeting framework and a flexible exchange rate policy,
while efforts will continue to strengthen the financial system, and improve supervision.

Structural reforms are also set to advance further. The government intends to secure congressional
approval of the revised budget code during2004. Tax administrationi s to be strengthened further, and a
constitutional amendment on pension reform i s to be submitted to Congress inJuly 2004. By September
2004, the economic policy cabinet will develop a plan to strengthenthe current system of fiscal

decentralization. Colombia has acceptedthe obligations of Article VIII, and the authorities plan to phase
out the few remainingexchange restrictions inthe next few years.

These reforms, together with prudent macroeconomicpolicies, should lay a solid foundation for sustained
growth and financial stability over the mediumterm, while also reducingpoverty and improving social
indicators.
