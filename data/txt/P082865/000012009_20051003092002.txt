3. Program Description
3.1 The Overall Program

1.        The Government of Colombia's (GOC) national development objective in the social and labor
sectors is to promote higher employment, increase human capital formation, and strengthen social
protection, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. This objective, articulated in the GOC's National
Development Plan for 2002-2006, is to be achieved through more efficient and equitable use of social
sector resources, an improved regulatory environment, and better institutional practices.

2.         The World Bank is supporting the GOC in meeting this objective through a series of
programmatic operations known as the Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment
Loans (PLaRSSALs). A programmatic approach to Bank assistance was adopted in view of the need for
flexibility in the sequencing of activities among the different institutions responsible for the labor and
social sectors.1 The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the first PLaRSSAL (Report No.
30210) rated the overall outcome and the health and education objectives as highly satisfactory, and the
remaining objectives as satisfactory.

3.        Bank support for the PLaRSSAL program, considered a high priority in the 2002 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), was an appropriate and timely response to the GOC's request for continued
assistance to address the labor and social effects of slow economic growth, high and rising income
inequality, and high levels of poverty.                  The government was also concerned about the continued
vulnerability of children to illness and malnutrition, and Colombia's lagging position in educational
attainment and quality, which could undermine its prospects for greater long-term competitiveness and
growth. In particular, the newly-elected government asked for the Bank's support to establish more solid
conditions for the sustained expansion of employment, faster human capital accumulation, and better
social protection of the population, thereby creating an enabling environment whereby subnational
governments would have incentives to collaborate with the reform process.

4.        While the PLaRSSAL I set up the policy environment for reform and articulated the long-term
outcomes expected from the program, the PLaRSSAL II contributed to these long-term outcomes by
focusing on short-term results by which progress could be measured in the reform process. Specifically,
the PLaRSSAL program supports the GOC's long-term vision by focusing on the following medium-term
objectives, to which the program's targets for 2006 are meant to contribute:

· institution of an effective authority in charge of developing a comprehensive social risk management
    system to provide efficient and timely protection of the poor and vulnerable against the threats and
    consequences of illness, unemployment, poverty, and economic volatility;
· greater access of poor children to Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) Assistance and
    Prevention programs through the establishment of an explicit targeting policy and practices to ensure
    their cost-effectiveness;
· achievement of at least 95 percent Expanded Program of Immunization (PAI) coverage rate of 0-5
    year-olds by 2006;
· continued advances in the implementation of health system reform, further expanding health
    insurance coverage of the poor, reducing direct subsidy to public hospitals, and ensuring quality of
    services of health insurers and care providers;
· implementation of labor and training reforms to reduce the wedge between employers' hiring/training
    costs and workers' acceptable wages, while improving the social protection of vulnerable workers;


1During Board presentation of the operation, PLaRSSAL II was cited as a good example of how the Bank should engage with
middle-income countries, because of its strong alignment with national priorities, value added through technical assistance, focus
on institution building, and results orientation. Draft Summary Discussion of Board Presentation, November 19, 2004.



                                                                2

· acceleration of education reforms to provide access to high-quality education, especially to basic and
    secondary schools; and
· greater transparency and social control of social programs through periodic evaluation and greater
    participatory oversight by citizens.

5.       The PLaRSSAL program originally consisted of two single-tranche loans. In February 2005, the
GOC requested, and the Bank agreed to, the preparation of a third loan which is expected to be presented
to the Board in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The purpose of the proposed new loan is to
continue support to the implementation of the reform process while facilitating the transition to a new
Administration taking office in August 2006.

3.2 PLaRSSAL II
6.       The PLaRSSAL II (Loan 29590-CO for US$200.0 million), approved on November 4, 2004,
supported the implementation of key actions laid out by PLaRSSAL I (Loan 7193-CO for US$200.0
million) approved on September 9, 2003. Unlike the PLaRSSAL I, which was more process- and
legislation- oriented, the PLaRSSAL II carefully defined results and measurable targets to be achieved
towards meeting the GOC's goals in each one of the programs. Thus, the PLaRSSAL II focused on the
following specific contributions to the long-term vision and medium-term objectives articulated in the
policy matrix:

    · An effectively functioning Ministry of Social Protection(MSP), through the definition and
         implementation of key responsibilities and functions of the agency (Objective A);
    · Initial implementation of the ICBF Agreement, including, inter alia, implementation of the
         targeting policy in municipalities in which SISBEN is available (Objective B);
    · Sustained progress in the PAI, including implementation of policies requiring immunization cards
         for students (Objective C);
    · Advances in health reform, including extension of the subsidized regime coverage (Objective D);
    · Evidence of implementation of key articles of Law 789 on labor and training reform (Objective
         E);
    · Increase in the student­teacher ratio, dissemination of education innovations, and advances in the
         implementation of Law 715 (Objective F); and
    · The GOC approval of instruments and policies requiring regular evaluation of social programs
         (Objective G).

7.       The full policy matrix and results achieved by the PLaRSSAL II are provided in Annex I. Each
of the policy measures responded to the main sector issues identified by the GOC and the Bank and
supported the general objectives of the PLaRSSAL program. As with the PLaRSSAL I, the main policy
actions were developed and carried out through extensive consultation and collaboration with all relevant
government agencies, including the Ministries of Finance, Social Protection and Education; the National
Planning Department (DNP), which acted as a coordinating agency; the National Training Program
(SENA); and the ICBF. The policy matrix and its implementation drew on extensive and high quality
joint sector work,2 as well as advances and lessons learned from previous social and non-social sector
operations.3


2Examples of these analytical pieces include: (i) Colombia Poverty Assessment (Report #12673-CO); (ii) Social Safety Net
Assessment (Report #22255-CO); (iii) Colombia: the Economic Foundation of Peace (2003); (iv) Public Training Reform Issues
in Colombia: the Case of SENA; and (v) Social Sector Efficiency programmatic analytical work on education and hospitals (on-
going).

3For example, the output indicators in each sector are a result of intensive support to the National Planning Department's
Evaluation Unit, through the Bank's public sector loans. The Evaluation Unit worked with the Ministries to develop indicators to



                                                                 3

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective
8.        ICR Rating: Satisfactory. The PLaRSSAL II successfully achieved its objectives, in many
cases exceeding the targets set.4 Financing provided by the loan enabled the government to continue and
deepen social reforms through the implementation of key policies laid out under PLaRSSAL I and the
expansion of coverage for existing social programs. As discussed below, all the measures in the policy
matrix for PLaRSSAL II have been carried out satisfactorily. Moreover, the program is having a
substantial institutional impact, both on the MSP and the DNP. Sustainability of reforms supported by the
PLaRSSAL program is likely for reasons provided in Annex II.

4.2 Outputs by objective
9.        Annex II presents the objectives, results, and ICR rating of each of the PLaRSSAL II's medium-
term objectives and its triggers. As noted, the health and education objectives are rated highly
satisfactory, maintaining the ICR rating given to these two areas in the PLaRSSAL I, and all other
objectives are rated satisfactory. Following is a summary of the PLaRSSAL II's main results:

     · The establishment of the Technical Vice-Ministry within the MSP and the articulation of its
          functions and responsibilities (Objective A).
     · The number of poor (SISBEN 1) children 6 years old or less covered by the Desayunos Infantiles
          (children's breakfast) program reached 517,598 children by December 2004, exceeding a target
          of 500,000 for 2002-2006 (Objective B). Due to the success of the program, the GOC is planning
          to expand it to cover another 500,000 poor children in 2005.
     · The PAI coverage rate of 0-5 year-olds was 90 percent by December 2004 (Objective C), and the
          multi-year budgets allocated to PAI should be sufficient to reach at least 95 percent coverage of
          this cohort by 2006.
     · The number of people benefiting from the Subsidized Health Insurance Regime increased by over
          1.8 million new affiliates with full subsidy and another 1.7 with partial subsidy (catastrophic
          insurance for major illness conditions) in 2004, well beyond the PLaRSSAL II's target of 800,000
          new affiliates for 2002-2004 (Objective D).
     · The increase in basic and secondary education enrollment was 734,413 students in the period
          2003-2004, exceeding the target of 500,000 (Objective F).
     · The increase in student/teacher ratio was 2.6 points--from 26.7 students in 2002 to 29.3 students
          in 2004--surpassing the PLaRSSAL II target of 1.5 points for 2004 (Objective F).
     · The transfer of the government management information system (SIGOB) from Presidencia to
          the DNP, and the signing of transparency agreements between the DNP and the National Results
          Evaluation System (SINERGIA) and 212 territorial entities (Objective G).

10.       Regarding Objective E, implementation of key articles of the labor reform law resulted in the
following:

     · By March 2005, the number of beneficiaries of the unemployment subsidy program created by
          the reform law in 2002 had reached over 100,000--about 30 percent of which were informal



track progress in their goals stated in the National Development Plan; these indicators were the basis of the measured outputs
presented in the PLaRSSAL matrix.
4The greater than anticipated success in the implementation of the matrix activities, as well as unanticipated advances in other
parts of the social program, were the basis for the ROC's decision to permit the increase of the loan amount from its original
US$150 million to US$200 million.



                                                                4

         sector workers, a target group whose size and lack of coverage had been, and continues to be, a
         concern.
    · The reform of the apprentice contract--that allows employers to pay less than minimum wage in
         job training contracts--has yielded impressive results. The number of apprentices increased from
         33,337 in 2002 to 74,265 in 2004. By March 2005, the number of apprentices had reached
         220,000, on track to reach the 321,000 apprentice target for 2006.
    · SENA's share of funds dedicated to train the unemployed has risen from 20 percent in 2002
         (prior to the reform), to 36 percent in December 2004 exceeding the reform law's target of 25
         percent.
    · SENA has increased its productivity, as indicated by the over three-fold increase in the number of
         trainees, from 900,000 in 2002 to over 2.9 million in 2004.

11.      One program that was created by the labor reform law to provide incentives to employ vulnerable
workers has progressed more slowly. Adhering to the principle behind results-based management, the
GOC undertook a rapid assessment of the program, determining that the slow take-up was due to lack of
demand from employers. The GOC then established an alternative program with the same objective but a
different process. This change illustrates the benefits of a results-based approach, which allows for quick
analysis and adjustment of programs that are not having the hoped-for effects, which in turn creates a
greater likelihood of reaching the desired development outcomes, as compared to a strategy of focusing
on processes alone.

4.3 Institutional Development Impact and Sustainability
12.      Institutional Development ICR Rating: Substantial. Annex II provides an assessment of the
institutional development impact by component. Overall, institutional development is rated substantial for
the following reasons:

· implementation of key functions and responsibilities of the new MSP by establishing the Technical
    Vice-Ministry, which is charged with coordination of social insurance and assistance programs and
    monitoring and evaluation functions of programs under the purview of the MSP;
· rapid adoption and implementation of a strict targeting policy for all major ICBF food and nutrition
    programs, with written normative and operation manuals, and the adoption of transparent competitive
    bidding procedures to procure services from private providers in programs such as Desayunos
    Infantiles;
· successful implementation of key provisions of the labor reform law, such as apprentice contracts and
    unemployment subsidies;
· reorganization of regional Education Secretariats, the dissemination of innovative education models
    (e.g. Escuela Nueva, SAT, Telesecundaria, among others) to over 300 municipalities, as well as the
    establishment of a national system for measuring student enrolment and learning achievement; and
· advances in the development and institution of periodic impact evaluation and citizens' monitoring of
    social programs.

13.      Sustainability ICR Rating: Likely. Over the course of PLaRSSAL I and II, the GOC has
maintained a clear vision and strong ownership of the reforms, as well as an unwavering political will to
implement them. These factors are key to program sustainability, but in addition, the PLaRSSAL enjoys
broad inter-ministerial support, and the benefits of its reforms in the MSP are beginning to be realized by
participating social protection agencies, the DNP, and the Ministry of Finance. The yearly struggle to
secure adequate funds for the PAI program appears to be minimized, as the GOC has agreed to sign a loan
with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to fund the program for 2005-2008. Also, the labor
reform articles, including the creation of unemployment insurance and apprentice contracts, are benefiting

a large number of unemployed and young people, and so are expected to continue receiving political
support in the future, as is true for the expansion of the health insurance program for the poor.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
14.     Consolidating institutional change to build a strong MSP has required a gradual approach. First,
the MSP has had to deal with meeting its wide-ranging mandate, while at the same time proposing major
pension and labor reform laws and writing their regulatory decrees and other normative acts. Second, the
MSP has had an enormous coordination challenge not only with different federal semi-autonomous social
protection institutions-- SENA, ICBF, ISS and Cajas de Compensación -- but also with states and
municipalities, as most social spending has been decentralized to these entities. Long-term and continued
Bank support through sector work, financing of the PLaRSSAL program, its companion Technical
Assistance Loan (TAL) and a Japanese PHRD grant have all helped the MSP to identify critical areas of
concern and action, and sustain its efforts. The proposed loan to support the social safety set, which will
support the Familias en Acción program, also has a component to help the MSP design and implement its
monitoring and evaluation functions, in close coordination with the SINERGIA of DNP.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
15.     Satisfactory. The Bank's performance in the PLaRSSAL II is considered satisfactory for the
following reasons:

· The Bank has carefully crafted a partnership with the GOC over the last six years, which has survived
    two administrations and changes in the Bank team, and which continues with the PLaRSSAL III.
    This close collaboration, along with the array of lending and knowledge products in the labor and
    social sectors that the Bank is supporting in the country, has allowed the Bank to respond quickly and
    effectively to new and changing needs of the client, by maintaining a continuous dialogue and fluidly
    contributing to the GOC's larger development agenda.
· The Bank supported an operation that is consistent with the CAS and contributes to the
    implementation of the country's development plan.
· The Bank worked in partnership with the GOC to design the policy matrix, thereby contributing its
    substantial technical expertise to the process, while building ownership on the part of the GOC.
· The preparation of PLaRSSAL was timely--the GOC wanted to capitalize on the national attention
    given to labor and social reform, and needed support for speedy and able implementation of such
    reforms. The Bank's quick support for preparation of the programmatic operation and focus on
    outputs was key to leveraging this attention and allowing the GOC to advance the reform process;
· The Bank provided high quality technical assistance, drawing on best-practice sector work on safety
    nets, health, labor and training, as well as on lessons learned from past investment operations
    supporting the development of the social net program (RAS) and the 2002 Social Sector Adjustment
    Loan (SECAL).
· The Bank maintained close coordination with the IDB, which ensured that the PLaRSSAL matrix
    remained relevant and consistent with that of the IDB, making it easier for the client to work with two
    donor agencies.
· The Bank team was multi-sectoral, thus adding more depth to the operation than if it were designed
    and implemented by only a single sector, and allowing for better collaboration with the DNP, which
    also has a multi-sectoral view.

Borrower
16.     Satisfactory. The Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory for the following reasons:




                                                        6

· The GOC developed a clear vision and logical strategy of its labor and social reform agenda, laid out
   in the National Development Plan 2002-2006, and continues to use it as a relevant roadmap. This
   guided the preparation and implementation of the programmatic operation.
· The Administration ensured that its policy commitments were realistic and could be achieved as
   scheduled.
· The involved ministries and other government agencies have been managing and monitoring the
   implementation and effects of the various reform measures­and have sought to adjust them in light of
   the evolving experience and lessons learned. Indeed, the deep commitment of the different agencies
   involved, including the Ministries of Finance, Social Protection, Education, the DNP, SENA, and
   ICBF during program preparation and implementation has been key to the success of the PLaRSSAL
   I and II. High level technical staff of all agencies involved participated jointly with Bank staff in
   preparation activities and discussions leading to the program preparation, identification of the
   objectives to be achieved, and the timing of the targets and triggers of the sequence of loans. The
   coordinating role played by the DNP was instrumental in ensuring effective preparation and execution
   of program objectives.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

17.    The experience of the PLaRSSAL program provides the following main lessons:

   · Strong and sustained dialogue between the GOC and the Bank, through integrated, high-quality
       sector work on social protection issues, labor, training, and operations, creates a more cohesive
       response to the reform process and enables the Bank to respond more rapidly and effectively to
       the client's needs.
   · An emphasis on results-based management, involving clear and measurable indicators and a
       focus on outputs and outcomes, rather than inputs and processes, is critical to performance
       monitoring, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the program, and allowing for quick
       corrections when the processes are not having the desired results. Focusing on program outcomes
       permits inclusion of many sectors, which would be difficult to manage in a series of operations if
       the outcomes for each sector were not clearly defined and measurable.
   · A series of operations­SECAL, PLaRSSAL I, PLaRSSAL II and its companion TAL­ builds
       momentum on both the client and the Bank side, allowing for a more fluid unfolding of a long-
       term vision for reform programs. The approach commits the government to stay focused on
       monitoring progress in outputs of key reform measures over a longer time period in a
       coordinated, formal and systematic way, and to make changes when needed.
   · A rich program of investment Loans, sector studies, and adjustment loans in other sectors is
       necessary to fill-out the labor and social reform program. While the PLaRSSAL loans have
       successfully met their goals, the GOC and the Bank team understand that they have a specific and
       limited role. Other complementary Bank instruments are necessary to most efficiently support
       the Government's fulfillment of its development plan most efficiently.
   · The Bank team's integrated composition, including economists, social protection, health, poverty,
       and education specialists, among others, and the broad and varied operational and analytical
       experience of the team members, ensured that high-quality technical assistance was provided to
       the client.
   · A strong coordinating role, such as the one that the DNP has played, ensures that the entities
       involved are making progress in achieving agreed output targets and advancing in meeting the
       trigger actions, and for the PLaRSSAL program it has been critical in ensuring the continuation of
       reform efforts over a long period of time and has permitted detection of potential delays and
       problems.
