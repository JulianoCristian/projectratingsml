Document number: CAS 25129
Date of last CAS discussion:  January 19, 2003
According to the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board of Directors 
on January 19, 2003, the Bank’s strategy focuses on three goals:  (i) fast and sustainabl
e growth; 
(ii) quality government institutions; and (iii) sharing the fruits of growth.  Achievement of these 
goals will strengthen the foundation for peace and the possibility for conflict resolution. As 
noted, violent conflict is Colombia’s greatest chal
lenge at present.  To support this strategy, the 
Bank lending program envisioned in the CAS focuses on operations that would: (i) have the most 
tangible impact on poverty alleviation; (ii) achieve fast and sustainable growth while protecting 
the poor; (iii
) incorporate the lessons learned from the Bank’s operations, particularly from on
-
going Learning and Innovative Loans; and (iv) pilot innovative interventions with important 
demonstration effects.

The Second  PLaRSSAL will directly contribute to achiev
ing the following benefits:

 
Economic growth
.  For faster and sustained economic growth, Colombia needs to 
increase employment of workers and total factor productivity growth. The labor reforms 
supported  by  the  PLaRSSAL  contribute  to  increased  employment. 
Moreover,  the 
education and training reforms advanced by the government and nurtured by these 
operations increase the pace of the country’s human capital accumulation and push the 
private  sector  productivity  towards  the  technological  frontier.  In  the  Bank’
s  report, 
Closing  the  Gap  in  Education  and  Technology  (2003)
,  these  two  conditions  are  deemed 
necessary  for  sustained  and  rapid  economic  growth  in  the  technologically  changing 
global economy. 

 
Building quality government
. The PLaRSSAL contributes to the de
velopment of 
quality government by supporting reforms intended to promote the transparency, social 
accountability, coordination, and rationalization of key social programs and institutions 
(e.g. MSP, ICBF, SENA, and MEN). In addition, the operations enhanc
e the participation 
of Colombia’s citizens and the ability of beneficiaries to make choices and informed 
decisions.  Such  actions  are  expected  to  reduce  inefficiencies  and  improve  relations 
between the population and the government. 

 
Sharing  the  fruits  of  g
rowth
.  The  labor,  education,  training,  social  assistance,  and 
health reforms supported by PLaRSSAL enhance the ability of all people, especially the 
poor,  to  share  in  the  fruits  of  economic  growth.  Employment  is  the  single  most 
important source of income f
or poor people. Hence, reforms that reduce unemployment 
and underemployment as well as raise employment in the formal sector are likely to 
lower poverty and improve income equality. It can also be argued that improved cost
-
effectiveness and targeting of IC
BF and SENA programs to low
-
income people (called 
for by PLaRSSAL) reduce welfare inequality. Moreover, a movement towards universal 
access  to  good  quality  basic  education  and  health  services  promoted  by  PLaRSSAL 
favors lower income children.
Poverty Imp
act.
  The social impacts have clear poverty implications since most of them are 
investments in the future productivity of low
-
income individuals.  The increase in the quantity of 
education  and  job  training,  access  to  health  care,  immunizations,  and  early  c
hildhood 
development programs will increase opportunities to earn the higher rates of return that elude 
those with less human capital.  Additionally, the actions in the loan will contribute to the positive 
non
-
monetary benefits associated with more human c
apital, such as:  longevity, decreased risk of 
poverty, healthier off
-
spring, etc.  In the short
-
run, the program supports employment for low
-
skilled and hard
-
to
-
employ groups, thus getting them back into the labor market and earning an 
income.
2.  Objec
tives
:
Page  3
The proposed Second Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment 
Loan (PLaRSSAL II) will support the Government of Colombia’s (GOC) 
objectives to: (a) increase employment; (b) raise human capital formation; and (c) 
strengthen social p
rotection. It deepens the labor and social reforms initiated 
under the PLaRSSAL I (approved Sept. 9, 2003) and focuses on actualizing the 
groundwork laid down in the previous operation and return 
results.
 These 
objectives would be achieved by: 
(i) supporti
ng the reform of GOC’s labor 
regulations under Law 789 and improved training schemes; (ii) implementing 
Law 715 that amends the rules regarding the decentralization of education and 
health services while introducing incentives to enhance and measure qualit
y; and 
(iii) developing an integrated and more efficient social protection system, 
including the establishment of institutions for regular impact evaluation and 
public oversight of social protection programs.
3.  Description
:
The Second programmatic str
uctural adjustment loan is being proposed to support the above
-
mentioned labor and social sector reform program. Building on the first PLaRSSAL operation, 
the  Second  loan  focuses  on  development  impact,  namely  through  producing  measurable 
results/outcomes
. 
 This would be achieved by implementing those labor and training laws that 
were regulated in the PLaRSSAL I, and advancing the education, health, and social protection 
reforms, in accordance with Laws 789 and 715 such that they produce quantifiable results
.
The Second PLaRSSAL II focuses specifically on: 
o
Implementing  targeting  regulations  regarding  the  use  of  ICBF  (early  childhood 
development) services by poor families; 
o
Impact and cost evaluation studies to provide recommendations on the consolidation 
a
nd streamlining of ICBF programs; 
o
Expanding immunization by ensuring adequate budget allocation in 2004 for the PAI 
(immunization expansion program) to keep on schedule for 95% immunization rates by 
2006, and implementing the Decree recommending an immuni
zation card for children 
enrolling in schools; 
o
Expanding  the  Subsidized  (Health  Insurance)  Regime  to  even  more  poor  people, 
licensing  health  care  services,  and  capping  the  public  resources  allocated  directly  to 
public hospitals, thus further advancing the
 transformation from supply
-
 to demand
-
side health care delivery;
o
Implementation of the regulatory decrees for Law 789/02, which provides incentives to 
employers 
to 
hire 
workers, 
particularly 
vulnerable 
workers, 
and 
expands 
the 
apprenticeship  program  to  in
clude  more  students,  including  those  who  received 
training in the private sector and to reallocate public monies to private providers of job 
training services, 
Page  4
o
Implementation of the Action Plan for the modernization of SENA (National Training 
Service) wit
h a particular focus on the separation of conflicting core responsibilities of 
the  financing,  regulation/accreditation,  and  provision  of  training  services  and  the 
implementation  of  SENA’s  information  systems  for  impact  evaluation,  managerial 
accounting, an
d job search. 
o
Expansion of coverage in basic and secondary by increasing the student
-
to
-
teacher ratio 
and expanding innovative methods to expand coverage to hard
-
to
-
reach students.  
o
Enhance school quality by re
-
organizing the teacher staff, testing stude
nts in grades 5 
and 9 to allow better targeting of educational resources to improve student learning, and 
implementation of teacher performance evaluations.  
o
Legislation,  in  the  Organic  Budget  Law,  of  an  article  that  requires  all  major  social 
programs to 
periodically evaluate the impact of their programs, paid by the program’s 
budget
o
Implementation  of  the 
Bogotá  Cómo  Vamos?
  Model,  in  which  civil  society  reviews, 
disseminates, and discusses federal government programs,

Benefits.
 The Second  PLaRSSAL will d
irectly contribute to achieving the following targets:

 
Increase employment by 350,000 workers between 2002 and 2004, due to the 
labor reform;

 
Increase number of graduates from publicly funded job training and an increase in 
the  number  of  individuals  benef
iting  from  apprenticeship  experiences  due  to 
changes in the labor law, beginning in 2003 and increasing over time; 

 
Increase  the  number  of  students  trained  by  SENA  by  450,000  from  its  given 
resources between 2002 and 2004;

 
90 percent coverage rates for DPT
 and polio, 95% coverage rates for Triple Viral 
for children age 0
-
1 in between 2003 and 2004; 

 
1.4  million  newly  affiliated  poor  people  in  the  Subsidized  (Health  Insurance) 
Regime between 2002 and 2004;

 
Increased access of poor children to ICBF services b
y 432,000 between 2002 and 
2004; and

 
Increase in net enrollments by 500,000 new students between 2002 and 2004.
Notably,  even  greater  benefits  are  expected  from  the  program,  since  it  instituted  structural 
reforms in labor, health, education, and child deve
lopment that will persist beyond the period of 
the operation.
Poverty Impact.
  The social impacts have clear poverty implications since most of them are 
investments in the future productivity of low
-
income individuals.  The increase in the quantity of 
edu
cation  and  job  training,  access  to  health  care,  immunizations,  and  early  childhood 
development programs will increase opportunities to earn the higher rates of return that elude 
those with less human capital.  Additionally, the actions in the loan will con
tribute to the positive 
non
-
monetary benefits associated with more human capital, such as:  longevity, decreased risk of 
Page  5
poverty, healthier off
-
spring, etc.  In the short
-
run, the program supports employment for low
-
skilled and hard
-
to
-
employ groups, thus 
getting them back into the labor market and earning an 
income.
4.  Loan Amount and Disbursements
:
The second  PLaRSSAL operation proposed for a total of $150 million, which would be in the 
form of a fixed spread, U.S.
-
dollar
-
denominated loan, would be ma
de to the Republic of 
Colombia. Disbursements under the proposed loan would be made to an account (Deposit 
Account) of the Republic of Colombia, established at the 
Banco de la Republica
 for this purpose. 
As mentioned, the proposal would be to disburse the 
loan in one tranche upon Board approval. 
This tranche arrangement has been designed with the government and reflects its and the Bank’s 
assessment of the necessary timing for implementing the proposed conditions. Aside from 
financial pressures due to an ur
gent financing gap, the timing of the loan is calibrated to support 
the government in its efforts to continue the momentum of the SECAL and the momentum of the 
social sector reform.
