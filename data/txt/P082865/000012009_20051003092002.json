An emphasis on\n            results-based management, involving clear and measurable\n            indicators, and a focus on outputs and outcomes, rather than\n            inputs and processes, is critical to performance monitoring,\n            revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the program, and\n            allowing for immediate corrections when the processes are\n            not reaching the desired results. Focusing on program\n            outcomes permits the inclusion of many sectors, which would\n            be difficult to manage in a series of operations if the\n            outcomes for each sector were not clearly defined and\n            measurable. A rich program of investment Loans, sector\n            studies, and adjustment loans in other sectors is necessary\n            to fill-out the labor and social reform program. While the\n            series of programmatic labor reform structural adjustment\n            loans have successfully met their goals, the Government and\n            the Bank team understand that they have a specific and\n            limited role. Other complementary Bank instruments are\n            necessary to efficiently support the Government's\n            fulfillment of its development plan. Further lessons address\n            the importance of a strong and sustained dialogue between\n            the Bank and the Government, and, a strong coordinating role."}, "docdt": "2005-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
