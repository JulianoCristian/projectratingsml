F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG), an integral part of the Bank's Interim
Strategy (ISN), is to support the implementation of the Government's reform program for
sustaining economic recovery over the 2006 period. The ERSG is supporting a number of
policy and institutional reforms to consolidate the progress made under the EERC and the




                                                ii

ERC, to build the foundation for economic diversification, sustained growth and poverty
reduction. The ERSG focuses on the following long-term development objectives:
  #     Improving public expenditure management and their impact on the poor;
  #     Reviving agriculture export sectors (coffee, tea and cotton) and ensure better
revenue distribution sectors among actors; and
  #     Reviving the private sector by improving the investment climate, accelerating the
divestiture of State enterprises; and settling the government domestic arrears to the
private sector.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector
background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Background.
In 2006, when the ERSG program was approved, the country was slowly emerging from a decade
of political turmoil and civil war that took a heavy toll on human lives, destroyed economic and
social infrastructure and made Burundi one of the poorest countries in the world with some of the
weakest social indicators. About 250,000 people had been killed and 1.2 million had been
displaced. The GDP per capita had fallen by 18 percent from US$127 in 1994 to US$105 in 2004.
The incidence of poverty had increased from 40 to 69 percent. Gross primary school enrollment
ratios had declined from 73 percent in 1992 to less than 50 percent in the late 1990s. Life
expectancy had declined from 51 years in 1993 to 42 in 2000. Infant mortality rates had doubled
and child mortality had increased by close to 50 percent.

The signing of the Arusha peace and reconciliation agreement with a number of political parties
and rebel groups in August 2000 marked the beginning of a return to peace and political stability,
based on power-sharing between the two main ethnic groups. The transition government, which
took office in November 2001, negotiated and signed cease-fire agreements with all the rebel
groups, with the exception of the FNL-PALIPEHUTU. In 2004, the government initiated a
comprehensive demobilization program with financial support from the donor community (grants
from IDA and a Multi-Donor Trust Fund). Following approval of a new Constitution in February
2005, Parliamentary and Presidential elections were held in July/August 2005 and a post-
transition government took office in September 2005. One of the main tasks of the new
government was to initiate negotiations with the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, which signed a cease-fire
agreement in September 2006.

Both the transition government of the early 2000s and the new (democratically elected)
government practiced generally prudent economic and public finance policies. Monetary policies
were focused on liberalizing the foreign exchange regime and virtually eliminating the parallel
market premium. Tax revenue remained at a high 20-21 percent of GDP and the government was
able to mobilize large increases in donor support (mainly in the form of grants). The combination
of high security spending (defense and police) and increased (donor-financed) economic and
social expenditures led to a sharp increase in total government spending (from 27% of GDP in
2001 to 37% in 2005) and in the size of the overall public deficit. However, since most of the
increase in public spending was financed by foreign grants, the primary deficit declined from 3.5
percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.7 percent in 2005. In the external sector, growing donor-funded
imports for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance caused a sharp increase in the current
account deficit (from 24-25 percent of GDP in 2003 and 2004 to 34 percent in 2005).

An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was approved by the Government in November
2003 and reviewed by the Boards of the Bank and the IMF in January 2004. The I-PRSP
emphasized five major objectives: (i) peace and democracy; (ii) private sector development; (iii)
development of human capital; (iv) special action for disadvantaged groups (conflict victims and
women) and (v) fighting HIV/AIDS. In August 2005, Burundi reached the HIPC decision point
and was granted access to interim debt relief. Together with the slow decline of military
expenditures, HIPC funds and donor support enabled the government to allocate more resources
to the social sectors. Education was the main beneficiary of that increase. Combined with the
recruitment of additional teachers, the elimination of school fees in September 2005 led to a


                                                 1

dramatic increase in gross primary school enrollments which reached 100 percent in 2005-2006.
Although public spending on health increased only marginally, health indicators improved (a 20-
25 percent decline in rates of child and infant mortality) in recent years.

The World Bank played a major role in providing project and program financing and helping the
government mobilize donor assistance. An Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC) in
2000 and an Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC) in 2002 provided budget support in the
context of reform programs aimed at stabilizing the economy, stimulating private investment
improving public expenditure management and reducing gender disparities (see Box 1). In 2004,
a CFAA report identified some of the main weaknesses in the country's public finance
management procedures and practices at all stages of the budget preparation and execution
process, as well as in accounting, cash management and auditing.

                  Box 1 - The performance of two earlier DPOs: EERC and ERC

The Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC) was approved by the Board in April 2000. Its
objectives were to support the peace process through macroeconomic and fiscal policies aimed at
stabilizing the economy, supporting the recovery of the private sector and rehabilitating critical economic
and social sectors (health, education and infrastructure). While the institutional development impact of the
program was viewed as modest, its outcome was rated satisfactory and its sustainability likely.

The Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) was approved by the Board in August 2002. It was a more
ambitious three-tranche operation aimed at: (i) improving public service delivery and basic social services,
through transparency and accountability in the use of public funds; (ii) deepening institutional and
structural reforms for sustained economic recovery and poverty reduction; and (iii) establishing a track
record for early access to debt relief under the HIPC initiative. The conditions for the release of the second
tranche were: (i) satisfactory macroeconomic policies, and (ii) specific conditions concerning the
privatization of public enterprises and the improvement of the budget process. The conditions of the third
tranche concerned gender issues, the revival of the coffee and tea sub-sectors, the reform of public
procurement, and the establishment of an Office of the Auditor General (Court of Accounts).

The ICR questioned the design of the ERC program, which was viewed as too complex and beyond the
capacity of the government. Both the privatization process and the reform of the coffee sector, two
politically sensitive programs, had not been adequately prepared before and during preparation of the
operation. In addition, no technical support was available when the ERC program was launched (a TA
project was approved one year later). However, the outcome of the program and the performance of the
Bank and the government were rated satisfactory: (i) good progress was made toward stabilizing the
economy and controlling inflation (following a year of negative growth caused by poor climatic conditions
in 2003, the rate of growth of GDP reached 5.1 percent in 2004, and the country reached the HIPC
decision point in August 2005): (ii) a Public Expenditure Unit in the Ministry of Finance initiated an
assessment of critical public finance management issues; (iii) budget allocations to priority programs were
in line with the objectives of the Interim PRSP; and (iv) action plans were prepared to improve cash
management, reform procurement procedures, privatize public enterprises and revive the coffee and tea
sectors. With respect to the export crop sector, the action plan was followed by a series of decrees opening
entry to the sectors and liberalizing prices and marketing.


The gradual return to peace, the (slow) progress of the reform process and the mobilization of
additional donor assistance stimulated economic growth. Following a decade of economic
decline, the rate of growth of GDP went up to 1.8 percent in 2001-2003 and 5.1 percent in 2004.
A major drought in 2005 led to a sharp drop in agricultural production and overall economic
growth declined to a modest 0.9 percent. As a result per capita GDP continued to decline or
increased modestly in 2001-2005 depending on estimates about the rate of population growth.

Rationale for Bank assistance

In 2006, Burundi was one of the world's poorest countries and was still struggling to restore
peace, security and political stability. The country and its government had made considerable
progress towards establishing a fully democratic political system; the Burundian authorities had
implemented sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies and were beginning to restructure budgets
and public expenditure programs in line with the priorities of the Interim PRSP of 2003. Massive
efforts, however, were still needed on the part of the government and its development partners to
stimulate growth, develop human resources, reconstruct and rehabilitate economic and social
infrastructure, resettle refugees and other displaced people, demobilize ex-combatants and offer
them job opportunities.

Paragraph 16 of the Program Document argued that after 11 years of conflict a window of
opportunity had opened. Based on experience in other post-conflict countries, exceptional levels
of support were needed to take advantage of this opportunity. A strong signal from the
international community to support economic recovery would have an important positive impact
on peace prospects.

Donors operating in Burundi supported that approach. Following the approval of the operation by
the Bank Executive Directors, two bilateral donors decided to attach part of their assistance to the
ERSG program. The Netherlands contributed the equivalent of US$ 10 million to be disbursed
with the first tranche of ERSG, and of US$ 13 million to be disbursed with the second tranche.
Norway decided to contribute the equivalent of US$10 million to be disbursed with the second
tranche.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG), an integral part of the Bank's Interim Strategy,
was a stand-alone two-tranche US$60 million grant, which supported a number of policy and
institutional reforms to consolidate the progress made under the EERC and the ERC, and to build
the foundation for economic diversification, sustained growth and poverty reduction. The ERSG
focused on the following long-term development objectives: (i) improving public expenditure
management and its impact on the poor; (ii) reviving the agricultural export sector (coffee, tea
and cotton) and ensuring better distribution of revenue among actors in the sector; and (iii)
reviving the private sector by improving the investment climate, accelerating divestiture and
settling government domestic arrears to the private sector.

Key indicators were:

    ·    On public expenditure management: (i) the 2006 budget is executed through the Interim
         FMIS; (ii) a modern legal procurement framework is in place and institutions provided in
         the new procurement code have been set-up; (iii) the share of pro-poor expenditures
         increases from 33.6% in the 2005 budget to 35.5% in the revised 2006 budget and to the
         PRSP target in 2007;
    ·    On economic performance: (i) the rate of growth of GDP reaches 5% in 2007; (ii)
         adoption & implementation of a 3-year action plan for the coffee sector; (iii) adoption of
         a 3-year action plan for the tea sector and a strategy for the cotton sector; (iv) an
         investment climate assessment report is available.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

PDOs and indicators remained unchanged during program implementation.


1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The ERSG supported reforms in the following areas:

Public expenditure management

    ·  Budget management framework. The government was expected to complete the
       preparation of a draft Loi Organique, which would clearly define the key principles of
       public finance management, introduce streamlined budget execution procedures and
       organize timely production and auditing of government accounts.
    ·  Procurement. The government was expected: (i) to prepare and adopt a revised
       procurement code separating the regulation and the execution functions; and (ii) to
       establish the institutions provided for in the new code.
    ·  Budget preparation. Budget preparation would start early, thus enabling sector ministries
       to formulate budget proposals that are more in line with their sector strategies and the
       objectives of the Interim PRSP.
    ·  Budget execution and monitoring. The government was expected to continue to develop
       its computerized financial management information system and to produce consolidated
       administrative accounts (comptes administratifs) and a consolidated public accounts
       balance (comptes de gestion) starting with accounts for the 2006 budget. Annual audits of
       government accounts by the Cour des Comptes would be made available to the public.

Impact of public finance management on the poor

    ·  Share of priority sectors in public expenditures. The government was expected to
       increase the share of priority sectors and poverty reduction expenditures in future budget
       allocations.
    ·  Monitoring poverty reduction impact of public expenditure programs. To ensure that
       budget resources reach intended beneficiaries, the government was expected to launch a
       Public Expenditure Tracking Survey for 2006 in the education, health and justice sectors.

Reforming the coffee, tea and cotton sectors

     ·   Coffee. The government was expected to prepare studies aimed at defining: (i) a legal,
         regulatory and institutional framework for the sector which would be consistent with a
         liberalized and privatized environment: (ii) mechanisms for the provision (and
         financing) of key services (extension, research, road maintenance, inputs, quality
         control); (iii) strategies for privatizing the washing stations, the SOGESTALs (which
         manage the stations), and the two coffee mills managed by SODECO; and (iv)
         accompanying measures, including safety nets for poor coffee farmers.
     ·   Tea. A technical and financial audit would review the performance of the Office du Thé
         du Burundi (OTB), which has a monopoly on the processing of green leaves into dry
         tea. The audit would serve as a basis for a restructuring plan for the sector.
     ·   Cotton. An update of the technical and financial audit of COGERCO, which is
         responsible for collecting and ginning seed cotton, and the revision of the contract



                                                  4

         between COGERCO and COTEBU, which obligates COGERCO to sell all of its
         production to COTEBU the national weaving company, would lead to the design and
         adoption of a strategy for the sector.

Private sector development

     ·   Business environment. The government was expected to carry out an evaluation of the
         investment climate, which would provide the data and analysis necessary to build a
         consensus on priorities for action and reform.
     ·   Settlement of domestic arrears. Settling domestic arrears to the private sector is essential
         to support economic activity. The government was expected to define a settlement
         strategy and settle all arrears to the private sector including banks.

Reforming public enterprises and the privatization process

    ·   Public enterprise management. The government was expected to strengthen the capacity
        of SCEP, the public entity responsible for supervising public enterprises.
    ·   Privatization. To prepare and implement actual privatization transactions, the government
        was expected to revise the privatization law, to prepare and adopt a privatization road
        map and to re-launch the sale of OCIBU's assets in non coffee sectors, including shares
        in the Société Hôtelière Nouvelle du Burundi.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance

All the conditions of the program were met but full implementation took more time than
anticipated during appraisal. In addition to political and institutional development factors, two
governance issues delayed program approval and execution:

    ·   By early 2006, the ERSG grant was ready for approval, but the need to address a critical
        governance issue (the sale of the presidential plane), and to incorporate corrective actions
        in the program delayed Board presentation to August 2006. The recruitment of an auditor
        for the audit of the sale became a condition of effectiveness, which was not met until
        November 2006. In addition, the release of the second tranche depended on the
        publication of the auditor's report and government approval of an action plan based on
        the report, a condition that was met one year later in November 2007.
    ·   A second governance issue also influenced disbursements, since the Bank was not ready
        to release the second tranche until questions related to improper government payments to
        Interpetrol had been resolved to the satisfaction of the Bank and donors.

These delays affected the disbursement of the cofinanciers' contribution.

Satisfactory progress in carrying    Condition generally met. The government performance was
out the Program and an               satisfactory in 2006 and during the first half of 2007.
appropriate macroeconomic            - The rate of growth of GDP went up from 0.9 percent in 2005 to 6.1
policy framework.                    percent in 2006. The increase in consumer prices declined from 13.4 to
                                     2.8 percent. The primary public finance deficit increased from 1.7 to
                                     5.6 percent of GDP but remained below the PRGF target of 8.9 percent
                                     of GDP.
                                     - Because of the slow but steady decline of defense and other security
                                     expenditures and the availability of HIPC funds, the share of priority
                                     economic and social sectors in total public expenditures continued to
                                     increase from 34.1 percent in 2005 to 38.2 percent in 2006.
                                     - A poor coffee harvest in 2007 and the deteriorating political and
                                     security situation slowed down economic growth which declined to 3.6
                                     percent. The increase in consumer prices went up to 8.3 percent owing
                                     to higher international commodity prices and exchange rate
                                     depreciation.
                                     - Although the revenue target of 19.7 percent of GDP was not reached
                                     in 2007, the postponement of proposed increases in expenditures
                                     enabled the government to limit the primary public finance deficit to
                                     5.9 percent of GDP.
                                     - In 2007, relationships between the government, the World Bank and
                                     the IMF were affected by a major governance problem as the
                                     Inspection Générale de l'Etat discovered that unbudgeted and
                                     improper payments of FBu 16 billions (equivalent to 1.6 percent of
                                     GDP) had been made to a domestic petroleum import and distribution
                                     company.
                                     -The government took strong remedial measures, including an external
                                     audit, legal proceedings against responsible officials and efforts to
                                     recover funds (freezing the sale of some of the petroleum company's
                                     assets and a bank deposit of FBu 6 billion as a guarantee against future

  As a stand-alone grant, the ERSG did not include specific triggers for future Bank-financed
  policy lending operations. The project appraisal document (PAD), however, listed ten areas in
  which progress was expected during and/or after program implementation. As of today, six of
  these ten measures have been fully implemented. In retrospect, one should recognize that the
  timing of several measures was unrealistic. Setting up new institutions, privatizing public
  enterprises and restructuring agricultural filières were important and complex decisions that
  required detailed preparatory work, including extensive consultations with all the stakeholders. It
  is expected, however, that as part of the ongoing program and with Bank support, the government
  will complete most of the remaining measures by the end of this year or at the beginning of 2009.

                                       completed. A major setback was the decision of the government, in
                                       2007, to give a New-York-based trader a monopoly on the marketing
                                       of Burundi's coffee. This decision was in conflict with earlier
                                       liberalization measures and was incompatible with the official
                                       objective of creating an environment favorable to the privatization of
                                       the sector. In April 2008, OCIBU abolished the monopoly and
                                       provided that all exports of coffee should be based on competition. In
                                       2008, a group of international consultants coordinated by an
                                       investment bank was recruited to help define alternative options for

 2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

 The program was implemented in difficult circumstances. The IDA grant was rewarding several
 years of effective management of the political transition toward a multi-party system and
 generally prudent economic and public finance policies, but the program was executed by a new
 government whose attention was focused on urgent and complex political and security issues. The
 new team had good will and was ready ­ in principle ­ to accept the advice and follow the
 recommendations of the international community but as it had not participated in the design of all
 the program components, it did not really own the package of reforms proposed in the ERSG. The
 lack of consensus was particularly problematic in the agricultural sector as the program provided
 for the privatization of the coffee washing stations in line with one of the conditions of the HIPC
 completion point. This was a highly sensitive political issue and a major challenge for a new
 government in a post-conflict situation. As mentioned in the November 2006 OPCS report on
 conditionality, "less policy space than desirable may have been given to the incoming
 government, as measures related to the coffee sector were taken by the outgoing government, thus
 giving less confidence in the new government's ability to fully appropriate the agenda".

 Another critical factor that slowed down implementation of the program was the lack of technical
 and financial management capacity in key economic and sector ministries, exacerbated by an
 excessively rapid turn-over of technical and managerial staff. The lack of capacity was partly
 mitigated by significant improvements in the performance of EMSP, an ongoing technical
 assistance project approved by the Board in FY04, which was restructured in October 2006 to
 help the government prepare and implement policy and institutional reforms programmed in the
 context of ERSG. The restructured EMSP proved to be a most useful instrument for the
 government, as it financed a wide variety of activities (studies, draft legislation, policy papers,
 action plans, information systems, capacity-building programs, etc.) viewed as essential to
 support implementation of critical aspects of the ERSG agenda. However, the best policy reform
 proposals will achieve little if political leaders can not rely on a national team of experienced

professionals to help them review proposals prepared by consultants, consult with stakeholders,
create a consensus and decide.

Program implementation was also affected by three major political, security and governance
issues.

    ·   In September 2006, one month after the approval of ERSG, the government and the last
        rebel group signed a cease-fire agreement, which however was not immediately
        implemented. Negotiations were suspended in July 2007 and sporadic fighting continued
        particularly in areas near Bujumbura. Insecurity slowed down implementation of the
        demobilization program and undermined government efforts to stimulate growth and
        reduce poverty.
    ·   In 2007, internal divisions within the ruling CNDD-FDD party triggered a political crisis
        that paralyzed the government and the Parliament and blocked the review and adoption of
        the reform agenda. In November 2007, the main political parties were able to reach an
        agreement, which led to the creation of a broad coalition government and made it
        possible to restore a more effective dialogue between the government and the Parliament.
    ·   Two corruption scandals concerning the sale of the presidential plane in 2006 and
        irregular payments to Interpetrol ­ a domestic petroleum trading company ­ in 2007
        affected the confidence of the donor community, delayed disbursement of a number of
        externally-financed budget support operations and had a negative impact on investment
        and growth. Eventually, strong remedial measures taken by the government reassured the
        international community and encouraged donors to resume disbursement of budget
        support.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

In May 2005, the government and the donors providing budget support had signed a partnership
agreement aimed at improving the monitoring of the reform process and better coordinating
donor-financed budget support. The PAD proposed to combine the monitoring of the ERSG
program with that of the PRGF and other budget support operations. In this context:

    ·   The Ministry of Finance would be responsible for coordinating implementation of the
        overall program. Finance would provide quarterly progress reports on ERSG
        implementation and monthly reports on budget outcomes.
    ·   A cellule d'appui was expected to assist the Finance Minister in the monitoring of ERSG
        and other donor-financed budget support operations.
    ·   Program implementation would be reviewed and supervised by a Technical
        Implementation Committee (TIC) including representatives of Finance, Planning, Good
        Governance, Agriculture and Commerce, the central bank and the PRSP Secretariat.
    ·   A Steering Committee headed by the Vice-President in charge of coordinating economic
        and social reforms and including the Ministers of Finance, Planning, Good Governance,
        Agriculture and Commerce would meet from time to time to review progress of ongoing
        reforms and discuss the policy implications of the program.
    ·   The Bank would monitor the program through supervision missions, including joint
        missions with the IMF and other donors. The Bank's Country Office would also play a
        major role in the day-to-day supervision of ERSG.

After a slow beginning, the partnership framework and the monitoring mechanism envisaged in
the ERSG program have become more functional. The Steering Committee never met but for a



                                                 11

while the Technical Implementation Committee met regularly and took over the policy role
assigned to the Steering Committee. The cellule d'appui operated as the Secretariat of the
Technical Committee, preparing meetings and organizing contacts with donor missions. More
recently, the monitoring of the ERSG program has been assumed by the Ministry of Finance, with
the help of the cellule d'appui. More than six Bank missions visited Burundi during
implementation of the ERSG program to review progress, discuss implementation issues and
prepare a follow-up operation (ERSG 2).


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

A second Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG 2) was approved by the Bank's Executive
Directors in August 2008. Like ERSG 1, ERSG 2 is focused on PFM reforms, private sector
development and reform of the coffee sector. ERSG 2 will be the first in a programmatic series of
development policy grants aimed at supporting the reform process.


3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The ERSG was fully justified by the following considerations: (i) the structural need for increased
budget support and other forms of development assistance for a country whose infrastructure and
productive base had been devastated by a decade of civil war, and which had become one of the
poorest countries in the world; (ii) progress of the peace process and effective management of the
transition to a multi-party system; (iii) generally prudent monetary, fiscal and economic policies
since the beginning of the 2000s; and (iv) the commitment of both the transition government and
the government which took office by the end of 2005 to the poverty reduction objectives of the
interim PRSP, notably through significant increases in social expenditures (mainly for education).

The ERSG program was fully compatible with the objectives of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
discussed by the Executive Directors in May 2005. The ISN emphasized: (i) improved access of
the population to basic social services and income generating activities, in support of the peace
process and the economic reform agenda of the government; and (ii) restoring the foundations for
sustainable growth and poverty alleviation in line with the main goals of the Interim PRSP of
November 2003.




                                                  12

Two important questions, however, have been raised about the scope of the ERSG program:
    ·   was the program realistic considering available institutional capacity; and
    ·   was it fair to ask a new government in a fragile post-conflict situation to address such
        politically sensitive and potentially divisive policy issues as the privatization of public
        enterprises and in particular the privatization of coffee and other export crop sectors?

Complexity of the program considering available institutional capacity. Burundi's civil service
has some capacity. The staff of the Ministry of Finance includes qualified administrators capable
of understanding the objectives of the reforms and helping the government implement the
program. However, the number of highly qualified and experienced personnel remains limited;
the financial management capacity in sector ministries is weak and one should not underestimate
the negative impact of rapid turn-over of managerial and technical staff in key ministries and the
politicization of recruitment and promotions to key positions. Viewed in this context, the reform
agenda proposed by ERSG was far too broad and too complex. Insufficient efforts have been
made to focus the program on a short list of critical issues, and to select a small number of
particularly urgent measures in areas in which substantial progress was feasible within twelve to
eighteen months. In the Burundian context, selectivity should have been a major objective of the
program.

Politically sensitive issues. The recovery of the coffee and tea sectors is an important goal since
these two crops are the main source of cash income for more than 800,000 very poor rural
households and contribute at least 68% of the country's export earnings. However, the reform of
the coffee sector in Burundi is a particularly difficult undertaking, as most of the rebellions of the
post-independence period were at least partly motivated by conflicts between coffee farmers, the
private sector and the government on the structure of the sector and the sharing of benefits
between participants. In this context, privatizing washing stations and other processing facilities
was doomed to fail without a coherent approach to the development of the sector as a whole,
including rehabilitation of ageing plantations, rehabilitation and maintenance of rural
infrastructure, and provision of inputs and technical advice. In addition the reform process should
involve extensive discussions with potential investors and potential buyers of high-quality
Burundian coffee and consultations with all the other stakeholders including representatives of
farmers and local communities. These consultations were organized during the execution of
ERSG, but they should have taken place at the beginning of the process before deciding that
privatization of the processing plant was the adequate response to the crisis of the export crop
sector. Finally, and more importantly, that type of reform cannot succeed without the strong
support of the country's leadership. In this case, the new government inherited a program that
was largely conceived during the transition. As mentioned in the November 2006 OPCS report on
conditionality, most of the policy measures concerning the coffee sector had been decided by the
outgoing government, and since the new government had not been given enough "policy space" it
was unable to fully appropriate the reform agenda. It should be noted, however, that Bank staff
and government officials involved in the preparation of the ERSG program felt constrained by
one of the triggers of the HIPC completion point which provided for selling a majority of
government shares in coffee washing stations. The Bank and the IMF have now agreed to review
the relevance of that trigger, taking into account the scope and timing of the reform process that
has been initiated.

Two other questionable features of the ERSG program are:
    ·   the priority given to the preparation of action plans rather than results-oriented actions;
        and
    ·   the lack of clarity of the PAD, notably the policy matrix.



                                                 13

Strategies and action plans. The ERSG program tends to give priority to the preparation of
pieces of legislation and the adoption of strategies/action plans rather than results-oriented
actions. Close to two thirds of the prior actions, conditions of effectiveness, conditions of second
tranche release and indicators of progress provided for the preparation of studies, reports and
audits, and government approval of decrees, laws, strategies and action plans. This, however, was
probably justifiable in the context of a country which during the transition period had begun to
take a number of measures recommended by individual donors but had not yet developed a
coherent approach to public finance and other economic management issues. In 2005-06, the
government and the Bank felt that there was a strong need for strategies and action plans that
would serve as a basis for the design of future reform programs supported by the Bank and other
donors. While implementation of these action plans was generally slow and sometimes
inadequate, most of them continue to be used by government officials as reference documents for
planning and monitoring the ongoing reform process.

Clarity of documents. The ERSG PAD ­ notably the policy matrix ­ is the main document that
implementing agencies normally use as a basis for monitoring the reform process. Bank staff
should therefore make a special effort to verify that such documents are clear, simple and fully
operational. In this context the matrix of the ERSG PAD is not a good model if only because it
includes too many measures some of which are fully justifiable in the long term but are not
particularly urgent and could probably have been introduced at a later stage.


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

As shown in the Table below (and in the more detailed Annex 6), slow but substantial progress
was made towards most of the public finance management objectives of the ERSG program. Only
modest progress was made towards achieving the other objectives of the program (in particular,
reform of the export crop sector).

                                     Achievement of ERSG objectives

  Overall ERSG objective: Support implementation of PRSP. Strengthen government's capacity to carry out
                                  development and poverty reduction programs
Expected outcome: Increase economic growth to at least 5% in 2007. Reduce incidence of poverty.
Present status: Following a significant increase to 6.1% in 2006, the rate of growth of GDP declined to 3.6%
in 2007 and the average growth for 2006-2007 was only 4.8%. A poor coffee harvest and the deteriorating
political and security situation are largely responsible for the mediocre performance of 2007. The incidence of
poverty, which ­ as a result of the civil war ­ had increased from 35% in 1993 to 68% in 2002 was estimated
at 67% according to a 2006 QUIBB survey. With a population growth rate approaching 3%, the country
clearly needs to embark on policies and programs aimed at accelerating overall economic growth and
increasing output and income in rural areas where 97% of the poor live.



First component: Improve public expenditure management & impact on the poor

                          Objective I: Deepen public expenditure management reforms
Expected outcome: Improve transparency of public expenditure management. Modern budget law framework
that addresses 2004 CFAA weaknesses. The IFMIS covers all public expenditures financed under the national
budget and is secure and adequately maintained. Adoption/implementation of a 3-year reform action plan that
provides a good basis for donor support, in particular those who signed the 2005 MoU on budget support.
Present status: Four critical measures are likely to improve the transparency of public expenditure
management: (i) adoption/implementation of a new Loi Organique; (ii) a more reliable financial management
information system; (iii) improved procurement procedures and practices; and (iv) improved internal controls



                                                      14

and external audits.
- A draft Loi Organique has been approved by the Parliament. It clearly defines institutional responsibilities,
streamlines spending procedures, simplifies ex-ante controls and limits the use of exceptional procedures.
- The government prepares quarterly budget execution reports based on the IFMIS system introduced in
January 2006. The coverage is partial (74% of domestically-financed expenditures in 2007) and data provided
are not fully reliable. The government, the Bank and the IMF are working together to improve coverage and
reliability (extension to the payment phase and integration of the payroll function).
- A new procurement law has been promulgated in February 2008 and new institutions are expected to be in
place by the end of this year.
- General government accounts were submitted to the Court of Accounts in May 2007 (for the 2006 accounts),
and in April 2008 (for the 2007 accounts). Training programs have been organized for the staff of the Court of
Accounts, with help from the Belgian Court. The Burundian Court produced its audit report on the 2006
accounts in December 2007.

A number of other developments will also influence the public finance performance of the government.
- In 2007, the Bank and the government undertook the preparation of a public expenditure management and
financial accountability review (PEMFAR). A draft report was completed in June 2008. It was discussed in
workshops involving government officials, the civil society and other donors in September. Ideally, the review
of the PEMFAR report should provide the basis for PFM action plans that should dominate future government
and donor programs.
- One of the conclusions of the report is that reducing current expenditures and, in particular, the relative size
of the wage bill (in share of GDP) would have a strong positive impact on growth and poverty reduction.
Future government decisions in this critical area will have a major impact on economic and fiscal
performance.
- The recurrence of financial scandals suggests that introducing a culture of transparency will require
considerable efforts on the part of the country's leadership. It should be noted, however, that the government
published the auditor's report on the sale of the presidential aircraft and took strong remedial measures
following unbudgeted and improper payments to a domestic petroleum company.
   Objective II: Increase the level and impact of public spending on the poor in priority sectors. Strengthen
                                           poverty focus of the budget.
Expected outcome: Improve impact of public expenditures on growth and development. Increase share of pro-
poor expenditures in total spending from 33.6% in 2005 budget to 35.5% in 2006 and PRSP targets in 2007.
Improve poverty reduction targeting. HIPC expenditures tracked through IFMIS. For education, health and
justice, results of PETS exercise are available as a basis for action plan to improve services.
Present status:
- Availability of HIPC-financed expenditures and increased project financing by donors led to a significant
increase in capital expenditures from 10.4% of GDP in 2001-04 to 11.2% in 2005-06. Another positive change
in the structure of public spending is the increase in DDR expenditures from 0.3% of GDP in 2001-04 to 2.3%
in 2005-06. The success of the demobilization program is one of the factors that may accelerate economic
growth and should enable the government to further increase spending on priority economic and social sectors
at the expense of defense and other security expenditures.
- So far defense and other security expenditures declined in terms of share of domestically-financed
expenditures but increased in terms of share of GDP from 6.6% in 2001-04 to 7.6% in 2005-06. The share of
priority expenditures (health, education, agriculture and infrastructure) increased from 31.8% of total
expenditures in 2001-04 to 36.1% in 2005-06, and from 5.5% of GDP to 7.8%.
- Education was the main beneficiary of that increase. Its share went up from 23.9% of domestically-financed
expenditures and 4.1% of GDP in 2001-04 to 28.1% of expenditures and 6.1% of GDP in 2005-06. Gross
primary school enrollment rates increased from 80% in 2003-04 to 101% in 2005-06. The profile of new
school children shows that the impact of free education was greater on children from rural areas and poor
households. There was however no significant improvement in the efficiency of education expenditures. The
index of internal efficiency was only 47% in the early 2000s; this is largely due to very high repetition rates of
about 30 %.
- Interim PETS reports are available for education, health and justice and have been distributed to other
donors. Relevant departments have begun to prepare action plans.
Objective III: Strengthen poverty reduction strategy monitoring and evaluation.
Expected outcome: Improve knowledge of poverty. Improve poverty reduction targeting.



                                                      15

Present status: ISTEEBU, the statistical office of Burundi, became member of AFRISTAT in 2007.
AFRISTAT will help ISTEEBU perform specific tasks and improve its capacity. Currently ISTEEBU has
undertaken a review of Burundi's national accounts for 2005. A specific codification has been added to the
Plan Budgétaire et Comptable for HIPC-financed and poverty reduction expenditures. In addition, a new,
more precise, methodology has been developed in 2007 for the identification of poverty reduction
expenditures. This will facilitate the analysis and monitoring of the poverty reduction impact of planned
budgets and actual public spending. A PSIA exercise is planned for FY 2009. It will focus on the potential
impact on the poor of the proposed coffee sector reform, when ongoing restructuring studies are completed
and the government has selected a specific option for the disengagement of the State.


Second Component: Accelerate sustainable economic growth.
Objective I: Reform the coffee, tea and cotton sectors.
Expected outcome: Accelerate sector growth. Increase sector contribution to poverty reduction. No
government guarantee for financing 2006-07 coffee season. Adoption of action plans/reform strategies for
coffee, tea and cotton. Launching of bidding process for coffee washing stations & SODECO-managed
factories.
Present status:
- The export crop sector provides cash income to more than 800,000 households in the poorer regions of the
country. Annual variations in coffee production (due to ageing plantations) are the main factor influencing the
output of the export crop sector, which never reached again the peak of 4.1% of GDP in 2004. Consequently,
coffee and other export crops did not make a significant contribution to economic growth and poverty
reduction during the ERSG implementation period.
- In the coffee sector, a major setback was the decision of the government to give a New-York based trader a
marketing monopoly, a decision which was in conflict with liberalization measures adopted in the context of
earlier programs. Studies and consultations with potential buyers have shown that the Burundian coffee has
potential for sales on specialty markets, but no progress was made towards the restructuring of the filière. In
June 2008 a group of consultants coordinated by an investment bank was hired to identify alternative
approaches to the disengagement of the State from the coffee sector. A final report is expected to be available
in December 2008 and will be used by the government to select and implement what will be viewed as the best
option.
- Virtually nothing has been done to implement reforms in the tea and cotton sectors. As the restructuring of
the coffee sector proved to be particularly difficult, the government and donors felt that the reform of the tea
and cotton sectors, which was viewed as less urgent, should be resumed at a later stage, taking into account the
lessons of experience with the reform of the coffee sector.
Objective II: Improve private sector environment. Promote private sector development. Increase
attractiveness for national and foreign investment.
Expected outcome: Increase private sector/GDP ratio by ½ percentage point per year. Increase non-coffee
export/GDP ratio, Public/private sector consultation framework in place. Modern legal and regulatory
framework for private sector operations in place. Investment Climate Assessment available as a basis for
action plan. Adoption/implementation of strategy for settling domestic arrears to private sector including
banks.
Present status:
- Private sector investment increased from 2.7% of GDP in 2004 to 4% in 2005 and 8% in 2006. The share of
non-coffee exports increased from 59% in 2005 to 60% in 2006, but the main factor was the decline in coffee
output and exports rather than a significant increase in non-coffee exports.
- A June 2008 decree established a public/private sector consultation framework. An insolvency law has been
approved by the Parliament. A new investment code has been submitted to the Parliament. The revision of the
laws on competition and on public/private companies is ongoing as part of an indicative trigger for the third
ERSG (ERSG 3) under preparation. The government plans to strengthen the tribunal of commerce.
- A draft investment climate assessment report has been reviewed by a technical committee and Bank staff. It
will soon be submitted to the government for approval.
- The most positive contribution to private sector development was the settling of government arrears.
Following an audit of outstanding arrears a settlement strategy was adopted and implemented in 2006-07.
Small creditors were paid up to FBu 100 millions. Large creditors (banks) took 5 year/9% government bonds.
 Objective III: Reform public enterprises, through privatization and private/public partnerships. Set-up sound



                                                        16

               institutional framework for privatization. Prepare sound privatization program.
Expected outcome: The data base on public enterprises is up-to-date and accessible. Simple institutional
framework for privatization in place. Improved capacity of SCEP. Adoption of disengagement plan. Bidding
process for sale of shares in Société Hôtelière Nouvelle du Burundi relaunched. Bidding process for sale of
government shares in APB, EPB, UCAR and OPHAVET launched.
Present status: A database on public enterprises was completed in 2007. The government created a
privatization committee chaired by the second Vice President. The EMSP project financed a capacity-building
program for SCEP. Bidding process for Société Hôtelière was re-launched but did not attract sound investment
proposals. A number of small-size public enterprises have been liquidated or sold.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

As documented in detail in section 3.2 and summarized further below, the grant and the Trust
Fund (TF) co-financing achieved their overarching objectives of supporting PRSP
implementation and strengthening government capacity. In particular, the grant and TF achieved
satisfactory outcomes under the three objectives linked to public expenditure management, pro-
poor expenditure allocation, and PRSP monitoring. By contrast, outcomes were unsatisfactory
regarding the objective of reforming the coffee sector and other cash crops, as overly ambitious
reform plans needed to be reviewed and adapted by the government elected in 2006. Moderately
satisfactory outcomes were achieved under the two remaining objectives for private sector
development and public enterprise reform. On balance, the grant therefore achieved a moderately
satisfactory outcome across its two components and six different objectives.

Component 1: Improve public expenditure management and impact on the poor. Satisfactory.
Slow but substantial progress has been made towards the public finance management objectives
of the ERSG program, as follows:
    ·    With respect to the first objective of this component, the National Assembly adopted a
         modern budget framework, the government promulgated a new procurement code,
         improved gradually the financial management information system, produced quarterly
         budget reports in a timely manner and strengthened the Court of Accounts. These
         measures have resulted in significant improvements in the PFM system, enhancing
         transparency, accountability and oversight in a challenging post-conflict environment.
    ·    With respect to the second objective, the government achieved (and the recent PEMFAR
         report documented) a gradual increase in the share of priority economic and social sectors
         in budget laws and actual spending, leading to dramatic improvements in primary school
         enrollment rates. This can be seen as one of the most successful part of the program as
         the reforms not only impacted the fiduciary aspects of PFM management but reoriented
         resource allocations toward poverty reducing expenditures and service delivery.
    ·    In relation to the third objective, statistical systems have been strengthened in
         collaboration with AFRISTAT and the government is tracking poverty reduction
         expenditures through specific markers. A preliminary PETS has been conducted for the
         education, health and justice sectors.

These different results are being consolidated with additional efforts to help the government
further improve its PFM system by increasing its transparency and making the country's public
expenditure and public investment program a more powerful instrument of growth and poverty
reduction.

Component 2: Accelerate sustainable economic growth. Moderately unsatisfactory.




                                                    17

Progress under the second component was mixed. Only modest or negligible results were
achieved for crop reforms. Moderately satisfactory results have been observed in the areas of
private sector and public enterprise reforms. In particular:

    ·   Regarding the first objective of this component, the government adopted an action plan
        for the reform of the coffee sector but did not implement most of the measures envisaged
        in the plan. As mentioned earlier, it was probably unrealistic to expect a new government
        to address forcefully such politically sensitive and divisive issues as the privatization of
        the washing stations. It is hoped that the ongoing effort to help the government identify
        and select effective and realistic options for restructuring the coffee sector will give a
        new impetus to the reform process and will serve as a model for other export crops
        including tea, where no progress was made.
    ·   Regarding the second objective, outcomes were fully achieved regarding the domestic
        arrears settlement. These constitute a critical step toward normalization of government
        relations with the private sector. In addition, the government advanced the private sector
        agenda through a new consultation framework. On the regulatory side, some progress
        was made with the adoption of a new insolvency law, but other initiatives (new
        investment and competition laws) are expected to be only approved and promulgated
        within the next few months.
    ·   The EMSP project helped finance a database on public enterprises and a capacity-
        building program for SCEP, the agency responsible for managing public enterprises and
        the government privatization program. A few small public enterprises were liquidated or
        privatized. The bidding process for the sale of Société Hôtelière was re-launched but did
        not mobilize attractive investment proposals.


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
So far, implementation of the ERSG program probably did not do much to reduce the incidence
of poverty. The rate of growth of GDP went up from 0.9 percent in 2005 to 6.1 percent in 2006
but declined again to 3.6 percent in 2007, i.e. an average of 4.8 percent in 2006-07, close to two
percentage points over the country's population growth rate. However, the declining share of the
primary sector in total GDP (from 49 percent in 2004 to 45 percent in 2005 and 2006) suggests
that the average per capita income in rural areas, where 97 percent of the poor live, did not
improve. Insecurity, inadequate rural infrastructure and the steady decline of the export crop
sectors are the main factors. The ERSG program, however, had a positive impact on access of the
poor to social services, notably education. The profile of the new school children shows that the
impact of free primary education and increased primary school enrollments was greater on
children from rural areas and poor households and the ratio of girls to boys improved from 0.79 in
2003 to 0.83 in 2006. The elimination of user fees for women in delivery and children under 5
should help reduce maternal and child mortality rates particularly in poor rural areas. However,
only a major rural infrastructure rehabilitation program combined with vigorous efforts to revive
the coffee sector ­ through privatization or through other sector restructuring schemes ­ will have
a major impact on rural poverty.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Combined with implementation of the restructured EMSP project, implementation of the ERSG
program helped improve the capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to develop and use
more effective public expenditure management procedures and information systems. The recently
approved Organic Law will put in place a modern budget preparation and execution system with



                                                 18

streamlined procedures and simplified ex-ante controls. It will pave the way for a more effective
contribution of key sector ministries to budget preparation and execution. Improving procurement
procedures and institutions and strengthening the Court of Accounts and the Inspection Générale
de l'Etat are critical elements of the fight against corruption.

Another important achievement of the ERSG program was also to strengthen the National
Institute of Statistics (ISTEEBU) to improve the monitoring of economic development and
poverty reduction programs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

No other significant outcome.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

So far no beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop has been organized to discuss the impact of
ERSG.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial.

Although the government took a long time to fully implement the financial management policy
and institutional measures envisaged in ERSG, it remains committed to the overall objectives of
the program and is likely to implement ­ at its own pace ­ most of the public finance and other
reforms envisaged in the PEMFAR report. The views of the government on privatization of
public enterprises and the restructuring of the export crop sector are less clear. Selection and
implementation of a new disengagement strategy based on alternative options that high-level
consultants will propose to the government by the end of 2008 will be the most appropriate test of
its commitment.

Continued insecurity in rural areas may impede economic development. The elections of 2010
may stir up tensions among communities and political groups and derail the progress of the
reform process.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

As mentioned earlier, the ERSG program responded to critical financial needs in a difficult
transition to a newly elected government and incorporated a set of critical economic and public
finance management measures with strong impact on expenditure composition and management.
The program attracted two co-financiers who made important additional financial contributions to
enable the government to stay its course. Another positive point relates to the Bank's response to
the governance challenges arising at the time of appraisal (sale of presidential plane). Bank staff
constructively incorporated the related governance response into the program, which resulted in
some delay but rebuilt sufficient trust to not jeopardize program financing by the Bank and



                                                  19

donors. ESRG also launched a critical process of policy development in several areas of
economic management. However, quality at entry was weakened by an insufficient focus on the
most urgent issues and lack of attention to the ownership issue in the transition to the new
government, which took office in 2005. In this regard, the export crop reform program was
particularly weak and overly optimistic in neglecting the need for extensive stakeholder
involvement.

(b) Quality of Supervision


Rating: Satisfactory

Major efforts were made by headquarters and local Bank staff to help the government better
understand the objectives of the program and implement the most critical measures.

    ·   The ongoing IDA-financed EMSP project was restructured to help the government
        finance studies, activities and capacity-building programs necessary to implement ERSG.
        EMSP-financed TA sub-projects are partly responsible for much of the progress achieved
        in implementing the public finance management component of the program. The EMSP
        project is currently used to finance high-level consultants to help the government identify
        the most appropriate option for disengagement from the coffee sector. It should be noted,
        however, that the EMSP restructuring operation did not remove a major obstacle to a
        more effective use of project resources: the government argues that slow implementation
        of a number of ERSG reforms was caused by delays in the review by Bank staff of sub-
        project proposals, proposed TORs, and decisions concerning the selection of consultants.
    ·   Headquarters economists were heavily involved in the monitoring of the program either
        through supervision missions or in the context of other exercises (joint Bank/IMF visits,
        preparation of the PEMFAR report, preparation and appraisal of ERSG 2).
    ·   In addition to the Country Manager, a Bujumbura-based procurement specialist and an
        economist recruited a few months before approval of ERSG also played a major role in
        the supervision of the program.
    ·   As was the case at entry, when new governance challenges in the petroleum sector
        emerged at the time of tranche release, the Bank assisted government counterparts to
        establish a credible process of establishing culpability and pursuing the perpetrators.
    ·   Finally, while headquarters sector specialists did not make a significant contribution to
        the design of the program, they were much more involved in its supervision. A parallel
        study on sources of growth in rural areas showed that Burundi's coffee had potential for
        penetrating high-value specialty markets and helped design the action plan that was not
        implemented immediately but may eventually lead to a positive outcome.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The program was technically sound, although too ambitious and too complicated considering the
country's fragile political situation and the lack of financial management and policy design
capacity in key ministries. Bank supervision by headquarters and local staff was effective and
helped salvage the most critical and the most urgent components of the overall program.

                                                 20

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The transition government made a useful contribution to the design of the program but the new
government which took office in September 2005 focused its attention on urgent and complex
political issues and was not really given the opportunity to discuss in detail the main objectives
and components of the program and in particular the scope of the export crop reform component.

The government should be credited for having implemented in a timely fashion critical prior
actions, including the rapid introduction of a computerized financial management information
system and the preparation of budgets reflecting a significant increase in pro-poor expenditures.
Many other important public finance management measures were implemented but at a very slow
pace, as the security situation deteriorated again and the Parliament stopped considering draft
laws and policy proposals during most of 2007. The recurrence of major financial scandals in
2006 and 2007 influenced the perception of donors and the civil society on the capacity of the
government to support a culture of transparency in the management of the public service. Special
efforts need to be made at all levels of the government to improve the credibility of the country in
this area. The discussion of the recent governance survey and the preparation of a national
governance strategy will enable the Bank and the donor community to test the commitment of the
country's leadership to the fight against corruption.

The government performance in implementing the export crop reform program was clearly
unsatisfactory but the blame should be shared with the Bank which had not done its homework
during preparation of that component.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Ministry of Finance was the implementing agency responsible for the ERSG program.
Despite significant capacity problems, the Ministry made adequate efforts to implement a
comprehensive public finance management reform program and help persuade other ministries to
do their share of the effort. The creation of a cellule d'appui to monitor the PFM reform agenda
and help coordinate donor-financed budget support proved to be a useful instrument for the
supervision of the ERSG program.

These accomplishments, however, were tarnished by the involvement of the former Finance
Minister and the former Governor of the Central Bank in the Interpetrol scandal.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

On balance, the government implemented most of the measures envisaged in the public finance
management program, but did very little on all the other components of ERSG.


6. Lessons Learned

Special attention to the needs and constraints of fragile post-conflict countries. In Burundi and
in many other post-conflict countries the transition to more development-oriented strategies is a
long and complicated process and the special needs of these countries should be reflected in the
design and implementation of Bank-supported reform programs. For many years, governments


                                                 21

emerging from long civil wars will give priority to security and to the success of the
reconciliation process. Development policies are an important instrument of the reconciliation
process, but adequate time should be given to governments and the civil society to reach a
consensus on critical development issues and to complete a limited number of high-priority
reforms. Implementation of these reforms will need to be carefully monitored and supported by
the Bank which should allocate enough resources to the supervision of the programs and to the
provision of high-quality technical assistance. Recent experience in Burundi and other post-
conflict countries has also shown that governments should not be urged to address politically
divisive issues that could exacerbate the risk of renewed open conflicts. The reform of the export
crop sector is one of the measures that should have been better prepared both technically and
politically by engaging extensive discussions with the new government which took office in 2005
and all the other stakeholders before deciding that privatization was the appropriate solution.

Need to combine several operational instruments. The relative success of the public finance
management components of the program is partly due to the combination of policy reforms
supported by the ERSG grant and technical assistance activities financed by the restructured
EMSP project. It could also be argued that a sector investment project financing the rehabilitation
of coffee plantations, washing plants and rural infrastructure would have provided useful
additional support to the agricultural sector reforms envisaged in the ERSG program and would
have done more to help 800,000 poor families than unrealistic privatization programs.

Need to involve sector specialists in the design of DPLs. Bank country economists did most of
the preparation work even on sector policies with minimal support from sector specialists.
Agricultural sector specialists would have spent more time on the preparation of the agricultural
component of the grant if the ERSG program had been combined with sector work and project
preparation activity aimed at developing an agricultural sector development project or program
(see previous paragraph).

Need to improve the performance of TA programs supporting policy reforms. As shown in
section 7 below, the government recognizes the important role Bank-financed TA played in
helping implement the ERSG program but complains that overly complex procedures and delays
in approving sub-projects, terms of reference (TORs) and the selection of consultants delayed
implementation of critical reforms. Bank evaluations of these TA projects should focus on these
issues. At the same time, the Bank should recognize the high cost to Bank staff of the supervision
of complex TA projects. The review of sub-projects, preparation of TORs and the review of draft
contracts with consultants is a time consuming activity, which ideally should be simplified.

Need for a better balance between the development of social sectors and growth-oriented
infrastructure expenditure programs. The availability of HIPC funds enabled the government to
increase public expenditures in the social sectors, particularly education. However, while public
spending on education increased to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2005-06, public spending on
agriculture and infrastructure remained at very low levels (respectively 0.3 and 0.6 percent of
GDP). In the situation of Burundi, stimulating economic growth is at least as important and
probably more urgent than rapid increases in social expenditures.

Need for comprehensive strategies and action plans endorsed by the government, the civil
society and the country's development partners. With the help of EMSP, the ERSG program
produced a number of studies, policy papers and action plans that have not always been
implemented effectively but serve as reference for government and Bank monitoring of the
reform process. Now the main priority is to develop an overall policy framework that will be
supported by all the stakeholders, including donors. The preparation and recent approval of the



                                                 22

PEMFAR report is expected to play that role, at least in the public finance management area.
However, the PEMFAR report focuses on domestically-financed public expenditures and
provides little guidance on the structure of donor-funded investment programs and projects. The
lack of reliable data is a major obstacle to that exercise. The Bank may wish to discuss with the
government and its partners the feasibility of a joint public investment review that would be
prepared with the help of experienced sector specialists from the Bank and other donors. A sound
public investment program is one of the keys to optimizing implementation of a growth-oriented
development strategy.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
Bank staff discussed the performance of the ERSG program and the main findings and
conclusions of the ICR with a Burundian delegation during the recent Bank/IMF Annual Meeting
in October 2008. The comments of the delegation ­ which were subsequently confirmed in
writing by the Finance Minister (Annex 4) ­ concerned: (i) the design of the ERSG program; (ii)
the supervision performance of the Bank and the role of Bank-financed technical assistance; and
(iii) the overall impact of the program.

Design. The government recognizes that most of the measures included in ERSG were designed
in close cooperation with the departments concerned. However, the final result was an over-
ambitious reform package including too many measures, which per se were fully justified but
could not possibly be completed in one or two years.

     ·    The timetable of specific components of the ERSG program was particularly unrealistic.
          Much more time was needed to prepare and implement the reform of the coffee sector.
     ·    The privatization of public enterprises should have been better prepared through the
          definition of a comprehensive privatization strategy and detailed evaluation of assets and
          prospects of individual enterprises.
     ·    The problem was exacerbated by the fact that many other donors providing budget
          support also had their own package of reforms that had to be implemented during the
          same period. Clearly, government institutions did not have the capacity to carry out all
          these measures at the same time.
     ·    Better coordination of donor-financed budget support and harmonization of
          conditionalities along the lines of the Paris Declaration is therefore essential to strengthen
          government performance and increase the effectiveness of critical policy reforms. It is
          hoped that the recently approved PEMFAR report will help develop a consensus on PFM
          reform priorities and will produce a common list of reform measures to be supported by
          all the donors.

Performance of the Bank. The government recognizes that both headquarters and local staff were
very helpful during ERSG implementation, reviewing periodically the progress of the reform
program with government institutions, providing sound advice on all major issues and helping
mobilize appropriate technical support. As already mentioned, the government thinks that Bank
technical support, and in particular implementation of the EMSP project, would have been more
effective if procurement procedures were less complicated and Bank responses to consultations
on sub-project proposals, TORs, selection of consultations and terms of contracts were provided
more rapidly.




                                                   23

Impact. Despite some shortcomings, the ERSG program had a most positive impact on economic,
fiscal and PFM policies and performance. Some of the most important reforms were:

    ·   the preparation of a Loi Organique, which establishes a more modern, budget
        management framework;
    ·   the introduction of a computerized financial management information system;
    ·   the settlement of government arrears to the private sector; and
    ·   the recognition by the government that coffee farmers and their associations should
        become the main actors in the management of the filière.

(b) Cofinanciers

Officials in Dutch and Norwegian institutions which provided budget support to Burundi in the
context of the ERSG program have been asked to comment on the design, implementation
performance and impact of ERSG. The report was sent to them. The Dutch Chargé d'Affaires in
Burundi wrote that she shared the conclusions and recommendations of the report which - in its
present form - provides a comprehensive analysis of the ERSG program. She noted, however, that
the report should have been more explicit on the factors explaining the relative failure of a
number of specific measures. No comments have been received so far from the Norwegians.

It should be noted that both The Netherlands and Norway continue to support the type of reforms
envisaged in ERSG and, in particular, agreed to contribute to the follow-up program (ERSG 2).

An early draft of the report was sent for comments to officials in Dutch and Norwegian
institutions which provided budget support to Burundi in the context of the ERSG program. The
Dutch Chargé d'Affaires in Burundi wrote the following.

         Thank you again for asking us for comments on the IRC-report on ERSG (I, I assume). The report
         seems to me a thorough and comprehensive review of the ERSG. The only thing missing - in my
         view - are short analyses of why certain conditions have only been met "generally" and progress
         only been "modest"/"no(t) significant"/"not yet been implemented". Furthermore, the pages on the
         "achievement of the ERSG objectives" seem rather descriptive and would profit from more
         emphasis on the "why" of the gaps between "expected outcome" and "present status".


         With best regards,

c)Improve procurement  Adoption of monitoring indicators to track    11. A new procurement law was promulgated in February 2008. A government
                       performance in terms of competition &         ordinance created the Regulation Agency that will coordinate and monitor procurement

e)Improve internal       Strategy for internal control and ex-post audit 14. The Loi Organique and the PEMFAR report provide the elements of an internal
control & audit          available for implementation in 2007            control and external audit strategy.
                         Capacity building program for internal control  15. With the help of the Belgian Court of Accounts and IDA-supported TA, specialized
                         & audit institutions available for              training programs have been organized for CdC magistrates and staff. As its resources
                         implementation in 2007                          remain limited, the Burundian Court decided to focus its attention on auditing annual
                         Follow up by Presidency of IGF                  government accounts. The EMSP project financed selected training for CdC and IGE

f)Improve external       Annual audit report of government accounts      17. As mentioned under 12, the general budget account and extrabudgetary accounts for
oversight                by the Audit Court submitted to Parliament &    2006 were submitted to the Court of Accounts in May 2007. The Court produced its
                         made public;                                    audit report in December 2007. The general budget account for 2007 is under review by
                         Statute of magistrates guarantees               the Court.
                         irremovability Staffing strengthened            18. Training, manuals and experience helped build-up the capacity of the Court of
                         Methodological guidelines & manual provide      Accounts. As the Inspection Générale de l'Etat is already member of INTOSAI and
                         adequate reference for auditors                 does not want to give up that privilege, the Court was unable to become a member of
                         Membership into INTOSAI gives access to         that institution.
