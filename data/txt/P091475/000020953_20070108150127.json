by\n            supporting key policy measures aimed at a) improving public\n            expenditure management and their impact on the poor; and, b)\n            accelerating growth. In particular, the operation is\n            expected to translate into improved services for the poor\n            and greater well being of the population, and, increased\n            income-generating activities - employment opportunities\n            through private sector development and State disengagement -\n            as well as increased producer income, through coffee, tea\n            and cotton sector reforms.
