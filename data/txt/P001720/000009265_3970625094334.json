{"cdata!": "The Second Forestry Project addresses\n            the increasingly real threat of deforestation in many parts\n            of Mali through a combination of urban and rural\n            initiatives. For the urban market, tax reforms will\n            influence demand by increasing the consumer price of wood in\n            Bamako and elsewhere while wood supply will be improved\n            through the plantation component. In rural areas market\n            interventions are inappropriate and technical solutions are\n            scarce. Accordingly, the project will finance two pilot\n            schemes aimed at developing guidelines for managing the\n            national forest. The project would also provide technical\n            assistance to the Forestry Department and finance studies to\n            improve knowledge of the sector."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
