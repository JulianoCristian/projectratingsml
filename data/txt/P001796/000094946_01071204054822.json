Lessons convey the\n            following. The need for clear objectives at appraisal, is\n            once again being reinforced, particularly important if, as\n            in this case, the weight of preparation predominantly fell\n            on Bank staff, and consultants, rather than on the\n            Government itself. Consequently, during implementation, it\n            appeared the Government was not prepared to use project\n            funds for expenditures such as emergency, and technical\n            assistance, although funding provision was included. Thus,\n            the Bank should support the Government in seeking a blend of\n            credit, and grant funding through co-financing for\n            operations requiring substantial assistance as specified\n            above, in partnership with nongovernmental organizations.\n            While the project was designed as a three year pilot\n            operation, it turned into a seven year rural development\n            operation, and although there is recognition for its\n            management flexibility, it is suggested pilot activities\n            should be limited in size, with provision for effective\n            monitoring, and evaluation systems, backed by strong Bank\n            supervision. Nonetheless, following restructuring, the\n            project focused on micro-projects, primarily on the\n            rehabilitation, and development of social, and rural\n            infrastructure, proving that simple, targeted activities\n            greatly contribute to the success of such operations. As for\n            land use mapping, project design should ensure that such an\n            expensive tool, be part of a comprehensive strategy for land\n            policy development."}, "docdt": "2001-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
