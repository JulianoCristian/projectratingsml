The\n            objective of the project is to undertake pilot activities to\n            support decentralized rural economic recovery, while\n            simultaneously creating the capacity and procedures\n            necessary to respond to the challenges of post-war national\n            reconstruction. The RRP has been designed to be flexible so\n            it can respond to the changes likely to occur during the\n            life of the project. The design of the management and\n            implementation of the project benefited from the experiences\n            of past projects in Mozambique. The project has four\n            components. The Support for Decentralization Component\n            includes a pilot activity to test procedures for\n            identifying, funding, and implementing community-based\n            investment subprojects.  The Lands Component will improve\n            land use information and will support the development of\n            policies to demarcate smallholder lands. The Distribution of\n            Agpacks Component will provide seeds and hand tools to\n            smallholders returning to their traditional lands after the\n            war. The Rural Water Supply Component will increase the\n            coverage of the rural water supply, improve the organization\n            and management of provincial water supply institutions, and\n            stimulate community participation in the operation and\n            maintenance of the systems."}, "docdt": "1993-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
