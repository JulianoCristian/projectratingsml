the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned from\n            the project: A dedicated project unit responsible for\n            implementation was critical, though the implications of\n            scaling up were not sufficiently understood. The need for a\n            more comprehensive and accurate definition and monitoring of\n            project outcomes. Supervision must have an adequate focus on\n            issues related to procurement and financial management. The\n            involvement of partner institutions was critical for\n            implementation and encouraging participation of\n            disadvantaged communities. Mobilizing community partnerships\n            and the participation of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)\n            will require strong commitment from the state. There is need\n            to understand the connections between teacher training and\n            improving quality of classroom practice. Project design must\n            be inclusive of state structures."}, "docdt": "2006-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
