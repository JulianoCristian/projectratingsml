       of existing transport infrastructure. This will be\n            accomplished by the rehabilitation and widening of selected\n            existing radial roads leading into the San Jose Central\n            Business District (CBD); the construction of one new radial;\n            the improvement of CBD intersections and selected streets to\n            increase traffic bearing capacity in conjunction with the\n            radial improvement program; and a new CBD traffic signal\n            system. Special peak hour bus lanes and other features to\n            facilitate bus traffic are incorporated into the design of\n            the project. Equipment will be provided for road\n            maintenance, traffic management and regulation enforcement\n            and bus inspection, and training and technical assistance\n            will be provided to improve local capacity to manage the\n            program, continue improving public transport and plan for\n            future growth of the city."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
