Government's program for expanding junior secondary\n            education and providing education opportunities in rural\n            areas. It will also improve secondary school maintenance.\n            The project will include: (a) construction and equipping\n            eight new junior secondary schools in rural areas; (b)\n            strengthening the program for maintenance of secondary\n            schools; and (c) project administration. The Norwegian\n            Agency for International Development will provide 35\n            man-years of technical assistance for project administration\n            and the school maintenance program. The eight new schools\n            will provide over 3,120 additional student places and help\n            arrest a decline in the percentage of students progressing\n            from primary to junior secondary levels."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
