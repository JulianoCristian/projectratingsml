Private Sector\n            Development Project (EPSDP I). The additional financing\n            grant provided through the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF)\n            will help meet the financing gap required to complete the\n            implementation of the EPSDP's two telecom components:\n            'upgrading of selected parts of telecommunications\n            infrastructure for the payments system,' referred to as\n            Iraqi Inter-Banking Network (IIBN), and 'rehabilitation\n            of selected parts of national telecommunications\n            network,' referred to as Microwave Network (MWN).\n            Specifically, it will cover the gap created by the\n            depreciation of the Dollar to Euro exchange rate and\n            contract variations in the MWN contract, and provide\n            contingency funds for possible contract variations for the\n            IIBN and for future fluctuations in the exchange rate of the\n            MWN contract. The project became effective on December 6,\n            2004 and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2009. After\n            experiencing initial long delays, the project has shown\n            encouraging progress in 2008. Disbursements have increased\n            from 9 percent in February 2008 to 41.6 percent by\n            mid-October 2008. The project is expected to be fully\n            disbursed by the project closing date. The implementation\n            progress rating of the project has recently been upgraded to\n            'moderately satisfactory' from 'moderately\n            unsatisfactory'. The project management teams (PMTs)\n            have strengthened their skills and staffing; have earned\n            experience over the past years, and are now better equipped\n            to effectively manage project implementation."}, "docdt": "2008-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
