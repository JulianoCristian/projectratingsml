                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project Restructuring. The project restructuring needs to be processed quickly in order to allow the client to launch all the consultancies.

                         i.         Process and review of the new implementation plan. The mission reviewed the draft Restructuring Paper and updated the Status of Project Implementation, as well as the
                         list of activities to be completed by the proposed closing date.

                         ii.       Allocation of additional funds ($1.5m from the Ministry of Planning). PMT informed the mission that Ministry of Planning has agreed in principle to transfer an additional $1.5
                         million to the Telecom component of the project. The project team, in presence of project stakeholders, agreed on allocating these additional resources to Consultant Services
                         (Category 2.c for $1.1 million) and Operating Costs (Category 3.c for $0.4 million) respectively. The mission requested PMT to submit this letter from Ministry of Planning about
                         transfer of $1.5 Million to The World Bank so that this additional fund may be included in the restructuring proposal.
