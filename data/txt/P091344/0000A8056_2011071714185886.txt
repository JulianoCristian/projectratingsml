                         As of December 7, 2010, overall disbursements stand at $57.40 million or 88.3%. The total allocated amount for the project is $65 million.

                         The Project was restructured to accommodate: (i) additional capacity building and TA for the PSD and Telecom component respectively; (ii) reallocation of proceeds (including
                         replenishment of the operating budget of PMT); and (iii) extension of the closing date to March 31, 2012. Funding for the additional TA uses "savings" from the additional financing of
                         US$10 million as a result of stabilization of the Euro vs. Dollar exchange rate. The restructuring was approved by the RVP on March 31, 2010.

                         The current closing date of project is March 31, 2012.
