Project for Republic of Iraq were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: in post-conflict\n            settings, project preparation should proceed from as robust\n            data as it is possible to obtain, along with a detailed\n            analysis of the actual situation on the ground, particularly\n            institutional issues and constraints. The decision to launch\n            a project of this type with various components covering\n            distinct sectors should be made only if there is a basic\n            implementation capacity available in the respective\n            ministries and preferably if champions in those ministries\n            can be identified during preparation. In addition, the\n            reforms to be undertaken should not be too complex for the\n            available capacity. Finally, such a multi-sectoral project\n            requires skillful, hands-on management from the Bank side to\n            promote the needed coordination, collaboration, and\n            communication across sectors and Bank unit teams. It is\n            unclear whether a project based on World Bank investment\n            lending procedures was appropriate so soon in the\n            post-conflict and fragile conditions evident in Iraq after\n            2003. In a similar post-conflict situation in the future, it\n            may be more useful to find ways to help the public sector\n            strengthen its internal policies, systems, and processes\n            first through Bank-provided or -financed training despite\n            pressure for quick project implementation. In similar post\n            conflict settings, telecom infrastructure investment should\n            always be complemented with this type of technical\n            assistance (TA) in order to maximize impact (increased\n            usage, penetration, etc.) and economic gains. The success of\n            the project is linked to the overall effort that was\n            sustained over time, in a context of political turmoil and\n            uncertainty. While focusing on emergency needs, the project\n            was also able to address capacity building issues and to set\n            the basis for effective institutional strengthening. In\n            countries with an unstable political environment such as\n            Iraq, keeping the scope of projects straightforward and\n            simple is essential. Private sector development (PSD) should\n            be included in the Bank's initial support for fragile\n            and post conflict environments. A focus on reconstruction\n            and capacity building for PSD institutions and the\n            establishment of functioning markets can play a key part in\n            development of the twenty two private sector and generate\n            jobs on this ground."}, "docdt": "2012-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
