                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation Status for the PSD components:

                         Components I and II (PSD) were completed in 2009/10. The Institutional Strengthening for Private Sector Support contract was completed in June 2010. For the Economic

                         Development Fund (EDF) the contractor delivered on all the deliverables, as amended, with the final report submitted in August 2009. In April 2011 the Ministry for Planning agreed in
                         writing to transfer responsibility for oversight of EDF to the Ministry for Finance. However, this transfer did not take place and the EDF at the MOPDC was formally closed in 2011.

                         All deliverables for the Industrial Zones component were completed by the consultant in 2010. These includes detailed plans for two Industrial Zones (in Erbil and Basra) and draft
                         Industrial Zone legislation which are being considered and reviewed by the Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government (for Erbil). In late 2012 UNIDO initiated a related
                         project for Special Economic Zones which is supported by the Italian Government. UNIDO has agreed to take forward the draft legislation and plans as part of their project.

                         Implementation Status for the Telecom components:

                         Under the telecommunications components, the communications component III has been completed: both the Iraq Inter-Banking Network (IIBN) and the Microwave Network (MWN)
                         became operational. IIBN has been installed and commissioned at 35 sites as targeted. The network has been tested and applications for payment, real-time gross settlement, and
                         check-enabled systems have been launched. The MWN has been installed and commissioned at 56 sites in the northern, southern and western regions, connecting 10 major cities
                         and around 20 million people. All the three regional routes have been tested and are in use. There were quality issues with some of the MWN towers but these have been corrected.
                         Overall, the new ICT infrastructure has been successfully implemented. The project's closing date was extended in 2010 to provide additional technical assistance under Component
                         IV, in particular, to strengthen the institutional capacity of key Iraqi communications sector institutions.

                         Over the past 12 months, the Telecom agenda has been moving forward at a satisfactory pace, thanks to relative political stability, a pro-active Minister of Communications, and
                         coordination between the World Bank team and various stakeholders including CMC, MOC, Private Sector, and the US State Department. The project has achieved most of its
                         objectives. Two activities are expected to be worked upon until the close of project: (i) technical assistance to support telecom sector reform in Iraq; and (ii) support for rehabilitation
                         of IIBN after damage to the core network of IIBN due to insurgent attacks on Central Bank of Iraq.

                         Overall, disbursement is at 92%. The current closing date of project is May 29, 2012.
