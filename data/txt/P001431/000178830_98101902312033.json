strengthen the newly created government Forestry\n            Development Authority (FDA), introduce a proper framework\n            for forestry development and management and train Liberians\n            in the forestry sector to ensure that: (a) Liberia improves\n            its benefits from the exploitation of one of its principal\n            natural resources; and (b) Liberians participate more fully\n            in the development of the forestry industry. The project\n            would provide FDA with increased staff, buildings, vehicles,\n            equipment, and staff training as well as technical\n            assistance required to undertake various policy studies. The\n            project would also establish a 1,600 ha industrial trial\n            plantation of fast-growing commercial species. The principal\n            benefits of the project would be increase Government revenue\n            from forest taxes and improved Government capability to\n            formulate and implement rational forest policies and\n            investment programs. The trial plantation under the project\n            may lead to development of a large-scale industrial\n            plantation and possibly the establishment of a pulp industry\n            in Liberia."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
