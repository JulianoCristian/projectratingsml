Project is\n            intended to facilitate the completion of the privatization\n            of ZCCM (Zambia Consolidate Copper Mines) by supporting the\n            provision of efficient and reliable water supply services,\n            wastewater services and solid waste management in five mine\n            townships during a transitional period following the\n            privatization. There are three project components. The first\n            and second components will be implemented through the AHC\n            Mining Municipal Services (AHC-MMS) and the third component\n            through the Ministry of Local Government and Housing. The\n            first component consists of a) Performance Based Management\n            Contract, which will be managed between the AHC-MMS and the\n            private operator; b) Production Costs Support and Start-up\n            Costs, the monies to finance the AHC-MMS's operation\n            and maintenance support which include computer equipment for\n            finance and engineering activities; and c) Rehabilitation\n            Works, which include rehabilitation of water mains and water\n            and wastewater treatment plants. The second component will\n            provide support to employees of AHC-MMS and their families,\n            and increase the awareness of HIV/AIDS throughout the\n            community. The third component will support the preparation\n            of a permanent system for the delivery of urban development\n            in the selected Copperbelt towns and cities by acting as\n            demonstration project for the use of private sector\n            contracting to achieve sustainable results."}, "docdt": "2000-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
