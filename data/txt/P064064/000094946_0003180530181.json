Since the\n            construction of the project poses further environmental\n            risks on the area, the Environmental Assessment (EA)\n            presents mitigating measures, addressing in particular\n            sewage effluent issues, which have permanently changed the\n            ecological system of streams flowing into the Kafue River.\n            Measures re-enforce the need to assure that the management\n            contract include raw water quantity, and quality monitoring,\n            which includes waste water management, i.e., quality of\n            treated effluents, and equipment investments. Furthermore,\n            the need for a training component for water supply, and\n            sanitation systems' operators is addressed, as well as\n            the risk of cross contamination of water supply,\n            recommending separation of workers dealing with clean water,\n            from those with residual waters, and, a solid waste\n            management component is recommended, outlining a number of\n            sub-component activities.
