Lessons\n            learned from the project: Clear and predictable tariff\n            setting mechanisms and regulatory approvals are a key\n            support element for the implementation of a utility\n            commercialization strategy. Time requirements for\n            reconnaissance of a deteriorated network need to be\n            realistically assessed to ensure suitable project design.\n            For a project that is set up as a transitional solution, the\n            process/roadmap for determining the exit strategy should be\n            clearly defined, key stakeholders should be involved\n            throughout that process, the implementing agency should be\n            given an appropriately strong mandate, and the Bank should\n            ensure that it is closely associated with it. Communication\n            should include decision makers and political leaders, be\n            continuous and should if required be supported under the\n            project. It is unrealistic to anticipate large labor/staff\n            cost savings in a situation where a utility is changing from\n            an inefficient non-commercial public sector setting to a\n            commercial focus."}, "docdt": "2006-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
