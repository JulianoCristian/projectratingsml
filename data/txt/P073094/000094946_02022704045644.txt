shifted the focus of planning from division
level to village level. Micro plans are village
level plans that are an integral part of
community forest management. However, to
institutionalize this decentralized planning
process and to thwart possible conflicts
between working plans and micro-plans,
suitable measures are suggested. As the entire
exercise of microplanning is in the process of
evolution, it will have to be ensured that the
aspirations of the Communities expressed in
the micro plans are not in conflict with the
silvicultural prescriptions of the working
plans. Since the working plans are larger
documents covering larger areas including the
areas covered by the micro plans, it would be
necessary that working plans lay broad and
practical guidelines for silvicultural treatment
of the forests. Site specific planning duly
incorporating the needs and aspirations of the
Communities involved in Community Forest
Management under the umbrella of the
silvicultLral details, as prescribed by the
working plans, can be the domain of the
Micro-plans.

uniformity and objectiveness, a format for a
Micro plan is suggested in the report.
