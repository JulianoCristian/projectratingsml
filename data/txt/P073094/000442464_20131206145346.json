This gives small farmers\n            an important economic incentive to adopt dairying for their\n            livelihoods. In India, dairying is recognized as a catalyst\n            for social and economic development. Besides being a source\n            of liquidity and insurance against crop failure, milk is the\n            only product where the farmers realize 60-70 percent of the\n            consumer price. The Rajasthan District Poverty Initiatives\n            Project (DPIP) supports the formation of common interest\n            groups (CIGs) comprising 10-15 members at the village level.\n            It then helps CIGs to identify and implement economically\n            beneficial subprojects and provides with matching grants to\n            get enterprises off the ground. On average the dairy\n            cooperative society (DCS) delivers up to 1,000 liters per\n            day and nearly 2,000 liters per day in the flush season.\n            This way, the DCS links the rural poor to markets under the\n            World Bank assisted DPIP in Rajasthan, India. With the\n            expansion of dairy activities and to promote increased milk\n            production, there is a need to develop persistent and\n            productive pastures for high nutritive quality of cattle\n            feed and to expand the use of qualified veterinarians and or\n            trained youth professionals (para-vets) for animal health\n            and breeding."}, "docdt": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
