development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: clear agreement between the Bank and the\n            client on necessary policy changes can lead to a sound\n            framework for project implementation. Required internal\n            institutional reforms for Community Forest Management (CFM)\n            require time and commitment by forest departments. In India,\n            forest department field officers mainly carry out regulatory\n            and enforcement duties with communities. Policy changes\n            enacted by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department (APFD) under\n            the project delegated new responsibilities for financial and\n            administrative powers from Forest Section Officer's\n            (FSOs) to Forest Beat Officer's (FBOs). This meant an\n            increased workload at the FBO level and a significant\n            transformation in their approach to dealing with\n            communities, which proved challenging for some staff.\n            Strong, sustained and visionary leadership is required to\n            support a shift from Joint Forest Management (JFM) to\n            Community Forest Management (CFM). To fully empower Vana\n            Samrakshana Samiti (VSS) groups to manage their forests\n            requires sustained commitment by the forest department.\n            Community groups will vary in terms of their own commitment\n            and performance. Cooperation with Non-Governmental\n            Organizations (NGOs) is essential when working with\n            communities. The project worked closely with many NGOs,\n            especially at the inception phase, to formulate government\n            orders in respect of the CFM framework; for community\n            mobilization, and for preparation of VSS microplans."}, "docdt": "2010-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
