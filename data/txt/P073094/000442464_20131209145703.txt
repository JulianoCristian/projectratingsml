  Series 2. Note No. 2. February 2009.
  The Andhra Pradesh Community Forest Management Project (APCFMP) follows the previous Bank-assisted AP Joint
  Forest Management Project (1994-2000) that brought 850,000 hectares of forests under joint management by the State
  Forest Department and forest communities. APCFMP reﬂects the lessons from the ﬁrst project, making communities the
  primary managers of local forests with the State forest department facilitating them and providing technical advice and
  regulatory oversight. The project has been implemented in 5,000 villages, covering nearly 350,000 families in 14 districts
  with a total project cost of US$126 million.
