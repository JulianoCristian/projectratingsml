The project will employ community-driven\n            development approach, where community will be empowered to\n            take all decisions for protecting and developing forests.\n            All the VSS have been assigned forest areas for protection\n            and development. Therefore, no new land acquisition is\n            envisaged to undertake project interventions. Furthermore,\n            no physical displacement is expected. The main issue is\n            encroachment in the forest areas mainly for agriculture\n            purpose. There are likely to be some adverse effects or\n            impacts on the families and people in the form of losing the\n            encroached land in the forests under management of VSS and\n            their livelihood source. This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n            is prepared to describe the process how the resettlement\n            issues will be addressed. VSS communities facilitated by\n            NGOs will carry out the process of social assessment. About\n            28 percent of the families are likely to be affected, nearly\n            28 percent will be landless largely dependent on encroached\n            lands for meeting their household food requirements. It is\n            expected that some families encroaching forest land will\n            resist surrendering land. The approach proposed to be\n            adopted is to promote surrender of encroached forest land\n            required under no compulsions and pressure on the affected families."}, "docdt": "2004-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
