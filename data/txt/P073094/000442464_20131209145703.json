About 30 years ago, India started\n            experimenting with joint forest management (JFM) to address\n            this crisis, formally adopting the model about one decade\n            ago. The goal for the evolution of JFM is community forest\n            management (CFM) that builds the capacities of community\n            institutions, invests in forest productivity, and gives\n            people greater incentives to develop into independent\n            community forest enterprises. The World Bank-supported\n            Andhra Pradesh Community Forest Management Project (APCFMP)\n            is now piloting CFM to demonstrate that as communities\n            become the drivers of sustainable forest management, they\n            can be its greatest proponents. The APCFMP is reversing the\n            unsustainable pattern of dependence among forest\n            inhabitants- commonly landless or owners of small\n            unproductive land parcels who rely on the forest department\n            and wage labor from establishing plantations instead of\n            generating income from enterprises based on a variety of\n            fast and slow-growing species to meet different market\n            needs. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has taken positive\n            steps to empower communities to use forest resources and\n            retain 100 percent of revenues. Additional gains can be made\n            if policy and regulatory changes allowed better market\n            access for certain timber products such as teak, which will\n            be coming on stream in many Vana Samrakshana Samiti (VSS)\n            sites in the next two decades."}, "docdt": "2009-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
