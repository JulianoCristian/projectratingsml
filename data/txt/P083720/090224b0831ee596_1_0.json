Emerging\n            from three decades of conflict and instability in 2002,\n            Afghanistan barely had a functioning communications network.\n            The country had little or no access to the internet. Given\n            the state of communications infrastructure, the government\u2019s\n            ability to govern was severely limited. International\n            Development Association financed Emergency Communications\n            Development Project was launched in 2003 to improve delivery\n            of communications services to the government and people of\n            Afghanistan. Unprecedented progress revitalized the\n            country\u2019s communications. Telephone access increased from\n            less than 1 percent to 32 percent of the population. The\n            number of fixed and mobile telecommunication subscribers\n            increased from 57,000 in 2002 to almost 10 million in 2009,\n            while costs have plummeted by 95 percent. Afghan Telecom has\n            been corporatized and a separate regulatory agency\n            established. The telecommunications sector is dynamic and\n            growing in Afghanistan."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T04:56:05Z"}
