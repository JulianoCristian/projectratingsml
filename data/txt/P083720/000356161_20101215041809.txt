Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To support activities designed to improve delivery of communications services to the
Government and to the people of Afghanistan. This will be achieved by: (i) carrying out
urgent expansion of the government communications network to restore critical
communications between ministries and provinces; (ii) providing urgently needed policy
advice and capacity building to the MOe to promote sustainable communications sector
performance and increased private sector participation; and (iii) improving the postal
sector and the delivery of postal services. The outcomes of the project are expected to be
improvements in communications facilities and delivery, while laying the foundations for
sector reforms and institution building that would lead to sustainable development of the
communications sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In 2003, Afghanistanjust emerged from over two decades of severe internal conflict. A series of
domestic conflicts since 1978 had left its state institutions non-functional, devastated the
economic infrastructure, severely depleted the human resource base, and fragmented society into
factions defmed by ethnicity, religion, or ideology. The country was one of the poorest members
of the World Ban1e

Before 2002, Afghanistan had a barely functioning, very limited telecommunications sector. The
overall network and legal infrastructure of the sector was weak. The Government, through its
telecommunications department in the Ministry of Communications, operated approximately
57,000 lines in five major cities with two thirds of these lines in Kabul. Teledensity - the number
of telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants - was only 0.2, much lower than Pakistan (2.4),
Turkmenistan (8.3), Tajikistan (3.5), or Uzbekistan (6.8). Second, the Government's abilities to
coordinate its own operations were severely limited by inadequate communications capacity, both
between Ministries in Kabul, as well as nationally and internationally. Third, the many post
offices were dilapidated and lacked basic equipment such as scales and franking machines,
required for daily operations.

In the immediate years after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 the Government through the
then Ministry of Communications (MoC) began deploying new infrastructure with the assistance
of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). This included digital telephone service in
Kabul, Heart, and Mazar-e-Sharif, and national and international satellite links . Private
telecommunications firm A WCC launched a mobile telephone service in Kabul, and a second
mobile telephone company (Roshan) was making plans to deploy its network.

The legal infrastructure was also just beginning to develop. The Transitional Islamic State of
Afghanistan (TISA) developed a national communications policy to modernize and expand
telecommunications networks and services, and roll out universal telecommunications access.
The Government recognized the importance of open competition and private sector investment
supported by a stable and transparent policy, legal, and regulatory environment to achieve this.
The Government set out to establish a sector regulator and develop the Telecommunications Act,
with support from the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF).

Consequently, IDA support provided investment and technical assistance resources to the MoC
(now known as the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, MCIT) to: (1)
develop the Government Communications Network; (2) strengthen the policy function ofMoC;
(3) restructure state-owned Afghan Telecom; (4) establish the regulatory unit; and (5) reform the
postal sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the Emergency Communications Development Project is to support activities
designed to improve delivery of communications services to the Government and to the people of
Afghanistan. This will be achieved by: (i) carrying out urgent expansion of the government
communications network to restore critical communications between ministries and provinces;
(ii) providing urgently needed policy advice and capacity building to the MOC to promote
sustainable communications sector performance and increased private sector participation; and
(iii) improving the postal sector and the delivery of postal services. The outcomes of the project
are expected to be improvements in communications facilities and delivery, while laying the
foundations for sector reforms and institution building that would lead to sustainable development
of the communications sector.

The project was expected to bring about positive changes in terms of increasing the relevant
institutions' capacity to reform and govern the sector, develop a competitive market, and enable
the private sector to provide services in Afghanistan. The expected benefits were increased access
to various telecommunication services in the country, improved sector governance, and access to
basic telecommunications services in Afghanistan.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions to the components.

1.7 Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in project design during implementation

The project closing date was extended twice, to September 30, 2008, and subsequently to
September 30,2009. The extensions to closing date were requested by the Government and
approved by Bank management. The reasons for extension were to accommodate the 2-year
operation and maintenance (O&M) phase of the Government Communications Network (GCN)
contract, as originally intended in the project design, due to delays in the initiation of work on the
GCN.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis to support the preparation of ECDP was sound, based on a one-year
engagement with the MoC and other donors in the telecommunications sector. QAG's Quality
At-Entry Assessment (QEA7) rated the quality at entry of this project as Highly Satisfactory
overall.




                                                  5
The project and its components were designed to respond to specific priority investment needs to
restore and expand the government communication network and long-term policy objectives of
the Government to create the right conditions for open competition and private sector investment,
and a stable and transparent policy, legal and regulatory, environment.

The project also built on the experiences of telecommunications components and activities in
post-conflict Afghanistan such as the EPAP and EERDP, and the ARTF and PPIAF-funded
telecommunications programs. It also drew on experiences from post-conflict environments that
suggested the great importance of wireless communications as the primary telecommunications
infrastructure, and the rapidity with which competitive private wireless provision can roll out
(even in poor and war-tom environments) under the appropriate regulatory and policy conditions.
This suggested the urgency of creating regulatory and legal institutions that can foster
telecommunications roll out, particularly in the wireless segment.

The experience in Afghanistan and in other post-conflict environments was used to inform the
design of the project. First, the project implementation was kept flexible to adapt to a rapidly
changing environment. Second, it took steps to ensure sustainability in project design. Third, it
was designed to achieve a relatively simple and attainable set of objectives. Finally, it sought to
reduce security related risks in the immediate post-conflict environment while creating the
foundations for broader development of the system in later years.

The QEA7 panel rated the project's quality at entry of this as Highly Satisfactory (1) overall. The
assessment comprised Highly Satisfactory (1) ratings for:
    ·  Strategic Relevance and Approach (improving Government ability to communicate was
       an overriding political and economic priority);
    ·  Policy and Institutional Aspects (political backing, commitment, and incentives were all
       strong);
    ·  Implementation Arrangements (the project was well prepared, kept simple, and was ready
       to launch); and for
    ·  Bank Inputs and Processes (Bank management gave the project the strongest backing).

All other quality dimensions-Technical, Economic and Financial Aspects, Social,
Environmental, Fiduciary Aspects and Risk Assessment-were rated Satisfactory (2). The QEA 7
review noted that while the rationale for concentrating on the two main components (Government
telecom and policy reform) was well borne out by results thus far, the case for "including a postal
element in the project - with a minimal allocation of project finds - seems less well made." The
review noted that the postal component should either have received more funds or been
postponed and handled later in a separate project.

The overall project design was straightforward and uncomplicated. Strengths included a simple
and clear component structure and standardized implementation arrangements.

The objectives were also described with sufficient clarity. They were also realistic and important
for the country because they were fully aligned with and supported the Government's immediate
objectives. Hence, there was borrower buy-in for the project throughout the design phase, as the
objectives were part of the Government's stated mandate. The objectives remained unchanged
during implementation as the sector priorities ofthe Government remained the same, despite the
changing political and security landscape.

Government's Commitment, Stakeholder Involvement, and Participatory Processes



                                                  6

During project preparation and throughout the implementation process, the Government was
highly committed to the sector. It recognized the importance of telecommunications for the
country's wider socio-economic development agenda. Despite a highly challenging security
environment, the Government implemented reforms in the sector.

Assessment of risks and mitigation measures

The assessment of risks at the time of project appraisal was satisfactory. It considered critical
risks and mitigation measures for every component, and correctly identified implementation
capacity and security as major risks. The establishment of the Project Management Office helped
address implementation capacity risks.

2.2 Implementation

The project implementation period saw rapid positive changes in the local context. Due to the
policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms supported by ECDP, the Afghan telecommunications
sector has experienced almost 100 percent annual growth since 2003. Teledensity has grown from
0.2% in 2002 to about 35% by 2009. From two service providers (Afghan Telecom and AWCC)
in 2002, the sector now includes another five private telecommunications providers and seven
operational Internet service providers (lSPs) . Mobile signal coverage has reached over 70 percent
of the population and tariffs have fallen to about 10 US cents a minute from US$2 per minute in
2002. Private investments were, at the time of closing, over US$1.2 billion. The postal sector has
developed further with the introduction of new services such as Express Mail, and the drafting of
the Postal Law. Services have also been expanded using postal agencies and licensing of courier
service providers.

This success has been due to the high level of commitment to sector reforms on the part of the
implementing agencies. Starting from a point of weak capacity, the MoC (now MCIT) has taken
on the policymaking function and is seen as technically competent and responsive. The regulatory
function has been successfully delegated to ATRA, while Afghan Telecom is now moving slowly
towards sustainability in the long term.

One challenge experienced up front was the lack of project management capacity within the MoC.
This led to some initial delays with procurement and a lag between commitments and
disbursements. However, the Project Management Specialist (PMS) hired under the project
quickly began work and was able to respond effectively. The PMS throughout played a
significant role in procurement, financial management, training, and institution building. As a
result, six months into the implementation, total disbursements reached US$9.5 million, ahead of
appraisal estimates. Further, the team continued intensive supervision through frequent visits,
video conferences, and teleconferences to support the Project Management Team and ensure
quick implementation.

By the time of the Mid Term Review (MTR) in December 2005, the disbursements had reached
US$13.3 million, and the performance ratings were Satisfactory for achievement ofPDO and
implementation progress. Nonetheless, there were significant and important gaps in the capacity
of Afghan Tel, the post office, the regulator TRB, and MoC that required additional and
accelerated training and technical assistance. The MTR mission and Ministry agreed to reallocate
funds to support such an accelerated program of support. Further, in view of the Government of
Afghanistan's interest in using ICT for improving governance and providing a better quality of



                                                7

life to citizens, it was agreed that project funds would also be utilized for technical assistance to
plan and implement priority activities in the eGovernment and Government IT sphere.

It is worth noting that by January 2006 nearly all of agreed End-of-Project perfonnance indicators
included in the ECDP Development Credit Agreement were met or surpassed. There were 40 (as
opposed to the envisaged 30) Government sites in Kabul connected to the GCN and 30,000 (as
opposed to 6,550) telephone lines provided to Government staff, for example.

In addition, the Bank also recognizes the importance of the sustained policy dialogue with the
MoC and TRB (later the MCIT and ATRA) to ensure open and fair competition in the
telecommunications sector. This supported the capacity building activities under the ECDP. The
team consistently emphasized the need for transparency in the regulatory environment through
greater public consultations with industry and other stakeholders.

Two sets of issues remained out of the control of the proj ect team and MoC throughout the
project, although the impact was managed and was negligible in the end. The first set related to
the shifting tax codes and rules that the MoF developed and then imposed. At one point, close to
US$2 million in payments on contracts under ECDP and the ARTF projects became overdue
because of a dispute over whether the goods and services tax (approx. 8 percent and four percent
on international and local procurements respectively) should apply to contracts funded by the
Bank. Another concern related to the MoF was the repeated delays in payments due to slow
response of Control staff deputed from the MoF to MCIT. These issues were discussed with and
addressed by the Government.

The second set of issues related to the volatile and deteriorating security situation in the country .
This has not only slowed down the implementation ofMCIT projects that the ECDP was
indirectly supporting (such as the Afghan Telecom national fiber optic backbone), but also
reduced significantly the number of consultants who were available to travel to and stay in
Afghanistan. Well-qualified consultants were often unwilling or could not--<iue to restrictions by
their national governments or employers-travel to Afghanistan. This was a significant problem
because much of the capacity building activities needed sustained and regular interactions.
Moreover, some international training for Afghan staff and Government employees could not be
organized because of the difficulty in getting travel clearances from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.

During project implementation, the Ministry, ATRA, and Afghan Post also had access to
technical assistance financing from other sources such as the United States Government and
USAID; International Telecommunications Union (lTU); Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT);
and Universal Postal Union (UPU). This was not envisaged during project preparation. As a
result, a portion of funds allocated towards technical assistance and capacity-building activities
were reallocated during project implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E parameters used reflected the focus of the project on Government connectivity and
policy refonn. The parameters were designed to record the improvement of government
communication capacity in Kabul, with provinces, and through expansion of telephone access.

The policy refonn parameters were designed to capture the impact of sound policy and regulatory
decisions, as opposed to simply a 'checking-the-box' approach. Hence, these parameters focused
on the increase in the number of licensed telecommunications service providers and Internet


                                                   8

service providers, in investments in the sector, and in access to telecommunication services.
These parameters were expected to reflect the improvement in the business climate for
competitive telecommunications providers and the easier access to telecommunications for
citizens.

The MCIT and regulator ATRA implemented the M&E system successfully, engaging with the
range of proj ect beneficiaries to coordinate the collection and analysis of data. While government
connectivity data would be easily available because the MeIT was the implementing agency, the
collaboration of service providers in data collection was useful in the M&E for the policy reform
parameters. It helped that these parameters are standard for the telecommunications sector and are
well understood by all stakeholders.

The M&E data, especially the data related to the policy reform components has been widely used
by the MCIT, ATRA, and stakeholders to highlight the pro-competition, investment-friendly
policy and regulatory framework in place in Afghanistan. Key snapshot data is available on the
MeIT Internet homepage and is updated every quarter. Thus, the data becomes a key element of
internal and external communication and helps strengthen the Government's credibility by
highlighting its ability to present information on market opportunities and progress to the private
sector and to maintain buy-in for the reform from Afghan society by demonstrating its ongoing
positive impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance is rated satisfactory. No issues were reported regarding compliance with
Bank policy and procedural requirements. The project had minimum environmental implications
because there was no need for supporting roads, significant civil works, or power-supply
installations.

Financial Management: The overall performance of financial management is rated moderately
satisfactory. The project has complied with all fiduciary requirements with some delays in the
submission of annual audit reports. This was due to factors outside of the control of the proj ect.
The project submitted timely Financial Management Reports (FMRs) and no major issues were
raised. Project accounting and internal controls were adequate, and the team provided the needed
supervision in fiduciary matters.

Disbursements: Of the original credit of SDR 15.7 million, a total of SDR 15.6 million was fully
disbursed. The remainder was cancelled after closing.

Procurement: Overall procurement performance is rated Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase

MCIT and ATRA recognize the importance to sustain the gains made thus far and build on what
exists. Building on the opportunity presented by the availability of a widespread
telecommunications network, and reflecting the leT strategy developed in the ANDS, the GOA
remains committed to using leT broadly to improve public service delivery, include more
Afghans in the global information and innovation economy, and connect rural and remote
communities. Furthermore, the Government recognizes that it can leverage the widespread
mobile telephone network for public service delivery, to improve M&E of programs and projects,
and to offer citizens access to finance. Responding to the Government's interest, the Bank is



                                                 9

               -to-gtllUan(;e on the development of mobile applications focused on rural


Simultaneously, sector stakeholders realize that as the Afghan market develops, the policy and
                       will have to adapt to new opportunities and
              ""PH/A'-V"                                                              by evolving
                                   Responding to their request,      Bank      been engaged in
                                ATRA providing additional              building             just-in-
                     on                      As            closed, the Bank had begun providing
non-lending technical assistance on tariff regulation and on     development        Internet policy


A         area of       is to                with the             on the future of Afghan
Telecom. The project has            the company in becoming a corporate              that could be

technical capacity and is able to         high quality                                 connectivity to
the            market, and has                  retail

The                                      Telecom and the establishment        truly level playing
field require the Government to re-visit the privatization of Afghan            The           and

                         the context of licensing reforms to maintain a level playing field.
Simultaneously,       Government should ensure that assets such as the            optic      cable
network being developed by Afghan               should be regulated to allow non-discriminatory
access to                    providers                   abuse

                                   and                           to            the . . V1HIJ','"U

that connects a greater number of provinces across Afghanistan; (iv) investment support
technical            to build on                IT           while promoting mobile
applications, wider Internet use, and eGovernment applications. Follow-on support in            sector
would yield substantial              and               for  country,                      areas of
next generation data networks and                                transformative            for the
poor.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance ofobjectives: The objectives of     project remain relevant to the Afghanistan's
                        the             National                        (ANDS) (2007/8
201213), and the most recent Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN).

   ANDS notes the strategic vision for the   sector is to "make affordable information and
communication         available every district and         of                     enabling


                                                   10 

market economy." The focus of the ECDP on policy and regulatory reform has helped support the
realization of this vision. Further, the ANDS lCT Sector Strategy has targets of "Transforming
Afghanistan into an information based society by 2013," and increasing "Telecom access to 80%
geographic coverage of populated areas by 2010." The ANDS program thus builds on the work
done through the ECDP, specifically creating a policy and regulatory environment to promote
access to affordable telecommunications services across Afghanistan. The ECDP also supported
improved Government communications and the development of Government IT infrastructure
that will help the implementation of e-Government and other lCT applications enabling Afghans
to enjoy the information age.

The objectives of the project are relevant to the three pillars of the FY09-11 lSN for Afghanistan.
First, the development of the foundation for e-Government systems and public service delivery
mechanisms helps build the capacity of the state and its accountability to its citizens. Second, the
expansion of telecommunications promotes economic growth generally. This will help, as these
networks go even deeper into rural Afghanistan, build up the rural economy. Finally, creation of a
positive and pro-competition policy and regulatory framework has supported the growth of the
private sector.

The project design is relevant, reflecting proper diagnosis of development priorities and
alignment with project's development objectives.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project has achieved its development objective and surpassed almost all of its stated targets
as discussed in Section 1.3 above.

Indicators related to the improvements in the capacity of the government communication network
were all met. The GCN is fully functional (voice, data, and video) and connects all 34 provincial
capitals and 40 line ministries/agencies in Kabul. The operation of this network has been fully
transferred to Afghan Telecom and it serves as the backbone for the CDMA network. The target
for telephone connectivity of Government has been surpassed. Over 70 thousand lines are being
used by Government-ten times over the target of 6550 lines.

Proj ect outcomes related to the development of the telecommunications sector have surpassed
targets. Investments in the sector have crossed US$1 billion and are 30 percent over the target of
US$950 million. The teledensity nationally has crossed 35 as of late 2009, with the total number
of subscriptions at about 11 million. Over 20 lSPs were licensed, and seven of these are
operational.

The number of operators licensed to provide telecommunication services reached seven. The
market has experienced spectacular growth since 2002. As of September 2009, Afghanistan'S
mobile teledensity, for example, was on par with India (41), Tanzania (42), and Cambodia (37).

3.3 Efficiency

The project had provided a credit ofUS$24 million equivalent to the Government. This has had a
significant multiplier effect on the economy, had a positive social impact, and contributed
significant revenues to the Treasury in the form of taxes and fees.

Economic impact. Recent research suggests that every 10 percentage-point increase in mobile
telephony penetration in developing countries leads to an acceleration of GDP growth by 0.75


                                                 11 

percentage point. Even with this conservative estimate for Afghanistan, the overall effect on GDP
due to mobile telephony is about US$309 million since December 2004. In itself, this
conservative estimate suggests that the ECDP credit had a mUltiplier effect often times on GDP.

Further, tariffs dropped from US$2 per minute of talk-time to about 10 US cents per minute over
the period of the project. This represents a drop from one minute of talk-time being equivalent to
0.92% of per-capita GDP to 0.02%, representing a significant increase in the affordability of
telephone services.

Social impact. There has also been significant social development impact. The growth of the
telecommunications sector has created 60,000 jobs directly or indirectly. One mobile telephone
company has begun pilots of a mobile money transfer service that will, over time, include more
Afghans in the formal banking system and provide them with access to finance. This widespread
mobile telephone network creates platform that can be used for public service delivery and
improved access to information.

The development of the GCN also lays the foundation for Government IT and e-Government
services that will help improve both internal government management and external government
to-business and government-to-citizen services.

Fiscal impact. Finally, the project led to policy and regulatory reforms and further liberalization
of the telecommunications sector that brought in significant revenues to the Government. One
time revenues included the license fees paid by the third and fourth telecommunications licensees
(MTN in September 2005 and Etisalat in May 2006), which totaled US$80 million.

Recurring revenues include the significant inputs to the Treasury from the various taxes being
levied on the telecommunications service providers. In 2009, the estimated taxes contributed by
the telecommunications operators was US$75 million, about 10 percent of the total domestic
Government revenues.

3.4 Justification of Overa]] Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project outcomes are rated as highly satisfactory because all the project outcome targets have
been met or surpassed; the efficiency of the project is very high in terms of economic, social, and
fiscal impact compared with the size of the IDA credit. In terms of access and private investment,
the outcomes have surpassed all expectations thus justifying the rating of Highly Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Access to quality communications services is an important component of the overall poverty
reduction strategy for most developing countries. The expansion of the telecommunications
industry has created new economic activities. It also represents an improved investment climate.
Now, as ATRA implements the Telecommunication Development Fund (TDF) and begins
supporting the expansion of telecommunications services in rural and remote areas, the

reduction efforts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Through capacity building initiatives, the project has supported significant institutional
restructuring, capacity building, and reforms. The key transformations are described below.

The Ministry of Communications (MoC) evolved into the Ministry of Communications and IT
(MCIT), responsible for policymaking and implementation of the ICT development agenda. The
ICT policy and law have been developed.

The Afghanistan Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ATRA) was also established and
the TDF has begun operations. The first round of bids for rural telecommunications infrastructure
was completed in 2009.

The department in charge of telecommunications operations was corporatized into Afghan
Telecom. Afghan Telecom is now a licensed operator, providing CDMA wireless and fixed voice
services, and Internet access.

Finally, postal services have been expanded in Afghanistan. New services such as Express mail
service have been introduced. Further, the Postal Commission has been instituted and the Postal
Law has been drafted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcomes is Low.

The reforms undertaken in the sector are irreversible. Today Afghanistan's telecommunication
sector and its mobile segment are dynamic with investment, iIU1ovation, and competition. This
trend is likely to continue because of the basic reforms funded under the project (legal and
regulatory reform, and creation of an institutional framework). The QEA Sustainability rating was
Likely (2). That assessment noted that given the nature of the project deliverables - physical
infrastructure and institutional and policy reforms - it is highly unlikely that these would ever be
reversed.

6. Lessons Learned

First, in conflict-affected andfragile states, projects that are focused on results, which use simple
design to create the foundations for future growth, and leverage competent and committed
leadership might work better. This project was focused on attaining well-defined, well
understood, and broadly supported objectives. It focused most on two components that were to be
implemented based on international experience and were in line with national development
strategies. Moreover, the project was designed to be flexible to allow adaptation to a rapidly
changing environment while seeking sustainability through the development of simple systems
that could grow subsequently.

Second, in low-capacity environments, continuity ofstaffwith a dedicated project implementation
unit and sufficient Bank resources for supervision are important ingredients for successful
processing and implementation. The team had the resources and built long-standing relationships
with the officials in the implementing agency. This allowed close supervision, rapid response to
concerns or challenges, and the creation of a candid and results-focused work environment.

Third, projects can be successfully implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment
to reform, and when there is strong political and administrative commitment to monitor progress
and make flexible changes as required. Clear leadership, willingness to implement refonns at a
senior level, and a broad consensus on priorities facilitated project implementation during much
of the project period. Specifically, the project was designed to support Government priorities and
fit well with its strategies and development plans. The backing of the Bank management for this
project was also critical in ensuring the highest quality at entry and in maintaining involved
supervision. This lesson is noteworthy as the project was implemented against a backdrop of
conflict and insecurity.

Finally, even in a conflict-affected andpoor state such as Afghanistan, the liberalization ofthe
telecommunications industry led to massive private investment, rapid expansion ofnetworks and
subscription, and significant job creation. The focus of the Government on creating an enabling
environment for pri vate sector investment was thus rewarded, and has a powerful demonstrati ve
effect for other sectors in Afghanistan, as well as other states with similar political or economic
conditions.

Environmental Conditions in which the project was implemented and on Implementation
and Operational Results:

 Economic: When the project was conceptualized in 2003, MCIT had very limited National and
International Connectivity, only with 04 Provinces of the Country. Provisioning of National and
International connectivity to 40 Ministries at Kabul and to 34 Provincial Offices provided a basis
for economic growth of the Country. Population of the Country has access to Voice and Internet
facilities that are key factors for the improvements in the economic conditions of the citizens of
the nation.

 Technical: High Quality TDMA Mesh Network was established to connect all the Provincial
Capital Cities of the Country. State-of-art Technology was commissioned at all the Network
Nodes. Conununications Hub has been established at Kabul, where the most modem Network
Management System has been installed to monitor the health of the Networks. Soft Switch in the
HUB integrates all the Satellite, Microwave, Fixed Line, and OFC Networks. 25 Ministries at
Kabul have been connected to the HUB through OFC Network and 25 have been connected
through Microwave Media.

 Financial: In 2003, there was an average of 50,000 USD per month revenue for MCIT from the
limited conununication Networks as existing at that time. After commissioning of the Networks
under ECDP, which also enabled integration of all MCIT's Networks in the Country, MCIT's
revenue averages to one Million USD per month.

Social: Social sector perceived a positive trend of growth due to growing conununication
facilities. Life styles of the citizens tended to change. Employment opportunities enhanced and
Teleconununications Engineering is being seen as a preferred field of Engineering in the Society
now.

Institutional: MCIT has been recognized as an institution contributing well towards the growth of
the Society. Information and Conununications Technology (lCT) became the focal point in all
high-level discussions in the Social sectors.

Environment: In 2003, having a Telephone was treated as a matter of pride. Very few Phones
were in place. Now, 80 % of the Population is covered by the conununication facilities. Whole
environment has seen a sea change.

 Performance of the Bank in this project has been excellent. Project was evolved with clearly
defined Objectives and Monitoring Indicators, which were simple and achievable. Procurement
Plans were very well drawn and monitored by the Bank. For such complicated projects with
induction of high level Engineering Technology, Training ofMCIT's Staff has been main key to
success. Bank focused on the Capacity building aspects ofMCIT, ATRA, Postal, and Afghan
Telecom that resulted into efficient implementation of ECDP.

13.    Proposed Arrangements for Future Operation of the project and Performance
Indicators to be used to monitor future Operation and Development Impact

 All the project Assets created under ECDP funding have been handed over to their respective
Departments ofMCIT, ATRA, Postal and Afghan Telecom. Drive Test System and Spectrum
Monitoring Equipment is being operated and maintained by ATRA. All the Networks as created
are being operated and maintained by Afghan Telecom. Office Automation Items and
Networking Equipment as issued to the Ministries and to other Departments of MCIT, ATRA,
and Postal Services are being operated and maintained by the concerned Departments themselves
as these assets have become their life line for day-to-day operations, being necessary for availing
Voice and data facilities from Afghan Telecom. All the Goods procured under ECDP are
contributing to generation of Revenues and thus, the accruing Revenues are in a position to
maintain the Assets. Growth of Afghan Telecom's Revenue through these Assets as
commissioned under ECDP will be a good Performance Indicator for monitoring the futuristic
operational and development impact.
