Emergency Communications\n            Development Project for Afghanistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            conflict-affected and fragile states, projects that are\n            focused on results, which use simple design to create the\n            foundations for future growth, and leverage competent and\n            committed leadership might work better. In low-capacity\n            environments, continuity of staff with a dedicated project\n            implementation unit and sufficient Bank resources for\n            supervision are important ingredients for successful\n            processing and implementation. Projects can be successfully\n            implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment to\n            reform, and when there is strong political and\n            administrative commitment to monitor progress and make\n            flexible changes as required. Even in a conflict-affected\n            and poor state such as Afghanistan, the liberalization of\n            the telecommunications industry led to massive private\n            investment, rapid expansion of networks and subscription,\n            and significant job creation."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
