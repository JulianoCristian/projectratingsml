through: (i) reform of public\n            expenditure and economic incentives; (ii) financial sector\n            reforms, especially the restructuring of the state-owned\n            development bank; (iii) institutional and legal reforms\n            affecting relations between the Government and public\n            enterprises; and (iv) public enterprise restructuring and\n            divestiture. Overall, the performance of the operation is\n            rated as satisfactory. The key policies were instituted,\n            albeit with delays. PE restructuring led to settlement of\n            cross-arrears among them; divestiture (including\n            privatization) of some; and rehabilitation of major PEs\n            dealing in utilities and infrastructure services.\n            Sustainability, however, is uncertain. The remaining public\n            enterprises require improved management. Some continue to\n            experience financial deterioration. Institutional capacity\n            remains weak and the social consequences have not been fully\n            ascertained or dealt with."}, "docdt": "1993-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
