MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE =ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The  following memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a   proposed
development credit to  the Republic  of *ali  for SDR  7.0 million  (US$9.5
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, and would help
finance a Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project.
2.        Background.  Mali's public  enterprise (PE)  sector grew  rapidly
during the 1960s  and 19709.  By  1983. there were  57 non-financial,  com-
mercially oriented PEs, which accounted for about 70Z of modern industrial
output and absorbed nearly  701 of total domestic  credit.  The sector has
perEormed poorly however, and imposed a heavy burden on both the banking
system and government finances, because of ill-conceived investments, inap-
propriate economic policies and regulations, lack of financial discipline
within-the public sector and deficiencies in government-enterprise rela-
tions leading to poor PE management.
3.        In view  of  the  sector's  unsatisfactory  performance  and  the
emergence of unsustainable financial disequilibria, the Government has
formulated  and  begun  the   implementation  of  a  comprehensive   Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (PESAP). The Economic Management and
Training Project (Credit 1307-MLI) snd a PPF advance of US$1.5 million  for
the proposed project have financed diagnostic studies of selected PEs, a
cross-debt study, audits of  PEs to be  liquidated and consultant  services
needed to initiate implementation of  the program. The reform program  aims
to reduce the burden  of the PE  sector on public  finances and improve  PE
performance through action in four key areast (a) reform of key economic
policies concerning public resource management and the structure of
economic incentives; (b) financial sector reforms, including restructuring
a  state-owned  bank;  (c)  institutional  and  legal  reforms   redefining
relations between government and PEs; and (d) rationalization of the sector
through restructuring and divestiture.
4.        Overall implementation of the reform is the responsibility of  an
interministerial commission chaired by the Prime Minister and composed of
the Ministers of Planning, Finance and Commerce, State Enterprises, Infor-
mation and Telecommunications,  Labor and Civil  Service, and Industry.   A
technical committee chaired by the  Prime Minister's cabinet director will
manage implementation of the program.   The 'Bureau des Entreprises  Publi-
ques' (BEP), within the Ministry of Planning, will coordinate activities,
monitor progress in the reform  and report to the interministerial  commis-
sion. The Ministry of Finance and Commerce (MFIN) will be in charge of
financial sector reforms, privatization and liquidation of enterprises
covered by the divestiture program and evaluation of the financial per-
formance of all PEs. To adequately discharge their responsibilities, the
BEP and the MFIN require additional skills in the areas of banking reform,
divestiture, performance-contracts, management information systems and
legal reform.



-2_
5.        Ration    for IDA Involvement.  The project is essential to IDA's
strategy to help Mali carry out an economic adjustment program, the first
phase of which will focus on the PE sector. The project will help ensure
the successful implementation of the reform program while concommitantly
developing the institutional base for sound managoment of the sector.
6.        Project Obiective.  The objective of  the proposed project is  to
provide the institutional support needed by the Government to extend and
deepen its PE reform efforts, which would be supported through the accom-
panying PE Sector Adjustment Credit. The project is to address the long-
term issue of strengthening the Government's ability to devise and imple-
ment PE reforms as well as to monitor the sector's performance and manage
its future development. This also entails strengthening the capabilities
of PE  management  to  respond  to the  changed  policy  environment.   The
proposed project would  provide direct  support to  the MFIN  and BEP   for
implementation and monitoring  of the  program, and  to the  OPT (Post  and
Telecommunications) to implement its restructuring program.
7.        Prolect  Description.   The  proposed  project will  permit  the
Government to acquire the necessary technical and administrative capacity
to formulate and implement the reform measures incorporated in the PESAP
through: (a) a program of general support (resident advisors, short-term
consultants, plus logistical support) to the BEP and the MFIN; (b) studies
leading to the development of additional reforms; (c) a comprehensive
training program for Government and PE staff; and (d) advisory services and
other support to restructure OPT. The project, to be carried out over six
years, is estimated to cost US$9.9 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$8.8 million (89 percent). IDA would finance 100?
of foreign exchange cost and 60? of local costs due to severe Government's
budgetary constraints. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown  in  Schedule  A.  Amounts   and methods  of procurement  and   of
disbursements, and the disbursement  schedule are shown  in Schedule B.   A
timetable of key project processing events and the status =of Bank Group
operations in  Mali are  given in  Schedules C  and D  respectively.   More
detailed information on the proposed project  is provided in Annex 1.   The
President's Report for the accompanying PE Sector Adjustment Credit is No.
P-4734-MLI, dated May 31, 1988.
8.        Agreed Actions.   The  Government  has agreed  to  the  following
actions: (a) full government financing of BEP; (b) preparation of annual
work plans (including a detailed training program) by December 31 of each
year (preparation of the first of these for the second half of 1988 would
be a condition of effectiveness); (c) terms of reference for studies to be
carried out during the reform period; and (d) annual audits and project
monitoring procedures. Effectiveness of the PESAP credit and signing of
the  OPT   subsidiary  loan   agreement would   also  be   conditions   of
effectiveness.
9.        Benefits.  The main benefits under the proposed project are:  (a)
enhanced government and PE capabilities for timely and effective implemen-



-3-
tation of PE reform measures; (b) solid institutional framework for sus-
tainable PE reforms in the long run; (c) improved efficiency in PE manage-
ment and government supervision of the sector; and (d) improved technical
and analytical base for designing the next phase of PE adjustment measures
and continuing the macroeconomic reform process.
10.       Risks.  The main  risk associated with the  proposed project  is
that despite the Government's willingness to reform the PE sector, it might
fail to carry out the politically painful process of divestiture and
reform. This could entail slowing down the pace of reform, as it becomes
more demanding on bureaucratic interests and affects the existing institu-
tional relationships between ministries and PEs that have vested interests
in the status quo. The project is designed to minimize this risk by adopt-
iug a deliberate approach with firm leadership from the interministerial
commission chaired by the Prime Minister, combined with solid technical
analysis and assistance to overcome potential resistance.
11.       Recommendation.  I am  satisfied that the  proposed credit  would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

REPUBLIC OF MALI
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.        Characteristics and Performance  of the Sector.   As detailed  in
the President's  Report  for  the  accompanying  Public  Enterprise  Sector
Adjustment Program (P-4734-MLI), Mali pursued a deliberate policy of
parastatal intervention as the key instrument to further economic develop-
ment after independence in 1960. A large number of PEs were created,
particularly in the 1960s and early 19709, in the industrial and comnercial
sectors. By 1983, there were 57 non-financial, commercially oriented PEs,
more than 20 rural development agencies, several financial institutions and
numerous other parastatals providing public services as financially autono-
mous agencies. Performance of the PE sector has been poor, however, and
has had a serious negative impact on the banking system, public finances
and external debt. At end-1986, for example, PEs had accumulated CFAF 4.9
billion in arrears to the debt agency (CAA), CPAP 16.8 billion in arrears
to the National Treasury, and CPA? 13.8 billion in debt to the BDM.
2.        Institutional Framework.  A major reason for the poor performance
of the PE sector was the excessive government interference in day-to-day
management. Government control was exerted through technical ministries
and the Ministry of State Enterprises with the latter having considerable
influence on key decisions such as choice of director general and board
members. All major decisions (budgets, tariffs, pay scales, investments,
borrowings) had to be  approved a oriori and  reviewed a Dosteriori by  the
supervising ministry that also automatically chaired the boards of direc-
tors of each enterprise.
3.        Government Reform  Efforts.  The  Government has  formulated  and
begun implementation of a comprehensive reform of the parastatal sector
focussing on four main areast (a) revisions in public resource management
and incentive policies; (b) reform of the financial sector; (c) improve-
ments in the legal and institutional framework for the PE sector; and (d)
divestiture of individual enterprises. The details of the program are
summarized in the President's Report for the accompanying PESAP. A PPF
advance of US$1.5 million was granted in 1986 to finance diagnostic studies
of selected PEs, a cross-debt study, audits of PEs to be liquidated and
short-term and resident advisors needed to initiate implementation of the
program.
4.        Proiect Descrintion.  The proposer project would furnish the nec-
essary technical skills, advisory services, and institutional support for
improving implementation of the Government's PESAP. It would also continue
the process of improving the institutional base for the PE sector within
the government's supervision agencies, particularly BEP and the MFIN and
within the enterprises themselves. The project would consist oft (a)
support to the BEP; (b) support to the MFIN; (c) support for the
reorganization of OPT; (d) training of key PE personnel and government
officials; and (e) studies for the development of additional reform
measures. Each of these components is described below:

Page 2 of 5
5.        Support to the BEP (US$1.8  million).  The project would  finance
204 person-months of consultants services and logistical support (vehicles,
equipment and supplies) to the BEP. A Resident advisor (36 person-months)
would assist BEP in preparation and implementation of PE policy, legal and
institutional reforms  and monitoring  and reporting  on project  progress.
Short-term (including local) consultants (168 person- months) would prepare
enterprise-specific privatization programs, carry out overall evaluation of
the legal changes and follow-up studies on the impact of privatization  and
other reform measures, prepare a suitable management information system for
the BEP and assist in implementing a system of performance-contracts
between the Government and key PEs. Annual audits of key PEs, the project
and the PE sector adjustment credit would also be financed.
6.        Support to the  MFIN (US$1.2  million).  The  project would  also
finance 66 person-months of consultant services and logistical support
(vehicles, equipment and supplies) to the MPIN where a followp unit will be
created.   A  resident  advisor  (36 months)  would  assist  the  MFIN  in
implementatie- of the divestiture program, evaluation of PE financial
results and wonitoring performance contracts. Short-term consultants (30
months) would  assist tbe  MFIN  in design  and implementation  of  banking
sector reforms, implementation of the privatization program, completion of
liquidation proceedings, evaluation of PE financial results and preparation
of additional macroeconomic reforms.
7.        Restructurint of OPT (US$3.2 million).  The project would provide
technical  assistance  to  support   the  restructuring  of  the   telecom-
munications and postal sectors. The cost of the technical assistance for
OPT and upgrading its postal facilities is estimated at US$3.2 million.
Specialized consultant services (104 person-months) would help prepare and
implement a general plan for the establishment of autonomous postal and
telecommwnication companies, including: (i) labor management policies (12
person-months);   (ii)   rehabilitation   of   the   mail   services    (40
person-months); (iii) improvement of the reorganization and introduction of
a management information system for domestic and international services (40
person-months); and (iv) preparation of bidding documents for the rehabili-
tation of OPT's postal facilities, acquisition of related equipment and
coordination of these technical assistance services (12 person-months).
Other support will help upgrade postal facilities in Bamako and provide
needed furniture, equipment and vehicles to enhance the efficiency of OPT's
postal services.
8.        Trainins (US$0.7 million).  The  project would provide a  compre-
hensive training program, equivalent to approximately 150 person-months  of
training, aimed at building up local capabilities for improving PE perform-
ance. The training program, summarized in Schedule 2, would primarily ad-
dress PE executives and government officials responsible for the monitoring
and evaluation of PE performance. It would cover the following core areass
corporate  and   strategic  planning,   performance-contracts,   accounting
standards and reporting; setting objectives and targets; project cycle;
financial management, auditing and internal control; management information
systems; personnel planning and administration and investment appraisal and

Page 3 of 5
capital budgeting techniques.   The program would  aloo include  on-the-job
training by the resident advisors. OPT training program would be oriented
toward management training. A specialized consultant would be called upon
at periodic intervals to help prepare these training programs and monitor
the overall progress Lf the project's training activities.
9.        Studies (US$0.7 million).  In order to lay the basis for  further
reforms, the project would finance studies on the following subjectos
action plans for the 22 PES to be covered in the next phase of the PE
reform; PESAP evaluatior with regard to divestiture experience, PEs
financial results and performance-contracts; impact studies; studies for
redeployment of former public employees into the private sector; role of
supervisory ministries; action plan for financial policy reform; action
plan for the textile sector.
Coordination with Other Donors
10.       The project is  designed to  help the  Government implement  more
effectively the activities of other donors and other IDA-financed projects
in the  PE sector.   The project  will complement  ongoing efforts  by  the
donors to rehabilitate specific enterprises such as RPCM (railroad-Canada
and 'Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique') and OPT (IDA and CCCZ),
COMANAV (river transport-Germany) and EDM (electricity and water-France,
Canada, Germany, African Development Bank).
B.   PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
11.       Ortanization  and Manaaement.   An  Interministerial  Commission
chaired by the Prime Minister has been charged with overall responsibility
for the Sectoral Adjustment Program. It comprises the Ministers of Finance
and  Commerce, Planning,  State  Enterprise,  Labor  and  Civil   Service,
Industry, and Information and Telecommunications, and will ensure coordi-
nation among ministries with respect to implementation of PE reform
measures. A technical committee chaired by the Prime Minister's cabinet
director will manage implementation of the program. The BEP will coordi-
nate activities, monitor progress in the reform and report to the inter-
ministerial commission. Its specific responsibilities include development
of broad PE sector policy recommendations, monitoring implementation of PE
legal reforms and preparation of complementary measures, preparation of
divestiture strategies and preparation of proposals to facilitate the
redeployment of redundant PE personnel. The MPIN is charged with prepara-
tion and implementation of banking sector reforms, implementation of the
privatization program, liquidstion proceedings, evaluation of PE financial
results, monitoring of PE performance contracts, and preparation of
additional macroeconomic reforms.

Page 4 of 5
12.       Umlementation Plan.  A summary  of the project's key  activities
is presented  in Schedule  1.   Implementation of  the main  activities  is
anticipated to take about four years with some activities extending beyond
that. The project is thus expected to be fully completed by the end of
June 1994. Annual work plans to be reviewed every six months would be
established in agreement with IDA.
13.       Procurement.  The goods  and services  to be  financed under  the
project would be procured in accordance with procedures summarized in
Schedule B. Consultants and technical assistance personnel to be financed
by IDA (US$5.25 million) would be appointed in accordance with the Bank
Group guidelines  of  August  1981  and would  be  employed  on  terms  and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. Vehicles, equipment and spare parts for
OPT (US$0.56 million) would be grouped whenever possible into bid packages
for more than US$50,000 and procured through ICB in accordance with parts I
and 11 of IDA guidelines of May 1986. Items that cannot be grouped into
bid packages of more than US$50,000 up to an aggregate not to exceed
US$250,000, equipment, vehicles and furniture for BEP and the MYIN (US$0.29
million), would be procured through international and local shopping after
receipt of price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers. Civil
Works (US$0.2 million) would be procured in accordance with LCB procedures
satisfactory to IDA. IDA-financed contracts for amounts over US$50,000
equivalent would  be subject  to  prior review.   Other contracts will  be
subject to selective post-award review.
14.       Disbursement.  In line with the average disbursement profile  for
technical &ssistance projects in the Africa Region, the project is forecast
to be disbursed over six years. However, the Government is targeting to
complete disbursement in a much shorter period, reflecting the fact that
the bulk of the project is composed of short-term technical assistance and
training to be disbursed during the first three years of the project.
15.       All disbursements would be fully documented except for  contracts
of less than US$50,000 equivalent, as well as training, and operating costs
(equipment and vehicle maintenance) which will be made against statements
of expenditure (SON). The Director of BEP would have the responsibility
for the preparation of withdrawal applIcations for the BEP component.   The
cabinet director of the Ministry of Finance would have the responsibility
for the preparation of withdrawal applications for the MFIN and OPT
components.
16.       Revolving Fund.  To expedite implementation, the Government would
establish a Special Account in CFAF in the Central Bank - 'Banque Centrale
des Etats de l'Afrique Occidentale' (BCEAO) as Revolving Funds for IDA's
contribution. An initial deposit of US$525,000 equivalent (CFAP 150.0
million) would be made from the proceeds of the proposed credit upon
effectiveness.   Details of the establishment and operation of the  special
account and other disbursement procedures have been agreed. The minimum
replenishment application would be US$100,000. Budgetary provision for
local costs will be inscribed in the annual operating budgets for the MFIN
and the Ministry of Planning and OPT.

Page 5 of 5
17.       Accounts and Audits.  The  BEP, MFIN,  and OPT  would  establish
separate accounts in accordance with accepted accounting principles, to
record all project expenditures and to maintain records on all commitments,
reimbursements and  the  status  of  project  funds.   Agreement  has  been
obtained that independent auditors acceptable to IDA would audit these
accounts and those of OPT and the PESAP annually in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles and in such detail as IDA may request.
Audit reports will be due six months after the end of each fiscal year.
18.       Revortinit and Monitoring.  The Ministry of Planning would be  re-
quired to submit semi-annual reports on the progress of project implementa-
tion, policy reforms and institutional changes, and implementation of the
performance contracts. The scope and detail of these reports have been
agreed upon  with Government.   In  addition, it would prepare  an  annual
report summarizing  progress  in all key  areas  of the  reform.   At  the
completion of the project, the Ministry of Planning would prepare the
project completion report.

TRAINING
1.        The training program is aimed at providing Malians with the
skills required for implementing the PE sector reforms corporate planning
and objective-setting, financial audit and control,t-management informa-
tion system, project cycle and related subjects. In addition to these
specific subject areas, the program would also provide for continuing
training in, and practical exposure to, the ways in thich PE operation
relates to such matters as deve1pfent policy and the appraisal of PE
management personnel and government officials, the latter mostly from
supervisory agencies who will need such knowledge in order to effectively
review, monitor and evaluate action plans. performance contracts, and PR
performance. Each specialist's terms of reference would include training
responsibilities aimed at progressively assigning more of the work to their
Malian colleagues throughout the project life.
