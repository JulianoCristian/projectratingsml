These reforms are expected to: (1) improve\n            public resource management; (2) reduce private sector policy\n            distortions; (3) enhance public enterprise performance; and\n            (4) reduce the burden of public enterprises on public\n            finances and the banking system. The project provides the\n            institutional support needed by Government to extend and\n            deepen its public enterprise reform efforts. project permits\n            the Government to acquire the necessary technical and\n            administrative capacity to formulate and implement reform\n            measures thr a program of general support to the BEP (Bureau\n            des entreprises publiq the MFIN (Ministry of Finance and\n            Commerce).
