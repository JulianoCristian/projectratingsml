(ICR) for the Public Enterprise Institutional\n            Development Project (PEIDP). The overall objective of PEIDP\n            was to provide GOM with the institutional support it needed\n            to extend and deepen its reform efforts under the PESAP. The\n            PEIDP was to address the long-term issue of strengthening\n            the GOM's ability to devise and implement Public\n            Enterprise (PE) reforms as well as to monitor the\n            sector's performance and manage its future development.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. Some key lessons can be\n            gleaned from the project and they were as follows: (i) the\n            first lesson is that when govemment capacity to implement\n            reforms under a quick-disbursing operation is weak, the\n            objective of a companion Technical Assistance (TA) operation\n            should be to provide short to medium-term TA; (ii) the\n            second lesson is that long-term capacity building should not\n            be the objective of a TA project that is a companion to a\n            quick-disbursing operation, as it is impossible always to\n            reconcile the long-term capacity-building objectives with\n            the objective of fulfilling conditionalities for the release\n            of much needed budgetary assistance under a quick-disbursing\n            operation; (iii) the third lesson is that, if the provision\n            of short-term TA and the objective of long-term capacity\n            building must be combined into one project, then the project\n            design should identify clearly the two different objectives\n            and the related streams of support activities for each, as\n            this will help the government to focus on each of the two\n            objectives; (iv) the fourth lesson is that, strong\n            government commitment is essential to the successful\n            implementation of a long-term institutional\n            capacity-building project; and (v) the final and perhaps\n            most important lesson is that capacity-building projects\n            should be supported by a solid implementation plan adopted\n            by the government that clearly reflects its sense of ownership."}, "docdt": "1996-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
