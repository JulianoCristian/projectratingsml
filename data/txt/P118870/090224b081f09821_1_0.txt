                         inputs. This has proved to be an important resource to the communities in bridging their financial gaps until a more definite livelihood opportunity has taken place. The implementation
                         performance is satisfactory, there is no more likelihood of major risks, and the project remains relevant. The project has already achieved most of the targets. Based on the findings of
                         the mission, the achievement of the PDO is Satisfactory and the project is likely to achieve its development outcomes and outputs at the end of the project.

                         Overall Implementation Progress (IP): The actual project expenditure up to July 31, 2013 stands at 98%, 99%, 88% and 97% for Components A, B, C and D respectively, compared
                         to cumulative targets of the agreed six month work plan. The ongoing work plan includes 752 works which corresponds to 752 works contracts awarded to date. PMU, in consultation
                         with MED, has taken many stringent actions in reducing the overcommitment from LKR 680 million during MTR to LKR 65 million now within six months and a special committee is
                         commissioned by MED to resolve outstanding issues on final payments. The status of fulfilling the actions agreed at the previous missions is Satisfactory. The procurement
                         administration is rated Moderately Satisfactory until the overcommitment is leveled while compliance with legal covenants, social and environmental safeguards, financial
                         management, and M&E are rated Satisfactory. The total expenditure is 90% while the disbursement is 96.6 %. A withdrawal application for US$ 1.5 million is being processed now. In
                         view of the above significant achievements, the project implementation progress is upgraded to Satisfactory.

                         Progress of Return and Resettlement: The Government has completed the return and resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs) from the welfare camp to the project area. As
                         per the Government's records and as of July 31, 2013, about 148,904 families (585,458 persons) have been resettled in the five districts of the Northern Province. Of these people,
                         about 236,418 are the people displaced between January-April 2008. It is worthwhile to note that the project was designed to cater only 100,000 IDP returnees.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has entered the final stage of implementation and GOSL, in consultation with IDA, is taking all steps to complete the project by the December 31, 2013 as agreed. But,
                         the following aspects need to be noted:

                         1. There seems to be still an over commitment as a result of accommodating the needs of the newly returning IDPs prior to the MTR. PMU should ensure that no new works or
                         variations are allowed in future and that all commenced works are completed to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.
                         2. Wherever possible, the newly returned IDPs should be assisted in jungle clearing, rehabilitating access roads and cleaning of community wells, once the overcommitment is
                         leveled and savings become available.
                         3. PMU should take early action to commence necessary studies and preparation of the borrower's ICR on time.
