                         successful resettlement of the IDPs. The cash for work activity created new resources and it was an important additional source of finance for essential expenditure related with
                         schooling and agricultural inputs. This has proved to be an important resource to the communities in bridging their financial gaps until a more definite livelihood opportunity has taken
                         place. The implementation performance of the project is satisfactory, there is no more likelihood of major risks, and the project remains relevant. The project has already achieved
                         most of the targets. Based on the findings of the mission, the achievement of the PDO is Satisfactory and the project is likely to achieve its development outcomes and outputs at the

                         end of the project.

                         Overall Implementation Progress (IP): The actual project expenditure up to December 15, 2013 stands at 98%, 100%, 93% and 97% for Components A, B, C and D respectively,
                         compared to cumulative targets of the agreed six month work plan. The ongoing work plan includes 755 works which corresponds to 755 works contracts awarded to date. PMU, in
                         consultation with MED, has taken many stringent actions in reducing the over commitment from LKR 680 million during MTR to zero now within six months and a special committee is
                         commissioned by MED to resolve outstanding issues on final payments. The status of fulfilling the actions agreed at the previous missions is Satisfactory. The procurement
                         administration is rated Moderately Satisfactory until the over commitment is leveled while compliance with legal covenants, social and environmental safeguards, financial
                         management, and M&E are rated Satisfactory. The total expenditure as of December 15, 2014 is 94% while the disbursement is 99.3 %. In view of the above significant
                         achievements, the project implementation progress is upgraded to Satisfactory.

                         Progress of Return and Resettlement: The Government has completed the return and resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs) from the welfare camp to the project area. As
                         per the Government's records and as of December 15, 2013, about 148,904 families (585,458 persons) have been resettled in the five districts of the Northern Province. Of these
                         people, about 236,418 are the people displaced between January-April 2008. It is worthwhile to note that the project was designed to cater only 100,000 IDP returnees.
