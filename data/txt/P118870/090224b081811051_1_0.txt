                         This ISR has been prepared based on the findings of the progress review held at the MED and on the performance achieved after the May 2012 . The project intended to: (i) assist
                         the GoSL primarily in the rapid return and resettlement of the IDPs displaced during the last stages of the war and housed in the welfare camps in Vavuniya after May 2009; (ii) target
                         on about 100,000 out of about 290,000 IDPs living in Vavuniya welfare camps that time; (iii) these target IDPs to be resettled in Phases III and IV of the GoSL’s resettlement plan as

                         defined at the time of the project design in December 2009; and (iii) with flexibility to extending the project assistance to the other returning IDPs in geographic areas outside the
                         Phases III and IV as and when need arose.

                         As per the Government’s records and as of October 31, 2012, the IDP camps have been closed and all persons have been resettled in the five districts of the Northern Province.

                         Some IDPs who were staying with relatives have also returned. Therefore, these resettled families/persons not only include the ones who were housed in the Government’s welfare
                         camps in Vavuniya during the last stages of the war ended in May 2009, but also the long term displaced people who returned back to their original villages. The civil society in North
                         appreciated this pragmatic approach of the project and confirmed that the project has been resourceful and complementary to the IDP return and resettlement program (Uthuru
                         Vasanthaya – Vadakin Vasantham of the GOSL being implemented in the North. However there are further needs to be fulfilled to assist the IDPs resettled recently and to be
                         resettled in the next few months, and the project resources are no sufficient to meet these needs, the Bank has emphasized to the implementing authorities that other resources need
                         to be mobilized to address the needs.


                         Key Achievements:

                         •         6,965 ha of jungle farmland and 369 km defense bunds had been cleared. Farming resumed by the returned IDPs in 6,726 has. The project also provided paddy, red onion,
                         and cowpea and greengram seeds to about 2,525 families and about 85,000 coconut, guava and lemon seedlings to about 12,270 persons. The coconut nursery in Kilionochi district
                         reactivated by the project has started producing coconut seedlings.
                         •         45,097 families had been assisted with 2.2 million person-days of labor employment generated through the cash for work program and clearing school lands, temple lands,
                         public places, hospital lands, rural roads, defense bunds and irrigation canals.
                         •         476 km village roads, 91 minor irrigation schemes, and 385 miscellaneous public and community public buildings have been completed. .
                         •         Many breached embankments has been restored, the reservoir impounded on time, and the scheme was re-commissioned enabling the returned IDPs to resume irrigated
                         farming.
                         •         School buildings restored have helped to conduct classes conveniently. Most completed government office buildings, including DS offices, agrarian service centers and
                         vetinerary offices, have resumed public and other technical services to the resettled people. The irrigation schemes restored are providing irrigation supply to the IDPs and maha and
                         yala cultivations have been resumed after many years in many villages.
                         •         The paddy stores have been useful in storing the paddy production in the last maha season. The GAs, DSs and beneficiaries are very appreciative of this support of the
                         project.
                         •         The rehabilitation and restoration works for another 135 km of village roads, 29 minor and medium irrigation schemes, 102 buildings and 9 drinking water supply schemes
                         (including the water storage, pumping systems, office buildings and staff quarters, transmission and distribution systems for all the 9 schemes) are ongoing and are at various stages
                         of progress.
                         •         The drinking water supply schemes, when completed, are expected to provide safe drinking water supply to about 51,226 retuned IDP.

                         It was also noted that the Government Agents (GAs) of the five districts of the North reported to the Task Team that ENREP has complemented the Government's resettlement
                         program tremendously, supported the livelihood recovery of the returned and resettled people, contributed to the jump-starting of farming activities in the resettled villages, and
                         assisted in the resumption of essential government service delivery in the project areas.
