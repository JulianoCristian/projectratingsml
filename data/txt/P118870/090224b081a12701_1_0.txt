                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support Government of Sri Lanka#s efforts to rapidly resettle the IDPs in the Northern Province by creating an enabling
                         environment#. It will be achieved through: (A) Emergency Assistance to IDPs; (B) a Work-fare Program; (C) Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Essential Public and
                         Economic Infrastructure; and (D) Project Management Support.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The indicator of the agreed project results matrix to measure the PDO is the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) returned to their place of origin and supported by the
                         project. As per the Government’s records and as of March 31, 2012 about 143,615 families (476,013 persons) have been resettled in the five districts of the Northern Province,
                         against a project target of 100,000 people. The achievement of the PDO is therefore Satisfactory. It is to be noted that the project was designed to: (i) assist the GoSL in the rapid

                         return and resettlement of the IDPs displaced during the last stages of the war and housed temporarily in the welfare camps in Vavuniya after May 2009; (ii) target to support the
                         Government to resettle about 100,000 of those IDPs in Phases III and IV of the GoSL’s resettlement plan of the Government at the time of the project appraisal; and (iii) extend the
                         project assistance to the other returning IDPs in geographic areas outside the Phases III and IV as and when need arose.

                         The project provided its assistance to the IDPs by aligning and spreading its geographic coverage with actual IDP return and resettlement of the Government in all the five districts.
                         Therefore, the above number of the IDPs represents not only the IDPs who came from the Government’s welfare camps in Vavuniya and resettled in the project assisted villages, but
                         also the other IDPs who returned from various other parts of the country as well as from India. This is because during the project implementation, the villages assisted by the Project
                         had an influx of IDPs not only from the Government’s welfare camps but also the long term IDPs returned from other locations outside the welfare camps too (Colombo, India and
                         other parts of the country). Therefore, the actual number of IDPs benefitted directly and indirectly by the project interventions is more than the originally targeted 100,000 persons
                         expected to return from the welfare camps. All the five Government Agents confirmed that ENREP, complemented by the ongoing Reawakening Project (RaAP), has been one of the
                         key instruments of the Government to assist the returning IDPs in the last three years.

                         Overall Implementation Progress (IP):

                         Performance of all four project components continues to be Satisfactory. The outputs of these four components are well in line with the targets of the work program cleared with the
                         Bank at May 2012 mission and outcomes have collectively contributed to the achievement of the PDO. The total cumulative disbursement to date is US$ 48.75 million from IDA
                         Credit (75%) and US$ 10.5 million (100%) from AusAID Grant. Also, the IDA Credit is almost fully committed (indeed over-committed due to unexpected urgent needs of returning
                         IDPs) for the contracts already awarded and the AusAID grant is also closed. The project is very likely to reach full disbursement of the IDA Credit (US$ 65 million) and AUSAID
                         Grant (US$ 10.5 million) has been fully disbursed. The actual project expenditure up to December 31, 2012, including the expenditure claims under process, stands at 99%, 99%,
                         78% and 93% for Components A, B, C and D respectively, compared to cumulative financial targets of the agreed six month work plan in May 2012. The status of fulfilling the actions
                         agreed at the previous missions is Satisfactory. The compliance with financial management, legal covenants and safeguards and M&E are rated Satisfactory.
