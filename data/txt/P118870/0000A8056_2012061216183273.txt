                         This ISR has been prepared based on the findings of the seventh Implementation Support and Review Mission during May 7-16, 2012. The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has
                         made significant progress in the return and resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs) in the project area. The project intended to: (i) assist the GoSL primarily in the rapid
                         return and resettlement of the IDPs displaced during the last stages of the war and housed in the welfare camps in Vavuniya after May 2009; (ii) target on about 100,000 out of about

                         As per the Government’s records and as of March 31, 2012 about 143,615 families (476,013 persons) have been resettled in the five districts of the Northern Province. Therefore,
                         these resettled families/persons not only include the ones who were housed in the Government’s welfare camps in Vavuniya during the last stages of the war ended in May 2009, but
                         also the long term displaced people who returned back to their original villages. The Government Agents too appreciated this pragmatic approach of the project and confirmed that
                         the project has been resourceful and complementary to the IDP return and resettlement program (Uthuru Vasanthaya – Vadakin Vasantham of the GOSL being implemented in the
                         North. However there are further needs to be fulfilled to assist the IDPs resettled recently and to be resettled in the next few months, and the project resources are no sufficient to
                         meet these needs, the Bank has emphasized to the implementing authorities that other resources need to be mobilized to address the needs.


                         Key Achievements:

                         •         6,748 ha of jungle farmland and 369 km defense bunds had been cleared. Farming resumed by the returned IDPs in 5,986 has. The project also provided paddy, red onion,
                         and cowpea and greengram seeds to about 2525 families and about 85,000 coconut, guava and lemon seedlings to about 12,270 persons. The coconut nursery in Kilionochi district
                         reactivated by the project has started producing coconut seedlings.
                         •         45,097 families had been assisted with 2.2 million person-days of labor employment generated through the cash for work program and clearing school lands, temple lands,
                         public places, hospital lands, rural roads, defense bunds and irrigation canals.
                         •         442 km village roads, 79 minor irrigation schemes, and 323 miscellaneous public and community public buildings have been completed. .
                         •         Dam embankment of Kalmadu irrigation scheme in Kilinochci had been breached since early 2009 consequent to the war and the scheme was defunct. The breached
                         embankment has been restored, the reservoir impounded on time, and the scheme was re-commissioned enabling the returned IDPs to resume irrigated farming from this yala
                         season.
                         •         School buildings restored have helped to conduct classes conveniently. Most completed government office buildings, including DS offices, agrarian service centers and
                         vetinerary offices, have resumed public and other technical services to the resettled people. The irrigation schemes restored are providing irrigation supply to the IDPs and maha and
                         yala cultivations have been resumed after many years in many villages.
                         •         The paddy stores have been useful in storing the paddy production in the last maha season. The GAs, DSs and beneficiaries are very appreciative of this support of the
                         project.
                         •         The rehabilitation and restoration works for another 169 km of village roads, 25 minor and 9 medium irrigation schemes (total 25), 196 buildings and 9 drinking water supply
                         schemes (including the water storage, pumping systems, office buildings and staff quarters, transmission and distribution systems for all the 9 schemes) are ongoing and are at
                         various stages of progress.
                         •         The drinking water supply schemes, when completed, are expected to provide safe drinking water supply to about 51,000 retuned IDP.

                         It was also noted that the Government Agents (GAs) of the five districts of the North reported to the mission that ENREP has complemented the Government#s resettlement program
                         tremendously, supported the livelihood recovery of the returned and resettled people, contributed to the jump-starting of farming activities in the resettled villages, and assisted in the
