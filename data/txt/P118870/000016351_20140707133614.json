"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall outcome rating of the\n            Emergency Northern Recovery Project for Sri Lanka was judged\n            to be moderately satisfactory. The Bank and borrower\n            performance were satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was moderate. Significant changes included change in\n            the scope of the components and to some of the\n            sub-components, and reallocations of the appraisal estimated\n            budget. Several lessons were learned. A post conflict\n            recovery project can provide immediate assistance to\n            Internally Displaced People (IDP) returnees and\n            substantially help restore their livelihoods provided it can\n            be started immediately, has political commitment and\n            effective implementation mechanisms in place, and has the\n            right components. Including a wide range of provincial,\n            district and local level implementation agencies into a\n            project enables an emergency recovery project to\n            simultaneously address urgent high priority multiple\n            recovery needs of IDPs in war ravaged areas. Political\n            leadership is necessary to provide effective coordination.\n            The effectiveness of short recovery operations can be\n            enhanced through careful targeting of beneficiaries,\n            beneficiary needs assessment and complaints redressal\n            mechanisms. Active participation of beneficiaries in the\n            implementation of project supported activities is also\n            crucial for sustaining project funded village-level\n            infrastructure. Allocation of project funds on a first-come\n            first-serve basis rather than fixed district allocations\n            increases project success provided effective social\n            safeguards are in place. A large demand-based public\n            services and infrastructure rehabilitation component should\n            be subject to economic analysis/justification during project\n            design and implementation, have adequate provision for\n            funding operations and maintenance, and incorporate an\n            unallocated reserve fund of at least 10 percent of the\n            component cost.  Well-coordinated cash for work programs can\n            be extremely effective in post conflict situations to\n            encourage IDPs to return to their areas of origin, and to\n            provide them with immediate and extremely beneficial\n            assistance to kick-start their livelihoods until regular\n            income generation activities are resumed.  Gender\n            mainstreaming and targeting of vulnerable and marginalized\n            persons should be incorporated in recovery projects, rather\n            than rely only on area-based targeting and self-targeting by\n            setting labor rates below market rates."}, "docdt": "2014-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
