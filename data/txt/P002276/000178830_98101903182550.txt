INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED CREDITS
TO TEE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR
THE TERRES NEUVES SETTLEMENT PROJECT AND
THE CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on tao proposed
credits to the Republie of Senegal in amounts in various currencies
equivalent to US$1.35 million for the Terres Neuves Settlement Project
and US.$3.7 million for the Casamance Rice Project.  These projects are
designed to achieve broad common objectives; they are accordingly discussed
in this single report, in the context of the situation of agriculture in
Senegal and what the Bank is doing to help the Government foster agricul-
tural development.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Republic of Senegal, which became independent in 1960 and a
member of the Bank Group in 1962, has until recently received the bulk of its
foreign aid from France and the European Economic Community (EEG). This
assistance was substantial but because of the special circumstances
following independence it did little more than help cushion the depress-
ing effects of the adjustment forced upon Senegal during its first
decade. In 1960 Senegal was one of the most developed countries in
West Africa but this was to a large extent based on Dakar being the
economic ancl administrative capital of French West Africa. The end of
the West African federation terminated Senegals leading role, so that
the country's industrial base had to adjust to a smaller market.   At
the same time, price support by France for the country' s main export
crop was discontinued and groundnut prices had to adjust themselves to
prevailing world market levels.
3.        The bulk of Bank Group lending to Senegal has been for trans-
portation, essentially for projects which could not easily be financed
by traditional lenders (Annex 1). In 1966 a credit for improving the
railways waSS made. The project is expected to be completed in the first
quarter of 1972, almost three years behind schedule because of difficulties
on the managerial and financial side and the use of savings under the
project for additional track relaying. A recent supervision mission
reported that satisfactory steps were being taken by the Senegalese
authorities, and a follow-up operation is under consideration. In 1967
a loan was rmade for Dakar Port. All new construction work has been
completed; only dredging - because of the unexpected presence of hard
material - hlas set back completion by nine months to October 1971. Imple-
mentation oi the 1970 highway project, which focuses on the improvement of



feeder roads, is progressing satisfactorily. The contract for con-
struction was awarded in March and work is expected to start soon.  The
road Jniprovement  and maintenance study began in November 1970.
4.        As the Senegalese Government placed increasing emphasis on
agriculture, and as the capacity of the Bankts Permanent Mission in
West Africa increased, the Bank Group was able to direct its lending
to this field. A first operation was undertaken with the financing of
the groundnut-millet improvement program in early 1969.   The program
has not beer, successful, not only because groundnut production has
fallen becattse of poor weather but also because of organizational
problems and inadequate producer prices. The operation has been under
close supervision, and during negotiations on the projects now proposed,
an understarnding vas reached on the additional measures required to
rehabilitate the groundnut sector. The Bank Group project needs to be
amended to take into account changed conditions as described in para. 25
of Part II of this report.
5.        In May 1966, IFC2 made an equity investment of US$0.8 million
in and a long-term loan of US$2.4 million to SIES (Société Industrielle
d'Engrais au Sénégal) which operates a fertilizer plant near Dakar.
Developments in agriculture have seriously affected fertilizer con-
sumption which has dropped sharzly.  The Government is honoring its
obligation under a "take or pay" contract according to which it will
purchase 60,coo tons of fertilizer per year or pay a compensation to
SIES. Discussions are going on between representatives of the Governmont,
IFC and the shareholders on these matters.
6.        Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken by the Bank
Group on projects which will broaden the base of Senegal's economy
through diversification of agriculture and which will assist the Govern-
ment in making the best possible use of the country's resources. Since
Senegal's adjustment process is virtually completed (para.2), economic
growth is expected to resume on a moderate scale. The Government is
also gradual:ly imnproving its capacity to execute projects, and future
foreign aid can be expected to make a more substantial contribution to
growth than :in the past. One further proposal for an IDA credit is
expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in this fiscal
year, namely a project for technical education, including agricultural
training. For fiscal year 1972 we are in the course of preparing projects
in the fields of urban development, public utilities and railways.
7.        Bank Group assistance to Senegalese agriculture has two major
objectives. The first is to assist the Government in solving the
difficulties confronting the groundnut sector, from which most of the
population derives its livelihood. The second is to help the Government
in its program of diversification; two areas of diversification appear
particularly promising.  One is the development of the southeastern



- 3 -
region known as the Terres Neuves where ecological conditions are more
favorable for farming than in the groundnut basin and where a resettle-
ment scheme is proposed by the Government. The other is the expansion
of rice production in the Casamance area, traditionally a rice growing
area where growing conditions are favorable and where increased pro-
duction would substantially reduce the need for imports which are growing
rapidly. Tlese are the two projects financing for which is now proposed.
PART II - COUNTRY BACIGROUND
8.        A report on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Senegal" (AW-15a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10,
1970 (R70-113). A Basic Data Sheet is attached (Annex 4).
Economic Situation and Policies
9.       Ween Senegal became independent in 1960 it was one of the most
developed countries in West Africa and at the same time the most
industrialized, with manufacturing accounting for 12 percent of GDP. The
relatively high standard of living was the result of Dakar's position as
the economic: center and administrative capital of French West Africa (AOF),
the first characterized by a concentration of manufacturing and services
enterprises entirely managed by expatriate personnel serving a market of
over 20 million consumers; the second resulting in a sizeable government
administration.  While these functions had their main impact on the
standard of living of the urban population, the rural sector profited
from the French guarantee of grouridnut prices substantially above those
in world markets. As a result, at the time of independence, Senegal had
an artificielly high standard of living, out of proportion to the limited
economic potential of the country and the generally low standard of
education. These advantages were lost one by one during the first six
years after independence which forced Senegal into a serious process of
readaptatiori. The break up of AOF (1960) reduced Senegal's exports of
manufacturedl products by 25 percent within one year. Manufacturing
production and services were further reduced by the departure of most
of the French services and of many French civil servants. The loss of
preferential prices for groundnuts (1967/68) resulted in a fall of export
prices of almost 20 percent. As groundnuts (including processing)
account for almost 20 percent of GDP and over 75 percent of exports, this
sharp fall had a substantial impact on the general economic situation.
It forced the Government to reduce export taxes, adversely affecting
government revenues, and to reduce producer prices which made it un-
attractive to farmers to use inputs (fertilizer, equipment, etc.) and
thus contributed to the recent sharp fall in groundnut production.
Government attempts to deal with the aftermath of independence, namely
the loss of Senegal's leading role in administrative services and manufac-
turing, were hampered by the great number of civil servants that came
on government payrolls.



10.       As a result of these developments, GDF growth between 1961 and
1968 averaged 2.5 percent per year which is only marginally over the
estimated population growth of 2.2 percent. GDP gradually rose to
205 billion CFAF in 1968 but dropped to slightly under 200 billion CFAF
in 1969, mainly as a consequence of a sharp decline in groundnut output
which offset expansion elsewhere.
11.       In the Lace of these difficulties, Government has maintained
during the entire period since independence a conservative financial
policy; the tax burden close to 20 percent of GDP is among the highest
in Africa. Nevertheless, Senegal's public finances have shown a steady
deterioration since 1965. Current revenues have stagnated because of
a decline in economic activity and, while the current budget is likely
to remain in surplus, it can make little contribution to the financing
of investmenit over the next few years. A very large share of public
investment will therefore have to be financed by foreign aid which will
have to cover some local expenditure as well as foreign, particularly
on schemes iwhich do not have a high foreign component. As foreign debt
service is :Low (under 2 percent of foreign exchange receipts), there is
some margin for foreign borrowing but a substantial increase in the
foreign debt burden is likely in the medium term.  As the difficult
public finance situation limits conventional borrowing, most foreign
aid should be granted on soft terms.
Agricultura:L Problems and Policies
12.       These financing problems are compounded by the failure of the
Senegalese Government to pursue an effective development policy.   It
continued to foster industrialization, particularly import substitution,
through increased protection, whîch benefited foreign enterprises and
the urban sector, but accentuated the deterioration of the terms of
trade of the farmers. In agriculture the Governmnent tried to stimulate
diversification but early efforts were insufficient and often ill-
directed. 'he Government also failed to take urgent and decisive
action to iinprove groundnut production on which the economy remained
critically dependent. Thus, Government policies were largely in-
effectual in dealing with more fundamental economic problems.   The
dramatic reduction in groundnut production has had a depressing effect
on the whole economy which has now brought a sense of urgency to the
Governrment in facing the problems of agriculture. As a result, the
Government is taking steps to improve farmers' incentives and to create
new opportunities in rural areas.



13.       The potential in agriculture is severely limited by low rain-
fall and generally poor soils.  Only 15 percent of the total area is
cultivated, mostly in small farms and with extensive methods. Most -
of the farming area is within 200 lm of Dakar in the so-called ground-
nut basin where the pressure of overpopulation is felt and overcropping
has exhausted nearLy all fertility. There is good land available in
the southeast and there has been some spontaneous and unorganized
migration to this area in recent years but lack of infrastructure and
guidance have so far hindered development. Some richer soils also
exist along the banks of the Senegal and Casamance Rivers.
14.       Farming is traditionally based on growing cereals, mainly
millet, for subsistence and groundnuts for cash. The problem stems
mainly from an excessive dependence on groundnut for agricultural
income, direct and indirect budgetary revenue and foreign exchange --
earnings. The problem has been aggravated by the slow growth of agri-
cultural production during the past decade, which up to 1969 averaged
less than 3 percent per annum. Main causes for this slow growth have
been the :Loss of guaranteed export prices for groundnuts, the rural
exodus and during the last half of the decade unusually bad weather
seriously affecting the groundnut, millet and rice crops. The Govern-
ment has become increasingly aware of these problems and has attempted to
coirpensatc  for them by an increase in the output of groundnuts and a
diversification of crops, but it has underestimated the task of estab-
lishing an adequate institutional framework and overestimated the
degree to which it could induce farmers to produce the main cash crop,
groundnuts, without providing them with adequate incentives.
15.       Groundnut cultivation, associated with millet and some other
food crops, has for a long time corresponded to an accepted equilibrium
between the farmers' subsistence and cash needs.   However, considering-
the implication of recent years of drought and the farmers' deteriorat-
ing terms of trade, it is understandable that farmers have often given
priority to the production of food crops, thereby consciously reducing
the production of cash crops. There is, however, sufficient proof that
the Senegalese farmer responds to production incentives whenever he
feels these incentives are real; but it is important that this en- -
couragement should not be to the detriment of food production. More-
over, there are limits to what can be achieved, given the deflciencies
in farmer training. Efforts to elicit better response from farmers are
handicapped by the lack of rural education and by the fact that the
standard primary-education system is ill adapted to the needs of the
rural population.
16.       Senegal is the fifth largest groundnut producer in the world
after India, the People's Republic of China, Nigeria and the U.S.



- 6 -
After 15 years of continuous expansion, groundnut production reached
a peak of 1.1 million tons in 1965/66 of which 1 million tons was
marketed.  ',ince then, output has fallen considerably and total marketing
is not expected to exceed 450,000 tons in 1970/71.  Even now, half of
the acreage under cultivation is devoted to groundnuts which account for
about half oa agricultural production, two thirds of farm income and
70 percent of export receipts. Value added by groundnut oil factories
represents in normal years25 percent of total value added by the
industrial sector.
17.       The climate is generally favorable for groundnut cultivation,
but its great variability, bath from year to year and fron region to
region, can affect production seriously. According to Senegalese
authorities the period 1965/1970 was the first time that, wzithin 5 years,
3 years have been subject to bad weather wihich took on disastrous pro-
portions in .1970. Little can be done to alleviate the effect of the
weather, except the development of seeds which can germinate i%dth little
rain. In genaeral, groundnut crops all over W4est Africa have been
especially poor in the 1970/71 crop year.  These events have seriously
affected exports and have pushed up prices of groundnuts and oil.
18.       Although climatic conditions have been a major factor affect-
ing recent crop years, yields in Senegal have declined since 1966.
Moreover, the declirie in marketed crops has been more than the decline
in production.  Rural autoconsumption has clearly stepped up and a
considerable volume of groundnuts has been sold in The Ganbia and> to
a lesser extent, in Mauritania, because of more attractive market conditions
there.
Bank Group Groundnut-Millet Project (1969)
19.       The first groundnut-millet program started in 1964 as a four-
year operation financed by the EEC to mnaintain and possibly increase
farmers' incomes at a time of declining prices.  At the same time and
as a result of a political decision by the Government, marketing was
completely re!organized on a cooperative basis and private traders
uere gradually eliminated.  The new- system proved inefficient and had to
be modified almost every year. In 1968, the Government recognized the
urgent need ta continue the program after the closing of the EEC project
at the expiration of the first Yaoundé treaty. The Bank Group appraised
a USt2h million operation, of which US$9.5 million was financed by the
Group in early 1969. The project included not only the provision of
agricultural credit through the national development bank (BNDS) for
the purchase by farmers of implements and draft animals, but also
consultant services for an analysis of the cooperativest supply and
marketing agency (ONCAD) and counterpart training for ONCAD staff. The



- 7 -
project continued the financing of cooperative services and prcvided funds
for the equipment of the Bambey Agricultural Research Institute.
20.       Use of funds provided under the Bank Group project for medium-
term loans to farmers will be less than was expected since farmers are
increasingly reluctant to grow groundnuts. This reluctance results not
only from poor technical and financial returns from fertilizer and
equipment, particularly under the repeatedly unfavorable climatic con-
ditions, but also to a large extent from unattractive farm gate prices
for groundnuts as compared with the cost of inputs. In addition, farmers
have been discouraged by an inadequate marketing organization based on
a compulsory cooperative system which has not met their needs with
respect to supply of inputs and the purchase of their production.   Finally,
inability of the Government to ensure satisfactory coordination and
cooperation among all institutions and services involved, together with
a deterioration in the operating efficiency of the BNDS, have aggravated
the problem.
21.       After the 1969/70 crop year, the first under the Bank Group
project, iwhen it became clear that the project was not successful, the
Bank urged the Government to take strong action. An attractive and
stable producer price was advocated to take into account the substantial
increase in wiorld market prices. Methods of farmer payments iwere to be
improved and the Coordination Committee set up under the project would
have to become more powerful and effective in carrying out its task.
Accompanying action to improve credit accounting was also necessary.
Action was required to strengthen the extension services and improve
their program and to speed up reorganization of ONCAD along lines re-
cormended by consultants financed under the project.
22.       During the first half of 1970, the Government became seriously
concerned and took some limited action. Farm gate prices were increased
by 1 CFAF or about 6 percent. Because of budgetary considerations, the
Government was loath, however, to grant higher prices in view of uncertain
price developments on the world market. Nevertheless, it did simplify
somnewhat the pricing system and improve cash payments. These develop-
ments took place against a background of continuously rising world
market prices which reached record levels in late 1970 allowing the
Government to secure substantial profits through its marketing monopoly.



- 8 -
23.       The extension services recognized that fertilizer and animal-
drawn implements have to be introduced as a package adapted to the
size of farms, an approach which was adopted at the start of the 1970/71
campaign.  The ONCAD consultant team prepared an interim short-term
prograni for immediate implementation. The consultants were also asked
to give priority to improving bath the services provided by the co-
operatives and the supply of inputs. An independent audit of the credit
institution BNDS,made at the Bank Group's request, showed the need for
corrective financial measures.
2h.       During the 1970/71 agricultural season, the evolution of the
Bank Group project was closely followed by Bank staff. W4hen it became
apparent in :December 1970 that extremely adverse clinatic conditions
had offset any favorable impact government action might have had, the
Bank Group in close coordination with other aid donors advised the
Government to take decisive action to help groundnut farmers as a
condition for further assistance. Subsequently, agreement was reached
in March 197:L between all parties involved on measures to be taken by
the governnment. These are:
-i-       Reorganization of the coordinating committee under the leader-
ship of a strong and able personality with powers to implement
its decisions and who would report directly to the Prime
Minister.  This committee would especially be in charge oa
considering and implementing measures proposed by consultants
under the Bank Group project with a view to improving the
marketing organization. The consultants have been making
progress in rearganizing ONCAD and are actively participating
in ONCAD's work with respect to supply and marketing, adminis-
tration and finance. In other areas, such as restructuring
of the cooperatives, training for ONCAD and cooperative
prcfessional staff, mechanical shelling, selection and treatment
of seeds, proposals have been made by the consultants to the
Government which has yet to make a decision.
-ii-      Payment of up to 3 CFAF per kg bonus to the farmers on marketed
production of the past campaign; individual payments would
take into accolnt the incidence of the drought and debt repayment
records.
-iii-     Increase of the forthcoming campaign's (1971-72) producer
prices ta 22 CFAF per kg, to be applied nationwide.
-iv-      Writing off the balance oa outstanding BNDS and ONCAD loans,
at least of those which have matured, thereby unburdening farmers
oa debts they cannot possibly hope to repay for years to come;
the Groundnut Stabilization Fund will provide this financing.



-v-       Payment to farmers of a "planting bonus" for groundnuts and
millet out of US$7.2 million of emergency assistance (see
para. 25) provided by the EEC.
-vi-      Ending the use of price stabilization fund assets for other
purposes.
-vii-     Reorganization by consultants of accounting procedures in
BlNDS aimed at putting in order all BNDS accounts and at
rationalizing methods and procedures.
25.       Il; is expected that these measures should restore a climate
of confidence among farmers.  The Government will be assisted by the
European Development Fund uhich is allocating US$7.2 million, half of
which is from its emergency funds pursuant to Article 20 of the Yaoundé
Convention which foresees help for "associated states to deal iwith
special and extraordinary difficulties creating an exceptional situa-
tion, having, serious repercussions on thoir economic potential.   Thle
proceeds are expected to be made available in the form of a planting
premium, thuLs adding another financial incentive for increased production.
The Bank Group has proposed to assist the Governrment by adjusting its
1969 Bank/IDA project financing to the changed conditions. This requires
a reduction of the agricultural credit category under the project by
almost 45 percent in view of the decline of farmers' demands. Accordingly
the US$3.5 niillion Bank loan 5S4-SE was cancelled on March 25, 1971 at
the request of the Government. Furthermore, a revision of the allocation
of proceeds of the US$6.o million IDA credit is required as follows:
-i-       to cover the entire cost of the consultant contract for
management services concerning ONCAD, this category is to be
increased by US$175,000 by the end of the contract in
September 1972. The consultants will iniplement recommendations
accepted by the Government as a result of the consultantst
analysis of ONCADWs problems;
-ii-      to withdraw an amount of US$250,000 earmarked for overseas
training because Italian private funds have provided the re-
quired financing. It is envisaged to use these funds for
financing local training for cooperative staff and for
merging cooperatives in the groundnut basin. WJhile a program
is being worked out, the above-mentioned amount will be
transferred to the unallocated category; and
_iii-     to finance the BNDS accounting reorganization, at a maximum
cost of US$270,000.

PART III - THE PROPOSED PROJECTS
The Terres Neuves Project
26.       The "Terres Neuves"' project is a land settlement scheme,
designed to assist and control the migration and settlement of farmers
from the overpopulated groundnut basin in suitable areas of Eastern
Senegal, a region with relatively high potential because of better
ecologicaI conditions. The project is a pilot operation which will
also introduce farmers to a diversified cropping pattern and to
improved cultivation methods. Migration is occurring spontaneously,
but on a inodest scale. An increase in the pace of settlement would
make use of large areas of good lands in Eastern Senegal where more
than 200,000 ha seem suitable for cultivation. An area of 25,000 ha
situated west of Tambacounda and south of the railway has been selected
as the first phase of a larger settlement programn. A follow-up phase
would cover an area up to 150,000 ha. The Government is attaching
great importance to the operation, which is expected to make a sub-
stoetial contribution towards long-term economic growth and strengthen-
ing of the economy, while it will also help solve pressing social
issues due to overpopulation in the groundnut basin.
27.       The project consists of:
(a) surveying the project area in detail, including
aerial photography;
(b)  creating, staffing and equipping a State Company,
"La Société des Terres Neuves" (STN), to carry out
the project;
(c) constructing feeder roads, warehouses and wells;
(d)  recruiting and transporting to the project area,
300 farm families and settling these families in
six villages to be located and developed under the
project;
(e) providing extension services both to project
settlers and to 250 farmers' families already
established in the area;
(f) providing seasonal and medium-term credit to
settlers and established farms by means of a re-
volving fund operated by STN;
(g)  providing a central pool of equipment for hire to
project farmers and te those already settled there;



- il -
(h)  conducting the studies needed to determine the
size, scope, and operation of subsequent phases
of the settlement program;
(i) establishing marketing arrangements;
(j)  carrying out surveys of the socio-economic and
technical results of the project and feasibility
studies of a second phase of settlement.
28.       In view of the pace-setting nature of the project, it is
considered preferable to entrust management to a special entity,
rather than to the existing national organizations, which are them-
selves in process of reorganization. Therefore Société des Terres
Neuves ('STN), a statutory corporation, will be established and
managed by agents, which, because of the prominence of cotton in the
project, are anticipated to be CFDT (Compagnie Française pour le
Développement des Fibres Textiles), a French technical assistance
agency specialized in the development of fiber crops. Other consul-
tants will assist in carrying out the technical and sociological sur-
veys requLired for planning subsequent phases of the settlement program.
29.       Project costs are estimated at US$1.8 million over 10 years,
the period required to bring all project farms into full production.
During the six-year period in which the proposed IDA credit would be
disbursed, project costs are estimated at CFAF430 million (US$1.55
million), of which the foreign exchange component is CFAF246 million
(US$0.9 million) or 57 percent (Annex 2). It is proposed that IDA
cover sone 80 percent of project costs during this period, represent-
ing the equivalent of $1.25 million. Government would contribute
$0.30 million over the six-year period and $0.55 million o-er the ten-
year period. A religious group, as explained belaw, would contribute
to the project through IDA, in the amount of $100,000.
30.       "Bread for the Wlorld,il an agency of the Evangelical
(Lutheran) Church in Germany, has been seeking, in recent years,
closer cooperation with multilateral development agencies and has
now expressed interest in using the World Bank Group as a channel for
some of the funds which "Bread" devotes to the financing of projects
for econoamic and social betterment in low-income countries. Such
cooperation would spare "Bread" the necessity of increasing its own
staff and administrative costs for project selection, appraisal and
follow-up; and "Bread" is willing to use such channels so long as
its funds can be used for projects which will directly benefit the
ordinary people of developing countries. For some time, the Bank/IDA
and "Bread" have been exchanging information concerning their respec-
tive objectives, policies and procedures, with a view to finding an
initial project where "Bread" funds might suitably be employed. It
was agreedi, and the Governnent of Senegal has concurred, that the



- 12 -
"Terres Neuves" project would present a good opportunity for such an
arrangement., In order to make this possible, the IDA credit would
be increasecL to $1.35 million frorm the amount of $1.25 million
originally proposed.  The contribition by "Bread" would be represented
by a participation agreement between "Bread" and IDA. "Bread" funds
would be avaLilable for local expenditure.
31.       The Association's own contribution of $1.25 million would
cover approximately 81 percent of project costs from 1971 through
1976 or 76 perceLlt of the ten-year total. The credit would finance
the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project and local cost of
US$0.36 million (23 percent of project costs over 6 years).   The
remaining local costs over the period, CFAF56 million (US$0.20 million)
or 12 percertt of total project costs, would be met by Governnent, after
taking into account "'Bread for the World's" contribution of $100 ,000
(7 percent). The Government would bear the total cost for the 4
subsequent years (about $260,000 equivalent).
32.       Ail contracts for goods and services required for the pro-
ject would be amarded locally since their value would be too small to
attract interest outside Senegal. Non-Senegalese companies are wiell
represented in Dakar and local procurement procedures should ensure
that competitive bids would be obtained.
33.       Ail project funds would be channeled through the Ministry
of Finance to STN. The initial provision would be CFAF35 million
(US$126,0O) from the Government as STI's share capital, and Govern-
mentts remaining contribution, together with proceeds of the IDA
credit, would be made available ta STN in the form of a grant (Section
3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).   Since the Governmnent
requires STNi to pay import duties and sales taxes, Government will
increase its contribution by an amount equal to duties and taxes paid.
34.       The project would generate foreign exchange earnings and
import-savings of about US$300,000 a year at maturity.  Based on the
Bank's price forecasts for groundnuts, cotton, maize and sorghum, the
economic return from the project is estimated at 13 percent.   Indivi-
dual rates cf return for the settlement and established farmer pro-
grams are 12.5 percent and 15.8 percent respectively.  At maturity in
1981, the average settler's cash income from his holding would be
about US$440 annually, about 70 percent higher than the current
average farn income in the groundnut basin from which settlers would
be selected.

The Casamarce  Rice Project
35.       The project's principal objective is to increase the
production of rice, groundnuts and food crops. Rice is increasingly
in demand by the local population as food grain, and the Governnent
intensifies its efforts to increase domestic production of paddy so
as to stablize or possibly reduce sharply rising rice imports.
Domestic production of rice has been stagnating for some time, depend-
ing on cliniatic conditions, at around 100,000 tons, while rice con-
sumption has increased steadily and reached 300,000 tons in 1970,
making Senegal West Africats largest rice importer and involving a
foreign exchange cost of about $25 million. About 80 percent of
domestical]y produced rice is grown in the Casamance region, the
climate and soils of wJhich are suitable for the efficient production
of rice ancd a wide range of other crops. The project would generate
a net foreign exchange gain of about US$1.7 million a year at maturity,
mainly fromi replacing imported with domestically grown rice, but also
from exports of groundnuts.
36.       Swamp rice is traditionally grown in the Casamance region as
opposed to upland rice, of which farmers have limited experience. The
project would involve, through provision of water control works, the
improvement of about 2,000 ha of existing suamp rice land.   It would
also inclucle the cultivation of 9,500 ha of rainfed rice, which would
be grownx mostly in rotation with groundnuts and food crops on about
32,000 ha of land cultivated by some 5,000 farm families.
37.       The project consists of:
(a) the establishment of a project organization unit,
within the Ministry of Rural Development, responsible
for carrying out the project and providing extension
services to farmers. This organization would appoint
suitable Senegalese staff, complemented where neces-
sary by non-Senegalese specialists. Close coordina-
tion would be maintained with the national extension
,ervice operating in the area;
(b) construction of irrigation and drainage works for
2,000 ha of swamps;
(c) construction of 24 rice mills and associated storage;
(d) clearance of 9,500 ha of land, provision of land
clearing winches for this purpose and provision of
crop sprayers for loan to project farmers;



(e)  iiprovement of project area roads;  and
(f) provision of seasonal and medium-term credit by
BNDS to project cooperatives for relending to
their members. ONCAD, the public marketing
organization now under reorganization, would be
used as a channel for administering the credits
to cooperatives.
38.       Project costs during the 10-year period 1972-1981 are estimated
at CFAF1.73 billion (US$6.23 million), of which the foreign exchange
component is CFAF684 million (US$2.45 million), or 40 percent. The IDA
credit is to finance part of the costs incurred in the first five years
of this period, namely 1972-1976 (Annex 3). These costs are estimated
at CFAF1.36 billion (US$4.9 million), of which the foreign exchange
component is about CFAFO.6 billion (US$2.1 million). The proposed IDA
credit of US$3.7 million wouLd cover approximately 76 percent of project
costs in th,s first five years, of which foreign costs would be US$2.1
million and local costs US$1.6 million. The farmers would provide CFAF
26 million (US$0.1 million), in addition to the labor and materials they
provide theinselves, and, in fact, these two latter items would account
for the bulk of their contributions. The Governnent would cover the
entire costis in the second five-year period, estimnated at CFAF373
million (US$1.7h million).
39.       Procurement of vehicles, clearing and spraying equipment and
rice milling equipment would be by international competitive bedding.
In the case of road construction and improvement, contracts involving
about US$0.6 miLLion would be unlikely to attract bidders not estab-
lished in West Africa and tenders for contracts would be invited only
locally. Tlie same would apply to contracts for the construction of
houses for project staff and rice milling and storage facilities,
valued at a total of US$o.5 million.
40.      TPhe project organization would be managed by a Senegalese
Director. The Director would be responsible for project implementa-
tion, with -the assistance of qualified staff. It is expected that
five non-Senegalese specialists will be necessary. The latter would
train Senegalese officers who wiLl eventually return to the national
extension service. Although directly supervised by the Ministry of
Rural Development, the Director would participate in regional and
departmenta:L coordination meetings of two existing agricultural
development committees. To avoid duplication and ensure efficiency,
a special committee would be established in Dakar and would include
representatives of the various agencies operating in the project area.
41.       OI the basis of yields, incremental production and current
prices, and assuming a project life of 25 years, the rate of return
to the economny of the project is estimated at 18.5 percent. Annual
cash incomes of farmers participating are expected to rise to between
US$400 and IJS$550, four to five times the current level.
