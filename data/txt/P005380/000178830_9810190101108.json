The project was one of the main industrial projects\n            included in the Moroccan 1973-77 five year plan, and its\n            objectives were: (i) import substitution by satisfying the\n            growing domestic cement demand by local production, and (ii)\n            development of the oriental region, one of the lesser\n            developed areas of Morocco. The project, which was\n            implemented during 1976-79, consisted of the construction of\n            a 1.2 million tpy cement plant near Oujda in the Oriental\n            region in Northeast Morrocco, and a 500,000 tpy distribution\n            center in Fes in the central region to facilitate cement\n            distribution of the plant in that region and Western\n            Morocco. Oujda was chosen as the plant location because of\n            the availability of raw materials (limestone and clay), and\n            its proximity to Algeria, which was to participate in the\n            project. Due to the above developments, project preparation\n            by the Bank took longer than expected. After a project\n            preparation mission in August 1974, the project was\n            originally appraised in March 1975, after which Algeria\n            withdrew from the project. The project was re-appraised in\n            November 1976 when the ownership of CIOR had been settled.\n            The US$45.0 million Bank loan, which financed civil works,\n            equipment, consulting services and interest during\n            construction, was approved in March 1977 and became\n            effective in July 1977. Five supervision missions and two\n            completion missions visited the project during 1977-81."}, "docdt": "1982-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
