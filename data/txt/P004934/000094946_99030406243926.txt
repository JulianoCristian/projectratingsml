SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNWERSITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3266-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Science and
Technology University Development Project in the Democratic and Popular Republic of
Algeria, for which loan no 3266-AL in the amount of US$65.0 million equivalent was
approved by the Executive Directors on November 6, 1990. It became effective on
December 3, 1991 and was closed on June 30, 1998, twenty-four months beyond the date
originally envisaged, June 30, 1996. The accounts were closed on October 30, 1998 and
approximately '75% of the funds were disbursed.
The Report was prepared by World Bank staff members Mr. Amine Khene
(MNSED), Ms. Claire Voltaire (MNSHD), Ms. Christine Wong (MNSHD), and Mr.
Mourad Ezzine (MNSHD) The borrower's comments were received on November 11,
1998, and are irncluded in the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission (June 30 to July 12, 1998). It is based on material in the project file.



EVALUATION SUMMARY
*  The Science and Technology University Development Project was the first Bank
project in the higher education sector in Algeria. It was initiated in 1988 and developed
as a pilot experience aimed at increasing university autonomy and efficiency in the
context of scarcity of resources caused by the sharp drop in country oil revenues which
began in 19,86.
*  Conception and implementation of the project coincided with a dramatic degradation of
the political and security situation in Algeria. Throughout this ten-year period, project
implementation was severely constrained by a very unfavorable environment.
*  The Staff Appraisal Report, dated October 5, 1990, stated the project objectives as
follows: (i) to provide an institutional model (based on peer review and transparency)
for the allocation of investment resources to higher education and (ii) to assist the
Government in upgrading undergraduate and post-graduate teaching and research,
concentratinig on the three major universities of science and technology. The project
was designed to act as a catalyst for reform while providing a model for the whole
higher education system. Interventions were aimed at improving (i) university
management and administration; (ii) curriculum relevance, teaching quality, and
teacher quallifications in selected science and technology degree programs targeted at
labor market needs; and (iii) the contribution of the universities to regional and
national development through the forging of closer research and training links with
local industry.
*  The project did not achieve its objectives. However, its implementation had a positive
impact on teaching and research capacities as well as on the management of the
selected universities.
* Implementaition was hindered by (i) the initial lack of experience of the implementing
agency witht Bank procurement procedures which was further aggravated by the
Bank's inability to closely supervise the project; (ii) difficulties in attracting foreign
suppliers and ensuring the adequate delivery, installation, and maintenance of
equipment; (iii) the lack of local suppliers of pedagogic materials; (iv) the rigidities of
the local coramercial banking system; (v) complicated budgetary procedures; and (vi)
the lack of biudgetary funds.
*  The project is not sustainable under the current conditions. Although it has made
universities more concerned about and more accountable for the quality and
efficiency of their investments and enhanced their credibility with regard to their
autonomous management capacity, the institutional model for resource allocation has
not yet been extended beyond the scope of the project.



*  Bank supervision of the project was not satisfactory. During its first three years, the
project suffered from a very high turnover of task managers. When the management
of the project stabilized after 1994, the security situation, in turn, prevented field
supervision.  The team  used alternative supervision methods, such as meeting
counterparts in third countries, but the Bank found no satisfactory way to cope with
the new situation. Throughout this period, the Bank remained optimistic that the
political situation would improve and that the project would reach its development
objectives.
*  The Borrower's performance was strongly influenced by economic and political
instability, the high turnover of key government officials in charge of the sector,
overall bureaucratic inertia and the rigidities of the banking system. This resulted in a
loss of momentum of the project, long delays and missed opportunities for a more
efficient use of project resources. In addition, the lack of financial contribution by the
Borrower further limited ownership and the development impact of the project.
*  The project's outcome is assessed as unsatisfactory despite some positive results.
The project had little impact on a durable reform of the resource allocation process.
The anticipated links between universities and industry did not materialize in any
significant way. However, the project did have a positive impact on the quality of
teaching and research as well as on the universities capacity to develop and
implement investment plans
-  In view of the security and political developments, the Bank should have been able to
consider different options, discuss them with the borrower, and eventually decide to
restructure the project.
-  The difficult political and economic situation which constituted the major obstacle to
the satisfactory completion of this project continues and should remain a concern in
view of any future operation.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
SCIENCE kND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3266-AL)
PART I: BANK'S EVALUATION
Introduction
1.    The Science and Technology University Development Project was the first Bank project
in the higher educaition sector. It was initiated in 1988 and developed as a pilot experience aimed
at increasing university autonomy and efficiency in the context of scarcity of resources caused by
the sharp drop in country oil revenues which began in 1986.
2.    Conception and implementation of the project coincided with a dramatic degradation of the
political and security situation in Algeria. Throughout this ten-year period, project implementation
was severely constrained by a very unfavorable environment.
A.   Project Objectives
3.    The Staff ALppraisal Report, dated October 5, 1990, stated the project objectives as
follows: (i) to provide an institutional model (based on peer review and transparency) for the
allocation of invesl:ment resources to higher education and (ii) to assist the Government in
upgrading undergraduate and post-graduate teaching and research, concentrating on the three
major universities of science and technology. The project was designed to act as a catalyst for
reform while providing a model for the whole higher education system. Interventions were
aimed at improvingr (i) university management and administration; (ii) curriculum relevance,
teaching quality and teacher qualifications in selected science and technology degree programs
targeted at labor market needs; and (iii) the contribution of the universities to regional and
national development through the forging of closer research and training links with local
industry.
4.    The project was designed to test new institutional arrangements as a precursor of an
autonomous intermediary institution for the allocation of Government funds to higher education
that was expected to emerge from the reform process. It was to support selected investment
proposals submitted by the participating universities in the framework of their medium-term
institutional development plans. Both the plans and the investment proposals were to be subject
to rigorous peer reviewing and to benefit from international scientific advice. The draft
development plans reviewed by the Bank involved delegation of authority to the participating
universities to enter into contractual arrangements with third parties, while keeping full control
over the resulting income and over all stages of procurement of goods and services.



2
B.    Achievement of project objectives
5.    The project did not achieve its objectives. However, its implementation had a positive
impact on teaching and research capacities as well as on the management of the selected
universities. The project was innovative, ambitious, and realistic, considering the overall political
and economic reform potential at the time. But the political events that erupted at the start of the
project created a new environment marked by a deteriorating security situation, political
instability and economic difficulties, in which reform of the higher education sector ceased to be
a priority. One consequence of this new environment was the scarcity of budgetary resources
available to the sector. In this context, one of the key objectives of the project, which was to test
new mechanisms for resource allocation and increased university autonomy, became almost
irrelevant.
6.    In spite of this very difficult environment, and particularly a lack of commitment among
the decision-makers involved, ownership of the project remained strong among the participating
universities, allowing them to significantly improve the quality of their teaching and research as
well as their capacity to design and implement investment projects. In contrast, their managerial
performance and responsiveness to the labor market and industry needs remained weak due to
little control over course offerings and student intake in addition to a lack of evaluation of and
life-long job security for all staff.
Institutional Model
7.   A central objective was to establish a competitive and transparent resource allocation
system. This process was indeed developed and applied. It actually prompted universities to
prepare quality proposals which were discussed, validated, and approved by a selection
committee composed of representatives of the three universities and of the Ministry of
Universities. However, due to the scarcity of budgetary resources (the loan funds were the only
investment resources available to universities) which prevented a fully competitive process to
take place and, above all, the lack of sufficient government commitment, this mechanism did not
function as initially intended. Moreover, because of the security situation, the selection
committee was not able to secure the permanent membership of international experts to evaluate
the proposals. Exchanges and discussions that had to take place with academics from other
countries were therefore limited to technical assistance contracts with French and Canadian
academic institutions to review the quality of proposals. Finally, the extension of this funding
scheme to other universities, envisaged as a logical consequence of a successful pilot operation,
was never implemented, suggesting again a lack of sufficient government commitment.
Upzradinf quality of teachins and research
8.    Improvement in the quality of teaching and research is apparent through the following
indicators:
(i)   the increase in the number of post-graduates diplomas
(ii)  the reduction of the duration of studies for completion of Doctorates.
(iii) the reduction in the numbers of repeater students.
(iv)  the increase in the use of libraries and documentation centers.
(v)   the increase in the number of scientific publications of international
standard.



3
(vi)  the increase in the use of laboratories.
However, the potential impact of the project in improving teaching and research conditions was
severely limited biy the difficulties encountered by Algerians to obtain visas to travel abroad and
by the reluctance of foreign nationals to go to Algeria.
Universiti(es Manazement Caopacity
9.    The combined effects of scarcer resources and of the innovative nature of the project
worked as an incentive for universities to develop procurement and management capacities
through the implementation of the selected proposals. Universities took the opportunity to train
their administrative and managerial staff. However, the management and maintenance studies
which were conceived to reform the universities organization and functioning were undertaken.
It proved impossible to agree on the terms of reference of the management study which was
eventually replaced by training for universities managers. The maintenance study was not carried
out mainly because counterpart funds were lacking. The computer networks study was
undertaken, but too late to allow the implementation of its recommendations before project
completion. In hindsight, the assignment of these studies to universities instead of the central
agency may have been a mistake as a necessary and meaningful consultation process among
universities proved too difficult to achieve. Moreover, the purpose of the studies themselves
became unclear to stakeholders as the overall context did not allow for an autonomy-oriented
consistent reform approach to be developed for the sector.
Links withl industrv
10.  In spite of the incentive of being authorized to use part of the revenues generated,
universities did not develop significant links with industry, except for a few agreements (under
which universities made studies against the use of public enterprises equipment) between UC
and Orlac, USTCO and Wilaya of Ain-Temouchent, and USTHB and Sonatrach, all with
negligible impact. During the time frame of the project, industry was in sharp decline due to the
security situation.
C.   Implementation Record
11.   The project was originally designed for a five-year implementation period. Two one-year
postponements of the loan closing date were not sufficient to allow for its full implementation
and only 75 % of the loan was disbursed. Over a period of eight years, the sector saw multiple
changes in its organizational structure (merging, restructuring, and reorganizing the Ministry), as
well as high turnover of managers in MU and in universities. The project did not effectively start
before 1993/1994. But throughout these difficulties, the DIE and universities remained
committed to the success of the project.
12.   Implementation was hindered by (i) the lack of experience of the implementing agency
with Bank procurement procedures which was further aggravated by the Bank's inability to
closely supervise the project; (ii) difficulties in attracting foreign suppliers and ensuring the
adequate delivery, installation and maintenance of equipment; (iii) the lack of local suppliers of
pedagogic materials; (iv) the rigidities of the local commercial banking system; (v) complicated
budgetary procedures; and (vi) the lack of budgetary funds.



4
13.   The project was successful in providing universities with needed scientific and
pedagogical equipment. The notable exception was the computer networks which were only
partially realized, due to delays in elaborating a complete master plan for the three universities.
Procurement of library materials was very difficult due to the isolation of the universities from
the international academic world for a number of years and their subsequent inability to make the
most appropriate choices. As a result, university libraries did not fully benefit from this input.
14.   Three studies covering all three universities were to be carried out on: (i) university
management, (ii) maintenance of technical equipment and infrastructure, and (iii) computer
networks. Each university was assigned a specific study. None of them was satisfactorily
completed.
D.    Project Sustainability
15.   The project is not sustainable under the current conditions. Although it has made the
three universities more concerned about and more accountable for the quality and efficiency of
their investments and enhanced their credibility with regard to their autonomous management
capacity, the institutional model for resource allocation has not yet been extended beyond the
scope of the project.
16.   As the investments resulted in reduced repeater rates, improved graduating rates, and an
increase in the number of scientific publications, the outcome has been to improve the teaching
and research capacities of the three universities and the efficiency of the sector. However, some
important issues, such as equipment maintenance, remain unresolved and threaten sustainability.
17.   The links developed with industry are too weak to constitute an element of sustainability
of the project.
E.    Bank's Performance
18.   During preparation of the project, the team was responsive to the Government's ideas and
intentions, but it overestimated the ministry and the universities' implementation capacity as well
as their ability to adapt to the Bank's guidelines and procedures. It also overestimated MU's and
the universities capacity to overcome bureaucratic inertia and rigidities.
19.   The Bank's supervision of the project was not satisfactory. During its first three years, the
project suffered from a very high turnover of task managers. When the management of the
project stabilized after 1994, the security situation, in turn, prevented field supervision. The
team used alternative supervision methods, such as meeting counterparts in third countries, but
the Bank found no satisfactory way to cope with the new situation. Throughout the project, the
Bank remained optimistic that the political situation would improve and the project would reach
its development objectives.
F.    Borrower's Performance
20.   The Borrower's performance was strongly influenced by economic and political
instability, the high turnover of key government officials in charge of the sector, overall



5
bureaucratic inertia, and the rigidities of the banking system. This resulted in a loss of project
momentum, long delays, and missed opportunities for a more efficient use of project resources.
In addition, the size of the financial contribution by the Borrower further limited ownership and
the development impact of the project.
21.   Delays caiused by cumbersome and lengthy procurement procedures were further
aggravated by the; security situation which prevented suppliers from properly fulfilling their
contractual commitments.
G.   Assessment of Outcome
22.   The projecit's outcome is assessed as unsatisfactory despite some positive results. The
project had little irnpact on a durable reform of the resource allocation process. The anticipated
links between universities and industry did not materialize in any significant way. However, the
project did have a positive impact on the quality of teaching and research as demonstrated by the
indicators in Table 5 and on the universities' capacity to develop and implement investment
plans.
H.    Future Operation
23.   The very difficult political and economic situation which constituted the major obstacle
to the satisfactory completion of this project continues and should remain a concern in view of
any future operation. In the present context, reform of higher education has not yet reemerged as
a government priority. A bill on the sector's organization was submitted to parliament on
September 17, 1998. It will notably define new management guidelines for universities. If and
when the bill is passed, it would be useful to have the Bank and the Algerian government discuss
future operations on the basis of a common assessment of the current experience. The sector and
universities' management have already expressed their interest in further cooperation with the
Bank for the realization of projects of a similar nature that would be better focused and would
entail a shorter implementation time.
I.    Key Lessons Learned
24.   Seven lessons can be drawn from this project:
(i.) Dramatic changes in the situation of any country cannot be predicted. The Bank should
nevertheless develop a capacity to assess political risks and adequate response
mechanisms. In view of the security and political developments of the nineties in Algeria,
the Bank should have been able to consider different options, discuss them with the
borrower, and eventually decide to restructure the project.
(ii.) Implementation capacity should be rigorously assessed during preparation and regularly
reviewed during implementation. Whenever institutional capacity is weak, the Bank
should make sure to strengthen it as part of the project.
(iii.) Competition for investment funds works better when basic needs of the universities (such
as library, relprography, scientific equipment) are met prior to the start of the competition



6
process. In fact, competition for investment resources cannot take place satisfactorily
unless it involves funds that are genuinely incremental.
(iv.) Projects involving investment funds should not be considered for Board approval unless
all the steps necessary for an effective and timely functioning of the competition process
are taken. In a case such as this one, that means that prior to Board, the selection
committee is appointed, and a first series of subprojects, corresponding to about 20 % of
the total amount, is approved.
(v.) With most centralized administrative systems, institutional reforms have to be based on a
relevant set of legislative and regulatory measures. In this particular case, such measures
should have been identified and referred to in the Loan Agreement, along with an
appropriate implementation schedule.
(vi.) The Bank should always make sure that there is sufficient commitment on the part of the
borrower and that this commitment is formalized in an official government document,
such as a letter of sectoral development.
(vii.) In order for the Bank to effectively contribute to the implementation of a sectoral
strategy, cooperation between the sector and the Bank should involve a continuous
substantive dialogue - beyond specific projects - to be maintained particularly in a
context of political instability.

PART II:   BORROWER'S EVALUATION AND COMMENTS
Introduction
Negotiatio:ns on the IBRD Loan Agreement commenced in 1988, and assumed a more
concrete form during the appraisal missions carried out by IBRD staff in Algeria in 1990. Those
missions led, in October 1990, to the drafting of the report entitled "Appraisal Report" - Science
and Technology iVniversity Development Report (Honari Boumediene University of Science
and Technology, Oran University of Science and Technology, and the University of
Constantine).
The Loan Agreement, for a total of US$65 million, was signed on February 27, 1991, and
ratified by Presidential Decree No. 91/337 of September 28, 1991, which was published in
Official Gazette No. 45 of October 2, 1991 and became effective on December 3, 1991.
The repayrment rate was variable and calculated according to a formula based on
variables that is presented in Article II (2.05) and Annex 3 of the Loan Agreement. The
provisional closing date was June 1996.
Objectives of the Loan
The objectives were of two kinds:
Main Objec tive
To reform the higher education system and strengthen its management, with a view to
providing universities with a greater degree of autonomy.
Intermediate Objectives
* to improve training (through a program of teacher training and the improvement of
teachers' skills).
* to improve the quality of teaching.
* to increase the amount of practical work and make the use of computer technology
more widespread.
*  to strengthen the documentary resources of university libraries and their equipment
(including the automation of loans).
* to make the system more productive (in terms of graduates).
*  to match training to potential employment.
Conclusion
The main objective was to turn the three universities into centers of excellence that could
serve as models for other institutions.



8
Achieving these objectives required:
*  The formulation of university development plans, approved by IBRD.
*  The creation of manuals of procedures (approved by EBRD) for explaining to
participants the implementation procedures used for investment operations financed
under the IBRD loan.
*  The establishment of management units within the central administration and within
the three universities. These units were to be responsible for monitoring the
implementation of the loan.
*  The creation of a review committee charged with ensuring the coordination of the
loan and maintaining a balance between the three universities. The committee was
composed of the Director of Development and Planning, the three Rectors of the
universities, and three individuals of significant renown in the world of science.
Structure of the Loan
The loan proceeds were divided among the following items. Investment amounts for the
three universities are aggregated.
CATEGORY              PLANNED AMOUNT              %
Scientific Equipment                     44,200,000       68.00
Books, etc.                               8,300,000       12.77
Training                                  3,700,000        5.69
Expert Services                           2,600,000        4.00
Unallocated                               6,200,000        9.54
TOTAL                                    65,000,000      100.00
Evaluation of the Qualitative Objectives
IBRD Loan No. 3266-AL (for the Science and Technology University Development
Project) closed in June 1998.
There is no doubt that the acquisition of new scientific equipment, now installed and for
the most part operational, greatly facilitated the practical components of the students' training
programs. This was an objective common to the three universities. The increase in the amount
of practical work, aimed at improving the quality of training given, was heightened once the
equipment purchase program had been completed.
The equipping of the university libraries, combined with the purchase of appropriate
books and other documentation (i.e. scientific works and reviews), led to a significant
quantitative and qualitative improvement in the library resources of the three universities.
With regard to enrollments, and despite a level of demand that continues to be excessive,
examination of the following tables indicates that:



9
1.    USTHB, in line with its initial objective, succeeded in stabilizing its total enrollments in a
range between 19,000 and 20,000 students.

2.    The same is true for the University of Constantine, although over the last two years its
total enrollment has reached a peak of about 27,000 students.

The decision to emphasize recruitment in the exact sciences and in technology did not
produce the anticipated results (student numbers in these specialties fell considerably), because,
unlike the other two universities, the University of Constantine offers courses in the social
sciences.
3.    USTO, which still has not achieved its enrollment ceiling, has experienced a slow
increase in its total enrollment, which this year (1997/98) reached the level of 10,000 students,
but did not reach the target of 15,300 students set for the year 1994.

Another joint objective of the three universities was to improve the level of training and
teacher skills, by instituting an overseas training program.
The training program, which met with considerable difficulties for nearly two years
(1992 and 1993), due to problems with visas and acceptance letters, has nonetheless made
satisfactory progress over the last three years in the three sectors targeted in this context:
* short-term training courses (1 to 3 months)
* retraining and refresher courses (6 months)
* sandwich courses (3 periods of 5 months)
The universities' scientific councils undertook periodic evaluations of this program.
Those evaluations would, however, benefit from the inclusion of greater detail, in order to show
the real impact of this program on the quality of training and the improvements made in this area.
To be more precise, the evaluations might show the following:
e the number of master's theses, doctoral theses, and publications completed
* any advances noted in the area of thesis work
* actual returns to teaching on the part of teachers who have received training
In terms of current enrollments, and despite a slight improvement in the level of training
among the lecturing staff, where the departure of overseas teachers had a significant impact, total
enrollments were not greatly affected and the desired staff/student ratio of 1:10 was not
achieved, primarily because of the growth in student numbers (83,000 undergraduates in 1996,
97,000 in 1997, and 86,147 in 1998).
Although it is perhaps still too early to state with confidence that the equipment and
scientific books procurement program, the increase in the amount of practical and experimental
work, and the introduction of computer technology at a quantitative and qualitative level had an
impact on university performance, the following can, however, be stated with respect to graduate
numbers:
*  At USTHB, the number of graduates increased significantly, rising from  1,836 in
1990/91 to 2,667 in 1997/1998.
* The University of Constantine experienced a large increase in enrollments, ,which rose
from 2,553 in 1990/91 to 3,285 in 1997/1998.
*  At USTO, growth has occurred at a much slower pace, as indicated in the tables below.

Implementation of the Loan: Physical and Financial Aspects
Studies and General Supplies (Dossiers horizontaux)
The Studies
In addition to the scientific equipment programs, three studies were carried out with a
view to the development of the universities:
1. Computing Study
This study was entrusted to USTHB and was performed by a group of Algerian teachers.
The goal of the study was to assess the existing situation and determine the prospects for
strengthening computing capacities and bringing rapid development in the area of computer
technology. The study also sought to identify the resources required by each university in order
to set up an equipment and teaching and technical-training program capable of linking up to a
local, inter-university, or even national network.
The study thus made it possible to prepare invitations to bid, and the contracts arising out
of those bids were duly signed with the chosen suppliers.
However, because of problems encountered with the banks, and above all because of the
closing date for the loan, only the University of Constantine, which had opted for a minimal
configuration, was able to finalize its contract.  Nevertheless, an emergency program
(procurement of 50 Pentiums) was implemented by each university.
2. Maintenance Study
This study was the responsibility of USTO. Preliminary studies were completed, the
invitation to bid was issued, and a research consultant engaged (contract signed). It was not
possible to implement this operation within the context of the loan, due to the high
implementation costs and the universities' lack of human and material resources.
3. Management Study
The University of Constantine was responsible for carrying out the management study. A
preliminary study mission, designed to define the study's terms of reference, was performed in
conjunction with a Canadian research consultant (CIDE). The implementation schedule and
complexity of this study are such that it has been necessary to postpone it.
Training of university administrative and management personnel was partially completed,
within the framework of the "training" aspect of the study. Administrative and technical
personnel were sent on training courses, following a decision taken at the review of the loan held
with Bank experts on July 22 and 23 1996, in Algiers.

General Supplies
In addition to the scientific equipment program, a number of other development measures
were undertaken, including:
1. Book Collection
This measure involved the purchase of scientific works and specialized journals for
strengthening the universities' library resources.  All operations in this context have been
completed, and the amounts allocated to universities for this purpose are as follows:
*  USTH3                       US$1,300,000
*  USTO                        US$1,500,000
*  University of Constantine   US$1,400,000
2. Copying Equipment
Once this package had been examined, the equipment concerned brought greater
autonomy to the universities in terms of their requirement for copying administrative and
educational documents, as well as other duplicated documents, such as student dissertations and
reports. This measure brought a considerable reduction in the costs previously incurred for
copying services, wvhich had formerly been contracted out.
*  USTHB;                      US$1,800,000
*  USTO                        US$1,800,000
3  University of Constantine   US$2,000,000
3. Automobiles (utility and private vehicles)
The purchase of all-terrain vehicles made it much easier for students and teachers to take
trips designed to iFacilitate practical work or experiments performed in natural or industrial
settings. The amounts paid were as follows:
*  USTHB                       US$212,000
*  USTO                        US$212,000
*  University of Constantine   US$213,000
Examination of Packages for Scientific Equipment
On the basis of the development plans selected, the three universities formulated
specifications for equipment for the institutions. The specifications were examined in Algeria by
representatives of LIRD, in the case of the first tranche, and by the University of Rennes, for the
second tranche, once the invitation for bids and the selection of the teams of experts had been
completed.



14
Composition of the Loan
Once the development plans had been formulated and approved, the first tranche was
officially approved on the basis of estimates made for each subproject, and then reevaluated in
terms of real costs. The second tranche was officially approved after the subprojects had
undergone appraisal and a detailed evaluation process. The composition of the two tranches for
each university is detailed below:

In response to actual circumstances, the loan was modified so that a greater portion could
be allocated to scientific equipment.  The amount initially allocated to this area was
US$44,200,000, but this had to be adjusted in view of the real costs that became apparent with
the invitations to bid:

Administrative Constraints
This was the first time this sector had worked with an international financial institution,
and the initial stages of the loan were fraught with difficulties, leading to major delays and an
almost total lack of disbursements for almost two years. This was due to the following factors:
-     a lack of experience on the part of the universities and the lack of administrative
training among university staff.
-     procedural delays such as obtaining budget funds took nine months at the Ministry of
Finance, program registration and authorization, devaluation of the Dinar, problems with
banks, involving commitments and payments (Banque Alg6rienne de Developpement),
domiciliation (Banque Algerienne de Developpement Rural), and high customs duties.
-     delays in the assessment carried out by the University of Rennes, due to problems
involved in sending experts from that university to Algeria.
*     the failure of a number of invitations to bid, which sometimes had to be repeated two or
three times.
*     difficulties with suppliers, due to financial clauses (security deposit, terms of payment,
irrevocable, and confirmed letters of credit).
*     difficulties in communicating with IBRD in order to obtain its approval (until
installation of a fax machine and introduction of the DHL system). On one occasion, for
example, it took over two months to send a simple letter to Washington.
*     difficulties with planning teachers' overseas training courses (acceptance letters, visas,
grants that were too low as a result of the weakness of the dinar).
This situation required measures aimed at lifting the constraints upon implementation of
the loan. A series of meetings was held, involving all participants ([MESRS], Universities,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Banque Algerienne de Developpement, and Banque
Algerienne de Developpement Rural) and aimed at simplifying procedures and avoiding
procedural delays.

Loan-related supervisory missions were also carried out, in Algeria and overseas. These
were held on a periodic basis (approximately every six months), and their purpose was to
evaluate the status of the loan. The meetings were followed by loan reviews, held together with
representatives of the IBRD.
Subprojects: Physical and Financial Status
At this point, virtually all the initiatives launched within the framework of the two
tranches are already under way.
On the physical and financial level, most of the agreed contracts and invoices have been
implemented. As described above, the first two years were very difficult because the first
disbursements were not made until the end of the second year.
Due to the measures taken to bring renewed impetus to the loan, the rate of disbursements
was satisfactory in 1994 and 1995, reaching a peak of US$20,096,004.14 (or almost 31 % of the
total loan amount) in 1996, and an equally impressive level of US$13,091,424.09 in 1997.
For 1998, the monthly statements provided by the IBRD show a disbursement level of
around US$2,076,001.07 as of June 1997. This brings total cumulative disbursements, as of the
same date, to US$48,385,866.52 (or some 74.4 % of the loan), including the payments made into
the special account, which is administered by Banque Algerienne de D&veloppement and held
permanently at around US$5,000,000 in order to subsidize the minor expenditures settled after
the fact by IBRD. Changes in annual disbursements are shown in the following table:

Conclusion
Considering when the loan took effect and the difficulties encountered at that time by the
universities (difficulties that have been covered in a very specific diagnostic report and
commented upon in detail in the appraisal report), and considering the degree to which the
quantitative and q[ualitative objectives of the loan were achieved, the experience of cooperation
with IBRD, within the overall context of the reform of the higher education system, must be
judged generally 7positive
The experience made it possible to set up new rules governing financing proposals for
subprojects, whiclh were able to be examined and evaluated with a greater degree of objectivity
and dialogue, from the laboratory where the idea for the project was born, to the appraisal
committee, via the department, institute, and scientific advisory council of the university.
Furthermore, each subproject was approved in light of technical advice provided by a
team of national and international experts.
The models for the terms of reference, proposed by the Bank and adapted to the specific
nature of Algerian regulations, made the task of the universities much simpler and were also
useful for other facilities, such as the Algiers Agricultural Institute and the Kouba Teachers'
Training College.
The process of inviting bids for the procurement of scientific equipment benefited from
greater national and international publicity, by ensuring a greater degree of competition among
suppliers.
Appraisal of the bids was carried out with the aid of a selection criteria grid, which was
based to a large extent on the Bank's Procurement Manual.
On the recommendation of IBRD, the management unit responsible for the loan procured
a range of communications tools (personal computer, photocopier, telecopier, etc.), all of which
considerably improved communications with the Bank. In many cases, we were able to receive
notice of approval just 72 hours after sending the documents.
The rapidity with which the various initiatives were dealt with on both sides and the loan-
related supervision or review missions (which were always marked by an atmosphere of great
mutual understanding) were both instrumental in bringing renewed impetus to initiatives
whenever delays occurred. The supervision mission that took place in Tunis from April 8 to
April 12, 1995, in particular, and that which took place on July 22 and 23, 1996 in Algiers
(Djenane El Mithak) gave the loan an impetus that led to the completion of a number of
contracts.
It was in this spirit that a transparent method of selecting subprojects was set up on a joint
basis. The organization of new invitations to bid (as in the case of the project's 2nd tranche) was
carried out in line with the regulations set up for the purpose:
1.    A standard list of special regulations (standard CPS) was drawn up in
response to the Bank's comments.



20
2.    A market model was adopted.
3.    A provisional implementation timetable was set up, in four phases, with notice of
approval required for each phase.
All the problems inherent in the implementation of the loan were handled with an
objectivity that enabled the universities to complete as many operations as possible.
Consequently, the loan was extended on two occasions, for a period of one year in each
case.
Lastly, if the resources procured were of considerable help in improving the lines of
communication between the two parties, another element that must be considered positive was
the regularity with which IBRD sent its monthly disbursement statements.
In conclusion, it can be said that the universities gained an undeniable wealth of
experience in conducting and implementing the projects financed by IBRD. The various
procedures (invitations to bid, choice of project timetables, disbursements, etc.) were all duly
noted and absorbed, and will be of great help for any future projects and operations that the
Algerian Government may be called upon to study in cooperation with the Bank.

because of a lack of counterpart funds, as well as the declining of the three
universities' operational budget
- As a result:-- two major and important studies on university management and on
the maintenance of the scientific and laboratory equipment acquired with the project
funds will not be completed;
- equipment delivered to Algeria are still not being used due either to lack of funds to
pay for duty and portuary taxes or to absence of adequate physical facilities for the
installation of the laboratories.

compete against each other for funds while priority needs remain unsatisfied.

- Staff training activities efforts were impeded by difficulties encountered by
academnics to obtain visas and the brain drain from Algeria as a result of the security
and political situation.
