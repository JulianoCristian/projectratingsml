Seven key lessons can be drawn from this\n            project: 1) In view of the security and political\n            developments of the nineties in Algeria, the Bank should\n            have been able to consider different options, discuss them\n            with the borrower, and eventually decide to restructure the\n            project. 2) Implementation capacity should be rigorously\n            assessed during preparation and regularly reviewed during\n            implementation. 3) Competition for investment funds works\n            better when basic needs of the universities are met prior to\n            the start of the competition process. 4) Projects involving\n            investment funds should not be considered for Board approval\n            unless all the steps necessary for an effective and timely\n            functioning of the competition process are taken. 5) With\n            most centralized administrative systems, institutional\n            reforms have to be based on a relevant set of legislative\n            and regulatory measures. 6) The Bank should always make sure\n            that there is sufficient commitment on the part of the\n            borrower and that the commitment is formalized in an\n            official government document. 7) In order for the Bank to\n            effectively contribute to the implementation of a sectoral\n            strategy, cooperation between the sector and the Bank should\n            involve a continuos substantive dialogue."}, "docdt": "1998-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
