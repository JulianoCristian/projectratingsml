It will test new\n            institutional arrangements executed through the Ministry of\n            Universities (MU).  These arrangements will be a precursor\n            to an autonomous intermediary institution for the allocation\n            of government funds to higher education that is expected to\n            emerge from the refrom process.  It supports investment\n            proposals selected from those proposed by the participating\n            universities in the framework of their medium-term\n            institutional development plans.  Both the plans and the\n            investment proposals will be subject to rigorous peer review\n            and benefit from international scientific advice.  The draft\n            development plans reviewed by the Bank involve delegation of\n            authority to the participating universities to enter into\n            contractual arrangements with third parties while keeping\n            full control over the resulting income and over all stages\n            of procurement of goods and services."}, "docdt": "1990-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
