TO TUE ENECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED lO
Il AU ANOUNT EQUIVAET TO US$65 MILLION
TO TUE DEMOCRATIC AU» POPULAR RE.ELIC OF AJLGERI
FOR A SCIECE AU TECRUOLGY UNIImSITY DEVELOPUET PROJECT
1.    The following  _emorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Democratic and Popular Republie of Algeria for US$65 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. Concentrating on the three major universities of science
and technology, the proposed loan vould assist the Government in improving the
quality of undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and research; and provide a
pilot experience for the competitive allocation of investment resources to higher
education through systematic processes based on peer review. This would support
Government's policy of increased university autonomy as a primary vehicle for
quality improvement.  The loan vould have a term of 17 years, including five
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    Backgrg=nd.  Algeria is in the process of introducing with Bank support
broad economic reforms aimed at promoting efficiency and raising productive
capacity. An adequate supply of well-trained higher level manpower is an
important element of successful reform.  A 1988 Bank report on the Algerian
higiher education system notes that, while higher education has expanded at annual
rates of close to 20X since 1981, resources devoted to it have increased at less
than half that pace. There has been a concomitant fall in standards, as the
system shows the strains of expansion -- in congestion costs, deficient teacher
qualifications and training, deteriorating physical plant and inadequate
provision of educational materials and equipment. Noreover, the system suffers
from high dropout and repetition rates, and there is increasing doubt about the
relevance of some degree programs to the needs of the economy. Finally, a highly
centralized system of pedagogic, administrative and financial controls has
paralyzed university initiative and demoralized many of the best qualifled staff.
3.    The Government recognizes the primacy of quality enhancement and that
increased university autonomy is necessary for sustained attaimment of this
goal.    The Governrent's strategy  includes:  allowing  greater managerial,
operational, pedagogical and financial freedom at the university level; providing
improved suppo;.t services for teaching and research; encouraging universities
to establish closer links vith industries; and formulating shorter, more focused
programas that permit graduates to adapt better to the needs of a changing
workplace.   To ensure success, these long-term changes must be undertaken
gradually.   As a first step, and to accelerate assimilation of imported
technologies and development of national technological innovation, Govertment
is giving priority to strengthening teaching and research in science and
technology. It has selected a few regionally significant universities to be
developed as centers of excellence in science and technology education. For
these cases, investment funding would be channelled through a new review
mechanism designed to motivate university administrators and faculty to become
increasingly involved in setting priorities and managint, lnvestments.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Contributing to improving teaching and
research in science and technology offers the Bank a major opportunity to help
shape and support policy changes in higher education, in tu.n an important



-2-
complement to the Bank assisted economic reform program.  Bank international
experience is useful to help Algeria establish an appropriate institutional
framework for the development of its university system, starting with a pilot
phase in selected institutions. In addition to providing methodology for peer
review mechanisms for investment decisions, the Bank's presence would also expand
opportunities for twinning arrangements with foreign universities and research
groupa in a system still relatively closed to international networks. Uith
analytical support from the Bank, complementary reforms in primary and secondary
education are on the Government's agenda and expected to lead to a broader
sectoral dialogue in the months to come.
5.    Proiect Objectives. The project vould assist the Government 4n developing
an institutional and operational framework designed to provide the university
system with the freedom and support necessary to improve the quality, relevance
and responsiveness of hîgher education.   It would foeus on three major
universities of science and technology' whose development plans put them in a
position to promote excellence in their fields and act as catalysts for reforn
while providing a model for the entire higher education system.  Interventions
vould be aimed at improving: (i) university management and administration; (ii)
quality and efficiency in teaching end research programs;  and (iii) the
contribution of the universities to local development through the forging of
closer links with local industry and the strengthening oi applied research
capacities. The project would also (iv) help introduce a system of assessment
and peer review of university performance at the central level linked to project
management.
6.    Proi ect Description. The project would test new institutional arrangements
executed through the linistry of Universities (NU).  These arrangements would
be a precursor to an autonomous intermediary institution for the allocation of
Goverr.ment funds to bigher education that is expected to emerge from the reform
process. It would support investment proposals selected from those proposed by
the  participating  universities  in  the  framework  of  their  medium-term
institutional development plans.  Both the plans and the investment proposals
would be subject to rigorous peer review and benefit from international
scientific advice. The draft development plans reviewed hy the Bank involve
delegation of authority to the participating universities  to enter into
contractual arrangements with third parties (for e.g. applied research) while
keeping full control over the resulting Income and over all stages of procurement
of goods and services. Development plans will also contain a set of agreed
planning scenarios for operating and investment budgets, as well as undergraduate
and graduate enrollment. Agreed eligibility criteria for investment proposals
include relevance to national and regional needs, availability of internationally
respected supervisory skills and know-how for implementation,  limited net
recurrent cost impact and preference for investments likely to mobilize
complementary resources (e.g. from fees or research contracts), and specific
improvements in teaching and research capacity.
1/ University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene (Algiers)-
University of Science and Technology of Oran; and University of Constanttine.
Together they enroll over 37,000 students, or 18X of the total higher
education system and 41X of all S&T streams (excluding medicine).



- 3-
7.    Loan proceeds vould finance foreign coats for: (a) staff development (e.g.,
overseas and in-country post-graduate and staff development programs); (b)
improved facilities for teaching and research (e.g., construction/refurbishment,
equipment, acquisition and production of educational materials); (c) upgrading
of library and computer facilities; (d) improved site and equipment maintenance
capacities;  and  (e) improved management capacities  (e.g.,  development of
databases and information systems, technical assistance, and training). An
initial set of 28 investment proposals representing $41 million, or 31X of total
project costs, vas revieved in detail by the Bank at appraisal, and is ready for
iamediate NU approval. Further discrete investments, representing $39 million
or 30X, are in the final stage of preparation, but further information/
*      justification is needed.  An additional US$50 million or 39% is likely to be
technically ready for submission vithin 12-18 months of effectiveness.
Investments over US$ 1.5 million vill require prior Bank approval. This is
expected to result in direct Bank review of 78X of all Fund commitments during
the initial four-year commitment period.
8.    Project management vlll be the responsibility of the investment management
section of the Directorate for Infrastructure and Equipment (DIE) of NU, headed
by its director. Staffed by professionals in areas of university management,
planning, and procurement and assisted by an advisory panel of specialists in
science and technology teaching and research, this group's principal function
vould be the appraisal and supervision of investments proposed by participating
universities on the basis of agreed criteria and peer review procedures.
Investment proposals (after Bank review, if necessary) would be submitted for
approval to a "Review Committee" composed of members of the DIE, university
representatives and recognized outside scientific advisors.   The gradual
development of DIE's capacity to apply the principles of peer review for the
allocation of government resources to the whole- University system would be a
major contribution of the project to institution building in the context of
increasing university autonomy.
9.    Cost and Financing. The total cost of the project including contingencies,
taxes and duties, is estimated at US$130.0 million with a foreign exchange cost
of US$76.0 million. The Bank loan of US$65.0 million vould cover about 51X of
project costs net of taxes and duties, or 85X of foreign exchange cost. The
Government vould finance local costs totaling US$65.0 million wihich include
US$4.3 million in indirect taxes and duties. The remaining foreign exchange
costs estimated at US$11.0 million vould also be financed by the Government,
mainly through bilateral aid-financed links vith foreign universities.   A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Croup
operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  The staff
appraisal report No. 9038-AL dated September 26, 1990, is being distributed
separately.
10.  Agreements reached durint negotiations.  The Government confirmed its
commitment:
(a)   to carry out the universities' development plans, and monitor their
implementation according to the agreed indicators; in this connection, the



-4-
Government provided assurances that any significant changes envisaged tn
the plans vould be coumunicated to the Bank for review;
(b)   to use the agreed appraisal guidelines for the selection and performance
evaluation of all project-finaanced investments; in addition, the Governuent
shall prepare Operations Manual based on initial implementation experience;
(c)   to submit to the Bank for prior review (i) all investment proposals above
US$1.5 million and (il) all proposals under this threshold, once their
aggregate amount has reached US$8 million per university.   Prior Bank
approval voiLlU be a condition of disbursement for these proposals.
The Government also confirmed that the expert advisory panel and the Review
Committee have been established by ministerial decision (Para. 8).
11.   Benefits. By providing a pilot model for university investment firancing,
based on rigorous appraisal criteria and peer review and by improving the quality
of teaching and research in science and technology higher education and
increasing the universities' responsiveness to changes in their social and
economic environments, the proposed project should contribute to Algeria's
international competitiveness through mastery of imported technologies and the
development of a capacity for local technological innovation. Together, these
project inputs vill improve the chances of success for Government's policy of
qualitative improvement through greater university autonomy.
12.   Riask.   The major risks lie in the government's ability to delegate
effective control over university management and the universities' capacity to
assume increased responsibilities.  Project design recognizes that overcoming
the institutional rigidities accumulated over the past 25 years vill be a
delicate undertaking that vill require substantial incentives and time in order
to succeed.  The rliks are reduced by the fact that the Government has already
started implementing measures aimed at decentralizing responsibilities for
university administration, in lino with reforms elsewhere in the *conomy, and
that the project vould include material and institutional support for the three
universities' planning and managerial caeacity. In addition, the project vould
include technical assistance and management information support for university
and DIE staff, as vell as appraisal guidelines and the development of appropriate
monitoring tools.
13.   Recommndation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan vould comply vith
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
