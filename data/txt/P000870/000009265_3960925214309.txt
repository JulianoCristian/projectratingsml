SUBJECTs    Project Completion Report on Ghana
Accra District Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1564-GH)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Ghana - Accra Dietrict
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1564-GO)" prepared by the Infrastructure Division,
Country Department IV of the Africa Regional Office.  The Borrower did not
provide Part II.
The project was prepared after thorough policy discussions with the
objective to support the ongoing economic recovery program of the Government of
Ghana.   It aimed at (i) improving resource mobilization through property
revaluation and tax collection, and (li) removing transport bottlenecks through
rehabilitation of existing road infrastructure in Accra. A small upgrading
component was also included to improve sanitation in a low-income area in Accra.
All components included respective staff training through twinning and specific
on-the-job training.
The   project   met   substantially   its   physical   objectives.
Implementation was well coordinated and good progress was made toward institution
building goals, thus laying the base for local government reform in Ghana. The
establishment of the property revaluation system was especially successful and
it was immedistely replicated in a few other urban areas. However, property tax
collection lags behind thus endangering the ultimate sustainability of project
benefits. Institution building efforts continue under the ongoing Second Urban
Project.
The project's outcome is rated satisfactory, its institutional
development partial and the sustainability of its benefits as uncertain.
The quality of the PCR is good ond it provides an interesting
discussion on local capacity building process and related implementation problems
that need to be overcome in a multi-faceted operation. The project is scheduled
to be audited within the framework of the Ghana Country Study.

ACCRA DISTRICT REHABLllAIION PPsOM LCPED 1564-GH)
PRBFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Accra District
Rehabilitation Ptoject for which Credit 1564-OH, in the amount of SDR 22.5 million
(US$22.0 million equivalent at the time of appraisal) was approved on March 3, 1985. The
credit was closed on June 30, 1992, one year later than was anticipated. Disbursements
against commitments made through October 31, 1992 amounted to SDR 21.6 million
(US$27.7 million equivalent). The balance of the credit, SDR 900,252.33 (US$1.2 million
equivalent) was cancelled on March 31, 1993.
The PCR is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report, President's
Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements, supervision reports, corresondence
between the Bank and Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and a final supervision mission in
March 1992.
Parts I and m of the PCR were sent in July 1992 to the Borrower for
comment; the Borrower was then requested to prepare Part  and to return it to the Bank
within three months. However, the Borrower's Part I was not received.
The Task Manager for this PCR is Ms. Eleanor Warner. Mr. Hiroshi Ueno
prepared the economic re-evaluation of the road rehabilitation componen. Messrs. James
Wright and Edwin Lim are the managing Division Chief and Department Director,
respectively, for the operation.

ACCRA DISTRICT REHAEILITATION PROJECT (CREDIT 15644M
PROJECT E§VALUATION SUR
i.           The project's objectives were to: (i) remove transport bottlenecks in Accra;
(ii) mobilize revenues at the municipal level in Accra; (iii) demonstrate cost-effective
improvements to basic infrastructure in a small central area of Accra; and (iv) strengthen the
capacity of institutions responsible for infrastructure maintenance in Accra (Accra
Metropolitan Authority, AMA and Accra District Roads Unit, ADRU) and uroan project
management (Technicai Services Center, TSC). The project met its objectives.
ii.          The project was implemented fairly smoothly without critical delays in most
of the components (para. 10). There were changes in the final selection of roads to be
rehabilitated for cost containment pmposes. Within six months of the original closing date,
all of the original components left in the project were completed, and a savings of US$3.4
milnion remained, attributed largely to the decline in value of the cedi. These savings were
utilized to rehabilitate selected road works, to procure equipment and vehicles, to rehabilitate
offices, and also to strengthen the capacity of TSC and the Department of Urban Roads
(DUR) to implement the Priority Works Project (Staff Appraisal Report, SAR, dated
December 1987) and Urban II (SAR dated May 1990). The closing date was then exended
one year to accommodaet these modifications to the project scope.
iii.         Implementation of the progrm of road rehabilitation and maitenance (about
73% of total costs) was fair after initial difficulties were attended to; a significant backlog of
maintena    remains to be taclded. Part of the difficulties in rehabilitating one of the road
sections (the Motorway I) was caused by the selection of too low standards in the search for
the least cost solution (paras. 11 and 12).
iv.          The urban upgrading component (about 15% of total project costs) was also
completed on schedule; the major issue on this component was the delay in com
homeowners whose property was demolished to make way for construction of roads and
drainage, but payments were evenully iniated in 1989 after a det tion was made on
ownership and appropriae payments (paras. 14 to 16).
v.           The revenue mobilization component, includig property revaluation
acouning for about 12% of total project costs, was completed within the original 20-month
period. After some persistent problems were sorted out, the valuation roll was finalized and
computrizd, and a billing and collection system was put in place based on the new roll
(para. 17).



iii
vi.          An important outcome of the project has been the creation and capacity
strengthening of a core of urban agencies which will now play a vital role in the country's
decentralization program (paras. 22 to 25). Th-e challenges ahead are twofold: (i) urban
managemene and administration needs to be further strengthened; and (ii) costs must be
recovered from beneficiaries to avoid a drain on Government resources and to allow the
project's initiatives to be replicated. Both of these issues are being addressed under follow-on
projects.
vii.         The ex post economic rates of return compare favorably with SAR
expectations (paras. 36-39).
viii.        The properties in Accra were revalhed by the Land Valuation Board (LVB),
created out of the former Land Valuation Deparanent in the Ministry of Local Government
(MG), and the exercise was successfully replicated in Tema without outside assistance. LVB
is now undertaldng revaluation of properties in the three other main cities, namely, Tamale,
Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi under Urban II project (paras. 18, 23). In order to fully
capitalize on the benefits of property revaluation in Accra, interagency coordination between
two key urban agenicies, LVB and AMA, needs to be strengthened urgently, and attention to
this critical issue is continuing under the Urban n project.
iz.          The twinning arrangement turned out to be a relatively inexpensive means of
technology transfer in key areas of finance and engineering. Both local and overseas training
helped to broaden the outlook of senior staff and motivated them to bring about positive
change (para. 19). While the twinning arrangement was useful for the specific purpose it was
intended for, it failed to take root and continue after the project (para. 32).
LSustainabilit
X.           The project put in place important institutions and mechanisms to help ensure
sustainable urban operations, but they require a significant level of follow-up, at least initially,
to ensure that they are fully operationalized. The ongoing Urban IT project provides this
necessary continuity.
xi.          After initial good results (1984-1988), revenue yields, particularly from the
property rates have shown disappointing results with arrears of approximately C1.4 billion
(September 30, 1991) at a level of approximately four times the annual revenue due. In
addition, the issue of sizeable operating losses threatens to undermine the capacity of AMA to
finance much needed maintenance expenditures (para. 33). Strategies are being considered by
the AMA at the highest levels to address the issues of revenue mobilization and financial
management in the context of political will (para. 21).
xii.         Jurisdictional problems between LVIS and AMA still need to be sorted out to
improve coordination of the rating system introduced and implemented by LVB, and the
billing and collection which must be done by AMA.
xiii.        Finally, it appears that without sustained incentives and appropriate wage
remuneration the problem of scarcity of qualified staff for Ghana's urban institutions would
continue, which may even undermine the efforts of the project (para. 24).



iv
Findings and Lessons
xiv.         Community participation is an excellent concept to be applied in project
development, but it should be careflly planned as it could require considerable management
skills which local authorities generally lack (pan. 15).
xv.          Interagency coordination is vital for the success of a comprehensive exercise
such as valuation and rating. AMA and LVB needed to work together as a team in carrying
out the rating valuation exercise and coordinating property reference numbers; they did not,
and lengthy delays occurred in implementing the revised rating system. Also, a revised
revaluation system must be dynamic to allow for addition of new propelties (para. 17).
xvi.         There are benefits in immediately replicatng an exercise as it demonstrates
capacity building accomplishment; staff of LVB were able to carry out revaluation of Tema
without outside assistance using the experience of Accra (para. 23).
xvii.        A program of public enlit , a well coordinated plan ard a building of
consensus among key intrest groups must coincide with any efforts to revalue property in
order to educate and influence public support for the eventual collection of higher property
taxes. At the same time, the new rates must be gradually phased in; they must be realistic
and affordable. In the case of Accra, a large number of residential bills went up over 100%
and reluctance to pay is evident in the volume of AMA arrears (pans. 17, 33, 34).
xviii.       ADRP and Urban II have been followed up by a Local Govermnent Sector
Study (Report No. 11369-OH, February 18, 1993), and a Local Government Project (1994) is
under preparation. Both are intended to continue building upon the foundations laid under
ADRP, particularly with respect to institutional development and urban management, and to
assist Government with planning and implementation of its very ambitious decentralization
program (pars. 40, 41).

1.           Gha's urban infrastructure undernv  drastic deterioraton during the 1970s.
The road and dige  stem in particular deteriorated to the point where it was dangerous to
veicuar traffic. The bulk of the poplaon lived in poorly served peripheral areas or in
densely popuaed low-income           . Erosion in urban finances and limited
isdtutional caacity made it difficult for cities to respond effectively to the calees
confting them. Moreover, the types of policies and programs pursued by Goverment
(e.g. high-cost, overdesigned and badly targetted housing programs) met very lite of the
dend for shelter of lower-incme groups.
2.           The Accra District Rehabilitation Project (ADRP) took sbape after legthy
policy discssions bmught about by political changes and stringent economic conditions.
ADRP evolved from an Urban Development Project first prepared in 1976 by the Government
of Ghana (GOG) with the finanial assistance of a Bank PPF advance of $175,000. The
project was appnised by a Bank mission in September 1977, but fiuther processing was
suspmded until mid-1980 due to the deteriorated mar-eonomic condition of the country
and a lment of the Bank's lending program. The project's tmetable is given in Part m,
Table 1. Discussions with the GOG during a Bank mission in August 1980 led to agreements
to revive and resuctr a reshaped project, reducing the original project from four cities to
one (Accra), and shifting is focus from shelter to rehabilitation of existng road
infraructure, and to municipal resource mobilizadon to support maintenance activities. A
small upgrading component in Accra was also retained because of the strong public
commme  the Goverment had made to provide basic sanitation inftru  in East
Maaiobi.
3.           The restuctred project was pre-appraised in October/November 1981, but
the chage in Government in December 1981 halted further processing while new policy
approaches were being worked out and development priorities redermimed. A preparation
mission in early 1984 reconfimed the priority of the project and its individual components in
the Government's economic recovery program. The mission updatd cost data and
implementation arran     and identified additional design work (rfecng  of properties
for revaluation, trainmg of Accra City Council (ACC) persnnel, nitial twinning visits, etc)
for which a second IDA PPF ($150,000) was granted; Canadian CIDA financing (Canadian
$150,000) was made available for the detailed design of the roads/drainage com .

C. Project Objectives and Description
4.           The objectves of the project were to: (i) remove transport bottlenecks in
Accra which were constraining general economic recovery; (ii) mobilize revenues at the
municipal level in Accra; (ili) demonsate cost-effective improvements to basic infrastructure
in a small cental area of Accra; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of institutions responsible for
finastnuc    maintenace in Accra (ACC/Accra District Roads Unit, ADRU) and urban
project management (Technical Services Canter, TSC).
5.           The project as described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) is detailed
below. The original base costs are also included.
A.    Inmbm  Rebabiitaion
1.    Road and Drae Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$15.5 million): Civil
works, technical assistance, vehicles, equipment, materials, training, and food
incentives in support of the Accra District Roads Unit of ACC/GHA. This
component was expected to help establish and carry out a six-year program
mnvolving the completion of the missing portion of the Accra outer ring road,
the rebabilitation of four other major road sections, and routine and periodic
maintenance of the road and drainage network of the city of Accra. The
component also includes a study of the Accra Central Business District to
determine road network requirements and traffic management measures; a
small provision for pilot measures and minor works consequent to the study
was also included; and
2.    Basic Infast n Ug;radina in East Maamobi (US$2.6 million): Basic
roads, drainage, water supply, electricity, sanitation and garbage disposal in a
30 ha area of Nima-Maamobi east of the Nima highway and north of the
Nima stream inhabited by approximately 19,000 people. This component
includes the acquisition of land for roads, public facilities, and compensation
for strcures displaced by the infstructure. It also included technical
assistance, vehicles and equipment for the implementation of this component
as well as the coordination of the project as a whole.
B.    Resource Mobilization
1.    Propertv Revaluation (US$1.8 million): Technical assistance, vehicles,
equipment, and training to assist the MLG Valuation Department in carrying
out revaluation of properties, beginning in Accra, improving management and
control systems in valuation, and trainig of valuers and other technical
personnel both within and outside Ghana; and
2.    MMuniipal Reveue Moblization (US$1.2 million): Technical assistance,
computer hardware, and vehicles for ACC to improve revenue collection and
financial manage_m; local consultancies for curriculum development and
delivery of short courses for ACC staff and mamnals of procedure; vehicles.
equipment, and books for the MLG Local Government Training School; short
overseas study visits for key ACC staff

D. Proiect Desis and OSzto
6.           The ADRP was designed to channel financial resources and technical
assistance to improve Ghana's urban infrastructure. The project concept and design were
appropriate and were timed to consolidate and complement other ongoing efforts in the sector,
such as the work of KfW/GTZ in solid waste management and sanitation. Correspondingly,
the road and drainage rehabilitation component formed part of a coordinated effort with the
port component of an ongoing Export Rehabilitation project (CR 1436-GH, PCR No. 9580
dated May 1991) and the Third Highway project (CR 1029-OH, PCR No. 6946 dated
September 1987) to remove major transport bottlenecks on the Accra outer ring road which
carried Tema port traffic. A list of related Bank Loans and Credit to Ghana is given in Part
Im, Table 2. These improvements were expected to result in speedier and less cosdy
movement of export and import items.
7.           The project also supported the Bank's policy in relation to the Ghana Highway
Authority (GHA) by reducing the blurden on GHA through the transfer of ADRU to ACC,
and by demonstrating the feasibility of urban road maintenance by a local authority rather
than GHA. The resource mobilization component was designed to improve the city's finances
and its ability to provide services and maintain inifastructure. Finally, the practical feasibility
of progressive improvements in Accra's finaces, particularly property taxes, was expected to
permit the city to ultimately reduce its dependence on Government subventions.
8.           Oveall responsibility for the coordination and adminison of the project
was vested in the Techimcal Services Center (TSC) established within the Ministry of Works
and Housing (MWH). TSC bad, in addition, direct responsibility for the East Maamobi
component. The other agencies, Accra City Council (ACC) and the Land Valuation Board
(LVB), were responsible for implementation of the componens which concerned them.
Overall project coordination was also erihanced by the establishment of an inter-agency
coordinating committee with representation from all executing agencies and chaired by the
representative of MWH. Because these agencies were weak at the start of the project,
thnical assistance and traiing were provided, essential equipment and vehicles were
procured, and offices were renovated. The emphasis on interagency coordination tumed out
to be most appropriate in a project involving numerous executing agencies.
E. Project Inmlemenaion
Startun Costs
9.           Because of the long gestation period, preparatory costs were relatively high
for this project, a total of 14 missions amounting to approximately 85 staff weeks (Part III,
Table 8).
The P-rojec
10.          The project was virually implemented on schedule. By end 1990 (i.e. six
months of the initial closing date), a total of US$21.1 million out of a budget of US$24.5
million was committed and the major components completed. An extension of one year (from
June 30, 1991 to June 30, 1992) was required to utilize the savings of about US$3.4 million
which were largely caused by the decline of the cedi against the SDR.

Raa and lei   Rehabiltatio and      M
11.          Implion of the road rehabilitation and manten  cmponent which
was the direct responsibility of GHA, met with some difficulty, resulting in variations in the
orignal design, slippage in te schedule and cost overmn. The physical problems were
related mairdy to: (i) premature degradation of the surfce of the motorway phase m; (ii)
unforeseen problems with service pipes and wires on the Nsawam road; and (ill) deterioration
of road surfaces after the original estimates were prepared. The problem of the premat
degradation of motorway phase m was traced by the consultants, to the presence of boulders
and stones in the sub-base and to the cutback of bitumen used in preparing the ful coat. In
retrospect, it appears that in the search for the least cost solution too low standars were
selected for the high levels of traffic which materialized.
12.          The maintenance aspect of the program included recrrent funding for
bitmen (and food incentivesl/) for ADRU employees. n addition, vehicles and eqpment
wiuch were vital to the road maintenance program were procured. Although ftis compone
progressed satisfactorily, funds for recurrent operations conined to be insufficient due to
poor collection of property taxes.
Tnfc Stud
13.          A study of the Accra Central Business District was prepared to determine road
nwork requiremen  and traffic management measures. The study identified critical road
rehabilitation investment needs which could be inplemented once the resources became
available. The most urgen traffic management fidig were implemented successfully under
ADRP and the ongoing Priority Works Project. The major findings of the study are to be
implemented under Urban II and a proposed urban transport project. The study was later

14.          The project financed construction of bitumen-surfaced roads with associated
drainage, footpaths, water pipts, fire hydrants, KVIP public latrines, refuse coniners and
low-tension overhead cable and limited street lighting which benefitted some 19,000 in a 30-
ha East Maamobi area. Problems with the original work on the drains and KVIPs led to
nodifications and recdfication works which were completed in Auust 1991. It is noteworthy
that the KVIPs made a major difference to sanitation in East Maamobi and are currealy
undepovided and overpatronized.
15.          Staup of this component was delayed by initially using coanunity
partcipaton to carry out the physical work; the small-scale local contracors tumed out to be
insufficienty organized and did not have the experience nor could they mobilize the laborers
as planned. Finally, a local contractor wiffi adequate machinery and equment was recruited
and after delays in plan approvals and valuation were overcome, the component progressed
satisfactorily.

as initially agreed.

16.          Owns of approxintly 100 dwelling rooms removed for infrastmn
insllation were prombsed  omnson, as were the owner of land acqired for rights-of-
way and public faciities. Delay in paymet of compensation becae a supervision issue;
after a lengthy period of investigadon te following conributory factors were identified: (a)
breakdown in coordination between TSC and LVB; and (b) failure of GO to allocate the
required funds. The first payment of 63.6 million cedis to 63 families was finally made in
March 1989; and the PCR mission was informed a second payment of 7.6 million cedis to 13
fanilies was scheduled for July 1992.

17.          Property revaluation was a joint undertakig by the AMA, local valuation
offices and UK Valuation Office (UKVO). The UKVO provided the professional base for the
exemcise and identified r rces in the local agencies and formed the LVB in 1986. The
revaluation of Accra properties (some 100,000 rteable units) was successfully completed
within a 20-month period (Jamnry 1986 to September 1987). ITe rolls were turned over to
AMA one month later in October 1987 for computeization and subsequent bilnlig. Delays in
operationalizing of the billing and collection system based on revised rates were however
caused by the following technical and institutional factors:
(a)    LVB was slow in urning over supportng documents (e.g. block plans) to
facfitate cross referencing to AMA's rate system. Once they were turned
over in March 1988, major discrepancies were found in the numbering
systems in the valuation roils. Cross-refencing was eventually completed by
end 1988 to facilitate dispatch of bills by mid-1989;
(b)   the property vahlation roUs were not sufficiently dynamic to allow the addition
and updating of new properties, and so a new system had to be devised for the
maintenance and updatig of valuation rolls on a regular and systematic basis;
and
(c)    delays occured in deciding on a rating method that all the agencies could
agree with. The AMA initialy proposed a flat ate of CO.OOS with no
differentls for location or use and no domestic rate relief, which caused a lot
of public reistance. In 1990, mini_mu and maximum levels of rates payable
by residketia rate payers were itoduced as a temporay measre. Finally,
agree_nt was reached in 1991 to intrdue differendal percentage rate
iuposts based on percentg    of rateable values for differen categories of
pWerdes.
18.          Th subsequent revaluation of propertis in Tema was successfully carried out
by LVB staff without any outside assistae. LVB has furtier undertaken revaluation of
propertis in the three other main cities, namely, Tamale, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi
under the Urban II project.

19.          The AMA City Treasurer's Departmn received technical assistance (through
a winni  arrangement) from the Staffordshire County Council (SCC) in the areas of
accounting and control systems, budgeting, collections controls and enforcement, direct labor
programming and contract manaement. Also, opportunities were created for staff from
AMA to undertake study tours to SCC and Chicago; SCC staff visited Accra to see and make
firsthand assessment of AMA's technical needs. This training was essenial to prepare the
Department to tackle its revised billing and collection function based on the new valuation
system.
20.          Additionally, with SCC assistance, a fmanclal advisor was recruited to work
with AMA for two years (extended to three). He initiated a proper budgeting process which
helped to improve coordination within the agency. The main problem which limited the scope
of what the advisor could accomplish was an apparent poor commnication with AMA's
treasurer.
21.          A revised computerized billing and collection system was introduced with
effect from January 1, 1989 with the Advisor's assistance and the diligent work of AMA's
accountig and data processing staff. The combination of the revised property tax system,
grdual increases in other fees charged, and better monitoring and collection systems,
increased the revenue of AMA in real terms over threefold since 1984. However, one year
after the deparatre of the financial advisor, the arrears situation considerably deteriorated,
particularly on property rates. This siuation is being closely monitored to ensure that the
property tax system (one of the major sources of revenue) is not undermined.
Insttutional Development
22.          The Ministry of Local Government (MLG) received limited support in the
form of vehicles and equipment under the project. However, due to very limited technical
and managerial capacity in MLG when ADRP started, MLG played a marginal role in the
implementation process. However, MLN   has realized that under the GOG's decenralization
program, it must play the leading role, and under Urban 1, MLG is a key agency. Its
technical, managerial and training capacity is being eabanced.
23.          The involvement of local staff in the valuation exercise under the project and
the creation of LVB helped build local capacity which was successfully tested in LVB's lead
role in the follow-on valuation of Tema and other cities.
24.          TSC is now well established, largely because of the experience gained by staff
durng implementation of ADRP. Also, additional incentives and better working environment
under the project motivated staff. However, recely, GOG has withdrawn the financial
incentives while it is reviewing the broader issue of compensation across the Civil Service.
This has adversely affected morale of TSC staff.
25.          ADRU was created on Jamnary 1, 1984 as a result of Government decision to
place responsibility for urban roads throughout the country under the technical control of
GHA, an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Roads and Highways (MRH). In the case
of Accra, the shift of responsibility brought the personnel, vehicles and equipment of the
AMA road unit under the control of the Greater Accra Region office of GHA which was



7
already responsible for urban roads and had the effect of consolidatng scarce technical skills
and equipment which were particularly lackng in AMA. However, it was ageed between
IDA and G0Gt iat, in view of the mprovensto be madc in AMA's ability to finance and
manage urban services (including road ma nce), ADRU would be transferred to AMA by
December 31, 1987. It was actually transfered with effect from January 1, 1990. The unit
perforned well under the leadership of a young Ghanaan engineer transferred from GHA.
Project Costs
26.          The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was US$26.3 million. The final
cost is US$28.5 million as shown in Part m, Tables 3 and 3(a). While in US dollars there
appears to be a cost overrun, in SDR terms, there were cost savings, and a total of SDR 0.9
million of the credit had to be cancelled.
Disbursements
27.          The estimated disbursements of the credit are given in Part m, Table 4. The
pace of actual disbursements was very close to expectations (graph in Table 4(a).
Credit Allocation
28.          The original and revised allocation of the credit (at June 30, 1992) are shown
in Part m, Table 5.
F. Proiect Results
Project Objectives
29.          Overall, the ADRP met its objectives which has laid the base for local
government refonn in Ghana. The ADRP has contributed to the GOG's economic recovery
efforts in priority areas of removal of infrsuctr constrains and the avoidance of
substantial future capital costs through mainance of infrastructure. Revenue mobilization at
the mmicipal level in Accra and improved management procedures enhanced AMA's ability
to maintain infrastructure and provide urban services, and could reduce the burden on scarce
central government resources. Basic infrastructure improvements in the East Maamobi area
helped improve living conditions for its residents while demonstrating a cost-effective
alternative to the Government's high cost programs. The challenge ahead lies in the ability of
the GOG to generat adequate local resource mobilization for maintenance and expansion of
urban infrastructure.
Physical Results
30.          The physical targets (as specified in paras. 4 and 5) of the project were
achieved substantially as planned.
Institutional Results
31.          The initiatives of the project helped to create and build a network of urban
institutions (AMA, ADRU, DUR, LVB), which are vital to sustaining the project's
investments in upgrading, road rehabilitation and mannance and city management. These



8
ages are young and req    considerable  atr   q  i      m       d key tecical
areas. Iteragency coordnadon, pardatuly betwen LVB and AMA, nods to be enhanced,
and attention to this isue h contnuing under Ura H. A maor Instiutonal developmnt
accopis     t under the project was the productin in 1989 a fivowyear coporat pla
documenting direction and identiig resourcesed  and  ty bringing togethr the
previoudy isolated management team of AMA. This wa done by a c of (a)
leaderhip by the mayor; (b) the initiave of the financial advisor, and (c) efbctive
supervision by IDA staff.
32.          While the twining arrangemet was usefl for the specific prpoe it wa
intded for, it failed to take rot and contie after the project. The mor  som  for the
limited success of twinig under the project was (a) it was aOt flly accepted by by sff of
the benficiary agency; and (b) the skinls mix among the twining staff wa consdered
inaopria  by the beficiary agency. Institutional development dfors wll continue undr
follow-on projects (psrs. 38).
33.          Financial tables, including both appraisal estmates and acual rsult for 1985
to 1991 are given in Annex 1. Data for 1985 to 1990 are based on adited finncial
steme_. Annex 2 provided deails of revenue collection perfomce for 1986 to 1991
based on anmual budgets (unaudited). Sigficant operatig loe ocured in each of the
seven yeaws but one, suggestng a steady lag in revenue growth, a reductai  in expeitures
on m         of city invesutents, and increased dependence on GO(   subvention to cove
operatig costs. The AMA continmes to fice drastic erosion of its pndig power due not
only to past high rates of inflation but also to delys in setinog app ate property tax rat
(its major revenue source) and its inability to aggessvly collect the  vues it is ettled to.
34.          AMA's financial portfolio is also plagued with a high volume of arars. It
aears of approximately Cl.4 bilion as at September 30, 1991 reached over 4 timos the
nnul rate of revenue of C320 million (excuding arrears). Various options are beng tried
for arrears' reduction, including the use of private collectors, establshmet of a sepaate unit
with appropriate incetives in place, allocation of greater resources to raes collecon and
ghiv incentives to rate payers for prompt payment. The Local Govarnet Law 1988 col
provide an effective machinery for recovery of unpaid rates, whih needs to be resorted to. It
is proposed to further strngdten the AMA in financil management uder Uban n and the
Local Goverment Project scheduled for 1994.
Am old Avudits
35.          TSC manned consolidaed aounts for the project with financil advice
under the techmical assistance compone. The financial advisor desind a computer-basod
accountg system which was effectively implemented by TSC for monitoring and fiaial
reportng. Audited reports were largely produced on  hedule.

:(a)    Road abehouatdX and _ceM
36.          The economic rate of return of the roads component (which compises
Motorway Phase I Rehabilitation. Motorway Phase m Colystractdon, and Nsawam Road
Rehabilitation  d which is suttialy differt frm th original roads component) is
estimated at 84% based on the final design, actual economic costs, and estimated economic
mahomame costs. This i amost the sam  as the ERR of 83% esmated in the SAR. This
result b eWxlaned by a combination of increased benefits as a result of much iher taffic
volumes on Motorway m and higher investment costs for all three road compnone. Had the
costs remained the same as expected at appraisal, then the ERR would have been much
higher.
(b)  U  
37.          The upgrading of East Maamobi provided significant improvemes in services
(atines, piped water and drainae, grbage collection and electricity) and accessibility in this
deely populat  area. Current estimates indicate a total populton of about 24,000, or
6,000 households iving in 750 cokmnds (an average of 8 households per compound) in a
30-ha area. Property sale. information in the Maamobi area indicate that a mudbrick stuure
of the compound type (8-16 rooms per structure) now sells for 280,000 cedis per room
compared to 50,000 cedis per room (in nominal terms) at the time of the SAR. This type of
buildin makes up about 80% of the sttu  in Maamobi. Anoter 20% are single-family
cement block strucures (3-edrom single family) and these sell for about 4.7 milion cedis
each, or about 780,000 cedis per room compared to 100,000 cedis per room at appraisd. In
real terms property values almost tripled. Tlis rise in property value assumed to occur two
years after the project with half the increase occwrring in year one and the other half in year
two is associated with an ERR of 394% (Annex 3). This ERR copares favorably with SAR
expectations for this component of a range of ERRs (40%, 182%, 541%) based on alternative
scenarios. The ERR is obviously high, which could be because the properties were
undervalued at the time of appraisal due to the lack of an active market and a poor database;
it could also reflect more than the value of upgrading, such as the value of improved temure,
densificatlon of the area and its proximity to the inner city.
38.          The value of the commecial oprations was not quantified at appraisal,
perhaps because the area did not attract businesses due to lack of access and services.
However, current indications based on field imspection are that a number of traders operate in
the East Maamobi area. One can assume that job opportnities have been created and
productivity has been enhanced by the project improvements.
39.          Once fWlly implemented, the policies irduced by the project - property
valuation and revemne mobilization - would outlast the project itself and help Ghana to cope
with high rates of urbanization. The urban upgrading experience has demonstated a low-
cost, workable approach to upgrading other densley setled, underserviced areas in Accra.
The health, environenal, productivity and social benefits which the improved services . ave
brout to the area, though not quanihd, have definitely enbanced the East Maamobi area.

G. Proiect SustaiabiHity
40.          The institutions created under ADRP (ADRU, DUR, LVB) now provide an
important base which did not exist before. These young agencies require continued
strengthening. The assistance to AMA under the project should help it to relocate adequate
resources for the _m  nce of project created facilities. The follow-up project (Urban U)
wil continue to assist AMA to strengthen its technical and management capacity through
training. To ensure continued finacial viability of the AMA and to enable it to fiancially
support the necessary sustained growth, there is a need to review the existing policies,
particularly with regard to seting appropriate property tax rates (para. 33). These factors are
being addressed through AMA's own intenal review. However, for actions in both these
areas, greater government involvement and commihnent is needed.
41.          To furher capitalize on the benefits, the Government needs to focus on
continued institutional development, particularly in the area of revenue mobilization methods
and interagency coordinaon. These aspects were reviewed under the Local Government
Sector Study (Report No. 11369-GH, February 18, 1993), and further support will be
provided under the planned Local Government Project, 1994. The GOG also needs to
examine the incentive sure if qualified and experienced staff are to be retained in key
urban agencies.
H. IDA Performance
42.          Through the ADRP, IDA made a positive contribution to the physical and
institutional development of the urban sector and put in place mechanisms to ensure contiued
financial viability of key urban agencies. IDA performance has been satisfactory. IDA staff
was prompt to help overcome Ghana's counterpart funding problem by adjusting upward the
IDA contribution to local funding. Lengthy procurement procedures in Ghana were dealt with
by constant IDA dialogue to obtain decisions. Working relationship between IDA and
relevant Ghanaian agencies remained very cordial, supportive, cooperative, and most of all,
productive. The politicians took keen interest in the project and helped to obtain policy
decisions expeditiously. Contimuity of staff in supervision also helped timely project
implementation.
I. Borrower Performance
43.          Part m, Table 7 provides details of the performance of the borrower on key
covenants. Borrower performance was good in delivering the project on schedule despite
several countervailing factors, namely, (i) several changes of key policymakers and agency
personnel -3 Secretaries of MWH during the project, and numerous personnel changes in
MRH; (ii) cumbersome prouemen procedures requiring mmerous approvals and signatures;
and (iii) shortage of counterpart funding. Procuement delays are now progressively being
overcome by GOG dalizing the procrem    procedures giving greater power to sector
ministries and regions to take decisions within specific parameters. The Ghanaians remained
very cooperative throughout the project.



11
J. Consulting Services
44.          The performance of consultants under the project has been adequate. One
local consultant was used and performance was satisfactory. In-house capacity is adequate
and being built up and should be encouraged.
K. Project Documentation and Data
45          Quarterly reports for the period July 1986 through September 1990 were
regularly perpared by TSC and sent to IDA as required by the SAR. A total of 17 such
reports were reviewed in preparing this PCR. The quality of reporting was fair. Useful data
were presented in the quarterly reports, but lacked consistency, which made it difficult to
follow a trend. Early reports were quite usefiu (1986-1987) as they presented in a consistent
way data on the arrears situation of AMA and monitored progress made in reducing the
arrears. This data became spotty in 1988 and by end 1988, disappeared completely in its
original format; the arrears problem, however, remained.

1.           Out of five road rehabilitation and construction components, only three wae
implemented ad completed: Motorway 11 Rehabilaon (Accra-Tema Motorway, Teteh
Quarshie Circle to Nsawam Road in the SAR), Motorway m Construction (Complete
Motorway Extension, Diamond inerhange to Winnea Road in the SAR), and Nsawam Road
(the same in the SAR). The rest (Ring Road Central and Ring Road West) were canceled and
not implemented because of cost overnms in the above tdr  investments.
2.           Actual financia investments in the tee components and geneal expendures
(which were allocated to the ftree implementd compones in proportion to their
investments) were C211 milion plus Deutsche Mark 20 million at current prices, and thier
economic costs of inestmes were esdmated at US$12 million at 1986 prices after applying
the standard conversion factor of 0.93 (Table 1).
3.           Economic road user costs i Accra at 1986 prices were esmed ranging
from US$0.81 per composite vehicle at the slowest speed on roads with severely failed
surfce to US$0.11 at the most economic speed of 70 kph on roads with good surfae  (rable
2). Road user cost (RUC) savig by Motorway m were estmaed at US$0.39 per vehicle
klometer (Fable 2). About 75% of the traffic on Motorway m is considered as diverted
from existn roads and 25% as generated. Since the generated traffic realizes a half of the
benefit from diverted traffic, the average RUC savings on Motorway m is adjustd
accordingly to US$0.34 per vehicle-km (Table 3).
4.           Based on acual cost and benefits estimd above, the ERR on all road
componen  is estmated at 84% (Table 3). This is almost the sme as the ERR in the SAR of
83% as a result of two major factors opert   in opposite directions. On the one hand, much
higher traffic volumes were red     on Motorway m i ng the befits, but actual
investment costs went up substtly for al three components. Had cost overmns not
occurred, then the benefits derived from the inveament would have been much higher.
Overall, the ERR on the road components is high enough and isfhctoy.

Ex-Post Eopnomic Rate of Retun Calclatin
The following assumptions were used in the calation of the ex-post
economic rate of return (ERR).
Costs
All prices have been expressed in 1984 constat terms.
Inftuct  costs include all costs of providing imovements in services
(roads, electricity, piped water and drinage, garbage coilecton) and accessibility.
Overhead costs include costs of administtion,  ginering and supervision of
the upgrading componen.
BeSfits
The benefit strem  has been calculated on the basis of the incremenl
property sale value of the following: A total of 750 residentl sucres (a) 80% or 6000
2.8 million cedis per structure (based on 10 rooms each) = 1,680 million cedis; (b) 20% or
150 @ 4.7 million cedis per structure (based on 6 rooms each) = 705 million cedis.
The rise in property values has been assumed to occur within two years of the
end of the project, 1/2 of the increase attributed to each year.
