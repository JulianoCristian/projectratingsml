Although the overall\n            development objective remains realistic and achievable,\n            there are however a number of steps the Government needs to\n            take, to restructure the project, and ensure these\n            objectives are attained. This proposed amendment would: a)\n            increase the number of cities named in the project\n            development objective, and included in Component 3 -\n            Municipal Grants - from five to eight for the remainder of\n            the project; and b) specifically include provisions under\n            Component 4 - Project Management and Technical Assistance -\n            for consultancies to evaluate the pilot, and provide\n            recommendations to the Government for a future program that\n            would include all 33 municipalities. The proposed amendment\n            would incur no additional cost, yet it would enable a more\n            thorough evaluation of the pilot, that would be important to\n            scale-up the learning and benefits from the project as a\n            whole in the future. The increased number of municipalities\n            would scale-up immediate project impact for the design of a\n            future set of mechanisms for the Government, thus support\n            municipal development which depends crucially on careful\n            analysis of the pilot and lessons learned. The proposed\n            credit amendment complies with the Articles of Agreement of\n            the Association, and it is recommended for approval."}, "docdt": "2004-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
