{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Municipal Development\n            Project (MDP) of Mozambique were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: (i) the design\n            of a project and in particular of a pilot program should be\n            kept simple and within the capacity of the staff and\n            agencies responsible for its implementation. In this case\n            the project and the pilot were both too complex; (ii) the\n            implementation must be flexible to adapt to changes in the\n            environment - in this case the design of the Municipal Grant\n            Fund (MGF) was frequently adjusted to reflect lessons\n            learned which resulted in successfully testing a transfer\n            system that enabled local staff to design and implement\n            small projects within a 12 month cycle; (iii) the initial\n            mechanism to transfer of funds was complex because of an\n            unreliable treasury system at the time of the project's\n            design. However, since the current treasury system is well\n            established, future transfers to the municipalities should\n            be via the intergovernmental transfer system and not using\n            the mechanism tested in the pilot; (iv) the MGF pilot\n            developed in the third cycle a mechanism which included a\n            provision that contracts could only be signed when all\n            required funding was in place. This modification addressed\n            the counterpart funding problem and reduced the time to\n            completion dramatically; (v) increased involvement of the\n            staff in the implementing agencies in management of the\n            project would have helped to increase the local capacity\n            more than by utilizing outside implementing units for the\n            central and municipal governments; and (vi) the MGF had a\n            complex implementation framework involving too many decision\n            makers and which minimized the importance of local\n            ownership. If decentralized systems are to be successful,\n            they must have the active support and involvement of the\n            elected officials and staff from the local governments;\n            (vii) the lessons from the MDP and other projects show that\n            political leadership and commitment from the\n            mayors/presidents is a pre-condition for a successful\n            project design and management since the mayor has much\n            greater ownership and direct responsibility and\n            accountability; (viii) the involvement of WBI in the\n            implementation of component 2 was the major reason for the\n            improvement in that component and for the eventual impact of\n            the training program; (ix) The outcome of the MDP shows that\n            better coordinated efforts from GOM and partners for\n            capacity development is important and necessary; and (x) it\n            is essential for the team leaders for the government and\n            Bank project teams to develop a strong working relationship\n            built on effective communication to ensure the efforts of\n            both organizations are working toward the same objective."}, "docdt": "2007-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
