strengthen the capacity of municipal governments in the\n            areas of management, finance, and the provision of\n            infrastructure services. It will assist the Government in\n            the operation of legal, institutional, and fiscal\n            frameworks, providing training to municipal officials, and\n            staff, and, will pilot a municipal grants mechanism, to\n            finance investments, laying the foundation for an\n            inter-governmental fiscal system. Specifically, the\n            components will: 1) provide technical assistance (TA) to the\n            Ministry of State Administration, for the drafting of legal\n            instruments, and the preparation of studies, manuals, and\n            other materials needed to establish the legal, and policy\n            framework for municipal development; 2) provide in-service\n            training to elected, and appointed municipal officials, and\n            staff, and, will also develop pre-service training, and\n            provide TA to improve processes. The training will support\n            municipal government systems, and public administration,\n            emphasizing technical skills in municipal finance, and\n            infrastructure delivery services; 3) provide municipalities\n            with financial resources, through municipal grants, to\n            implement civil works, supply equipment, provide consulting\n            services, and enable municipalities to build the capacity to\n            manage, and implement investments; and, 4) provide project\n            management, and TA, including support for municipal\n            engineering, procurement, contract management, and,\n            supervisory, and financial aspects."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
