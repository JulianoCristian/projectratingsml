Development Project is\n            expected to improve the environmental conditions in urban\n            areas through the successful implementation of civil works\n            programs in parallel with dynamic awareness campaigns\n            targeting user communities. During the first phase of the\n            civil works program, the five municipalities (Beira,\n            Quelimane, Nampula, Pemba, and Maputo) will be limiting\n            their works to surface water drainage, sewerage and\n            sanitation, markets, waste disposal, and rehabilitation of\n            pavements and footpaths. 1) During construction, storage or\n            cement mixing sites will be located so that they do not\n            contaminate local water resources. Awareness campaigns\n            involving local communities will be promoted to keep\n            drainage channels clean and free of debris. 2) Measures will\n            be taken to ensure sanitary conditions are maintained at the\n            new markets. 3) Contractual obligations of the contractors\n            must include clauses regarding environmental protection,\n            especially regarding post-construction site-cleaning.\n            Latrines should not be constructed close to ground and\n            surface water sources to avoid contamination. 4) Local\n            population will be discouraged from using footpaths as\n            latrines, and adequate drainage will be provided to preclude\n            possible flooding and erosion. 5) Skips equipped with\n            tight-ftting lids for waste disposal will be constructed to\n            prevent foraging and breeding by pest species."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
