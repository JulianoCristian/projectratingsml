Lessons learned from the project:\n            Contingency planning might have prepared the parties to\n            trigger the restructuring as early as 1999 (midterm review)\n            and avoid the subsequent suspension controversy. The Project\n            would have reached better outcomes faster, and Bank and\n            Borrower would have incurred lesser costs, if the\n            restructuring had taken place earlier. While framed to\n            support an ambitious national vision to rehabilitate and\n            develop the sanitation sector, project preparation was not\n            sufficiently concerned with the technical details and\n            institutional realities crucial to implementation in Fez.\n            The project did not involve public health specialists in\n            preparation or supervision. While the project aimed at\n            institutional and performance gains, it lacked a strategy\n            and components to influence such objectives. Even with a\n            less ambitious restructured scope, indicators provided in\n            this report show that the population of Fez is better off\n            with the project than without it."}, "docdt": "2005-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
