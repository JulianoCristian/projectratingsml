of wastewater; 2) assist\n            the government in developing a long-term policy on\n            institution-building and cost recovery of sewerage services;\n            and 3) address the needs of the poorest population groups by\n            improving sewerage services in urban areas, in particular\n            through rehabilitation of existing facilities. The project\n            will consist of the following components: 1) institutional,\n            operational and financial assistance to restructure Regie\n            Autonome Intercommunal de Distribution d'Eau et\n            d'Electricite de Fes (RADEEF), and in general, to\n            transfer operation and maintenance of sewerage systems from\n            Municipalities to Regies; 2) rehabilitation and expansion of\n            the sewerage system of RADEEF; 3) operational and wastewater\n            quality control equipment for upgrading operational\n            efficiency and management systems; 4) provision of\n            equipment, technical assistance and training for sanitary\n            education campaigns, water quality control, as well as\n            credit lines for social sewerage house connections; and 5)\n            consulting services, technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1996-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
