The components call for: 1)\n            tender privatization, to assist the Government in the sale\n            of state-owned enterprises (not undergoing special\n            privatization programs) to strategic local, and foreign\n            investors. Emphasis will be given to transferring majority\n            ownership of public enterprise assets, into private\n            ownership; 2) finance, and advice provision on utility\n            privatization under special privatization programs, which\n            includes both, the preparation of legislation, and\n            regulatory framework for the divestiture of utility\n            companies, as well as the actual sale of companies to\n            strategic investors; 3) technical assistance with unbundling\n            concessions, and insolvency procedures, to be provided to\n            large enterprises, and holding companies, including the\n            preparatory steps to attract potential investors for the\n            separated entities. Private sector participation will be\n            ensured through concession agreements, and, affected\n            enterprises will be protected under insolvency legislation,\n            and accelerated procedures; and, 4) capital markets\n            development, by assisting Government Entities, and the\n            Securities Commissions in facilitating the completion of\n            voucher privatization, creating regulatory frameworks\n            required for trading, and revision of securities, and\n            formulating stock exchange legislation, commercial codes and\n            bankruptcy laws. In addition to the four components, the\n            project aims at strengthening institutional building, and\n            administrative capacity for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
