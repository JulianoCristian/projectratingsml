unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included: 1) The project\n            design could have been improved by broader discussions with\n            and involvement of key parliamentary figures; 2) Strong\n            government commitment is essential in carrying out what can\n            be politically sensitive changes; 3) Technical assistance\n            projects of this kind have a greater chance of success if\n            they complement policy-based operations and the leverage\n            that these provide; 4) Legislation central to successful\n            project implementation, particularly in regard to technical\n            assistance projects where the Bank has limited leverage,\n            should be in place before project implementation begins; and\n            5) The presence of the task manager in the field facilitates\n            smooth project implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
