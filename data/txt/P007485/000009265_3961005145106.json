The financial sector support\n            component will enhance the basis for capital markets\n            development and financial intermediation through: (a) a\n            financial sector advisory program aimed to help upgrade\n            prudential regulations and banking supervision, reshape the\n            operations of the Government's two public development\n            banks, and increase export financing through training and a\n            preshipment guarantee program; and (b) a long-term credit\n            program to finance investments expected to build or\n            restructure, largely export-oriented, production capacity."}, "docdt": "1994-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
