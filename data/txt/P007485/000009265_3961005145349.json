The export support\n            systems component will establish: (a) an export support\n            program to accelerate the acquisition of export know-how in\n            export market research, product adaptation, and market\n            penetration; (b) a more effective export free trade regime\n            mainly through a privately controlled free trade zone (FTZ)\n            regime, privatization of existing FTZs, and a single factory\n            free zone regime to extend equal footing status to\n            enterprises in the Customs Territory; and (c) a labor\n            training and adjustment program to facilitate skill\n            upgrading and labor redeployment as required by new\n            enterprise investments. The financial sector support\n            component will enhance the basis for capital markets\n            development and financial intermediation through: (a) a\n            financial sector advisory program aimed to help upgrade\n            prudential regulations and banking supervision, reshape the\n            operations of the Government's two public development\n            banks, and increase export financing through training and a\n            preshipment guarantee program; and (b) a long-term credit\n            program to finance investments expected to build or\n            restructure, largely export-oriented, production capacity."}, "docdt": "1994-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
