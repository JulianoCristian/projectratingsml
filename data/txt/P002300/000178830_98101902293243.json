following\n            major objectives: (i) continue the development of irrigation\n            in the Senegal River Delta in the two perimeters at Debi and\n            Lampsar for production of irrigated paddy on about 3,000 ha\n            and tomatoes on 340 ha; and (ii) prepare for the future\n            integrated development of the entire river valley through\n            strengthening the management, planning, and research\n            capabilities of the national development agency SAED\n            (Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des\n            Terres du Delta) which is responsible for planning,\n            construction, and management of all Senegalese irrigation\n            schemes within the proposed regional development of the\n            Senegal River Basin. The project is expected to yield direct\n            benefits as a result of increased production of paddy and\n            tomatoes, including foreign exchange benefits to be realized\n            from substituting project production for current imports of\n            rice and tomato paste."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
