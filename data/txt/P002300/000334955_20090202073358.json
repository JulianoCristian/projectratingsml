Project construction began in\n            January, 1979, after a delay of almost a year caused by\n            management changes at the implementing agency and\n            difficulties in finalizing the works supervision contract.\n            While most of the originally foreseen project components\n            were completed well before the intended final closing date\n            of June 30, 1983, this was extended several times to permit\n            disbursement on added components including creation of small\n            village perimeters and rehabilitation of the Savoigne\n            perimeter and canal. Final disbursement and the eventual\n            closing date occurred on October 29, 1986. The originally\n            designated net area for irrigation could not be fully\n            developed because of excessively saline and sandy soils\n            encountered, and because of a denser network of canals and\n            dikes that resulted from shifting from 3 ha to about 1 ha\n            farm allocations. Over 20 percent of the appraised area was\n            thus lost, although this was partially compensated for by\n            development of other perimeters that were added to the\n            project. Production of tomatoes was abandoned after\n            difficulties with the first crop showed that the project\n            soils were too heavy and saline for remunerative yields."}, "docdt": "1988-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
