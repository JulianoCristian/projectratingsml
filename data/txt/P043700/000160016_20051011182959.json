Program. The project goals are: a) privatizing port services\n            and promoting private investments in ports by setting up a\n            new cargo handling organization and constructing new port\n            facilities under Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) schemes; b)\n            facilitating access of foreign investors to trade-related\n            transport; c) commercializing the railway parastatal and\n            making it financially autonomous through institutional\n            changes; and d) increased use of less polluting fuels. There\n            are three project components. First, port and trade\n            facilitation will remove potential bottlenecks to the\n            anticipated traffic growth, facilitate development of modern\n            shipping and port technologies, support implementation of\n            the new port laws and regulations, modernize customs\n            procedures, and develop modern data exchange systems for\n            disseminating modern trade logistics among the port and\n            trader communities. Second, railways modernization and\n            restructuring will allow the railway company to become a\n            fully-commercial enterprise. It will help the government\n            finance an investment package to catch up with deferred\n            modernization on the main corridor Tunis-Sousse-Sfax. Third,\n            sector management will strengthen human resource management\n            in the public sector and develop skills in the areas of\n            computerized information systems, transport economics, and\n            financial management."}, "docdt": "1998-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
