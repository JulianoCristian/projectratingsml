Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 CBPFM project execution has continued to accelerate since the last ISR. This acceleration continues the trend since 2012 and substantial progress
 is being made towards achievement of the project objectives contained in the log frame adopted in 2013. In order to implement project in compliance
 with the existing work plan the Project Board took a decision to extend the project until May, 31, 2015. This decision was supported by the Bank
 management. While some elements of the work plan remain behind schedule, every component of the program shows progress. PEFA Assessment,
 funded by the project is being conducted. Preliminary PEFA Assessment findings show modest improvement in several PFM areas. It is expected that
 the results of the assessment will be utilized in development of the future PFM reform priorities. As the project closing date is approaching, the project is
 maintaining a weekly action plan of key activities to monitor and take timely corrective actions to meet the project targets.
