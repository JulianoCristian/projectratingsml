                         extensive review of the logical framework, workplan, and training plan is underway to more closely align the project with current priorities and most viable reforms.

                         The Government has requested an extension of the project from its current scheduled ending date of June 30, 2013, to December 31, 2013. However, three of the four components
                         of the project are dependent on full implementation of the TMIS, supported by the GTAC project, and the advisability of extending the trust fund in its current form will be impacted by
