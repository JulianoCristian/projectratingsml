1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
Country context
In the years running up to project appraisal, strong economic growth contributed to a significant
reduction in poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic. GDP grew by 8.4 percent in 2008. Poverty rates
declined from 43 percent in 2005 to 31.7 percent in 2008 and extreme poverty fell from 35
percent to 7 percent. Still the Kyrgyz Republic remained one of the poorest countries in the
region, with GDP per capita of US$966. Cautious macro-economic and fiscal policies coupled
with strong economic growth and improvements in tax administration, with revenues rising
sharply to 20.7 percent of GDP, enabled the Government to consolidate its budget deficit. Firm
fiscal policy supported by strong growth and Paris Club assistance resulted in a reduction in
public debt, which is largely external, to 58 percent of GDP.
At appraisal the Kyrgyz Republic faced significant challenges in sustaining these positive
developments. As the global economic crisis started to affect the region, the prospects for the
Kyrgyz economy worsened owing to dependency on remittances and trade with Russia and
Kazakhstan and vulnerability to the world commodity prices. Economic growth in the Kyrgyz
Republic was expected to decline sharply and fiscal pressures were expected to increase. In this
case, reforms aimed at improving the efficiency in managing public resources assumed
prominence in the Kyrgyz Republic’s development agenda.
Sector context
Following the adoption of a systematic PFM Action Plan in 2006 that built on comprehensive
analytic work, the Government made progress in a number of areas with the support of technical
assistance, including: implementation of a new budget classification in the 2007 budget;
development of Treasury procedures to strengthen budget preparation and execution; adoption of
a new Chart of Accounts (COA); and approval of a Law on Internal Audit by parliament.
However, significant challenges remained. The second PEFA assessment published in 2009
pointed to some progress in budget comprehensiveness and transparency but identified poor
budget credibility is one of the principle shortcomings of the PFM system, stemming partly from
weaknesses in the budget preparation and execution processes and cash management. The
assessment also highlighted the needed for assistance in: updating the legal framework for
budgeting; strengthening annual budget preparation process; improving understanding of the
internal audit function and supporting implementation of the Law on Internal Audit; and building
the capacity of civil servants to lead the PFM reform process.
The Government adopted a Medium-Term Vision for PFM Reform in 2009. This document
outlined a sequenced approach aimed to improve the performance in six PFM areas: the budget
preparation; budget execution and reporting; the PFM legal framework; inter-governmental fiscal
relations; a fiscal reform strategy and revenue management; and capacity building.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
The Country Development Strategy (CDS) of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2009-2011 emphasized
the need to improve governance and transparency in public administration. The CDS recognized
that the Government had made some progress in enhancing PFM but significant further work
was needed in this area to support poverty reduction and economic growth. Kyrgyzstan’s

                                               23
experience with PFM reforms over the previous decade demonstrated that the authorities could
make progress when supported by external technical assistance and capacity building in the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and line ministries. The CDS stressed the need for coordination
among multiple development partners.
PFM reform figured prominently in the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (FY2007-FY2012),
under the second of the Bank’s four priority areas: Improving governance, effective public
administration and reducing corruption. The Bank had provided support to the preparation of the
PFM Action Plan and the authorities and donors asked the Bank to establish a MDTF and
support the preparation and implementation of the Capacity Building in Public Finance
Management Project.
1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The development objective for the MDTF was to assist the government of the Kyrgyz Republic
in enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability in PFM through strengthening the
budget process, the internal audit and control functions and the institutional and human capacity
of the MoF and line ministries. The development objective of the project supported a higher level
objective of improving service delivery. The PDO indicators included:
         A stronger budget process with improved internal management and accountability for
          spending and performance
         Intensified and more productive interaction between government and citizens on budget-
          related issues
         Increased predictability of the annual budget as a result of the medium-term budget
          framework (MTBF) providing an effective instrument for expenditure control and
          allocation of resources
         A stronger public internal control environment
         Increased competence in management, administration and technical functions in the MoF
          and key line ministries, specifically in PFM.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO and key indicators were not revised. However, an intermediate indicator on updating
the Budget Law was introduced. In addition, over the course of project implementation, the
Project Board excluded some intermediate indicators from the Logical Framework and added
new indicators, which were more relevant to the new circumstances.
      Revised intermediate indicator:
       The Budget Code of the Kyrgyz Republic that is under development contains relevant
         regulations to strengthen the overall PFM system consistent with best practices
      Excluded intermediate indicators:
       Media contains more frequent and improved reporting on budget-related issues, with
         increased budget literacy
       The MoF commissions and publishes independent studies related to the budget process,
         and conducts monitoring of the quality of publications on budget-related issues
       The MoF human resources practices
       Policy development capacity of the MoF to align policy decision to budget funding
         allocations

                                                24
      Added Intermediate Indicators:
       Availability of basic elements of the IA system, including improved laws and regulation,
         and also the standards and methodology
       A functioning Central Methodology and Quality Unit providing training, normative
         documents, guidance for internal auditors and monitoring IA quality and compliance
       Improved tax policy and tax administration
       Improved public revenue forecasting and analysis
       Improved public procurement processes
1.4      Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project were the MoF and line ministries at the central government
level, local governments, as well as all budgetary organizations since the PFM reform supported
by the project covered many PFM functions and spanned across levels of government. These
included budget preparation and budget execution, the medium-term budgetary framework and
performance orientation of the budget, linkages between the current and capital budgets, budget
comprehensiveness and fiscal transparency, internal audit and control, intergovernmental fiscal
transfers, revenue forecasting and public procurement. The MoF, line ministries and budgetary
organizations particularly benefited from the streamlined and more effective PFM processes and
staff training and capacity building supporting the development of core PFM skills supported by
the project. The local governments benefited from more effective equalization of
intergovernmental fiscal transfers due to the new formula developed as part of this project. The
public at large, including the private sector and citizens, benefitted from efficient public
procurement and transparent budget reporting.
1.5      Original Components (as approved)
The project included five components:
Component 1. Strengthening the Budget Process. This component included the following
activities:
    (a) Strengthening the legislative framework of PFM, including updating the rules and
        regulations for budget preparation and execution, and optimizing the work processes and
        procedures used;
    (b) Strengthening the relationship between Kyrgyz nationals and budget-related issues by
        supporting the process of systemic publication of budget information, public awareness
        of the budget process and the media’s literacy of budgetary issues.
Component 2. Improvement of Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF), including in
Line Ministries. The component financed the following activities:
   (a) Improving the quality of macroeconomic forecasting in the medium term and appraising
       fiscal implications of macroeconomic developments
   (b) Improving a credible link between the MTBF and annual budget preparation and
       execution
   (c) Improving the costing of budgetary expenditure in line ministries
   (d) Enhancing the link between realistic sector strategies and the budget process, including
       in line ministries
   (e) Developing financial and non-financial sector performance indicators



                                                25
Component 3. Internal Audit and Control. The component comprised provision of goods,
training and technical assistance to the MoF and line ministries to support the implementation of
the Internal Audit Law, including the establishment of both an internal audit unit and a central
harmonization unit, and building the capacity of these institutions.
Component 4. Capacity Building in PFM. The component financed for the following
activities:
    (a) Building management capacity within the MoF
    (b) Enhancing the capacity of specialists in key reform techniques
    (c) Developing the training capacity of the MoF
    (d) Capacity-building activities in direct support of PFM initiatives
    (e) Capacity-building for key PFM training providers in the Kyrgyz Republic
    (f) Enhancing the fiduciary capacity in the MoF
Component 5. Project Management. This component financed provision of goods, training and
technical assistance in carrying out project implementation, procurement and financial
management of the TF, including audit.
1.6    Revised Components
In the course of project implementation, Component 1 was revised by adding new activities,
which reflected the MoF’s emerging needs and included:
    (a) Establishing a new system of public procurement;
    (b) Improvement of inter-governmental relations;
    (c) Improvement of forecasting and analysis of public revenue;
    (d) Improvement of tax policy and tax administration, and
    (e) Introducing International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).
1.7    Other Significant Changes
There was no change in the project design, scope, scale and implementation arrangements.
However, there were two extensions of the project closing date through Level II restructuring on
December 12, 2012 and April 4, 2014. As a result the project closing date was extended from
June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014 and then to May 31, 2015.
The project experienced delays in 2009-2012 due to political instability, changes in the MoF
leadership and the failure of the recipient entity to appoint a project manager for over a year
during that period. Project execution accelerated from 2012. The extensions enabled the
completion of several key procurements that supported the achievement of the PDO. Notable
project achievements following extension were the development of a system for more
comprehensive disclosure of key budget documents and financial information and the
preparation of training materials and manuals for the internal audit. However, the adoption of the
Budget Code which was a key element for strengthening the budget processes was repetitively
delayed in parliament and thus still remains on the agenda for the future.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
A comprehensive analytical work laid a strong foundation for project preparation and
design. This included a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), a Country

                                               26
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), a Programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PPER), a
PEFA assessment – published shortly after project approval, the IMF’s Report on the
Observance of Standards and Code on Fiscal Transparency (fiscal ROSC) and technical notes on
budget preparation and execution. This analytical work informed the design of the Government’s
the Medium-Term Vision for PFM Reform which provided the basis for the project
development. During the project preparation, consultations were carried out with the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Economy, the line ministries, donors and government bodies outside the
executive, such as the Jogorku Kenesh and the Chamber of Accounts, so as to ensure that there
was a shared understanding of the project design and commitment to project objectives.
Donors adopted a common program and robust coordination arrangements. All of the
major donors supporting PFM reforms in the Kyrgyz Republic joined the MDTF and supported
the project: DfID, SIDA, SECO and EU. The Project Board provided strategic direction for the
project comprising top MoF officials and one representative from each of the MTDF donors. A
Technical Expert Panel served as an advisory body comprising the PFM TF manager, key
specialists from MOF, key experts (consultants) working on the Project, the Bank and MTDF
donors and other key experts working on PFM. To facilitate project start-up, the existing project
implementation unit (PIU) in the MoF, which provided support for the Bank financed
Government Technical Assistance (GTAC) and Agribusiness Support Projects, was put in charge
of procurement, financial management and disbursement and monitoring at the time of project
preparation.
The project design was overly complex and ambitious. The project provided support in seven
areas of PFM: policy-based budgeting, predictability and control in budget execution, accounting
and reporting, budget comprehensiveness and transparency, revenue policy and forecasting,
intergovernmental fiscal transfers and public procurement. The intermediate results framework
incorporated 24 indicators for all the PFM areas covered under the project. This made it difficult
to prioritize and sequence activities.
Successful completion of several reforms was dependent on the successful implementation
of the parallel GTAC Project which supported implementation of an IFMIS. The
implementation of a three-year budget planning, linkage between the annual budget and MTBF,
capital expenditure forward planning and introduction of the Unified Chart of Accounts (UCOA)
required the automation and consolidation of the budget preparation and execution processes.
GTAC’s failure to implement the IFMIS hindered the achievement of project development
indicators related to the MTBF and internal audit and control, which were left pending the
development of appropriate automated processes.
The internal arrangements for implementation of the reform were inadequate. Within the
MoF the assignment of personal responsibilities to the MoF officials for specific project
activities was unclear. This undermined ownership of reform and effective communication
between the project implementation team and top officials of the MoF. Implementation involved
a large number of institutions beyond MoF, including: the MoF, line ministries, local
governments, all the budgetary organizations. However, the project provided little support in this
cross-governmental coordination function, instead coordination arrangements were primarily
geared to manage MoF’s relationship with its development partners and between senior
government officials and international experts.



                                               27
The design overestimated the MOF’s ability - and perhaps extent of commitment - to
undertake far-reaching reforms. Eight major risks were identified, including political,
technical, capacity, low incentives for reforms, government responsiveness to citizen’s opinion
on budget issues, high turnover of qualified staff, government commitment to reforms and
corruption. Only two risks were rated as High and the remaining as Medium, including political
instability and consequently institutional and personnel instability. Some mitigating measures
were identified, such as Government agreement to the capacity building plan, involvement of the
MoF senior staff in the Project Board and the development of improved HR management
processes. The risk framework also provided for exit triggers, which would require action by the
MDTF donors to adjust or suspend MDTF implementation. However, the original design
underestimated risks that were outside the Bank’s or project counterpart’s control, particularly
risks institutional capacity in the public sector to internalize and implement complex PFM
reforms, the Government’s commitment to push for such reforms and the role of stakeholders
such as the legislature is delaying adoption of the Budget Code.

2.2    Implementation
The project experienced lengthy start-up delays and subsequently suffered some delays as a
results of changes in key personnel. Actual project implementation began with one-year delay in
early 2011. This was partly due to changes in the MoF leadership and the failure of the recipient
entity to appoint a project manager. The pace of implementation accelerated from the start of FY
2012 as procurement picked up and then accelerated again from the second quarter of FY2014
through to project closing.
The Government’s project review argues that requirement for a prior-review of a large
proportion of contracts in the procurement plan hindered implementation. Implementation also
suffered from changes in key personnel. Over the course of the project, the Bank’s Task Team
Leader, the MoF Project Director and the Project Manager were each replaced three times.
Moreover, low wages of local consultants made it extremely difficult to attract and retain
qualified staff in the implementation unit.
Discussions with the implementation unit reveal concerns regarding the effectiveness of
international advisors. Language constraints played an important part but in some cases
counterparts had limited understanding and ownership of assignments. Counterparts expressed a
strong preference for hands on operational support over analytical and advisory reports.
While, the design became more complex over time, as restructuring in 2012 added new and
ambitious activities and indicators, these adjustments helped revitalize a failing project, aligning
the project’s activities with emerging priorities. These new activities, notably support for public
procurement reforms, including introduction of e-procurement portal, and the work on
intergovernmental transfers, led to some of the most important project achievements.
The project closing date was extended twice for an additional 23 months from its original closing
date. Project extensions approved on December 12, 2012 and April 4, 2014 allowed the project
to complete a number of important outputs that contributed to successful project outcomes:
development of the regulatory framework for implementing the Budget Code; improvements
budget transparency; introduction of methodologies for local revenue forecasting and a formula
providing for better equalization of intergovernmental fiscal transfers; introduction of non-
financial performance indicators in the public sector; strengthened internal audit in line

                                                 28
ministries; implementation of a public e-procurement system; and development of MoF capacity
for delivery of training.
While there was no formal mid-term review, under prevailing procedures for a MDTF, the Project
Board and Technical Panel did take stock of implementation progress and approve adjustments to
the project, notably in preparation for the December 2012 project restructuring and extension.
2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. The project design had a strong results focus. The project anticipated the use of
PEFA assessments as a means of monitoring progress of the Government’s PFM reforms over
the longer term, with the 2009 assessment providing a baseline and a follow-up assessment in
2014.
The project results framework complemented the PEFA assessments focusing on the reforms
rather than the improvements in PFM system performance. Almost all of the PDO and
Intermediate Outcome Indicators were framed as outputs, in terms of improvements in
regulations and systems. None of the indicators had a quantitative dimension. Most required a
qualitative assessment. Few of the indicators had clear intermediate milestones that would allow
management to monitor progress towards delivery of the intended output. As such the results
framework was not well suited to the assessment of progress towards the achievement of PDOs
nor was it an effective project management tool.
Furthermore, the results framework did not cover all of the dimensions on the PDO. While
numerous indicators monitored progress in effectiveness and accountability, the concept of
efficiency was not clearly articulated. The only PDO indicator that measured some dimension of
efficiency, together with the Intermediate Outcome Indicators, was related to the internal control
function. Improvements in process efficiency were to be assessed solely in terms of an
Intermediate Outcome Indicator related to implementation of FMIS automation which was not
actually supported under the project. When the project scope was adjusted in 2013, Intermediate
Outcomes Indicator were added related to public procurement but this too was focused on
regulatory framework rather than system efficiency.
M&E implementation. Despite these deficiencies in design, project management regularly
collected data and reported on progress in relation to the approved indicators. The data were
closely monitored and the actual progress was compared with the target values. In the course of
the project implementation, the results framework was updated and approved by the Project
Board to reflect new activities implemented by the project and remove some activities, such as
preparing a tax policy concept, for which the MoF was no longer in charge.
M&E utilization. Minutes of Project Board meetings and the ISRs reveal that the data collected
from the project annual reports and supervision missions was reviewed, evaluated and used to
keep track of implementation and for decision-making on project activities. Monitoring
information informed decisions on adjustments in project timelines and adjustments in project
activities prior to the 2012 project extension.
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard issues. Not applicable.
Fiduciary issues. There were no substantial issues with regard to procurement and financial
management. Small discrepancies revealed during the annual audit reviews or supervision

                                                29
missions were effectively and promptly resolved. Audit reports were provided on time and were
unqualified. Regular procurement post-review reports prepared during project implementation
indicated some minor issues which were promptly addressed.
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
MoF has requested that the World Bank lead the preparation of a follow-up PFM capacity
building project, which will build on activities implemented under the MDTF. DfID, SECO and
EU have confirmed their interest to provide financing for the project. The Government is
currently finalizing an update of its PFM strategy. The follow-up project will reflect the
Government’s new priorities. It will also address the unfinished agenda of the CBPFM project,
notably the adoption of a new Budget Code and automation of the public financial management
system.
3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: High
The project development objective, design and implementation are still relevant to the current
needs of the PFM system in the Kyrgyz Republic. The government has started the development
of a follow-up PFM Reform Strategy. The primary objective of this Strategy is to strengthen the
effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of PFM through strengthening the budget processes
and the internal audit and control functions. The project objectives are also consistent with the
Bank Country Partnership Strategy for FY2014-2016 as one of the key priorities under Area of
Engagement 1 is strengthening accountability and transparency in the management of public
finances.
Relevance of Design: Substantial
The project design included relevant PDO indicators and financed the development and
enhancement of key PFM systems of government that required significant technical assistance.
But the scope of activities could have been more focused and selective. At the same time, despite
the broad scope the project achieved substantial results in many important areas: budget
comprehensiveness, fiscal transparency, improved allocation of inter-governmental fiscal
transfers, a strengthened internal control environment and increased transparency and
competition in public procurement. The project fully disbursed all funds at closing.
A number of design factors hampered implementation. Risk ratings and mitigation measures
were not appropriately assessed. The project scope was unduly ambitious given the country
circumstances, the institutional and technical capability of the institutions. Project management
arrangements were also focused on coordination with and between donors, management
arrangements that would ensure adequate ownership and participation of officials within and
across the government institutions were much less prominent and much less effective. The
monitoring framework focused on outputs and did not provide a basis for assessing progress
towards the project’s development objectives.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective
The development objective for the MDTF was to assist the government of the Kyrgyz Republic
in enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability in PFM through strengthening the
budget process, the internal audit and control functions and the institutional and human capacity

                                                30
of the MoF and line ministries. The development objective of the project was aimed to support a
higher level objective of improving service delivery. The remainder of this section assesses
progress drawing on MoF data, PEFA assessments, interviews with government officials and
project supervision and other reports. Annex 2 recreates the results framework as provided in the
Concept Note and includes a Table on Assessment of Achievement by Objective. It is important
to note that some of the PDO indicators and intermediate results indicators contributed to several
PDO objectives and thus reflected accordingly under the respective objectives.
PDO Objective 1: Effectiveness Rating: Modest
                                                   EFFECTIVENESS

The Concept Note included three PDO indicators that could contribute to improvements in
effectiveness of public expenditure: PDO 1, 3 and 5. Progress against the PDO 1 was partially
achieved by establishing the foundations for the introduction of a program structure and use of
performance information in the budget. Very limited progress has been made in relation to PDO
3 strengthening the medium-term perspective in budgeting. The MTBF for 2015-2017 still
applies only functional and administrative classifications. The annual budget is not linked to the
MTBF. PDO 5, enhancing the effectiveness of public finance management through capacity
building in the MoF and line ministries, was achieved.
Progress towards intermediate outcomes related to the effectiveness objective is also mixed. The
Budget Code provides for fundamentally new approaches to budgeting, such as the consolidation
of the Social Fund with the national budget, a Treasury Single Account, program budgeting,

                                                     31
managerial budgeting and stronger linkages between the annual budget and the MTBF. However,
the Budget Code has yet to be approved.
Considerable progress has been made in implementing reforms in inter-governmental fiscal
relations. It contributed to the improvement in planning of intergovernmental transfers and
supported the development and adoption of a new equalization formula. The project also
contributed to introducing changes to a system for financing education costs and incentive grants
by developing and implementing Guidelines for Preparation and Execution of Projects Financed
from Incentive Grants. The equalization grants factoring utilities costs were implemented in
2014.
The program classification developed under the project was approved on September 27, 2015. It
will be piloted in six ministries in 2016. The government plans to implement program budgets in
all ministries from January 1, 2017. The project also supported the development of non-financial
indicators for 20 sectoral strategies that were adopted. Subsequently, 28 ministries and agencies
submitted their reports on non-financial indicators for 2014. Furthermore, the project assisted the
preparation and implementation of Guidelines for Managing Public Investments and Guidelines
for Assessing Public Investment Projects. The Public Investment Program (PIP) is consolidated
into the budget documentation and fully accounted for in the budget. The project has put in place
the foundations for program budgeting and public investment management, though these systems
have yet to be defined.
The project supported strengthening training management capacity through technical
modernization and functional reorganization of the MoF Training Center. In particular, a new
technical equipment was delivered, nine training modules were developed and 10 certified
trainers were trained. 15,160 staff received training in key PFM technical skills during 2010-
2015. Additionally, the project has helped put the institutional framework for capacity building
on a sustainable footing through changes in the legal framework for the MOF Training Center,
allowing the center to recover funds for training to other government agencies.
Comparison of 2009 and 2014 PEFA assessments confirms the improvements in the budget
process. Significant progress was made in transparency of intergovernmental fiscal relations and
orderliness and participation in the annual budget process. There was no change in the
performance of the multi-year perspective in budget planning.

The PDO indicator related to the efficiency objective is PDO 4 which is contributing to
improvements in strengthening public financial control environment. The project provided
support for establishing internal audit function in the MoF and line ministries. With the project
assistance the Internal Audit Methodology Unit was established in the MoF, proper internal audit
legislation was developed and Internal Audit units were opened in 19 line ministries. However,
lack of Internal Audit quality assurance mechanism has limited the overall effectiveness of the
internal audit function.
The project made significant progress in the area of public procurement by implementing an e-
procurement system. A Law on Public Procurement and associated by-laws, which provide for
functioning of an e-procurement system, were adopted and implemented. More than 5,000
clients have registered on the government e-procurement portal. There was an increase in
competitive procurement as a percentage of public procurement and average number of bidders
per bid. Time required for bid evaluation decreased by almost half. Additional information on the
improvement of public procurement is provided in the Annex 4.
Some progress was achieved in improving the MoF’s internal management capacity. The project
supported implementation of an automated workflow “Landox” system, which lowered the cost
and enhanced efficiency of internal workflow management in the MoF. The project also financed
investment in data access and data collection, communications and computer equipment for
connecting ministries/territorial executive bodies to the network, and training for using the PFM
information system. However the proposed integration of the budget and treasury automated
information systems did not take place. As a result, the information management continues to be
fragmented, requiring repeated data entry and reliance on manual processes. The project did not
provide financing or support activities that would have delivered this Intermediate Outcome.
Comparison of 2009 and 2014 PEFA assessments confirms improvements in procurement and
internal audit.

      Republic” (28 Dec 2006) by the Ministry of Finance and local financial
      bodies.

The project made significant progress in strengthening engagement between government and
citizens, which contributed to creation of enabling environment for strengthening accountability
in public financial management. The MoF introduced a practice of regular and systematic
publications on the budget. The Civil Budgets for 2014-2015 were developed and published.
Over the past two years regular public budget hearings have been held. Draft budget and budget
execution reports are published regularly. A Law on access to information possessed by public
administration bodies was adopted and implemented.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s Open Budget Survey score increased from 20 to 54 points between 2012
and 2014 owing to the publication of the Pre-Budget Statement, Citizens Budget, Mid-Year
Review, and Audit Report and improvements in the comprehensiveness of the Executive’s
Budget Proposal. The Open Budget Report notes that the Kyrgyz Republic now publishes all
eight key budget documents but still has to make progress in improving the comprehensiveness
of the reports published during the budget implementation phase. Significant progress has also
been made in public participation, notably by the executive through the introduction on budget
consultations, with a score of 52 as compared with a global average of just 25.

3.3     Efficiency
As an institutional capacity-building project, quantitative projections of rates of return are not
applicable and were not developed during project preparation. However, even if the project did
not pursue specific economic efficiency objectives, it is expected that capacities developed under
the project on areas of performance budgeting, internal audit and public procurement
administration would contribute to a reduction in the costs of government per unit of output as a
result of administrative cost savings and reduced procurement costs. Table 5 shows
improvements in public procurement after implementing e-procurement system.

The project was implemented within budget. Despite the twenty three month project extension
(nearly 50 percent), there was a relatively modest increase in project management costs (21
percent). However, there were significant adjustments in costs between components, with a
reduction in expenditures on the component supporting the budget process and a significant
increase in costs of the capacity building component. These cost increases were partly owing to
new activities added on client request, related to adoption and implementation of the Public
Procurement Law, methodology for the formula-based allocation of equalization grants to local
budgets, and the methodology for forecasting state budget revenue.

Even though the project failed to achieve its goals in adopting a new budget legislation and
implementing the MTBF, significant progress was made in the areas of internal control,
procurement reform, budget transparency, accountability, the establishment of basis for program
budgeting and capacity development. The Kyrgyz Republic PEFA Report 2014 showed
significant progress relative to 2009 in the areas of revenue forecasting, budget transparency,
integration of public investment into the budget, access to information, accounting and reporting

as shown in Figure 1. Fourteen PEFA indicators registered A or B scores as compared with only
six in 2009 the number of D scores fell from fourteen to six. These improvements can be directly
attributed to the support provided by the CBPFM project.




3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
There is no direct poverty, gender or social impact on the population. Indirectly, however, the
project helped lay the basis for a strengthening of the government’s human resources, more
efficient management of service delivery and public finance organization, and improved access
to information by the public - all of which will benefit citizens and support the Government’s
poverty reduction objectives.
(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project focused on institutional strengthening and capacity building. Improvements in
budget preparation, budget forecasting, the internal audit environment, the implementation of an
e-procurement system were all supported by targeted training which sought to develop
sustainable improvements in capacity to manage system improvements over the longer term.
Particular attention was given to building capacity in management and delivery of training
through the MOF Training Center given the potential for positive cross-cutting effects in the
whole public sector.
(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A survey was completed in May 2015, conducted by a private consulting company funded by the
project, with 52 respondents drawn from the MoF and line ministries. The results were largely
positive in terms of the project’s impact.
The majority of respondents noted positive changes in PFM but the pace of changes was slower
than expected. The respondents considered public procurement as the area that had shown the
greatest improvement as a result of strengthening institutional, legal and methodological
frameworks as well as enhancing transparency in procedures. The respondents saw political
instability, lack of public awareness and the economic crisis as negative factors hindering PFM
reform, far more so than political commitment. Hence, they argued that action should be taken to
promote the interaction between different agencies involved in PFM reform, strengthen the
monitoring of PFM reform, raise public awareness of its objectives and progress, and motivate
different segments in society to engage in the reform implementation.
Seventy three percent of the respondents believed that PFM reform would not have achieved its
outcomes without the MDTF project. Eight percent believed that PFM reform outcomes would
have been achieved even without the project. The respondents considered capacity building of
civil servants, improvements in the regulatory framework and the general progress in PFM
reforms as the most important achievements.
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Significant
Further implementation and sustainability of part of the reforms implemented under the project,
notably program budgeting, introduction of the functioning MTBF, capital expenditure and
forward planning and public accounting reform are, largely, dependent on adoption of the new
Budget Code and implementation of an automated budget management information system.
Advances in the capacity for the management and delivery of PFM training also face significant
risks. While the project has helped put in place institutional arrangements that allowed the MoF
Training Center to recover funds for training to other government agencies the Center retains
only an insignificant part of the revenue earned from providing training to corporate clients. The
Training Center’s limited resources make it difficult for the Center to attract and retain highly
qualified trainers and hinder the expansion of the Center’s activities and delivery modalities such
as distance learning.
The Government has continued to implement system reforms and sought to consolidate project
achievements through a follow-up project. The Bank continues its policy dialogue on PFM issues
and has included approval of the Budget Code as a prior action in a proposed Development
Policy Operation that will be prepared in parallel to the follow-up Capacity Building in PFM
project.
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Quality at Entry: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Although the project had a strong analytical basis and offered the Government a single
instrument for managing development assistance for PFM reform, a number of design factors
hampered implementation. Risk ratings and mitigation measures did not adequately reflect
ongoing political, social and economic developments. The project scope and expectations

                                                37
regarding the progress of reforms was unduly ambitious given the country circumstances, the
institutional and technical capability of the institutions. The level of ambition and priorities –
such as the prominence given to program budgeting, a complex technique that was motivated in
part as a framework for sector budget support – appear to have been inordinately influenced by
donors. Project management arrangements were also focused on coordination with and between
donors, management arrangements that would ensure adequate ownership and participation of
officials within and across the government institutions were much less prominent and much less
effective. The monitoring framework focused on outputs and did not provide a basis for
assessing progress towards the project’s development objectives. However, it should be noted
that the project design anticipated that PEFA assessments planned to monitor progress in PFM
reforms would fulfill this function.
(b)    Quality of Supervision: Moderately Satisfactory
The project was subject to close supervision from the start. Bank supervision missions visited the
country 3-4 times a year. The Bank placed a full-time extended-term consultant in the field to
support the project complemented by a strong headquarter-based team, including PFM and
procurement specialists. At the donors’ request, the TTL was transferred to Bishkek and took up
a field based assignment for over year to provide closer support in the period up to project
extension at the end of 2012. Detailed aide memoires were regularly shared with the client and
development partners regularly. Bank missions focused on key issues and their solutions and
recommendations for further project implementation. Between missions, the team supported the
daily work of the project by providing considerable advice and recommendations. While the
project task team leader was replaced three times, each hand-over had a transition period.
Dialogue between the team, donors and the Project Director and senior government officials was
open and productive. Significant efforts were made to encourage the creation of the high level
body to oversee the PFM reform effort. Sector and country management were also involved in
project implementation and the Implementation Support and Results Report (ISR) ratings appear
to have been realistic, signaling from the beginning the challenges to the project.
The decisions to seek for restructuring and extension of the project closing date were entirely
appropriate allowing the project to complete planned activities and disburse all funds. While no
formal project mid-term review took place, this was not a formal requirement for MDTF and the
team did engage in a thorough review of project progress in preparation for the 2012 project
extension. Furthermore the team used the opportunity to add important activities that responded
to the Government’s emerging priorities. While these shifted the project’s focus, this appears
justified given the failure of the parallel project that was intended to put in place an FMIS. The
new activities revitalized a failing project and restored its relevance to key stakeholders. While
the Bank team did not fundamentally restructure the results framework to include indicators that
better reflected the PDOs, the results framework was adjusted in line with changes in the project
scope, was regularly updated and was used as a basis for discussions with the Project Board.
(c)    Overall Bank Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The supervision team demonstrated the strengths of the Bank technical and country expertise,
commitment to project goals and the partner, and willingness to go to additional lengths to
ensure a successful project. However, its satisfactory performance cannot outweigh the design
deficiencies which hindered project implementation.


                                                38
5.2    Borrower Performance
(a)    Government Performance: Moderately Satisfactory
Government performance improved over the course of the project. There was a year-long delay
in project effectiveness owing to delays in the appointment of a project manager. Once properly
constituted, the project implementation team under the MOF proved to be highly effective and
dedicated. Although political instabilities in early years of project implementation did not allow
the government to get actively involved in project implementation, there was a generally high
level of government commitment and ownership during the later phases of project
implementation. The high-level Project Board and technical groups were established and they
provided active assistance in project implementation by discussing the terms of reference and
participating in procurement processes. The extent to which this ownership and commitment
extended down through the institutions is more difficult to assess. There were instances where
officials were unsure of the purpose of reforms, their roles and responsibilities and there were
instances where officials failed to cooperate with consultants. When identified, these issues were
addressed by the Project Director and Project Board.
(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Satisfactory
The project management team provided effective coordination for all project activities.
Requirements developed for project assignments were quite detailed and clear. The fiduciary
functions including procurement, financial management and disbursement were delegated to the
MoF PIU. The PIU was very effective in accomplishing all aspects of project management, such
as financial management, procurement arrangements, reporting activities, and disbursements.
Financial management. The financial management system including accounting, internal
controls and reporting was adequate and satisfactory to the Bank. Quarterly interim financial
reports were submitted on time and were acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement Arrangements. PIU performed procurement in full compliance with the Bank’s
procurement rules and requirements. The majority of contracts were subject to prior review
which always showed good quality of procurement documents. Four post-review procurement
supervision mission did not find any critical issues. In retrospect, the prior review requirements
were unnecessarily onerous.
Reporting Arrangements. The PIU submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in
promptly. Reports were of high quality providing valuable information on project progress. The
status of performance indicators were incorporated in all progress reports and served as valuable
input to Bank supervision mission reports.
(c)    Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory. The inadequacies of the original
project design, delays during the early period of implementation and frequent replacements of
the key project implementing staff are factors impacted on project implementation.
Nevertheless, the majority of project targets were met or partially met, which laid the foundation
for further reforms in PFM.
6.     Lessons Learned
The lessons learned are intended to inform the design of the follow-up CBPFM project.


                                                39
During the review of this ICR, donors highlighted the need for TF contributors should
synchronize the processes for signing of Administration Agreements to avoid delays. In 2009
due to the fact that some donors joined the project at a later stage requiring multiple amendments
to Administration Agreements, contributed to delays in project preparation and implementation
process.
Project institutional arrangements should address coordination and implementation requirements
within the implementing institutions to complement arrangements geared to coordination with
external partners. Coordination arrangements engaging implementing agencies’ management
would help avoid, identify and address instances where key stakeholders are not informed of
purpose of reforms, their roles and responsibilities and tackle implementation constraints as they
arise. Establishment of a robust management structure within the MoF and other key
stakeholders would mitigate the risks of staff turnover by distributing responsibility for
implementation across a wider range of staff.
The results framework for projects supporting PFM projects should be designed to support
decision making during implementation as well as end-of-project evaluation. PDO concepts such
as efficiency, effectiveness and accountability should be spelled out in terms of measurable
dimensions of PFM performance that are relevant in the country context. Intermediate outcomes
should include both performance measures and outputs that describe the regulatory and systems
improvements. Key milestones in the delivery of these outputs should be identified to facilitate
monitoring during implementation.
The results framework should not include results that are not within the scope of the project and
the risks associated with activities that are critical to the project should be identified and
mitigation measures put in place. In the case of the CBPFM – and follow-up project – two
project related activities stand out: first, approval of the Budget Code; second, the automation of
key budget processes. Delays in parliamentary approval of the Budget Code and the consequent
uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment for PFM have prevented the project finalizing a
number of outputs that were identified as intermediate outcomes. So too has failure of the
parallel GTAC project to complete automation of the financial management information system.
Project design should identify mitigation measures, such as alternative scenarios for project
activities, should these kinds of risks materialize.
The risks posed by frequent changes in the Government’s core team – gaps in project
implementation, lack of continuity and ownership – should be made explicit and mitigation
measures identified. It is unclear to what extent the Bank to resolve the underlying of the low
level of remuneration of Government officials and consultants relative to other market
opportunities. However, mitigation strategies might include offering of professional development
opportunities to attract staff and succession planning.
Flexibility to restructure project activities by responding to emerging opportunities can save a
failing project. The adjustment of the project during implementation to incorporate reforms in
public procurement, tax administration and revenue forecasting contributed to some of the
projects important achievements. This flexibility in implementation was a design strength. It
allowed the project to respond following the failure of the parallel FMIS project and restored the
client and donors’ confidence in the project and its relevance to the changing priorities of the
PFM reforms.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a)    Grantee/Implementing agencies
The MoF prepared a 61 page final report on the project. MoF overall assessment of the results
achieved with the support of the MDTF was positive. The recipient believes that capacities in
the MoF and line ministries were strengthened and the new regulations that were developed and
implemented have contributed to enhanced PFM and training management. Public access to
budget information has improved as a result of web-based access to the MoF portal. Public
procurement procedures were simplified and bidders can submit their proposals electronically.
Significant progress has been achieved in the areas of intergovernmental budget relations,
revenue forecasting and result-based budgeting. However, the Ministry believes that reforms
should be further implemented.
The report discusses the project progress by components. A detailed analysis of areas with lower
progress is also conducted. These areas include developing the Budget Code, implementing
MTBF, automation of budget processes, revenue forecasting, tax administration, capital
expenditure management, and accounting and reporting. Poor coordination between project
stake-holders and inadequate capacity and commitment in specific areas are among the reasons
for poor performance.
The report raises some problems related to design and implementation of the project. Indicators
developed by the project were process-oriented rather than result-based, which posed difficulties
in measuring the progress. Also, excessive amount of prior-review contracts in the project
procurement plan caused undesired delays in procurement process. The ministry believes that
small contracts under specified threshold should be subject to post-review, which would
contribute to smoother project implementation. The ministry also argues that lump-sum contracts
should be preferred to time-based ones, since compared with time-based contracts deliverables
are clearly specified in lump-sum contracts. Another issue that had a negative effect on project
implementation was the low wages of local consultants maintained by the government, which
limited opportunities to attract qualified staff.
In its final part, the report identifies challenges facing PFM reform and priority areas of future
reform. These areas include improving legal framework, public investment management, public
procurement, revenue administration, intergovernmental budget relations, public internal
financial control, accounting and reporting. A list of specific activities that should be included
into a new PFM capacity building project is provided in the report.
(b)    Cofinanciers/Donors
The co-financing partners did not provide written comments on the program. Representatives of
the EU and SECO, both key external partners, provided written comments on the ICR draft and
participated in the ICR decision meeting. They endorsed the ICR findings and ratings. They
requested that the ICR recognize the need for TF contributors to synchronize the processes for
signing of Administration Agreements as an important lesson learned to avoid delays in project
preparation and implementation.

                                      Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
The survey was completed in May 2015, conducted by a private consulting company funded by
the project, with 52 respondents drawn from the MoF and line ministries. The results were
largely positive in terms of the project’s impact.
The majority of respondents indicated positive changes in PFM but a slower than expected pace
of changes. They considered public procurement as an area that had shown the greatest
improvement as a result of strengthening institutional, legal and methodological frameworks as
well as enhancing transparency in procedures. In addition, the survey participants from the line
ministries particularly noted substantial progress in improving the budget preparation and putting
in place foundations for program budgeting, as well as strengthening the overall budgetary
processes and internal audit. The respondents saw political instability, lack of public awareness
and the economic crisis as negative factors hindering PFM reform, far more so than political
commitment.

The survey participants stressed that successful implementation of the PFM reform depended on
the automation of business processes; development of proper capacity, including through
continuous professional training; and proper incentives to civil servants to push reform. They
suggested that action should be taken to promote the interaction between different agencies
involved in PFM reform, strengthen the monitoring of PFM reform, raise public awareness of its
objectives and progress, and motivate different segments in society to engage in the reform
implementation. The respondents also argued that future reforms would need to address the
secretive mentality of civil servants, salary increases of civil servants should be linked to their
performance and citizens should be consulted in assessments of the public administration’s
performance.

Seventy three percent of the respondents believed that PFM reform would not have achieved its
outcomes without the MDTF project. Eight percent believed that PFM reform outcomes would
have been achieved even without the project. Respondents considered capacity building of civil
servants, improvements in the regulatory framework and the general progress in PFM reforms as
the most important achievements. Twenty seven respondents considered that the project did not
have an impact. Improvements in transparency, procedures and technical infrastructure were
identified as project impacts by less than ten percent of respondents.

Recommendations to the World Bank

international consultants that meet the requirements of the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Lessons Learned

Adaptation of procurement procedures for efficiency and effectiveness of the project
   We can learn from the past that long duration of procurement procedures as well as of coordination of
    one or another activity with the WB and the MoF was affecting the project schedule and
    implementation. In this regard, it was agreed with the WB on the transfer to “post review” procedures
    as it is required by the WB procedures in that hiring of local consultants (when the proposed contract
    amount does not exceed 50 000 USD) will be under post review procedures, only ToRs of proposed
    positions will be sent to WB for “No objection letter”. The procurement plan was updated accordingly

                                                   60
     based on the decision made on the application of the principle of a post-review (instead of a prior-
     review) of some packages by the World Bank, which significantly speeded up the process of decision
     making and contract signing. As a result, we can notice a noteworthy increase and enhancement of the
     human capacity and resources of the project which affected the project team efforts for the timely and
     effective achievement of the project objectives.
    Due to the big workload of the MoF management, key members of all tender committees it was
     suggested to change the membership of the tender committees, inclusion of heads of relevant
     departments in the tender committees of the project, and training of members of the tender committees.
     For the purpose of improvement of the procurement procedures and early decision making on tenders,
     amendments were introduced to the membership of the Tender Committees by the MoF order No. 82
     dated May 27 of 2013 with replacement of senior management by the middle management of the
     concerned MoF departments.

Effective liaison between the interested parties
During the implementation of the project we could observe the lack of understanding, coordination and
support for the promotion of PFM reforms between the major stakeholders/ interested parties of the project.
As you know effective communication and controlled development of the project is the crucial element for
the realization of reforms through the constructive dialogue and team work. For the purposes of
improvement of the coordination and shared responsibility of the progress in the PFM reforms, the CB PFM
Project initiated the issuance of the MoF Order No. 81 dated May 27 of 2013 on re-approval of the structure
of the CB PFM Project Technical Boards on budget issues and internal audit and establishment of a
Technical Board on capacity building of staff. According to this adopted Order the heads of structural
subdivisions of the MoF have undertaken the personal responsibility for implementation the Project
Logframe Indicators for the effective implementation of PFM reforms. Moreover, as PEFA 2014
assessment was to be launched, the MoF initiated an establishment of the working group on preparation
and conducting the PEFA assessment as per the MoF order #132 dated August 5, 2014 and MoF Order
#140 dated August 18, 2014 where there was assigned a responsibility for the MoF management and heads
of the respective divisions of the MoF for the timely and quality provision of necessary materials and
implementation of the corresponding PEFA indicators.

Result-based project implementation
Projects are driven by the deliverables they are meant to produce. For this reason all the project management
activities (including planning) should be product focused rather than work based, since it should be the
required product that dictates the necessary activity and not vice versa. Moreover, the definition and
understanding of a product’s specification (including its quality and/or acceptance criteria) promote a much
higher understanding of what is required and improve the chances of a successful project. In this connection
we could learn that:
     Lump-sum contracts should be preferred to the time-based contracts as it turns out to be risky and
         difficult to measure the time spent by the consultants during the implementation of the assignment
         and it makes no use if the result is not achieved. At the same time in awarding “limp-sum” contracts
         there shall be a more thorough monitoring from a beneficiary at the stage of implementation, as
         well as the tasks shall be clearly stated in order to eliminate the possibility of receiving a product
         not corresponding to the expectations.
     As it occurs in various development projects the efforts of the stakeholders and the project staff
         may sometimes put in the recurrent activities and business processes related with them rather on
         the end products. Within this there is a lack of a result-based approach. The possible solution for it
         could be a delivery of the respective trainings for the stakeholders and the project management staff
         and coordinators of the respective components on the effective and result-based project
         management and implementation of the project.


                                                      61
Lack of qualified consultants
It is important to mention the difficulty in building a team of highly qualified and competent local
experts/consultants in view of the high qualification requirements versus law salaries to be awarded in
accordance with the Government Decree of the KR dated June 30, 2011 N 348. Based on the project
experience we could observe the problem of hiring of qualified and knowledgeable specialists which most
of the times slowed down the project implementation and affected the achievement of the project objectives.
The possible solution for this could be the introduction of the amendments into the respective Government
Decree on the changes of the salary to be awarded to the local experts.

New Challenges for PFM Reform
The priority areas of PFM reform are:
         Improvement of the budget process: the formation and execution of the budget in accordance
            with the policies, procedures, automation of the planning and execution of the budget, control
            of revenues and expenses during the year, FMIS, unified treasury account;
         Budget transparency, strengthening of interaction of the MoF with the civil society and the
            public;
