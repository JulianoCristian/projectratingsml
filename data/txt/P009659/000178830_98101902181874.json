In all, some 45,000 farmers will\n            be able to expand their output of food and commercial crops.\n            The annual increase in production is estimated at full\n            development at about 247,000 tons of foodgrains, 50,000 tons\n            of seed cotton, 23,000 tons of groundnuts, 400,000 tons of\n            sugarcane and 215,000 tons of bananas."}, "docdt": "1972-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
