Under the\n            project, wells and lift irrigation to be provided are\n            expected to irrigate some 100,000 ha, while land development\n            will be carried out on six major irrigation schemes with a\n            command area of 175,000 ha. In all, some 45,000 farmers will\n            be able to expand their output of food and commercial crops.\n            The annual increase in production is estimated at full\n            development at about 247,000 tons of foodgrains, 50,000 tons\n            of seed cotton, 23,000 tons of groundnuts, 400,000 tons of\n            sugarcane and 215,000 tons of bananas."}, "docdt": "1972-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
