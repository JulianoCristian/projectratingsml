The Sugar Industry Restructuring and\n            Privatization Project in Guyana. In 1990, the Bank's\n            Country Assistance Strategy for Guyana emphasized the need\n            for reducing severe fiscal and external imbalances and\n            encouraging private sector development. The project sought\n            to maintain sugar production at its present level, with the\n            unstated goal of restoring Guyana's ability to fill its\n            export quota with the European Union. It also sought to\n            ensure the technical and financial viability of the industry\n            through restructuring and privatization of Guyana Sugar\n            Company (GUYSUCO). The project's components consisted\n            of (a) a two-year capital investment program and (b)\n            technical assistance to prepare GUYSUCO for privatization.\n            The project outcome was unsatisfactory. Both preparation\n            assistance and International Development Association (IDA)\n            appraisal were rated deficient. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            very sound. The key lessons to be learned from the project\n            are as follows: (a) the justification for committing scarce\n            IDA resources to privatization projects needs to be examined\n            closely; (b) IDA efforts to support privatization should\n            more appropriately be part of an Adjustment and Policy\n            Reform Operation with TA instead of an investment project;\n            (c) bringing publicly-owned enterprises under private\n            management may lead to large efficiency gains; and (d) a\n            privatization strategy needs to be properly sequenced."}, "docdt": "1997-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
