The project targets\n            the communes with the poorest and most vulnerable\n            populations, principally focusing on communes attempting to\n            reintegrate relatively high numbers of refugees and\n            internally displaced persons. In general the legislative\n            framework provides for monetary compensation. The land to be\n            expropriated is mainly uninhabited so that compensation\n            needed will be minimal and determined by experts.\n            Beneficiaries of cultivated land will determine its use by\n            community consensus. During the outbreak of civil war,\n            displaced populations temporarily occupied community\n            infrastructures; if similar circumstances arise, the state\n            and nongovernmental organizations are sufficiently prepared\n            to respond to the situation. Land owners who have their\n            water supply diverted will either be compensated monetarily\n            or with land exchanged at a cost that covers the cost of\n            reinstallation. Where major technical constraints would\n            affect the surrounding community, their consensus will be\n            required. Generally, in order to be compensated, project\n            affected persons do not have to be holders of title. All\n            persons who have a right of title because of customary law,\n            or all persons conducting an activity tied to the\n            expropriated land, have a right to compensation at the same\n            level as those whom the State licensed to carry out that\n            activity. The plan also provides for conflict management in\n            the case of conflicts over the choice of sites and over expropriation."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
