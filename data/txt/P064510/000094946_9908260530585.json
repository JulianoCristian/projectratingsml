groups working in unison. The project supports the\n            objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy, in that it\n            will provide employment among poor rural communities,\n            infrastructure will be restored, and, social services\n            delivery will be expanded. The main components will : 1)\n            promote community investments, increasing community capacity\n            to select, finance, and operate local investments. This will\n            improve social stability, and mobilize communities towards\n            common interests and choices. In addition, investments in\n            infrastructure rehabilitation and construction, will help\n            restore community services. Appropriate investments in\n            health and nutrition, will target, specifically, young\n            children and mothers, and will include early child\n            development activities; and, 2) strengthen the statistical\n            capacity for monitoring poverty reduction, and help build a\n            social basis for peace at the local level."}, "docdt": "1999-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
