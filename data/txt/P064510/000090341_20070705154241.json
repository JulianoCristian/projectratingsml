Lessons learned\n            included: (a) community participation can ensure ownership\n            by the communities of the whole approach and process,\n            including community mobilization and the selection of\n            sub-projects, the monitoring of construction and the\n            subsequent operation and maintenance of infrastructure; (b)\n            in an emergency and civil conflict context, there is a need\n            for simplicity of project design for delivering urgently\n            needed support quickly, taking into account the limited\n            local capacity for project execution; (c) during a civil\n            conflict, it is essential for the implementing agency to\n            maintain good relations with all stakeholders in order to\n            implement sub-projects; (d) in a post conflict phase, there\n            is the potential to work with local governments, if these\n            are established; (e) a social fund can mobilize communities\n            to work with the formal health and education structures to\n            supply social services, rather than limit itself to bricks\n            and mortar; (f) The use of qualified NGOs and other entities\n            to work as Agences d'Encadrement has enabled\n            Twitezimbere to carry out the community mobilization in\n            almost the whole country in a relatively short period of\n            time; (g) early child development activities can be\n            undertaken in rural areas at a low cost provided that\n            implementation arrangements are based on community\n            participation and emphasize proximity aspects; (h) the\n            design of a monitoring component for a social fund project\n            will ensure that only competent organizations are recruited\n            for implementation; (i) subcontracting was a challenge due\n            to limited NGO capacity and administrative requirements; (j)\n            The Bank should have taken early action to design proper\n            indicator to monitor poverty; and (k) This type of project\n            may be a key contributor to improved development outcomes s\n            in a difficult situation."}, "docdt": "2006-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
