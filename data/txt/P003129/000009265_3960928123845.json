    improving extension on a large scale in Zaire. The pilot\n            would consist of : 1) strengthened management of extension\n            services, 2) training of extension staff, 3) adaptive\n            research, 4) the establishment of monitoring and evaluation\n            units, and 5) studies. The benefits of this project would\n            include: increased farmer income and productivity, increased\n            agricultural production and domestic food supplies, and\n            improved efficiency of field extension services. The project\n            is expected to cover half a million farm families, or 15 %\n            of the total farming population of Zaire. It will also have\n            a critical impact on the environment, and on farm women."}, "docdt": "1990-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
