MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Zaire -
Pilot Extension Project (Cr. 2096-ZR)
Attached are Parts I and III of the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Zaire Pilot Extension
project (Cr. 2096-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not contribute a Part II.
This was a three-year pilot project which attempted to harmonize, and improve the efficiency of,
the different approaches to agricultural extension used by various government and non-government
entities in Zaire. The eventual objective was to enhance agricultural production and farmer welfare. A
Training and Visit (T&V) model was used, but, rather than rely solely on the government bureaucracy,
parastatal and private non-governmental organizations (NGOs) under contract to the National Extension
Service were used as executing agencies wherever possible. Despite a deteriorating political and
economic environment and severe shortages in counterpart funding, especially during the second half of
the project, the pilot project satisfactorily met its limited objectives. Three factors appear to have
contributed to the result: (a) clear commitment to the project concept by all agencies involved and
therefore, effective implementation; (b) provision of simple agronomic recommendations (mostly for the
dominant food crops) which were relevant to farmer circumstances; and (c) intensive Bank staff
assistance/supervision.
The institutional arrangements envisaged in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were developed,
but the breakdown in funding arrangements makes their continuation unlikely. This pilot was relatively
narrow in its objectives, and did not provide an adequate basis for a long term, sustainable strategy for
extension service organization in Zaire. The project's institutional development impact was, therefore,
rated as negligible. Many of the improved agronomic practices which are reported to have been adopted
by farmers are likely to be maintained as they represent improved use of existing resources without
increased risk. However, the project has not demonstrated a sustainable and comprehensive service
system which will be able to meet the needs of farmers as they progress past simple agronomic
improvements. This, and the fiscal constraints affecting the services, make the sustainability of the
project outcome unlikely.
The PCR is unsatisfactory. It provides scant information on the use of local agencies as
extension service contractors, which is the project's most novel feature. The evaluation component of
the pilot was not implemented so that at the end of the project there was little reliable data available for
analysis. Nevertheless, the simplistic ERR exercise in the PCR is not credible; it is based on "observed"
yields on small demonstration plots, with national yield estimates (from a 1988 Sector Memorandum)
used in the "without project" situation. The calculation of service cost per farmer is incorrectly
calculated and hence cannot be compared with the cost estimate in the SAR.
In view of the deterioration in the economic, political and institutional conditions in Zaire, an
audit is not planned. Should conditions improve and the intended follow-on project be implemented, this
pilot phase could eventually be included with an audit of that project.

PILOT EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 2096-ZR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Pilot Extension Project, for
which Credit 2096-ZR, in the amount of US$5.9 million (SDR 4.6 million), was approved
on February 27, 1990. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1993, after a one year
extension. The last disbursement took place on November 21, 1993 and the undisbursed
balance of SDR 1.25 million (US$1.6 million equivalent) was canceled on December 31,
1993. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) provided parallel financing for
several project activities in the amount of US$4.3 million.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture and Environment Operations Division of
the Central Africa and Indian Ocean Department, Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). This report is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report,
the Development Credit Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, project progress reports, internal Bank memoranda. On August
30, 1994, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II.
No comments have been received to date.

PILOT EXTENSION PROJECT
(Credit 2096-ZR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    After years of unsuccessful attempts to define a national extension strategy, the
Government of Zaire sought donor (Bank and UNDP) support in 1990 for testing the
replicability and the sustainability of a simple system of organization and management
focused on extension and adaptive research, in order to increase small farm productivity,
and thus production.
Project Objectives
2.    The project was to be the first phase of a longer term program, aimed at
investigating the impact of improved extension on farmers' income and production, and the
possibility of improving extension on a large scale in Zaire. It was intended to test the
replicability and sustainability of a simple system of organization and management focused
on extension and adaptive research.  It targeted strengthening the management of the
extension service, to cover about 500,000 farm families (15% of the total farming
population of Zaire) by the third year of the project and to improve the linkages between
extension and research. Funds were also provided for staff training.
Implementation
3.    Project start-up.  Directly following the identification/preparation mission in
December 1988, project activities were launched in three pilot areas. In time to influence
the March/April 1989 planting season, resources were mobilized from ongoing projects.
Implementation continued while the project was processed within the Bank and it was only
in November, 1990 that the credit became effective. By that time, arrangements were
already being made to increase the number of pilot areas from three to five.
4.    The credit was declared effective on November 15, 1990. In-country capacity to
manage a large scale extension system has been demonstrated, thanks particularly to
regular training and constant field supervision. Extension messages which focused on
simple, low cost and low risk farming practices, were well received and adopted by the
farmers.   Research-extension linkages were developed through monthly training,
programming meetings, demonstration plots and trials (including agroforestry). However,
the monitoring and evaluation system was overly complex and did not provide reliable
statistical information of project impact.



iv                                                              Evaluation Summary
5.    A national extension policy document defining the role of the national extension
service and methodology including research and development was prepared, but has not yet
been published by the Government. Preparation of a national follow-on project, drawing
on the experience of the pilot operation (regular training and supervision, solid linkage
between research, extension and farmers, clear job descriptions of subject matter specialists
and researchers) was initiated by the Government in 1992. Disbursements were suspended
on June 15, 1993, because of the country falling in arrears with the Bank. Government
counterpart funds and the loss of project equipment and material during the 1991 riots were
the main constraints to project implementation in the later stages.
6.    Actual project costs were US$9.98 million (US$11.59 million estimated). IDA
contributed US$4.65 million (US$5.90 estimated). UNDP contributed US$4.33 million
(US$4.09 estimated); and Government contributed US$1.01 million (US$1.60 estimated).
Project results
7.    The project succeeded in developing a well managed extension service. Project
staff acquired, through training and regular supervision, the know-how to enable the SNV
to provide the technical advice to the extension agents. The management of the extension
service and the capacities of extension staff were improved.  Confidence has been
reestablished in the relations between extension agents and farmers, who adopt not only the
extension themes but also the agents themselves into their fanning community. At least
20% of farmers' contact groups in each extension pilot area have adopted entirely or
partially new technologies. This success is based on extension work with appropriate
technical themes in crop production, seed multiplication, soil fertility and conservation,
agroforestry and on-farm participatory trials. The technical messages came from improved
relations with the National Institute for Agricultural Research and Studies, the National
Seeds Service, the Ministry of Environment/Forestry and some NGOs.
8.    In 1993, about 280,000 farm families participated in extension activities throughout
the country organized in some 14,300 extension contact-groups (40% of which were
women); 15,600 demonstration plots (on-farm trials sites) were installed and more than
7,000 women participated in specific activities (nutritional education, post harvest
technology, storage and simple food processing). With indirect effects, some 600,000
farmers are estimated to have benefited from improved techniques introduced by the
project.
9.    The economic rate of return was estimated at 22 percent at appraisal. From the
limited existing data, an attempt was made to calculate the actual economic rate of return.
Based on a conservative assumption of a 20 percent adoption rate of farmer contact groups
in 1993 and using similar assumptions to those used in the SAR, in respect to other items,
the economic rate of return is estimated at 34 percent based on benefit and cost streams for
only 4 years. Details are given in Table 14, Part III.



Evaluation Summary                                                                    v
Sustainability
10.   In spite of the remarkable performance of the project and its "survival capacity',
sustainability will be severely jeopardized by the present macro-economic and political
environment. In the absence of funds to pay for salaries, field allowances and training and
supervision expenses, it is unlikely that the benefits of the project can be sustained for
long. UNDP is considering the provision of bridge financing.
Lessons Learned
11.   Among the lessons that can be drawn from the project, are the following:
(a)    Successful extension  work  does not depend  on  magic formulae or
complicated studies but on hard work and dedicated staff, together with: (i)
good ideas based on real "needs" identified together farmers and on real
low-cost solutions; (ii) a well-designed strategy for introduction and
demonstration of new technologies; (iii) sound organization and
management; and (iv) regular and efficient supervision.
(b)    Change in the role of field agents is attained by a clear definition by field
agents themselves of their role as conduits between farmers and research.
(c)    Cost of extension. Extension can be implemented at a relatively low cost
and yield, at least initially, high returns. In 1993, the cost was less than
US$5.00 per participating farmer. The rate of return for the four project
years alone is estimated at about 34 percent.

Sub-sector               Extension and Applied Research
2.    Background
2.1   At the time of project preparation in 1989/1990, agriculture provided direct and
indirect employment to approximately 82 percent of the economically active population.
Three to four million farm families, of whom at least 80 percent were traditional
smallholders practicing slash-and-burn techniques, produced mostly foodcrops (cassava,
maize, rice, plantain, groundnuts and beans) providing about 60 percent of the agricultural
output. The remainder came from large plantations that produced mainly for export: palm
oil, rubber, coffee, and cocoa. The political upheavals of the 1960s, the nationalization
policy in the mid-1970s and the neglect of rural infrastructure resulted in a drastic decline
of farm productivity. As a result, exports declined and imports increased to meet the needs
of a rapidly growing population.
2.2   Zaire's Government extension services lacked scientific training and logistic
support, and had a poor image with farmers, because they were used by local authorities to
impose compulsory planting and cropping practices, levy taxes and exact penalties. As a
result, donor-financed projects, agro-industries and non-government organizations (NGOs)
developed their own extension systems, with only limited lasting impact on overall
agricultural production.  In 1988, the Government, IDA and UNDP/FAO agreed to
organize a joint mission to take a fresh look at the issues in an attempt to define a national
extension policy.  The mission recommended launching immediately pilot extension
operations in the three areas visited (Kikwit, Gemena and Bumba). During the 1989
cropping season, farmers in these areas established thousands of adoption plots according
to the recommendations of the extension staff and achieved considerably higher yields.
Farmers and extension agents showed new, keen interest in interacting to try the improved

methods. The Government was strongly supportive of the pilot activities. The experience
gained during this phase was used in the design of the project.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The resulting project was a three-year pilot aimed at extending the activities
initiated in 1989 to larger areas such as Kananga. Mbuji-Mayi and Kabinda, to test the
impact of improved extension on farmers' income and production under a variety of
conditions, and the possibility of improving extension on a large scale in Zaire. Within
three years, the pilot was designed to start operations in about 10 pilot areas and benefit
about half a million farm families, representing 15 percent of the total farming population
of Zaire.
3.2   The project had the following components:
(a)   strengthening  the management of extension  services to  improve  the
efficiency of and to harmonize extension systems administration.  This
included: (i) planning field visits and training schedules; (ii) selecting active
and representative farmer groups; (iii) supervising field agents and trainers;
(iv) coordinating extension activities and their interaction with research
activities and (v) supervising and administering the overall services.
(b)   training of extension staff (induction seminars, regular training, monthly
seminars for subject matter specialists and visits to experimental sites).
(c)    adaptive research (field diagnoses, establishment of experimental plots).
(d)   establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems (setting up a monitoring
and evaluation unit, establishment of a farmer sampling system, collection
and processing of data on the adoption of messages and on the impact of
extension).
(e)   studies (study on the impact of the project and its costs; to prepare a future
follow-up project and special studies on the viability and ecological impact
of the use of agricultural inputs).
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1    The project was designed to test the replicability and sustainability of a simple
system of organization and management focused on extension and adaptive research. It
had to test approaches adapted to Zaire which included three features: (i) harmonization of
extension systems used by NGOs and Government services; (ii) reliance on existing



Part 1: Project Review from the Bank's Perspective                              3
institutions (the project was tailored to specific local conditions and was to be executed
whenever possible through local initiative); and (iii) lightweight administration and
management. Under the aegis of the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD), a small unit in Kinshasa was responsible for implementation. The project was to
serve as a basis for a larger follow-on project drawing on its experience.
4.2   The National Extension Service (SNV) was to sub-contract the execution of project
activities to local entities and/or to organize and support Government field services in the
absence of such local entities. The SNV was to be represented in pilots areas by extension
coordinators.  A steering committee regrouping representatives of various interested
Ministries (including research) was to be established to review national extension activities.
4.3   Cofinancing in the amount of US$4.09 million was to be provided by UNDP/FAO
(UNDP/FAO ZAI 83/003), in support of the following activities: training of headquarters
and field staff, technical assistance and some equipment.
5.    Project Implementation
A.    General
5.1   Macro-Economic Environment. Since early-1990, political instability has been
accompanied by declining production, investment and fiscal mobilization, unrestrained
public spending financed by monetary creation, resulting in hyper-inflation and currency
depreciation, raising current account deficits and mounting external arrears.   This
accelerated the loss of Zaire's creditworthiness and investors' confidence, the rapid
degradation of the country's productive assets and infrastructure (which were seriously
damaged during the 1991 and 1993 riots), and the decline in living standards and social
indicators.
5.2   Credit effectiveness. The credit was declared effective on November 15, 1990,
eight months after the signing date due to delays in obtaining the legal opinion and
ratification of the credit agreement.
5.3   Project Cost and Financing. Actual costs amounted to US$9.9 million against
US$11.5 million estimated (86 percent).  UNDP contributed US$4.3 million against
US$4.1 million estimated (95 percent). Government contributed US$1.0 million against
US$1.6 million estimated (63 percent); and IDA contributed US$4.6 million against
US$5.9 million estimated (78 percent). The main reasons for lower than estimated costs
were insufficient Government counterpart funding during the last two years of project
implementation and suspension of the IDA Credit in mid-1993 because of the country
falling in arrears with the Bank.
5.4   Procurement. Procurement was carried out in compliance with Bank guidelines,
albeit with some delays at an early stage because project staff was unfamiliar with IDA



4                                         Part 1: Project Review from the Bank's Perspective
procurement procedures. About sixty vehicles and an important quantity of materials and
equipment were lost during the civil disturbances of September-October 1991 while
awaiting customs clearance (vehicles) and shipment to the pilot sub-regions (equipment and
materials). The vehicles and equipment were not replaced.
5.5   Disbursement. In general, disbursements proceeded well. However, on occasion,
in the face of delayed or insufficient Government counterpart funding, the Special Account
was used to fund Government's share of some expenditures. IDA only reimbursed its
proportion of these expenses and, in spite of reminders, the difference was never made up
by the Government. Following the riots of 1991, the special account was reduced from
US$250,000 to US$100,000 in early 1992.  The final disbursement took place on
November 21, 1993. The undisbursed balance of SDR 1,252,897.18 (US$1.6 million
equivalent) was canceled at closing on December 31, 1993.
B.   Individual Project Components
5.6   Both supervision and independent review  missions found field results to be
outstanding despite the adverse socio-economic environment which prevailed during the
1991-1993 period. Shortage of Government counterpart funds and the loss of project
equipment and materials during the 1991 riots were the main constraints to project
implementation.
Strengthening the management of extension services
5.7   The extension service introduced a system of organization and management which
was based on the principles of the training and visit system (T&V) but included specific
features to take account of local conditions:
(a)   A flexible design with only a core staff based permanently at headquarters
and 2-3 persons in the regional coordination units. These units, supported
by ad-hoc missions from headquarters (Kinshasa) provided methodology and
training in extension management, coordination between the executing
agencies, and monitoring and evaluation of operational results and impacts.
(b)   The field work was organized and delivered by executing agencies operating
in the areas, through renewable contractual agreements. These agencies
(sub-regional inspectorates of MARD, parastatal joint venture companies,
NGOs,  other  donor-financed  projects)  managed  their  structures
independently and paid the basic salaries of their own personnel. They
received supervision and training from SNV and funding to carry out the
extension work along an agreed methodology and organizational lines.
(c)   Contact farmer groups were used instead of contact farmers.



Part 1: Project Review from the Bank's Perspective                              5
5.8   Extension messages focused on existing simple, low-cost and low-risk farming
practices. These included: (i) cultivation methods: optimal plant density, planting dates,
seed spacing, depth of sowing, number of seeds per hole, seed conservation and
arrangements for mixed cropping; (ii) agricultural resource management: crop rotations
and associations, integration of livestock and cropping, agroforestry, and composting of
crop with weed residues and livestock manure; and (iii) post-harvest technology: storage
and simple food processing, and starting in 1992, seed production by farmers and farmers'
groups. Introduction of technical messages for livestock husbandry envisaged at appraisal
(animal nutrition, simple animal health measures and recycling manure) did not take place
because emphasis was put on foodcrop messages during the first stage of the project. The
project also undertook trials on soybean inoculum.   Results were mixed and the
sustainability of this technique is uncertain since farmers subsequently have to depend on
an external source for input supply.
5.9   In an attempt to ensure satisfactory and timely contribution of funds from
Government, the original project design envisaged payment of local allowances and project
supervision activities by Government. It was anticipated that the importance of these two
components would encourage MARD to provide the necessary funds from the annual
budget. In the event, in spite of a high level of political commitment for the project (the
1992 commitment was about US$770,000 or 48 percent of the full project contribution),
the effects of the liquidity problems faced by all Government agencies and galloping
inflation were too great. IDA eventually agreed to the use of Credit funds to enable the
project to meet the necessary allowances and supervision expenses.
Training of extension staff
5.10  Project design called for staff training through induction and regular seminars inside
and outside the country. The UNDP/FAO financed most of the local training and short-
term external training. The Bank financed monthly workshops and local visits in Zaire,
together with some overseas travel for key project staff to compare experiences in other
African countries using similar extension systems. Shortage of means of transportation
posed a constraint to subject matter specialists and supervisory staff.
5.11  The training program was efficiently carried out and a large number of staff at
every level received considerable training. Between 1989 and 1993 the SNV organized, in
addition to the fortnightly training and the monthly workshops (20,000 man-days/year),
416 regional and national training courses for 7,414 extension staff and 2,039 researchers,
subject matter specialists and sector chiefs. In 1993, more than 1,000 hours were devoted
to training women in specific themes (e.g. nutritional education). However, due to lack of
transportation, participation in fortnightly training and monthly workshops was irregular
(about 47 percent). A considerable quantity of training material was produced (about 50
technical bulletins) but only a small number were actually used.

Adaptive research
5.12 Research-extension linkages have been developed and were a key element in
contributing to project results. These linkages were assured through monthly training,
programming meetings, demonstration plots and agroforestry trials. A total of 73,749
demonstration plots and 1,782 observation plots were established between 1989-1993. The
number of researchers varied between pilot areas. Attempts were made to reallocate
researchers to those areas where there were staffing deficiencies, with mixed success.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13 Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) only partially met appraisal objectives.
The system that was initially introduced was overly complex. Information on the main
project activities and results was not systematically gathered, analyzed and shared with
project management. Although some data existed in the SNV annual report, there were no
reliable statistical data on project imnpact indicators (adoption rates, yields and incremental
production).  This part of the M&E is still weak.  Many studies were, however,
undertaken (under FAO financing) describing the farming-system of each region, but little
was done in terms of an impact evaluation.
Studies
5.14 Preparation of a national follow-on project, drawing on the experience of the pilot
phase was started by the Government in 1992. The first draft was ready at the time the
Bank suspended its operations in Zaire in July 1993. Studies on the assessment of the
impact of improved extension on farmers' incomes and the welfare of the rural population,
including women and children, were not carried out. In spite of considerable preparatory
work, a study on the role of women in the extension service was not undertaken. A
national extension policy document was prepared in April 1992 which defines the role of
the national extension service and methodology including research and development, but
has still not been officially published by the Government. This policy statement would
facilitate and strengthen SNV collaboration with other structures responsible for research
and extension.
6.    Project Results
6.1   In-country  capacity  to manage  a large  scale extension  system  has been
demonstrated. Features of this capacity include: (i) regular training focusing on relevant
technical messages; (ii) constant and regular field supervision visits which result in a
continuous flow of information and efficient managerial control and (iii) staff's clear
understanding that the transformation of traditional farming systems is based on a better
use of the resources already available to farmers (labor, land, existing crops and tools),
before turning to superior technology requiring cash outlays.



Part 1. Project Review from the Bank's Perspective                            7
6.2   Results were good despite the perturbing events of September 1991 and January
1993. The project successfully improved the management of extension services, and the
capacities of extension staff through continuous training promoted regular and constant
field supervision visits and established better relations between the agricultural research and
extension services.  A sound extension service was established at a cost of less than
US$5.00 per farm household. This figure is a fraction of that incurred under earlier IDA-
financed integrated rural development projects in Zaire (about US$70 and US$520 per
household respectively for the Smallholder Maize Project (Credit 1040-ZR) and the
Livestock Development Project (Credit 1325-ZR)).  Original projections in the SAR
envisaged a cost of US$6.40 per farm family.
6.3   A new confidence has been established in the relations between extension agents
and farmers, who adopt not only the extension themes but also the agents themselves into
their farming community. This is the result of extension work with appropriate technical
themes in crop production, seed multiplication, soil fertility and conservation, agroforestry
and on-farm participatory trials. The technical messages were developed by the National
Institute for Agricultural Research (INERA), National Seeds Service (SENASEM), the
Ministry of Environment/Forestry and some NGOs.
6.4   About 280,000 farm families participated in extension activities throughout the
country in 1993, organized in some 14,300 extension contact-groups and served by some
1,350 extension agents; 15,600 demonstration plots (on-farm trials sites) were installed;
more than 7,000 women farmers participated in training on activities traditionally the
domain for women (post-harvest technology, storage and simple food processing). With
indirect effects included, about 600,000 farmers are estimated to have benefited from
improved techniques disseminated by the project.
6.5   Alongside the regular production themes, technical themes in agroforestry and soil
conservation were adopted faster than expected in the savannas of the Bandundu and Kasai
and the hillsides of Kivu (about 175 new woodlots in the Kikwit area, 2,000 farmers
engaged in stone-dikes and hedge planting in the Kivu, soil fertility improving plants were
introduced in the maize production cycle in the Kasai).
6.6  Improved technical messages increased yield and foodcrop production.  In five
major extension sites (Kikwit, Gemena/Bumba, Yangambi, Matadi and Sud-Kivu), cassava
yields increased by at least 40 percent and maize by 125 percent, whereas the increase in
rice yields was 121 percent and groundnut yields increased by 100 percent. The adoption
of new cultivation methods is resulting in changes in the traditional division of tasks
between men and women. Men have begun to perform tasks traditionally reserved for
women, such as sowing and weeding.

7.    Economic Rate of Return
7.1   The economic rate of return was estimated at 22 percent at appraisal. From the
limited existing data, an attempt was made to calculate the actual economic rate of return.
Based on a conservative assumption of a 20 percent adoption rate of farmer contact groups
in 1993 and using similar assumptions to those used in the SAR, in respect to other items,
the economic rate of return is estimated at 34 percent based on benefit and cost streams for
only 4 years. Details are given in Table 14, Part III.
8.    Sustainability
8.1  In spite of the remarkable performance of the project and its "survival capacity",
sustainability will be severely jeopardized by the present macro-economic and political
environment. In the absence of funds to pay for salaries, field allowances and training and
supervision expenses, it is unlikely that the benefits of the project can be sustained for
long. UNDP is considering the provision of bridge financing.
9.    Bank Performance
9.1   From the outset, the Bank provided close and regular field supervision throughout
the project cycle (identification-implementation) from the country resident mission
(Agricultural Country Officer and a Bank extension specialist). Other Bank support was
provided from headquarters and the East-African regional mission in Nairobi.  This
intensive supervision contributed considerably to early start-up. It was in their role as
facilitator in project workshops that Bank supervision missions made a particularly
significant input.
10.   Cooperation with Co-Financiers and Government
10.1 The cooperation between UNDP/FAO and Bank was satisfactory and productive;
the UNDP/FAO technical assistance team accepted to introduce the training and visit
extension management system and support to the project from the FAO Principal Technical
Advisor was strong and positive. While FAO supported training component produced
good results, data collection and project impact analysis under the M&E component was
weak.  Government-Bank relations deteriorated when the director of extension was
replaced without consultation in mid-1993.

11.   Performance of the Borrower
11. 1 Good working relations were established between the project and INERA,
SENASEM, the Ministry of Environment/Forestry and several NGOs.  Government
provided adequate financial and political support at initial stages as the project started to
produce good results. However, despite growing political commitment, demonstrated by a
commitment of US$770,000 of Government in the 1992 budget, Government failed to
provide counterpart funds in a timely manner despite many assurances. The project team
in Kinshasa provided close and regular field supervision which highly contributed to the
success of the project.
12.   Performance of the Consultants
12.1 The Bank provided facilitators for extension in M&E workshops based in Kinshasa
(Zaire) for a total of about three staff weeks. Post-workshop evaluation reports indicated
that this support was highly appreciated and successful. The UNDP/FAO project provided
two long-term consultants (Principal Technical Adviser and M&E/training specialist). The
ability of the Principal Technical Advisor to fit into the structure of the SNV contributed to
the success of the project. The M&E/training specialist succeeded in adapting less well to
the project and pursued too complex a system of M&E, resulting in poor results. A local
auditing firm introduced a sound computerized central accounts system. Auditing firms
performed satisfactorily in general with the exception of the 1991 audit for which further
work was requested by IDA on the accounts of executing agencies.
13.   Documentation
13.1  Implementation reports (feasibility studies, supervision and annual reports) of the
project were available throughout the project period. The annual report for 1993 was
underway at the time of PCR preparation in April 1994.

*     Increase in production for maize, rice, groundnut and cassava was that obtained
in demonstration plots (on-farm trials sites). However, average increase in
production in farms who have adopted the SNV new technology for these crops
was likely to be lower than that from  demonstration plots.  For cotton,
estimated yields at SAR were used because of lack of data.  Whereas, for
coffee, no incremental yield due to the project was noticed since the SNV did
not provide new technical themes on coffee.
