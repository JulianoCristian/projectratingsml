MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSRUCTON AND DEVELOPME
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO SLOVAK TELECOMMUNCATIONS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC
FOR A TELECOAMNICATIONS PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to Slovak Telecommunications (ST) for US$55 million equivalent with the
Guaratee of the Slovak Republic. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD tnrms
with a 17-year matrity and would help finance a telecommunications project.
2.          Backgrund. Slovalda is a country of 5.3 million people with a per capita
income of appoximately US$1900 in 1992. Slovalia became an independent country after
the break-up of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic on December 31, 1992. The
dissolution of the Federation took place smoothly and was accompanied by a series of
negotiated agreements on monetary policy, a customs union, the division of publicly-owned
assets and liabilities, and on the treatment of intenation  and domestic obligations. Two
principles guided the division of public prperty - temtoriality for immovable property and
the ratio of population in each Republic for property that is divisible.
3.          Slovalia became a member in the World Bank as a successor state to the
Czechoslovak Federation on January 1, 1993. The World Bank's Stucural Adjustment
Loan to the former Czechoslovalia was divided in the ratio 2:1. A Country Economic
Memorandum iS currently being prepared by the World Bank for Slovakia.
4.          Economic Situation. Slova's economic development was heavily
influenced by the imposition of Soviet-style cental planning. Before World War II, the
economy was primarily rural and much poorer than the neighborng Czech lands. The
communist Government, beginning in 1948, pushed strongly for rapid industialiion in
Slovakia to achieve convergence of incomes within the Federation. Slovaia's per capita
income rose from around 60% of that in the Czech lands in 1948 to nearly 80% in 1968, and
reached near parity in the 1970s. Slovakia's share of towal Czechoslovak industial
production increased from 8% before World War I to about 30% in the 1990s. This large-
scale indutriaon of the Slovak economy was financed in part through transfers from the
Federation and relied heavily on markets in the former Soviet Union.
5.          As a result of these developments, Slovakia's economy is highly indusralied
with an emphasis on semi-finished goods, engineeing products, chemicals and armaments.
Industry accounts for about 60% of GDP and 43% of employment. Agriculture, wich had
been the traditional mainstay of the economy in the pre-communist period, accounts for about
7% of GDP and 12% of employment. Slovak trade was highly dependent on the former
CMEA and the collapse of these markets had a severe impact on the economy. In 1991,
54% of Slovakia's imports and 42% of its expos were stl with the former CMEA



2
countries. The share of trade with OECD markebt has grown to 54% of erts and 51% of
imports in 1992.
6.          Slovalda shared the m nomic stion successes of te former
Czechoslovak Federation. Inflaton has remained low (10% in 1992), extemal debt to the
rest of the world is only 25% of GDP. and the economy has made rapid progress in areas
such as trade liberlizon, price de-control, and the establishment of a soWial saety net.
However, because of its industrial endowment, its transition to a market economy is likely to
involve greater adjustment costs than in the Czech Republic. The output losses associated
with the Federal stabilization prorm wer massive in both the Czech and Slovak Republcs
- with a 15% GDP decline in 1991 and a firther 6-8% decline in 1992. But the
unemployment rates have displayed a sharp divergence across Republics since the beginning
of the tsformaton program. The very low unemnploytent rates of 2-3% in the Czech
Republic contrast sharply with the 10-13% rates observed in Slovalda.
7.          Since independence, Slevaia has sought to follow the tradition of prudent
maconomic policies adhered to by the former Czechosovak Fedewaon. The
Government has alrady ak  a number of dffficult measu  to adjust to the loss of fiscal
transfers from the Fedeion. The DOM estimates the 1993 budget deficit as 7.5% of GDP
which, given that the undedying deficit in 1992 was 13%, impLied a major adjustment effort
The adjustment was based on major cuts in subsidies, better targedng of social benefits, and
postponement of some public investments. The size of the fiscal adjustment required is
complicated by uncerainty about revenues due to the introduction of a new value-added tax
in January 1993. Furuer budgetary measures may be required once more information is
available on revenue performance in 1993.
8.         A new central bank is being established. Following the dissolution of the
monetary union with the Czxch Republic in February 1993, a new currency is planned. The
exchange of the Czechoslovak currency for Slovak-stamped notes has proceeded smoothly,
although foreign exchange reserves are at low levels in the wake of seuation prior to the
dissolution of the currency union. Performance of the extnal sector depends heavily on
trade with the Czech Republic. Slovakda had a small trade deficit of US$321 million with
the rest of the world which was offset by a sutplus on the service account to generate a small
(US$55 milLion) current account surplus in 1992. Although there is considerable uncertainty
about the trde data between the two new countries, data for 1992 point to a sizeable deficit
of US$610 million with the Czech Republic which was financed through official tnsfs.
More recent evidence for 1993 points to a large decline in inter-republic trade flows. Under
the custms union with the Czech Republic, tade imbalances between the two countries will
be cleared on a reguar basis and financed under the clearing arragement up to a ciling of
Ecu 130 mI.ion.
9.          Although foreign exchange is in short supply at present, Slovalia's initial
exemal debt position is favorable. Foreign debt stands at US$2.6 bilLion to the rest of the
world. In addition, Slovala owes about US$900 million to the Czech Republic as a rest of
splittng the balace sheet of the Stae Barnk of Czechoslkvalda, but this is stll under



3
negotations. Debt seice was equivalent to about US$0.65 billion iti 1992, which was 8%
of exports of goods and services. While the foreign exchange resrves of the Central Bank
are very low, the Government is exploring a nwnber of options to restore official reserves.
If an agreement is reached with the IMP, the prospects for exte  financing would be
significantly enhanced.
10.         Financial sector reforms have included new baning legislation, interest rate
liberalization, and two financial operations to address the bans' portfolio problems
conducted under the auspices of the Federation. The fit opeation was the consolidation of
Kcs 110 billion of the permanently revolving credits for inventories in a Consolidation Bank
in March 1991. The second operation involved the transfer of Kes 50 billion to the
commercial banks from the National Property Fund's privatization revenues. Slovak banls
benefited from one-third of these funds. However, these two opeations have not been
sufficient, and there remains a sizeable bad debt problem associated with the loss maing
enterprises.
11.         Privatization remains the centepiece of structural reform efforts in Slovaida.
Until the end of 1992, the sategyhad been the same as that in the Czech lands using an
approch that combined direct sales to foreign and domestic investors with mass privatzation
through the coupon scheme  Prepatons for the second wave of prvazation are ongoing
with 650 medium and large-scale enterprises scheduled for privabtion startig in 1993 with
a book value of Kcs. 210 billion. The Ministry of Privatzion intends to rely more heavily
on conventional methods, and reatively less on the coupon scheme, which reflects concerns
about corporate govemance and revenue generation.
12.         Outlook. Despite the expected transitional difficultis, Slovia's medium-
term prospects are favorable. The country is strategically located in the center of Europe
and plans to exploit its position as a transit point for gas, other energy sources and goods
traffic. The labor force is highly skilled and real wages are competitive. Restr ing the
economy while maintaining a social consensus for reform will be difficult in the near term.
But the country's low indebtedness means that extnal financing can play a crucial role in
cushioning and reinforcing the transition. The Government remains committed to the
transformion of the economy, as well as to the attraction of foreign investment. Providing
adequate in u , such as telecommunications, is an important element of the
Governmt's strategy for attrcng new private investment, and for increasing overall
productivity.
13.         Bank AsLstam Strategy. Building on the relation the Bank developed with
the country in the context of the Strucural Adjustment Loan to the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic, the Bank will attempt to support Slovaka's transformation program simully
in three areas: (1) provision of technical advice on how to establish a public adminisation
and institutions in the new country that can best support the development of a private sector
and a market economy; (2) financial support to the Government's reform progam in the
form of fast disbursing balance of payments loans; and (3) technical and fincial upport to
investment projects, particularly in infastrucre, that can be exected to have the biggest

impact on economic growth and privat sector development A Bank country economic
mission visited Slovakia in Aprl/My 1993 to analyze key constaints to economic
developments during the initial phase of independence and advice on key issues of the
transforaion program, including macoonomic policies, pnvatzation, enterprise and
financial sector restricting, labor markets and the soul safety net. The economic report,
to be discussed with the authorities in September 1993, will provide us with the elements
needed to formulate a complete Country Assstance Strategy (CAS), which would be
presented to the Board on the occason of the next loan, perhaps a fist adjustment loan, most
likely early in CY 1994. Such an adjustment loan would be prepared in FY94, folowing the
epected so of the Government's economic program by the DMO under the new
Systemic Transformation Facility. A possible EPSAL to support the restructuing and
privatzation of enterprises and commercial banks has been tentatively scheduled for FY95.
Preatory work for projects in forestry, energ and enonment and the social sectrs is
aready underway. A project aiming at the protection of forests and related ecosstem
biodiversities under the Global Enonment Facilty is expected to be negoatd shortly.
14.        Bank Exposue. Bank exposure to Slovakda is very low at this stage. The
third tranche of the Czechoslvaida SAL (US$450 million) that was apportioned to Slovaia
has been disbused, and the country has assumed one-third of the repayment obligation of the
SAL, i.e. US$150 million. World Bank debt oonstitutes only 4 pecnt of Slovaia's total
outstanding debt at the end of 1992 (excluding debt to the Czech Republic).
15.        TdeommnicatIons Sector Strategy. Since the Spring of 1990, the BLA
has worked with the former CSFR telcommunications authorties and, subsequently, Czech
and Slovak authorities, to devise a strategy for the sector which has focussed on: (a) building
a "Digital Overlay Network (DON)" to pidly improve key services, and provide a sound
foundation for futur network development; and (b) seelkng a joint venture partner to
introduce cellular and packet-switched data services immediately, and then using the proceeds
of the Licensing fee to finance major studies of netwok development saegy and then begin
constuction of the most urgent components.
16.        This strtegy was foUlowed: cellular and packer.switched network licenses
were awarded, and the revenue used as mggested. Studies by two major optng
companies were undertaken, closely monitored by the Bank. The studies were completed in
the Summer of 1991 (covering both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic), and the-,
fonn the bads for the program which underlies the proposed project. As a result of the
separation of the two countries, this proect will be carried out in paallel with a similar one
in the Czech Republic.
17.        RatIonale for Bank involvement. Preparaton of the proposed project started
well before the break-up of the Fedraton. It had been conceived with two distinct Czech
and Slovak geo ical components and the new Slovak Government confirmed the priority
of mrnizing the telecommunications sector for its transformation progam. It will provide
a snifiantly mroved telecommunications network, which wil have a strong impact on the
development of the private sector and foeign trade. It will facilitate the integration of the



5
Slovak economy into the European and world economy. Due to its experience, the Bank is
well-equipped to provide technical, policy, and financial support for a comprehensive
balanced telecommunications developnent approach. A s msh, it has a unique role to play:
(a) as a catalyst and coordinator of such development stategies; (b) in providing technical,
maWerial and financial support; and (c) as the financier of essental portns of the sector's
development for which other sources are not available or not suitible. While other sources of
support for TC exist, they have some disadvantages. For example, other sources
of credit often have hidden costs, are avilable only for certain classes of equipment,
encourge distortion of investment goals and sategies, and rarely provide strong support for
institutional and/or policy reform. Private direct investment in the sector is both limnted and
usually focused on narrow portions of the TC market. Such pixetneal TC development,
while valuable, is not sufficient to support overall economic development. Progress in most
attractive sub-nwmkets must be coordinated with a program for developing the entire
nationwide network.
18.         Project Objectives. The project would support: (a) expansion and
strengthening of the intonal and national long-distance networks together with necessary
local tensions to relieve the most congested TC sevices and provide modern TC services
to business; (b) institutional strengthening of ST aimed at transfomig it into an efficient,
commercial company; and (c) development of policies and mechaisms for liberalization in
Ine with EC guidelines (a member of which the Slovak Republic wishes to become).
19.         Closely related to the project is a program of: (a) institudonal improvements in
the Ministry of Transpor, Communications, and Public Works; and (b) development of a
reguatory framework for liberalizing the sector. This progam has been developed with
close involvement and assistance from the Bank. The EC will take the lead role in
implementing this program and will finance the required technical assistace and training
from grants via the PHARE program. The Bank, however, is, and will remain, in close co-
operation with the EC on these mauers.
20.         Project Description. The project would support implementation of the 1993-
1995 time-slices of the development program of the ST. The emphasi would be on (a)
construction of a national DON; (b) a program of instituional  povenents in ST, including
the full separaon of Post from Telecommunications and introduction of modern commercial
practices; and (c) technical assistance and trning to support (a) through (b) above.
21.          The Slovak Republic would guarantee this loan.
22.         Actlons agreed. During loan negotiations, the following agreements were
reached:
a. With the Borrower:
Fiancial Covenants



6
By November 30, 1993:
(i)   ST shal submit an income statement for the thir quarter of 1993 and,
theafter, on a quarterly basis within two months from the end of the
quarter. Beginning in 1994, ST shall, in addition, submit a casb flow
statement and a balance sheet.
From January 1, 1994 on:
(ii)  Intenally genefated invesble funds (operating income plus
dercation minus taxes, debt service and increases in worldng capital)
for any one year shall not be less than 55% of a three-yea moving
average of investment
(iii)  The ratio of opeting expens (including deweciation) to oprtng
revenues shall not exceed 65%.
(tv)  The debt service ratio shal not fal below 2.5.
(v)   A study of tiffsis to be undertan by the ST, and a report submitted
to the MTCP, the Ministry of Finance, and the World Bank by Sept
30, 1993. This study will address, ame alla, what fiurher adjustments
may be needed in the level and sructure of taiffs (including provision
for diffential charges for direct subscribers to the DON). The study
shal make recommendations rading the real level of tariffs and shall
propose a dmetable for adjustments by January 1, 1994.
b. With the Guarantor.
(i)   the Guarantor sha increase, or cause to be increased, trff levels as
necessary, in order to ensure that the Borrower is able to comply with
the financial covenants; and
(iH)   the Guarantor shall review the eisting distnrbution of tariff
responsibilities, and any studies undern by the Guarantor andlor the
Borrower, and by January 1, 1994, shall propose an acdon plan for
implementing a program fori a regatory regime, methodology and
procedures covenng telcommunications tariffs. This will be discussed
with the Bank and, by April 1, 1994 actions will be taken to implement
the zesulting program.
c.    Additional conditions of effectivenes:
(i)   Effecdveness of the BIB and EBRD loan agreements; and



7
(ii)   Provision by the Brower of a financing plan satidsctory to the Bank
for the suppies credits  rough 1995.
23.         Project Benefts. The proposed project would: (a) significantly improve the
quantity and quality of tdtioal TC services and pemit new services for key sec' s of the
population (especiauy businesses) by providing direct acoe to a modem, inteionally
integrated digital network in a short period of time (by the end of 1995); and (b) greatly
improve service to all subscribers by decongesting the existing long-distance and international
network and thereby imprving its performane  In addition, the project would fcilitate
network eansion and moderizaton by: (a) creating a soundly engineered digital skeleton
upon which to build the future modern network; and (b) incrsg the reenue genertng
capacity of the system in order to finmce raid growth. Taken together, these benefits
would sinifiatly improve the capacity of the Slovak Republic to sustain its economic
reform and development progrm.
24.         RIks. The principal risk relate to: (a) the financial strength of the ST and its
ability to sustin high investment; (b) the implementation capacity of the ST; and (c) limited
experience of the new Slovak Government's institutions. These risks are acceptable because
it is the Govemment's policy to promote self-financing infrastructure investment, which
means that the Government must set such tariff levels which will permit the implementation
of the agreed development project Furthermore, the Government gives the highest prionty
to mvestments in telecommumication where the customers are willing to pay higher rates for
services rendered and the taiffs are relatvely low.
25.         Maoover, to increase the capacity of ST to manage these risks, a number of
povisions have been made. Meas to strengthen the financui management of the ST are
included in the project, such as the creation of a strong financial departmnt and taining of
its staff, taiff studies leading to reform and eaancing, and the design and implementation
of commerci acconting systems and related MIS. A sries of financial covenants (tied to
inter  cash generton and opeting ratio) will be requied to ensure adequate financial
perforance of the Borrower. A strong Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was created in
the ST pior to negotiation. Initally, this unit would deal with procurement prepon;
later, it would be responsible for project execion. The project would contain techmical
asistance for the PIU. Finally, the Government's policy and rguatory function is being
developed with the asistance of qualified consultants.
26.         Remendato. I am satisfied that the prposed loan woud comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
