telecommunications services in\n            Slovak Republic. Telephone service was transformed from an\n            outmoded analog network into a modern digital network. The\n            number of installed telephone lines and the number of\n            working lines had increased. In 2000, the public is being\n            served by cellular telephone lines. The lessons learned\n            include: a) The support of regulatory reforms does not end\n            with the creation of the independent sector regulator. b)\n            The efficient implementation of different financial\n            instruments not only ensured the investment program\n            financing, but more importantly, stimulated the enhancement\n            of financial management skills and positive evolution of\n            Slovak Telecommunications Company's (ST) corporate\n            culture. c) Any privatization transaction should be preceded\n            by a well designed public relations campaign and involvement\n            of all current and potential stakeholders in the sector. d)\n            Cofinancing arrangements should be secured as early as\n            possible in project preparation. e) The early provision of\n            quality technical advice to the Government for sector\n            restructuring and to ST for implementation of the physical\n            component, as well as the Borrower's capacity for\n            absorbing and using the technical assistance, greatly\n            contributed to the project sustainability. E) The need to\n            follow strict procurement guidelines is perceived by some as\n            an unnecessary burden."}, "docdt": "2000-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
