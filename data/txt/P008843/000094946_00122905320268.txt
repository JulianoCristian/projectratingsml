3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Project would support the digitalization and expansion of the core network to: (a) reduce congestion on
key network elements; (b) rapidly provide modem digital communications for businesses (overlay-network;
especially export-oriented businesses); and (c) provide a sound foundation for future modernization and
expansion of the entire network. The Project would also focus on institutional and policy improvements
aimed at: (a) increased efficiency in telecommunications investment and operations; (b) improved quality of
service; and (c) transition to full commercial operation.
3.2 Revised Objective:
In August 1997, the World Bank Board of Directors approved amendments to the Loan Agreement of
August 1993 in order to: (a) reflect the extension to a new period (1992 - 1998) of the original Project
objectives, which addressed the time period 1992-1995; (b) include progress in a sector reform process
more far-reaching than originally estimated (development of policies and mechanisms for liberalization in
line with EC guidelines); and (c) to amend legal covenants, by replacing three originally established
financial ratios (self-financing ratio of not less than 55%; operating ratio not larger than 65%, and
net-revenue/debt service ratio of not less than 2.5 times), by two new ratios more appropriate to Slovak
Telecom's (ST) new character as a commercially autonomous entity (gearing ratio of less than 80%; and
interest coverage ratio larger than 3.0 times).
3.3 Original Components:
The Project would support ST's development program for the period 1992-1995, and would consist of two
main elements: (a) construction of a digital overlay network focusing mainly on long-distance facilities but
with appropriate complimentary intemational and local network improvement; and (b) technical assistance
and training to support institutional improvements, especially in financial management, human resources
management, and market orientation.
3.4 Revised Components:
The revised Project objectives include to support: (a) the Borrower's development program during the
period 1992-1998 in the digitalization and expansion of core network; (b) institutional and policy
improvements in the Borrower's telecommunications operations ; and (c) the establishment by the
Guarantor of a modern regulatory agency for the telecommunications sector.
Background
Until 1990, the basic organization of the telecom sector in Slovak Republic, was based upon the typical
ministry which was simultaneously a monopoly service-provider and the sector regulator. This was the
"Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC)". In early 1990 initial steps were taken to reform the
sector, by separating the policy/regulatory functions, which were given to the "Federal Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications (FMPT)", from operating functions, which were allocated to the two operating
companies: "Sprava Post a Telekomunikaci" (SPT-Prague and SPT-Bratislava). With the separation of
Slovak Republic from the former Czech-Slovak Federation, on 1 January 1993, authority on the telecom
sector was given in the Slovak Republic to the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Public Works
(MoTCPW). At the same time, 1 Jan. 1993, Post was separated from Telecom. In May 1993, another
amendment to the 1964 telecom law established a new regulatory agency, called Telecommunications
Office of the Slovak Republic (TOSR). On 18 April 1995, through an amendment to the Law about
organization of the Ministries, responsibility on the telecom sector was transferred to the newly created
"Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications (MoTPT)".  Finally, at the time of ST
privatization, in May 2000, a new Telecom Law was approved.
-2-



The state-owned Slovak Telecommunications (ST) enterprise was created by the Slovak Government and
started operations on January 1, 1993.  It comprised of the telecommunications section (Sprava
Telekomunikaci) of the former Sprava Post a Telekomunikacie (SPT), and of the former Sprava
Radiokomunikaci, company which operated microwave links, as well as the nation's broadcasting facilities.
At this time, Mobile services (analog technology, in the 450 MHz band) were provided by Eurotel, a new
joint venture between ST (51%) and Atlantic West (49%).
ST organization was based upon 3 regional units, plus the capital, Bratislava. These regions were divided
into 82 nodal areas.  As of end 1992, there were approximately 821,000 telephones lines, all of analog
technology (strowger and crossbar).
Project Description
The original Project covered 4 years of ST's Development Plan: 1992-1995; which was called by ST
First Telecom Project.
The main purpose of the Project was to begin modernization by expanding the telecom network using
modem digital equipment; beginning with an international and inter-urban " Digital Overlay Network
(DON)". The goals of the Project, for ST's network expansion, as defined in the SAR (pages 15/16) were
mostly achieved in 1996. Until the end of 1996, the sources from the Loan were mainly used, in amount of
around US$ 20 million, to finance expansion of local access network.
Physical investment program
The purpose of the physical program was to start the process of modernization, digitalization and
expansion of the network. The purpose of the construction of the DON was to rapidly provide digital
service, especially to business customers, to improve the accessibility and quality of telecommunication
services, and to provide a foundation for the modernization of the entire network. The project covered
design, purchase, installation and bringing into service the following equipment.
1. International and transit switching exchanges consisting of about 36,000 ports.
2. Local digital switching exchanges to provide an equipped capacity of about 433,000 lines and
introducing Common Channel Signaling.
3. Operational Support System
4. Local analogue switching exchanges to provide an equipped capacity of about 88,000 lines.
5. Local and long distance Optical Fibre Transmission equipment consisting of about 3,200 cable km
and associating terminal equipment.
6. Microwave Radio equipment including multiplex equipment.
7. Coaxial cable digital equipment for refurbishment of 300 km coax cable.
8. Copper cable.
9. Cable ducts and rearrangements.
10. Training and technical assistance.
11. Building refurbishment.
12. Measurement and miscellaneous equipment.
Amendment to the Project Agreement of Aug. 1997
The Amendment to the Project Agreement, which was approved in Aug. 1997, extended the period of ST's
- 3 -



network expansion to be funded by the Project from 1992-1995 to 1992-1998. However, this new period
covered only a small percentage of total ST investment plan.
Since 1997, ST continued its modernization program, with targets beyond the goals (in network) stated in
the Project's SAR, and intended to use remaining portion of the Loan for this additional program. It is to
be noted that the SAR, (page 53, annex 9), expected disbursement up to June 1999, even when the Project
initially covered the period 1992-1995. After approval of the 1997 Amendment to the Project Agreement,
another US$ 30 million was used in additional programs, including extension of local access network, other
equipment and a small portion of technical assistance.
Taking into consideration the limited use of IFI's sources, due to the improved business situation of ST, the
company decided in 1996 to obtain funds on the international financial market, based on commercial terms
(without government guaranties). At the beginning of 1997, ST arranged a syndicated loan through
CITIBANK in the amount of US$ 170 million, and in 1998 another loan from EIB (EUR 100 million) was
guarantied by Sumitomo Bank, which also syndicated US$ 45 million. These sources, together with
remaining funds from IFI's and own sources were used for continuing additional programs.
3.5 Quality at Entry.
This Project was not reviewed by QAG-QER. However, at the time of this ICR, the Quality at Entry is
considered to have been satisfactory. As mentioned above, tlhe Project was designed in line with the urgent
needs of Slovak Republic to improve its telecommunications services by installing a "digital overlay
network". It can be noted that, during the project period, the company and the sector changed completely,
from a state-owned monopoly to a competitive privately-managed sector.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Project was highly successful in achieving its overall objective of improving the efficiency of
telecommunications services in Slovak Republic. Telephone service was transformed from an outmoded
analog network into a modern digital network; the number of installed telephone lines increased from
935,000 in 1992 to more than 2,070,000 in June 2000; and the number of working lines increased from
821,000 in 1992 to more than 1,730,000 as of June 2000. In addition, in year 2000, the public is being
served by some 800,000 cellular telephone lines. The efficiency of ST, as measured by the number of staff
per 1,000 working lines improved from 14.7 in 1992 to around 8.3 in year 2000.
The sector structure changed fundamentally with: (a) the separation of Post and Telecommunications
activities which took place on I January 1993; (b) the creation, by an amendment to the Telecom Law,
enacted in May 1993, of a new regulatory agency, the "Telecommunications Office of the Slovak Republic
(TOSR)"; (c) the issuance of a new Telecommunications Law in May 2000; and (d) the privatization of ST
in July 2000.
4.2 Outputs by components:

4.2.1.1 Switching network.
The start of DON construction was depending on the availability of foreign financial sources. According to
top-down principle at the end of 1992 ST started to build digital international gateway by using limited
amount of own sources. The construction of digital transit exchanges started in the second half of 1993
when financial sources from supplier's credits were effective. At the end of 1993 sources from IFIs were
also effective, which created conditions for full progress commencement from 1994.
In 1993, all four transit exchanges including intentional gateway in Bratislava were constructed with the
total capacity of 31,000 trunks. These capacities were extended in the middle of 1996 when total capacity
including the second intentional gateway achieved 46,700 trunks.
The construction of local digital exchanges also started in the second half of 1993. The significant progress
appeared in 1994 and 1995. At the end of 1995, the capacity of local digital exchanges achieved 379,000
lines. Target figure was achieved in the second quarter of 1996, when the capacity achieved 460,000 lines.
All these exchanges are operated and supervised from Operation and Maintenance Centres (OMC) which
creates support system for switching network. Whole country is divided into 25 operational areas, each
equipped by own OMC. The network architecture, as well as software of systems allows to use common
channel signaling between the individual switches.
According to the plan, it was intended to construct also about 88,000 lines in analogue switching
technology. During 1993-1995, more than 200,000 analogue lines were constructed. During the early
stages of project implementation, it was not clear how rapidly the digitalization will progress and the
waiting list was growing rapidly; the continued use of analog technology was the way to rapidly satisfy
high demand for telephone service. Later experience also showed that the planned amount was
underestimated, especially concerning the necessity to provide service in the areas where digital equipment
would be supplied later. The objective of the project was to achieve 20% of telephone penetration and 28%
of digitalization rate. At the end of 1995, 20,9% of penetration and 26% of digitalization was achieved.
Target digitalization rate (28%) was achieved in March 1996 when the penetration was 21,4%.
4.2.1.2 Transmission network
The digitalization of long distance transmission network mainly consisted of the construction of optic fiber
network and implementation of SDH technology. In the first stages of DON, digital microwave links for
connection between digital transit exchanges were used. As the construction of optic fiber links progressed,
the microwave links were replaced and used as additional capacities. In the lower levels of the transmission
network, the existing metallic cables were digitized in the cases when optical cables were absent. This
- 5 -



allowed to digitized the areas where optical cables were planned later.
Taking into consideration the number of factors influencing the construction of long distance cables (delay
of the start, right of way, climatic constraints, country profile etc.) the length of newly constructed optical
cable roads was lower than specified in the project. At the end of 1995, the length of optical cable roads
achieved 1,700 km. At that time, this quantity satisfactorily covered requirements for digital transmission.
Later experience shows that the originally planned length of optical fiber route cables (3,200 km) was
enough taking into account the demand for broad-band capacity at this point of time, as it was projected in
1995. Actually by the end of 1997, 3,640 km were implemented and new demand for optical fiber
transmission capacity is envisaged by the new private strategic investors. From this perspective, the
originally planned quantity of optical fiber routes was underestimated.
4.2.1.3 Local access network
The construction of local access network at early stages of the project was covered by own sources and
therefore the effectiveness of external financing did not represent a strong limitation for the implementation.
However, the possibility to use the sources from loans for local access also accelerated implementation in
this area. During the period 1993 - 1995, a total of 413,000 km pairs of copper cables were constructed. In
addition, copper network capacity was extended by using the pair gain systems and radio access solutions
especially in hilly areas.
4.2.2 Institutional development program (EDP) component
The program was executed through technical assistance and training of ST staff. The consultants delivered
their training using a number of presentations and classroom lessons, as well as by involving these
consultants in the solution of current issues. For each individual component, a suitable consulting company,
well experienced in telecommunication, was selected. A major factor in achieving high benefit was by
having ST staff working together with the consultants. In this way, they leamed their style of work, gained
skills and experiences, and also had on-the-job training by visiting related places abroad.
The main objective of IDP was to assist ST in the process of its transformation from the centrally planned
system into a commercial enterprise in the market economy. The IDP comprised following components:
- Corporate Strategy, Service Planning and Organizational Development
- Human Resource Management and Development
- Accounting and Finance
- Auditing
- Technical assistance
- Project Implementation
The project was designed as three years program for the period of 1993 -1995. It was expected to be
completed by 31 December 1995.
4.2.2.1  Corporate Strategy
In this area, several studies were conducted during project preparation. In the framework of IDP, in 1994 a
- 6 -



consultant from Telogic Ireland was hired to assist in the preparation of ST's strategic plan. The consultant
prepared an Outline Strategic Plan for ST, which was used by ST to develop its Corporate Strategy.
4.2.2.2 Human Resources Management and Development
This component was developed using the assistance of Sofrecom France. The works continued during 1995
- 1996. The project started with the process of diagnostics of the current situation, then continued through
the stages of conception and implementation. The scope of this project can be summarized as follows:
- Preparation of the dictionary ofjobs and responsibilities
- Identification of training requirements based on job analysis
- Development of manager's career
- Preparation of new remuneration system
- Forecasting of human resources
The implementation of results and recommendations of this Human Resources Plan will continue in the
forthcoming years.
4.2.2.3 Accounting and Finance
During 1994, Coopers & Lybrand (C&L) was hired for the preparation of the Master Plan for Accounting
and Finance. The study summarized areas which C&L recommended ST to focus on. As C&L was also
selected for auditing ST's accounts, some other aspects were improved during the auditing process (e.g.
international traffic accounting). Other aspects (budgeting, treasury etc.) were improved by ST through the
employment of relevant experts and/or consultants. C&L was also hired to elaborate a Service Costing
Study, which was a key element in the tariffs adjustment discussions with the Ministry of Finance (MoF);
because of this, it was decided that this study will be updated on regularly basis.
4.2.2.4 Auditing
Since 1993, C&L is auditing ST accounts according to international accounting standards.
4.2.2.5 TechnicalAssistance & Project Implementation
This component was provided by BT Telconsult. Since 1994, until the middle of 1996, a large scale of
assistance and consultancy was provided in the Technical Assistance and Project Implementation
components. The consultants were involved in resolving a number of technical problems and giving
guidance in the planning, procurement, O&M, project management and roles & responsibilities areas.
Training courses and seminars were provided for ST employees, covering business planning, planning
processes and project management. Much of the training documentation was translated into Slovak
language. On the basis of this good experience, ST decided to continue in co-operation with BT-Telconsult
also out of framework of IDP in areas of information technologies, marketing, etc.

All of the reform measures initiated under the project were advanced: (a) the new Telecommunications
Law (updating the Telecom Act of 1964), which allowed for the establishment of a regulatory authority,
was approved by the Parliament in July 2000, just prior to finalizing the privatization process; (b) the
Telecommunications Office of the Slovak Republic (TOSR) was re-confirmed and re-organized as the
Telecom Sector Regulator; and its staff were hired and trained; (c) the Government's sector policy
(Resolution No. 981/1995), promoting competition and private provision of services, was issued in
December 1995, and the liberalization was established by Cabinet Resolution No. 438 of December 1995;
(d) the corporatization of ST - status changed to Joint Stock company - was finalized in April 1999; and
(d) the privatization of ST was successfully completed in July, 2000.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The financial (FRR) and economic rates of return (ERR) on the project have been calculated on the basis of
the incremental cash flows from the new investment financed by the project, over a 15-year period
1995-2010. The FRR is calculated at 24.5 percent, less than the 41.3 percent calculated at appraisal,
although the two calculations may not be on a comparable basis. This result may reflect the fact that this
type of Project, building an "overlay-network" and subsequently replacing the existing analog technology
by a modem digital technology, includes a necessary but costly updating of installations which replace, not
add, revenue producing assets. The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of the
incremental cash flows after deducting the taxes and other fees and transfers paid by the company. On this
basis, the ERR is calculated at 42.7 percent compared with 41.2 percent at appraisal, although again the
two calculations may not be on a comparable basis.
The economy-wide benefits from the project are substantial. The project increased the level of private
participation in the sector through the successful privatization of ST and by establishing a regulator which
-9-



helped to build investor confidence. Even beyond STs privatization, foreign interest in the Slovak
telecommunications sector has included the establishment of privately-owned cellular companies, such as
GlobTel.
New employment opportunities were generated through the development of new services and the addition of
new service providers in the various market segments (cellular, paging, etc. ST's cellular subsidiary,
EuroTel created additional jobs. Businesses, which increasingly rely on telecommunications and Internet
services to enhance productivity, greatly benefited from ST's improved efficiency, service quality and
expanded network capacity. Improved telecommunications services will allow for business to have better
access to international markets, creating new export opportunities and reducing purchasing costs.
Resource mobilization was also an important economic benefits of the project. The US$170 million
syndicated loan obtained by ST in 1997 helped to mobilize private sector finances from the local and
international markets. This was followed by another loan from EIB together with a new syndicated loan
for US$ 45 million (see Borrower's Contribution).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
ST's financial performance during the project period (1992-1999) was strong enough to generate sufficient
funds from operations to cover a high percentage of total project costs, and to comfortably meet all
financial covenants. However, ST suffered pressure on revenues and profitability in 1998 - 1999, due to
an increased competition from cellular providers. As a result of increased competition, a new revenue item
"Interconnection with other operators" became since 1998 the largest revenue item for ST. International
revenue decreased between 1995 and 2000 due to declining international settlement rates, and competition
provided by new technologies (INTERNET, call-back arrangements). Total revenues grew by a factor of
2.148 between 1994 and 2000, while operating expenses increased by a factor 2.506, causing ST's gross
and net operating ratios to decline. As a result of these trends, average annual revenue per subscriber
declined from US$ 355 in 1996 to US$ 280 in 2000, a decline of 21%.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact of the Project, during the Project period (1992-2000), was
substantial;
(a) Government of Slovak Republic/Ministry of Posts, Transport and Communications (MoTPT) d
eveloped the capacity to design and implement the sector restructuring program. The Ministry became
fully responsible for Telecom Policy making; while the newly established "Telecom Office of the Slovak
Republic (TOSR)" became the full sector regulator in charge of licensing, tariffs approval, interconnection
agreements arbiter, in addition to its original responsibilities as the sole institution in charge of frequency
allocation, control and monitoring.
(b) Slovak Telecom, which originally had been a regional branch of the Czech-Slovak operator, became an
independent telecommunications operator. ST developed the skills to plan and obtain resources for its
network expansion, and in addition reached full operational handling of the World Bank and other IFIs
procurement procedures (see Borrower's Contribution).
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
None
- 1 0 -



5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government's commitment to sector reform changed during Project implementation from a weak
support in the period 1997-1998 to a strong support, starting with the new Government elected in October
1998, which ended in complete liberalization and privatization of the sector. This change delayed the
privatization process for about two years.
After issuing the Telecom Sector Policy in December 1995, which provided great impulse to the
liberalization and sector regulation, ST signed a World Bank's funded contract with N. M. Rothschild as
privatization advisors; however, the recommendations of this study were not implemented until 1999, and
the subsequent privatization advisory contract was signed with another consultant (Deutsche Bank) as a
continuation of this study. The new Government decided to re-bid this TA assignment and not to use any
Bank loan funds for the privatization advisory services.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Slovak Telecom established a strong Project Implementation Unit to handle all IFI's contracts. The PIU
was well staffed with a project manager and technical support, which, after some initial training, was
capable of managing all project related procurement /disbursement issues in a rapid and professional way.
There were no major procurement related complaints in the handling of some 20 contracts, and the
disbursement was finalized without the need to have a grace period after Project Closing date.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The Project's original financing plan, revised loan amounts, and total disbursed at Project closing ( 30 June
2000), are shown in the Table below:
Original Financing Plan            Revised Loan    Disbursed

As explained in the Borrower's Contribution, in the period 1996 -2000, ST decided to fund its
investment program with syndicated loans and further EIB loans instead of a new World Bank loan.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the Project's achievements is highly likely. The sector reform achieved under the
Project has already allowed for and will continue to increase private participation in the sector. The newly
privatized ST is planning for further expansion and improvement of the network to prepare for competition
(exclusivity for basic voice services will expire on 31 Dec. 2002). The Government has awarded new GSM
1,800 MHz (cellular) licenses to increase competition. All this should continue the progress made and
-11 -



contribute to improve efficiency and accessibility of telecommunications services in Slovak.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Simultaneously with Project closing, ST was privatized. The newly private company will use the greater
financial flexibility and support from the new major shareholder-manager DeutscheTelekom to succeed in
the open, competitive market, where competition from cellular providers was reducing ST's profit margin
for the last 3 years.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. ] Lending:
Bank performance at identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory. During the
28 months of preparation, from the initial identification mission to Board approval, the Bank maintained a
close dialogue with ST to ensure that the project objectives were directly in line with the Government's
goals for the sector.
The staff mix and continuity during preparation and appraisal were highly satisfactory. Financial analysts
and telecommunications engineers provided the core expertise. The loan amount and project execution
period was well estimated at the time; however, as explained in the Borrower's Contribution, the
implementation period was extended at the time of amending the Loan Agreements (1 997), mainly to allow
further Bank participation in the privatization/sector re-structuring process. Given the final outcome of
sector privatization, this decision may be considered as appropriate.
There was clear recognition by the preparation team of the project risks, namely the potential for political
interference in the implementation of the sector restructuring and the risk of delays in the investment part of
the program due to procurement delays resulting from the need for the borrower to learn the Bank's
procedures.
7.2 Supervision:
The overall supervision of the project was highly satisfactory, as recognized by a QAG review in 1998.
Regular supervision missions were carried out generally every six months and the documentation in the
project file is adequate. A de facto mid-term review was conducted in August 1997 on occasion of the
preparation for Board submission of the Amendment to the Project Agreements. A new Task Manager was
appointed in 1996. However, this did not disrupt the project supervision and had no impact on the project
achievements. Project performance indicators and financial indicators, as outlined in the SAR, were
monitored on a regular basis and generally served as realistic measures of the project's achievements, with
the exception of the quality-of-service targets, which had been over-estimated, as mentioned above. The
Borrower noted that in several instances there were delays in obtaining the Bank's non-objection on
procurement matters.
Following Bank financing of the first pre-privatization study, the Government took a passive position
(1996-1998), and the process regained strength and was finalized after a new Government was elected at
the end of 1998.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. Bank staff worked closely with the Government and
the implementing agency to push the sector reform ahead and to monitor progress on the physical
- 12 -



component. The Bank gave strong advice to the GOS on maintaining a consistent sector policy, in
following international best practice for the privatization transaction and in establishing a credible and
transparent regulatory environment. Project modifications, including credit reallocation and one extension
of closing date, were generally processed by the Bank team in an efficient manner in order to respond to the
Borrower's needs. The Borrower was especially satisfied with the positive response of the Bank to its new
needs, such as changing of financial Project covenants by a new set of parameters more appropriate to the
new company operating in an increasingly competitive environment.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The quality of the Borrower's commitment and contributions to project preparation were satisfactory. In
terms of the restructuring program, the Government and ST took several steps to ensure a successful
completion of the sector reform: (a) by issuing a new Commercial Law ( 513/1991) which allowed for the
sale of the telephone operating company; (b) by introducing competition through the licensing of the first
cellular operator (EuroTel in Sept. 1991); and (c) by creating the new operating company: Slovak Telecom.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government, with the active support from ST's PIU, was mainly responsible for the implementation of
the sector restructuring component. Although there were some hitches and delays along the way, given the
overall progress made on the sector reform during the period 1993-present (Telecommunications Law
adopted, Sector Policy Statement issued, regulatory agency established, policy division in MoTPT created,
and corporatization and subsequent privatization of the telecommunications operator), the Government's
performance can be considered satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
In terms of the investment component, the Borrower organized a Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
responsible for all IFI's project implementation related aspects. The PIU quickly reached a high level of
proficiency in the handling of all procurement, disbursement, project planning aspects; which was also
evidenced by maintaining a highly satisfactory data base, which allowed ST to handle the relations with
EBRD, EIB and IBRD in a highly satisfactory and professional way.
The implementing agency's (ST) performance was highly satisfactory. The PIU provided quarterly
progress reports on a regular basis with performance indicators generally exceeding expectations.
Financial management of the project was carried out in a very professional manner. Audit reports were
usually received on time and were unqualified, and the financial covenants, as specified in the Loan
Agreement, or in the Amended Agreements ( after 1997), were adhered to.  ST's management of the
physical component of the project was highly successful, and generally exceeded expectations.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance and participation in both preparation and implementation is highly
satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons to be drawn from this project implementation experience are the following:
Sector Regulation. The support of regulatory reforms does not end with the creation of the independent
- 13 -



sector regulator. Although the telecommunications regulator was successfully established and staffed
under the project, more attention could have been given to building the capacity of the regulator through
more specialized training and study tours, and in emphasizing the importance of complete separation of the
regulator from the ministry, including the allocation of a separate and independent budget for the TOSR.
Project Financing. The efficient implementation of different financial instruments, in particular the
syndicated loans managed by ST, not only ensured the investment program financing, but more
importantly, stimulated the enhancement of financial management skills and positive evolution of ST's
corporate culture.
Privatization. Any privatization transaction should be preceded by a well designed public relations
campaign and involvement of all current and potential stakeholders in the sector. A consistent sector policy
and strong display of Government commitment is crucial in attracting private investors.
Cofinancing Arrangements. Cofinancing arrangements should be secured as early as possible in project
preparation. In this case all IFI's finds were parallel co-financing. ST success in this arrangement was
mainly dependent upon the creation, staffing and training of a skilled, professional, and high performing
PIU; this was essential for ST achieving a smooth project implementation.
Technical Assistance. The early provision of quality technical advice to the GOS for sector restructuring
and to ST for implementation of the physical component, as well as the Borrower's capacity for absorbing
and using the TA, greatly contributed to the overall success and sustainability of the project.
World Bank Procurement Guidelines. The need to follow strict Procurement Guidelines, such as those
of the World Bank, is perceived by some well managed companies in relatively advanced economies in
Eastern Europe as an unnecessary burden.

Slovak Telecommunication Project
The contribution of Borrower to Implementation Completion
Report
History
The first contacts between the WB and ST (at that time SPT Bratislava under umbrella of the
Federal Ministry of Transport and Communications of the former Czechoslovakia) took place
immediately after the political changes in Central Europe. During 1990 - 1991, WB's
representatives visited several times the country, at both Ministry and company levels, and
expressed their willingness to support the development of the telecommunication sector. The
WB representatives defined the conditions required for such assistance, and together with other
international institutions (EBRD and EIB - IFI), started to identify a potential future project. At
that time ST was taking preparatory steps (feasibility studies) and the exact picture of the project
was not yet clear.
At the end of 1991, the results of the studies were known; the modernization plans included
more clear features.  Even when there was lack of experience in the country in the
implementation of projects of this size, the biggest obstacle for starting was the lack of financing.
The company had very limited own sources, the start required to purchase substantial amount of
modern technology equipment in foreign currency. The implementation of the new project would
not have been possible without foreign financing. In this situation, ST negotiated with the IFIs,
and also with other institutions. At the end of 1992, when the problem with required government
guaranties was solved, the appraisal of the IFIs started. During the first half of 1993 all
negotiations and approvals were done. The Loan with WB was signed in August 1993, however
its effectiveness was reached at the end of 1993.
Usage of Loan funds
During 1992 - 1993, the implementation of the Project waited for financing. A strong financial
impulse was needed for staring the process.  Unfortunately the time required to reach
effectiveness of the IFI' loans, did not provide such impulse when needed. In addition, the
special requirements associated with the introduction of WB procurement procedures, resulted in
further delays for the real use of the WB Loan.

After the Loan reached effectiveness, the disbursement started. During the life of the Loan, ST
prepared 13 bids for delivery of goods and equipment, which resulted in 20 contracts. At the
same time, ST also prepared bids for financing by other IFIs. The first disbursement from WB
Loan took place in May 1994, the last one in June 2000. The pace of disbursement of the WB
Loan was slow even in comparison with the pace of other IFIs' financing.

The funds from the Loan were used especially for delivery of components for local access
network and supplementary equipment, which was selected from those not strictly necessary
during the early stages of project implementation (this was due to the delays in WB procurement
processing, as explained below).
At the beginning of 1991 started the bidding process for delivery of digital switching systems,
which is one of the most important components for such modernization program. At that time, ST
did not know in sufficient detail the WB's procurement rules, and ST believed that international
bidding (the first of such scale in the country and under assistance of American experts from J P
Morgan) will be accepted and therefore financed by WB. Unfortunately the WB did not accept
this bidding procedure, and at this time (when was definitely decided that WB will co-finance the
project) it was not possible to cancel the bid and start again. If the WB would have given at the
beginning of the project a partial waiver from its procurement rules, and would had agreed with
financing of selected switching systems, the Project would had received vital momentum, and the
thrust from this source, would have been catalyzed with the introduction of required procedures.
EEB adopted this approach and we can see its higher contribution in the process.
From later perspective we can see that (due to these delays and cumbersome procedures) the
sources from the WB Loan were at the end used in aspects not crucial for the implementation of
the project. These sources were used as supplementary financing. Similar situation appeared
also in other Central European countries. The most crucial need for ST was to obtain a relevant
amount of sources relatively soon, and at the beginning of the Project, which would have
enabled its prompt physical start. Afterwards, or in parallel, ST could have introduced WB
procurement procedures, institutional improvements and other time consuming requirements
(training of the staff, development of organization etc.). Otherwise, (as happened in reality), it

was necessary to find other sources of financing for enabling the start of implementation. This
fact caused the delay of the start, and finally the Loan was used only as supplementary financing.
Traditional WB approach may be more suitable for "live" projects (poverty, health, education...),
in very poor countries, rather than in telecommunication projects in transforming countries in
Central Europe. It was supposed that the guaranties of government of these countries provided
sufficient comfort to WB for a specific or selective approach. At the beginning of the 90s,
telecommunication companies in these countries needed an accelerated process of modernization,
rather than to obtain the cheapest loans. Institutional development was also needed, but its
implementation was depending from political developments, and should not have resulted in
delays of the physical modernization of network. In the second half of the 90s, these companies
were able to procure financing on financial markets on commercial terms, and today most of
them are privatized.
WB contribution
Besides financing, the most beneficial contribution of the WB was its influence in the area of
reforms in the telecommunications sector.  The WB  supported the development of a
telecommunication policy, new sector legislation, and the creation of a modern regulatory
framework. In approximately 10 Missions, WB representatives, visited senior officials in the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport and Communications with the aim to share
information about recent developments in the sector, and to express WB's views on the situation.
Very important was the WB's impact on the introduction of an improved Tariff Policy. A Cost
Accounting Study was also financed from the WB Loan. Since 1995, when the government of
the Slovak Republic took the decision to privatize ST, WB was offering its support to the
privatization process, which preliminary study was also financed from the WB Loan.
The WB also supported ST through the organization of several training activities in the field of
corporate financing, procurement and disbursement procedures. After these training activities,
ST' staff was able to fully cover all WB requirements for using of Loan funds.
Finally ST appreciates very much the understanding of the WB in the issuance of several
amendments of Loan Agreement, as well as amendments of Loan covenants, the change of Loan
currency, extension of closing date, and the consents necessary during the privatization process.
All these ste s helped ST on its way towards the commercialization of the company.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT - LOAN 3637-SK
Code P008843 - SK
MAY 2000 - SUPERVISION & ICR MISSION
AIDE MEMOIRE
Preamble
1.    A Supervision Mission consisting of Messrs. Alberto Cruzat and Svetoslav Tintchev
visited Slovak Republic between Wednesday 3 and Wednesday 10 May 2000, to supervise
for the last time the Telecommnunications Project, prepare the ICR, and to discuss progress in
the telecommunications sector refonn.
2.    The Mission held discussions with Mr. Milan Luknar, Director General for
Telecommunications of MoTPT; Mr. Igor Chochol, Financial Director, Slovak Telecom a.s.
(ST), Mr. Peter Poliak, Specialist, Marketing Strategy Department, and Mr. Peter Anetta,
Investment Planning Department, (ST); Messrs. Peter Bollardt, Russel McGranahan, and
Marek Staron, from the Law Firn White & Case, who are the legal advisors for the
privatization of ST; and Mr. Robert Srnka, PriceWaterHouseCoopers. The mission would
like to thank the Government of Slovak Republic (GOS) and Slovak Telecom (ST) for the
courtesies and cooperation extended throughout its stay in Slovakia. The Mission's findings
and agreements reached are summarized in the following paragraphs, and are subject to
confirmation by the Bank's Management at Headquarters.
(A) SECTOR REFORM
Implementation of the Telecom Policy Paper (Resolution 981/1995)
3.    Attachment # 1 to this Aide Memoire presents a summary of Telecom Sector Reform
actions taken since 1964. In what follows we are going to briefly comment on the main actions
taken and current problems in each of these sector reform areas:
(a) ST PRIVATIZATION PROCESS & LEGISLATION - NEW TELECOM ACT
4.    The last Draft version of the Telecom Law was approved by Government and sent to
Parliament for approval. Parliament had the First Reading of the Law on Tuesday 9 May, 2000,
and approved streamnlined procedure for this Law, and sent to Second Reading. It is expected
that Parliamentary approval would take place by end May/early June 2000, which is the
expected time for submission of the Final Bids by the three pre-qualified Bidders: Deutsche
Telecom, Austrian Telecom and KPN, from Holland. The Mission received copy of the Draft
Telecom Law submitted to Parliament.
5.    The last version of the Telecom Law has solved the problems referred to in the
December 1999 Aide Memoire about tariff approval authority and procedures, leaving it in the
hands of the newly established Regulatory Agency (TOSR). The tariffs setting mechanism, as



-2-
established in the Tariffs Decree, which will be part of ST's license, will be based upon Price
Cap methodology, with a formula: CPI + 6%. The exclusivity granted to ST for the provision
of public voice services through fixed network ends on 31 Dec. 2002. Rural services are not
mentioned in the Law; while Universal Service obligations are defined as relating to: (a)
provision of public phone, data and Fax services; (b) provision of operator services; (c ) free
access to emergency services; (d) provision of public phones; and (e) publication of telephone
directories. Due to the general principles applied throughout Slovak Republic about budgetary
procedures, the Telecom Regulator will not keep the fees charged for its services, but will have
a budgetary allocation (chapter) in the general fiscal budget prepared by MoF.
6.    During the Mission, the Bank sent letters to MoTPT and ST about the "Consent &
Waivers" from the Bank required at the end of the privatization process. The Mission discussed
these issues with the privatization lawyers, White & Case, and with MoTPT, and received
copies of the Draft "Shareholders Agreement" and "Share Purchase and Subscription
Agreement". Early review and comment by the Bank of these documents would ease issuance
of final Consent and Waivers.
(b) LIBERALIZATION.
7.    The Government of Slovak Rep. decided in July 1999 to award the 2 licenses to
operate the GSM 1,800 MHz service to the current GSM 900 MHz cellular operators:
EuroTel and GlobTel. Initially MoTPT had declared that Voice over INTERNER(VoI)
should be considered Basic Voice Service, therefore, provision of this service would be under
the monopoly privilege of ST until end of 2002, and in the meantime EUROTEL -
GLOBTEL cannot offer it. However, after consulting the European Commission, MoTPT
decided to adopt the common European definition of considering Vol as a Value Added
Service, therefore, not covered by ST's exclusivity.
8.     The number of cellular customers has increased as follows:
Item                      1996            1997            1998            1999

(B) PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Procurement and Disbursement
9.    The Mission reviewed progress and updated the Procurement and Disbursement
Monitoring Tables (see Attachment 2 ). ST is making use of the funds of Loan 3637-SK
through 13 Tenders for procurement of equipment plus 4 Consultancy contracts. Contracts have
already been signed for all 13 Equipment related Tenders as well as for the 4 consultancies.
10.   Loan 3637-SK has been divided into two parts: Loan 3637- S, expressed in Currency
Pool Units, which total amount of US$ equivalent 36.4 million was fully disbursed as of May
1998; and Loan 3637-A in US$ for US$ 18.6 million, from which US$ 13.1 million had been
disbursed as of 1 April 2000. Out of the remaining US$ 5.5 million, approximately US$
0.96 million are already committed for contract E-1 1 COPPERNET-96, and US$ 4.5 million
are available.
11.   ST requested the Mission to explore possibility of using around US$ 2.5 million in
financing Amendment # 7 of the contract for SDH Transmission equipment. The mission
has been providing necessary information to Headquarters to seek approval under World
Bank procurement guidelines. This financing would not require extension of the 30 June
2000 Closing Date. The Bank promised to Drovide a final answer on this request before
end of May 2000.
12.  In addition, the mission received the request in principle from Mr. Milan Luknar,
General Director Telecommunications Department, MTPT, asking for the possibility to
utilize part of the remaining funds under this Loan for TA to be provided to the Telecom
Department of MTPT and to the Regulator, TOSR. This financing would require extension
of the 30 June 2000 Closing Date, and MoTPT should ask for that Extension as soon as
possible. MoTPTDept of Telecom to Drovide a final request for use of funds by end-Mav
2000.
Preparation of ICR
13.   The Mission discussed with ST about the preparation of the ICR for Loan 3637-SK.
In particular the Borrower's Contribution, and requested ST assistance in preparing the
Tables about actual Project Financing and Project Cost. ST provided these Tables during the
Mission, and agreed to comment on the draft ICR as soon as provided by the Bank.
Financial Projections
14.   ST Financial Projections are shown in Attachment 3, which also includes a summary
of the assumptions used in the projections, correspond to the Audited version following
International Accounting Standards (IAS). In current Slovak practice there are three (3)
different versions of the Financial Statements: (a) the Statutory Slovak Accounting
Standards version (SAS), which were recently amended moving them closer to IAS; (b) the
Slovak Tax version, which main differences are the treatment of Exchange Rate Adjustment
(not acceptable as Losses), and the Depreciation Life of equipment (example: switching



-4-
equipment is depreciated in 8 years., compared with 20 years for IAS and SAS); and (c ) IAS,
which presents Exchange Rate Adjustments as Losses in the Income Statement.
15.   The Tables of Attachment 3 show the results according to LAS; however, there are
also subtotals showing the partial results before introducing the effect of the Exchange Rate
Adjustments ("paper losses"). As a result of delays in the approval of Tariffs adjustments
and of increased competition from cellular service providers, ST has decreased its Income
Before Tax from SKK 4,219 million in 1997, to SKK 3,087 million in 1998, and to SKK
2,667 million in 1999. After considering the taxes paid and Exchange Rate Adjustment, the
result for the After Tax Profit decreased from SKK 2,233 million in 1997, to SKK 402
million for 1998, and increased to SKK 1,526 in 1999, as a result of the use of deferred taxes.
16.    The Tables also include a breakdown of Revenues by service, which allows to
associate minutes of traffic for each service. Using these data it is possible to calculate the
basic ratios: minutes per line, revenue per minute, etc. (see pages 4 - 5 - and 6).
Interconnection is now the single largest item in Revenue, after surpassing Domestic Long
Distance, International and Local Calls, and this is a non-regulated revenue component.
17.    The following Table compares the current average rates in US$ with the range of
international rates:
Item                Rate per min. in SKK  Rate per min.     International average
in US$ cents        rate in US$ cents
Local call                  0.7               1.7 cent           2 - 3 cents
Domestic LD                 3.7              9.4 cents          4- 7 cents
International
Incoming &                  5.3               11 cents         60- 100 cents
Outgoing                   13.7 _             35 cents
18.  It can be said that in general, current per minute rates in Slovak Republic are not far
from  international standards.  The Service Costing Study reached the same general
conclusions, and indicated that Installation Fees and Monthly Rental are the areas in need of
adjustment. Furthennore, after re-allocating some of the fixed costs from Installation Fee and
Monthly Rental to per minute charges, the Study concludes that in this case Monthly Rental
would break-even, but now Local Calls per minute charge would need adjustment, together
with Installation Fee and International Payphones rates.
