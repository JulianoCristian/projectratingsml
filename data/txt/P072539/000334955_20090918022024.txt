      to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity o f Kerala's key transport
      sector agencies."
      The revised outcome indicators would be (a) reduction in vehicle operating costs
      and travel time by 20 percent o n the approximately 1,450 Km o f roads to be
      upgraded and receive periodic maintenance under the project, and (b) reduction in
      the international roughness index (IN)to 4.5 m / Km on approximately 250 km
      road to be upgraded by end o f the project and (c) increase in portion o f state
      highways in good condition by at least 46% by end o f the project. The other
      development indicators related to road safety and institutional strengthening
      remain the same as originally envisaged in the Project Appraisal Document. ,

Does the restructured project trigger any new safeguard policies? No.

I.         Introduction

  1. This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Board to introduce changes in the
     Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP, P072539, Loan 4653-IN) and the
     accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents.

  2. The Part A o f the project, the corridor improvement component envisaged
     strengthening and widening o f about 581 k m s o f state's primary road network.
     These works were proposed to be taken up in two phases, Phase I    comprising about
     254 km and Phase I1 comprising 327 km. There has been a substantial increase in
     the likely cost o f completion for the civil works for Phase I o f corridor
     improvement component due to time and cost overruns. This l e f t only about U S $
     30 million o f loan for taking up the Phase I1 (about 327 km) corridor improvement
     works, which was grossly inadequate for taking up even one o f the three contracts
     under the Phase I1 improvement works. Accordingly, on M a y 07,2008 Government
     o f Kerala (GOK) had taken a decision (endorsed by the state cabinet) to exclude the
     Phase I1 works (about 327 km out o f the total scope o f about 581 km) from the
     scope o f the project. O n the other hand, GOK, Government o f India (GOI) and the
     Bank agreed to utilize the uncommitted loan amount o f US$ 30 million for
     procuring about 200 km o f additional maintenance works. The procurement for
     these additional maintenance works has also been completed now and the works are
     under implementation. The project needs to be formally restructured to
     accommodate exclusion o f the Phase I1 corridor improvement works (about 327
     km) and inclusion o f additional periodic maintenance works.

  3. The proposed changes, involving modifications in project outcome indicator targets,
     would constitute a first order project restructuring. The restructuring i s aimed
     towards partially mitigating the loss o f time and cost savings benefits arising from
     exclusion o f the Phase I1 corridor improvement works. Moreover, through the
     proposed restructuring, the project development impact could be extended by
     bringing in additional 200 km o f primary road network under improved periodic
     maintenance and safety management framework.

5. Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Progress towards Achievement o f
   PDOs.

The primary project development objectives are (a) to improve traffic flow and road
safety on the state's primary road network, and (b) strengthen institutional and financial
capacities o f the key transport sector agencies. These objectives were originally
envisaged to be achieved through implementation o f the following components - (a)
Transport corridor improvements consisting o f about 581 Km o f high priority state
roads and o f about 90 km o f inland waterways (cost US$ 261 million); (b)
Rehabilitation and Maintenance o f about 1,000 km o f state roads (cost US$ 58.20
million); (c) Road Safety component including policy development towards
comprehensive road safety management, accident management database development,
safety works and equipment (cost U S $ 4.2 million) and (d) Institutional Strengthening
(IS) component including Technical Assistance (TAs) in the area o f road information
and management systems, restructuring o f transport organizations and their core
functions and supporting TAs, training and equipment (cost U S $ 9.5 million).
Contribution o f components (b), (c) and (d) towards achievement o f both the
development objectives are satisfactory. The institutional strengthening and road safety
management improvements already achieved fully satisfy the development objective
(b). The development objective (a) o n improved traffic flow and safety continues to be
relevant. However, the travel time, cost and safety benefits associated with the project
component (a) can be only partially achieved as (i) Phase I1 corridor improvement
                                                      the
works (about 327 Km out o f total o f 580 km) have been excluded from the scope o f the
project due to paucity o f funds and time constraints, and (ii)   completion o f Phase I
corridor improvement works will be delayed by about 30 months. However, the
additional periodic maintenance works have now fully commenced and progressed
about 25% which would compensate the benefits lost f i o m exclusion o f the Phase I1
corridor improvement works. The Phase I corridor improvement works have also
completed about 86% and moved closer to completion. O n balance, the achievement o f
project development objective, can therefore been rated as moderately satisfactory.


6. Project ImplementationProgress

The project implementation progress was downgraded to 'moderately unsatisfactory' in
December 2006 following consistent poor performance o f the project component (a),
mentioned in paragraph 5 above. Consequently, a seven point action plan was agreed
between GOK and the World Bank in December 2006 to bring the project
implementation back to satisfactory status. The action plan can n o w be considered as
fully complied. However, compliance with the action plan entailing streamlining o f
overall project administration has not fully translated into improved physical progress
o f civil works. One o f the four ongoing Phase Icivil works contracts, contract 4b
(representing about 20% o f the ongoing works), was running seriously behind the
agreed schedule and was terminated on February 12, 2009. Procurement and re-
engagement o f contractors for the balance works in contract 4(b) has been concluded
for section 4b(2) and expected to be concluded for section 4b(l) by October 2009. The
implementation progress o f components (b), (c) and (d) are, however, satisfactory.
Nevertheless, the implementation progress o f the largest component o f the project

                                          3
 being `moderately unsatisfactory' the implementation progress o f the overall project
 continues to be rated as 'moderately unsatisfactory'. However, once the loan i s formally
 restructured by excluding the Phase I1 corridor improvement works and the Contract
 4(b) o f Phase Icorridor improvement works resume, the implementation progress can
 be upgraded to `moderately satisfactory'. With improved implementation o f the Phase I
 corridor improvement works and additional periodic maintenance works, the problem
 flag related to l o w disbursement could be removed after resumption o f works in
 contract 4b.

Specific Reasons and Rationale for Proiect Restructuring:

 7. The following factors make a strong case for the proposed project restructuring:

                                1
   a. Funding gap for Phase 1 corridor improvement works component - As explained
      earlier in the project paper, there has been a substantial increase in the likely cost
      o f completion for the civil works for Phase Icorridor improvement component
      due to time and cost overruns. The estimated cost o f civil works under the
      transport corridor improvement component (Phase I and I1 combined) was
      US$199.60 million during appraisal, while the likely completion cost o f only
      Phase I now been estimated at about US$ 162.00 million. This left only about
               has
      U S $ 30 million o f loan for taking up the Phase I1 corridor improvement works,
      which was grossly inadequate for taking up even one o f the three contracts under
      Phase 1 . Moreover, on M a y 07, 2008 Government o f Kerala (GOK) had taken a
              1
      decision (endorsed by the state cabinet) to exclude the Phase I1 works (about 327
      km out o f the total scope o f about 580 km) from the scope o f the project. It was
      also agreed that the Government o f Kerala would continue to finance, beyond
      December 2008, the remaining land acquisition and resettlement and
      rehabilitation works for Phase I1works utilizing their own resources following the
      framework o f the agreed Resettlement Action Plan for the Project. The state
      Government would explore alternate financing resources for implementation o f
      the Phase I1 works. Restructuring o f the project i s therefore fully justified from
      the funding gap point o f view.

   b. Time and Cost Overruns in Phase I corridor improvement Component - The time
      and cost overrun in Phase Icorridor improvement component was largely on
      account o f severe delays in land acquisition and utility relocation. While the
      procedure for land acquisition had been subsequently streamlined, the risks
      associated with delayed land acquisition and utility relocation s t i l l remain high.
      Exclusion o f Phase I1 corridor improvement component remedies that risk
      significantly and restructuring i s justified from an overall risk reduction aspect.

   c. Satisfactory performance o the Periodic Maintenance Improvement Component -
                                   f
       1000 k m s o f periodic maintenance o f primary roads, as originally envisaged have
      been completed with 98% o f these roads having demonstrated satisfactory quality
      and minimal time and cost overruns. These periodic maintenance works included
      considerable safety management and drainage improvement measures besides
      improving the road pavements and had an excellent demonstration impact o n the
      remaining periodic maintenance works being concurrently carried out by G O K

                                            4
       using their own funds. Under the circumstances, inclusion o f the additional
       periodic maintenance works for 200 km primary roads was the best use o f the
       savings o f US$ 30 million resulting from exclusion o f Phase I1 corridor
       improvement works.


 1.
1 1 Proposed Chanves

Changes in Proiect Outcome Indicators

 8. The originally stated Project Development Objective would remain the same as "to
    improve traffic flow and road safety o n Kerala State's Primary road network, and to
    strengthen the institutional and financial capacity o f Kerala's key transport sector
    agencies". The benefits associated with the Project Development Objective, as
    originally anticipated, will not be fully realized though and hence the target value
    for three outcome indicators need to be modified, as explained in paragraph 17.

 Changes in Proiect Design, Scope, and Costs

 9. The following changes in the project scope are proposed -

                          1
 (a) Exclusion o Phase 1 corridor improvement works - This entails exclusion o f the
                f
 entire Phase I1 corridor improvement works involving widening and strengthening o f
 about 327 km o f primary roads in the state. The originally envisaged cost for this
 component as mentioned in the P A D was US$ 101 million. Exclusion o f these works
 has also been endorsed by the Government o f Kerala State Cabinet o n M a y 07, 2008
 through a Government Order.

 (b) Inclusion o additional periodic maintenance works - This entails inclusion o f
                 f
 additional periodic maintenance o f about 200 km o f primary road network in the state
 at an estimated cost o f about US$ 33.0 million. This component would involve
 strengthening o f pavement and improvement o f drainage and road safety measures in
 the selected 200 k m s through eight construction contracts. This component would fully
 utilize the balance US$ 30.0 million relinquished due to exclusion o f Phase I1 corridor
 improvement works and an additional saving o f US$ 3.0 million from the construction
 supervision and project preparation services for corridor improvement works.

 (c) Construction Supervision and Project preparation services - It i s estimated that the
 expenditure for this component till end o f the project would be about US$ 11.5 million
 against the originally allocated amount o f US$ 14.5 million. This savings i s accrued
 primarily on account o f exclusion o f Phase I1 corridor improvement works supervision
 from the scope o f consultant services. The savings are proposed to be fully reallocated
 to the additional periodic maintenance works.

 (d) Goods under the Institutional Strengthening and Road Safety Components. Under
 the goods category, till date the project has disbursed about US$ 1.55 million against
 the originally allocated US$ 7.0 million. The anticipated expenditure (and
 reimbursement) for goods by the end o f the project closure i s expected to be about U S $
 2.2 million. The savings i s accrued primarily on account o f I T equipment which the


                                            5
  state has procured from other funding sources and the savings o f U S $ 4.8 million i s
  proposed to be fully reallocated to the civil works.

10. Revised Cost Allocations - The detailed cost overview o f the restructured project i s
    presented in Table 1. The table indicates both component-wise and category-wise
    costs. The available $-loan amount remains the same as 255 Million.

11.    Procurement Plan. The procurement plan has already been modified and agreed
with the Bank to reflect the change in scope o f the project. The procurement plan i s
attached as Annexure 2 to the Project Paper. The procurement plan includes three
services contracts and one works contracts totaling to about US$ 6.5 million, to be
procured in future. However, all o f these items were originally included in the project
scope and have not resulted due to project restructuring.

12.      Closing Date and Implementation Schedule - It is estimated that at the current
rate o f progress, the remaining works for Phase Icorridor improvement works and the
additional periodic maintenance works would be completed by September 2010. Final
loan extension till December 2010 has been granted o n August 31, 2009 to allow
completion o f all these ongoing works. An implementation schedule has been drawn up
for completing all remaining civil works by September 2010 and would be closely
monitored.

IV.      AppraisaYAnalvsis o f Restructured Proiect Activities

13.     The proposed restructuring does not raise the environmental category o f the
project. The classification remains as Category A under the Bank's OP 4.01. There are no
new environmental safeguard policies triggered. The existing Environmental & Social
Management Framework (ESMF) for the periodic maintenance works has been updated
to reflect inclusion o f the 200 km additional periodic maintenance works.

14.     The additional periodic maintenance component i s already under implementation.
In fact all contracts are in progress and the cumulative progress has reached 25%. The
procurement plan has been updated to include the additional periodic maintenance works.
These works are being fully supervised by the GOK P W D Engineers.

15.     The proposed project restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank
policies.

 16.    The costs and the benefits o f the restructured project would undergo changes with
the exclusion o f Phase I1 corridor improvement works and expansion o f periodic
maintenance works. The revised Net Present Value (NPV) @ 12% discount rate, as
presented in the table below, indicate that the restructured projects would s t i l l remain

V.       Expected Outcomes

17.    The proposed changes do not alter the original PDOs and outcome indicators,
with the following exceptions:

                                             7
      a. The reduction in vehicle operating and travel cost by 20 percent will be achieved
         on approximately 1,450 km o f roads to be upgraded and receive periodic
         maintenance instead o f about 1,600 km as originally envisaged.

      b. The reduction in the International Roughness index (IRI) to 4.5dKt-n be achieved
         on about 254 km o f road to be upgraded instead o f about 581 km as originally
         envisaged.

      c. Increase in portion o f state highway network to good condition by 46% against
         50% as originally envisaged.

The revised End o f project targets for the various outcome and output indicators are
presented in Annex 1 to t h i s project paper.

VI.        Benefits and R i s k s

18.      Benefits - Major benefits from the project restructuring include the following:

  i. Deepening and further consolidation o f the project development impact associated
     with the periodic maintenance works and improving the overall asset management
     culture in the state; and

  i
 i . Effective utilization o f the savings accrued from cancellation o f the Phase I1
     corridor improvement works from the scope o f the project.

 19.   Restructuring R i s k s - The governance, management and results-delivery risks
associated with the more complex corridor improvement works will be substantially
reduced due to exclusion o f the Phase I1 improvement works. Moreover, the state in
consultation with the Bank has already developed and started implementing a plan to
                                                                                1
deter any potential re-encroachment o f the land already acquired for Phase 1 . It has also
been agreed and documented in the December 2008 Aide Memoire that the Bank would
continue to monitor the compliance with the resettlement and rehabilitation framework
for Phase I1 corridor improvement component. O n the other hand, the implementation o f
periodic maintenance component has been largely successful, completed with minimal
time and cost overrun and contract disputes. Increasing the scope o f this component by an
additional 20% would bear l o w risk with reference to the probability o f their occurrence
as well as their potential to impact the effective, efficient and transparent delivery o f the
intended results from the restructuring.
