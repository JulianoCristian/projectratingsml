The\n            changes, involving modifications in project outcome\n            indicator targets, will constitute a first order project\n            restructuring. The restructuring is aimed towards partially\n            mitigating the loss of time and cost savings benefits\n            arising from exclusion of the second phase corridor\n            improvement works. Moreover, through the restructuring, the\n            project development impact can be extended by bringing in\n            additional 200 km of primary road network under improved\n            periodic maintenance and safety management framework."}, "docdt": "2009-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
