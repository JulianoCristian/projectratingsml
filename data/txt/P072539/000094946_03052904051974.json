For the road component, a number of\n            additional structures will be provided in new alignment\n            areas for better drainage. Riverbanks as well as riverbeds\n            are suffering from erosion. Retaining walls will be\n            constructed in areas where the expected erosion rates are\n            high. Quarrying will be carried out at approved and licensed\n            sites. Potential sources of noise pollution will be\n            controlled by strict procedures for issuing and controlling\n            driving licenses, noise pollution legislation, and noise\n            barriers. Tree removals must be approved by the authorities\n            and trees must be replaced by planting at least twice the\n            number removed. In the waterways component, a portion of the\n            side bunds are prone to erosion. Quarrying of construction\n            material will be restricted to licensed contractors. The\n            side bunds will be reconstructed and will constitute the\n            single largest share of the total investment for the\n            implementation of the project. The water quality is already\n            known to be poor and will require a comprehensive approach,\n            rather than the scope of this project, to clean up the pollution."}, "docdt": "2002-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
