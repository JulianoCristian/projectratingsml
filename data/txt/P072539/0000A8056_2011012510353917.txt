                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           1. While substantial completion of civil works would be achieved by the loan closure, minor ancillary works for the corridor improvement and the additional periodic maintenance
                         works, valued at about Rs. 30-35 crores would spill over to beyond the loan closure date. The state Government will have to bear the expenses associated with the ancillary works
                         for satisfactory completion of the balance ancillary works for the corridor improvement and additional periodic maintenance component, valued at about INR 35 crores, beyond the
                         loan closure date of December 2010. saatisfactory contract 4b(i) would be closely monitored by Government of Kerala (GoK) as the completion of that contract by loan closuredate of
                         December 2010 would be critical.

                         2. The project would still have to spend about USD 50 million during the remianingperiod and processing of bills and reimbursement claims by Government of Kerala would be
                         expedited.

                         3. GoK would ensure that the revised PWD Codes and manuls are given effcet to by the loan closure and all new systems (including the road mainatenance          management

                         system, financial management system and IT backbone system WINGs) would be sustained beyond the loan closure.
