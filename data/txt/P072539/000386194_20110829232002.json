Transport\n            Project for India were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: project preparation. The period between\n            the completion of the preparation and commencement of\n            implementation should be minimized (preferably should be\n            within one year) to avoid major variations of the existing\n            physical conditions of pavement. Raising awareness for\n            financing such single state projects, substantive capacity\n            building and training on safeguards, environmental,\n            financial and procurement aspects should be planned for the\n            project implementation agency (PWD). Safeguards management\n            aspects were environmental aspect, social aspects. The\n            introduction of the direct purchase method allowed the\n            Project affected peoples PAPs to participate in the process\n            of fixing land value and a fair chance to demand for due\n            price for their asset loss. Effective and efficient project\n            management implementing agency's project management\n            unit should be put in place including key personnel before\n            mobilization of contractor with due authority of decision\n            making to manage the project.
