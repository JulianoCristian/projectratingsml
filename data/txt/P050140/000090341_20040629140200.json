The lessons learned indicate that\n            introduction of provider contracting and changes in provider\n            payment mechanisms need to be supported by substantial\n            efforts to increase information flow, provider\n            accountability, quality assurance and appropriate service\n            delivery reforms to achieve the expected results. Unless\n            public financing constitutes a significant share of provider\n            income and the purchaser has the ability to enforce\n            accountability, new provider payment systems are unlikely to\n            have a significant impact on provider performance and\n            efficiency. In a system with substantial excess capacity,\n            payment reforms and provider autonomy alone will not result\n            in significant efficiency improvements nor systems\n            rationalization, if not supported by more decisive measures\n            to concentrate resources on selected providers or active\n            supply side interventions to reduce over capacity. Need to\n            supplement class room and hospital based family medicine\n            training with clinical training to allow family doctors to\n            gain hands on experience in clinical setting. Need to\n            improve the regulatory framework for family medicine in\n            order to ensure that newly trained family doctors and family\n            medicine nurses can practice their new skills and family\n            medicine concept. The project demonstrated that any design\n            weaknesses and/or emerging policy issues can be effectively\n            addressed during implementation by using other Bank\n            instruments, such as a structural adjustment lending program."}, "docdt": "2004-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
