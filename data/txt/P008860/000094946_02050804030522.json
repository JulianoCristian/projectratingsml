The first, the Micro-Projects\n            Component, provides grants in the form of community-based\n            projects to restore basic social and economic services and\n            infrastructure in response to local priority needs, and\n            sponsored programs to support projects provided for\n            particular vulnerable groups. The second component, the\n            Micro-Finance Component, provides credit-lines to\n            micro-finance institutions to expand existing programs to\n            poor groups, particularly women, and providing technical\n            assistance and training to MFIs to increase their capacity\n            to effectively manage their operations.
