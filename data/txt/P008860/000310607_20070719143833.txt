1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background
Tajikistan is the poorest country in ECA. The estimated per capita income at SPAP inception was
US$170. Education and health systems were collapsing, most industries were going through a
long and painful process of transition to a market economy, agriculture, a substantial part of the
economy, had been hit hard by a drought, and the country was receiving considerable amounts of
food aid. After independence in 1991, the economic collapse was exacerbated by a combination
of civil war and localized natural disasters. The end of the civil war in 1997 and the government's
pursuit of sound macroeconomic management through controlling inflation, privatization,
financial sector restructuring and transfer of land to the private sector led to economic
stabilization since 2002. Real GDP growth turned positive, and has averaged 10% per annum in
the early 2000s and GDP per capita doubled in 2000-05. Poverty overall declined but remained
high with 64% of the population living below the poverty line of US$2.15/day in 2003 (compared
to 88% in 2000), and the impact of economic growth on poverty was low - the poverty to growth
elasticity was only about 0.4 in 2003, compared to about 3 in middle income countries. Poverty
was most severe in the remote mountainous areas, where the population increasingly comprised
of very young and elderly. Women were disproportionately poor, often left caring for households
as men have left the villages to search for work, or widowed during the war. Poverty was also
prevailing among those without access to social safety nets, arable land or employment.

Sector Background

Unlikely attainment of MDGs. At the time of project preparation, Tajikistan was highly unlikely
to meet the MDGs on child and maternal mortality, gender equality in school, school enrollment,
incidence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and access to improved water sources. In 2002, infant
mortality of 43.8 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality of 45 per 100,000 live births were
among the highest in ECA and increasing. School enrollment, once nearly 100%, was rapidly
declining, particularly among girls and in grades 6-11. Girls' upper secondary school attendance
rate went down to as low as 38% in 2003. Incidence of tuberculosis reached 60.4 new cases per
100,000. Malnutrition was prevalent in many parts of the country, with, for example, as much as
39% of children in the Kurgan-Tube region affected with chronic malnutrition and 7% suffering
from acute malnutrition. Less than 50% of households had access to piped water. Meeting the
income poverty reduction target was also highly unlikely since over 40% of the population was
unemployed.

Obsolete social infrastructure providing social services of low quality and limited outreach.
Education, health and the limited social safety net were all in need of fundamental reforms to
improve access, quality and efficiency of service provision. Their extensive but obsolete physical
assets had not been maintained properly due to lack of funds. Only 7% of the schools had
undertaken capital repairs between 1999 and 2004. In 2001-2002, 17% of urban and 12% of rural
schools were closed for over a week for lack of electricity, heating or hazardous conditions. The
inadequate school infrastructure resulted in inappropriate and unsafe learning environment for
children that had been compounded by the departure of qualified teachers driven by low salaries
and poor working conditions, resulting in a dramatic deterioration in the quality of learning. Some
50% of the primary health facilities experienced shortage of electricity, 15% of all health
facilities had no water supply, 6% had no electricity, 15% lacked equipment and 50% were short
of drugs in stock. Other services were also disrupted - out of 699 centralized water supply
systems in the country, 113 were essentially inoperable and 358 did not meet sanitary standards,


                                                 11

and sewer services were available to just 23% of the urban and 5% of the rural population. In
addition, as responsibility for basic social services lay largely with local government, the lack of
funds at local level had led to the effective privatization of many services and to mounting
informal payments that widened the gap in utilization rates between the poor and wealthy.

Low level of state financing for the social sectors. The loss of transfers from the FSU after
independence in 1991 and the tight budget constraints since 1995 restricted government
expenditures for social sectors to 20% of GDP in 2000-2002 compared to around 50% in 1990s.
While the nominal value of social sector spending almost doubled in 2000-2002, its share in
overall public expenditures increased only marginally from 34.4% to 36.3% and its share in GDP
remained low: around 2.5% for social protection expenditures, around 2% for expenditures on
public health and around 4% for education expenditures. International donor programs partially
offset the gap by contributing up to 10% of GDP in 2000-2003. In this environment, it was
imperative to allocate resources effectively, considering local investment programs along with
community priorities.

Shortcomings in public service provision were rooted in limited decentralization and
insufficient capacity of line ministries and local governments to reach the poor and
underserved communities and foster community mobilization. In the immediate aftermath of
the social conflict, the central and the local government institutions had limited capacity to plan,
manage and monitor multi-sectoral investments in local public goods targeted to the poorest and
most vulnerable segments of the population. Local governance was also weak and required
applying the stricter social fund fiduciary responsibilities. These shortcomings of regular public
service provision made the use of social fund type of service delivery mechanism a viable
investment alternative.

Rationale for Bank Assistance
The Second Poverty Alleviation Project (SPAP) was designed to support the objectives of the
then ongoing 1998 Tajikistan CAS and the next 2003 CAS which was under preparation. The
1998 CAS called for poverty reduction through employment-intensive growth, promoting of
opportunities for the poor, improvement of the quality, access and coverage of social services,
targeted assistance to the poorest through community-based and demand driven interventions and
enhancement of institutional capacity. The 2003 CAS promoted sustaining stabilization and
macroeconomic growth, structural reforms and institutional capacity enhancement for long-term
development. In the same vein, it called for assisting the poor and vulnerable, through, inter alia,
employment-intensive growth, promotion of educational and employment opportunities for the
poor, and improvement of the coverage, access and quality of social services supported by public
service delivery mechanisms which envisage participation of local governments and communities
through community-level demand-driven initiatives. To support the 1998 and 2003 CAS goals,
SPAP implemented micro projects and promoted community empowerment aimed at: (i) helping
poor people access basic social infrastructure and services and providing income generating
opportunities in remote parts of the country where the outreach of the central government
institutions was weak; (ii) encouraging partnerships of communities with local government
administration, community mobilization, self-help initiatives and positive social capital building;
(iii) improving the quality of social services; (iv) informing the PRSP process with community-
level disaggregated data on living conditions and access to social services and infrastructure; (v)
building institutional and project delivery capacity in the National Social Investment Fund of
Tajikistan (NSIFT).

The Bank was well positioned to support this project. It had over 15 years of diverse experience
in investing in social funds worldwide, including in 24 social funds in ECA. In Tajikistan, the



                                                  12

Bank had accumulated experience on how to make a good use of the social fund instrument for
alleviating poverty among the poorest based on the lessons learned from the Pilot Poverty
Alleviation Project's (PPAP) controversial implementation record. The Bank had supported the
NSIFT since its establishment in 1997 through building capacity for prudent financial
management, procurement, recruitment policy and community outreach which NSIFT had been
transferring later to other project implementing agencies in the country. The Bank could integrate
the design of the social fund in the context of a broader policy dialogue with the government and
within a comprehensive investment lending program aimed at the development of all social
sectors for poverty reduction. The Bank had catalytic capacity for establishing collaborative
networks with other donors in support of government reforms, as well as for intermediation
between government development policies and community-based interventions.

The PDO, as stated in Schedule 2 of the DCA is "to improve the living standards of the poor and
increase their access to economic and social services". In the PAD, the PDO was formulated in a
more specific way: "to improve the living standards of the poor and vulnerable people through
MP, microfinance services and community empowerment in areas served by the project". The
key performance monitoring indicators, as outlined in the Supplemental Letter and the PAD were:

· An increase in the poor people's access to, and use of social infrastructure and services;
· 90% of MP fully functioning and adequately maintained after 9 months;
· 75% of implementing agencies (communities and sponsoring organizations) continuing
    activities and/or undertaking new activities after completion of the projects;
· An increase in the access to, and use of, projects and services through sponsored programs,
    especially by vulnerable groups (female headed households, the elderly, people with
    disabilities, etc.);
· Positive beneficiary assessments of experiences with participatory and collaborative planning
    and implementation of micro projects;
· An increase in poor people's (and especially vulnerable group's) use of micro credit services
    offered under the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO, as stated in the DCA, has not been revised. However, because the microfinance
component was dropped, the PDO statement in the PAD was changed to exclude microfinance
services. This change was made at MTR (January 20 ­ February 15, 2005) and formalized with
amendments to the DCA and PA of May 31, 2006.

The PDO monitoring indicators were updated in July 2003 following the regular supervision
mission and a workshop on mechanisms for collecting and processing indicators held for NSIFT
staff to ensure that these indictors are outcome-oriented, measurable, concrete and amenable for
data-collection.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

While the project was nationwide in scope, the primary target group consisted of those defined as
vulnerable poor and extreme poor, including unemployed or working poor, war- and drought-
affected villages, disabled, elderly and female-headed households. SPAP was expected to finance



                                                 13

around 340 MP targeting between 400,000 and 700,000 beneficiaries, with majority of the
projects benefiting the poorest people, i.e. those living in rural and particularly
mountainous/remote areas and those at a particular disadvantage. It was also expected that an
estimated total of 10,000 ­ 15,000 clients would benefit over four years from the SPAP
microfinance program. NSIFT staff, CDC members, local governments and local NGOs were
expected to benefit from institution and capacity building in the form of training for project
management, communication, participatory techniques, entrepreneurship, fundraising and other
needs articulated by the communities.

1.5 Original Components

The original project components were as follows:

1. Component 1: Micro Projects (US$9.96 million) ­ provision of grants in the form of (i)
Community-Based / Infrastructure Micro Projects to restore basic social and economic services
and infrastructure in response to local priority needs and with the involvement of beneficiaries in
the design and implementation of those projects, and (ii) Sponsored Programs to support projects
addressing the needs of particular poor and vulnerable groups. Specific for the sponsored projects
was their demand-driven nature and their awarding and implementation through sponsoring
organizations (intermediaries) primarily NGOs, since the beneficiaries were lacking the capacity
to apply and carry out the projects on their own.

2. Component 2: Microfinance (US$1.46 million) - provision of credit lines to competitively
selected MFIs to expand existing microfinance programs to poor groups, particularly women, and
providing technical assistance and training to MFIs to increase their capacity to effectively
manage their operations and support their growth in a sustainable manner.

3. Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management (US$2.38 million) ­
(i) institutional strengthening of the NSIFT as an institution to carry out projects but also to
implement programs financed by other donors, through the provision of training, technical
assistance and links with other social funds active in the region; (ii) investment in project
management to ensure effective and efficient implementation pf project activities.

1.6 Revised Components

The Microfinance component was cancelled following important changes in the microfinance
industry, more specifically:

·   The adoption of new microfinance legislation. The Law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On
    Microfinance Organizations" was adopted on May 17, 2004. It required from microfinance
    providers to register as non-bank financial institutions and mandated legal separation of
    microfinance from the other operations of non-profit or for-profit entities. For NSIFT,
    entering into micro lending could have implicated undermining its comparative advantage in
    being able to reach the poorest, most remote and vulnerable communities with MP. (More
    details on the rationale for the elimination of this component and the decision making process
    are provided in Annex 2).

·   Increase in the supply of microfinance. Commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions
    entered micro lending and boosted competition thus undermining the attractiveness of and
    demand for the microfinance program of NSIFT. Other international donors started providing
    grants or subsidized micro lending with the same consequences for NSIFT.



                                                 14

·   Risks for sustainability and efficiency of micro lending. The risks increased as a result of
    limited institutional efficiency of the local microfinance NGOs and non-leveled lending
    criteria across international donors.

1.7 Other significant changes


The following amendments were made to the DCA and PA:

1. Amendments of DCA and PA of May 31, 2006, to drop the Microfinance Component and
    reallocate unspent funds to the Micro Project component as follows:

2. Amendments of DCA and PA of May 27, 2004, to harmonize the procurement prior review
    thresholds and statement of expenditure thresholds;

3. Amendment of DCA and PA of May 20, 2003, to secure a waiver for the MFIs eligible to
    participate in the NSIFT micro lending scheme to register with the National Bank of
    Tajikistan in order to conduct microfinance activities, and to tighten their financing reporting
    requirements.

There were two other changes made that affected the project:

1. DFID extended a co-financing grant at the amount of BP1.5 million (US$2.9 million) for
    strengthening the capacity of NSIFT and its partners to promote pro-poor development and
    community empowerment. The grant became effective in August 2004, and closed on May
    31, 2007;



                                                 15

2. The overall credit amount expressed in US dollar terms increased by US$2.2 million (from
    US$13.8 million to US$16.0 million equivalent), as a result of the appreciation of the SDR
    towards the US dollar.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


The project was assessed for Quality at Entry in June 2002 and was found to be satisfactory. The
design of SPAP also benefited from the recommendations of a Microfinance "Clinic" organized
by the Social Protection Network.

On the positive side, the project design built on positive and negative lessons and on the
successful interventions from PPAP's micro project and microfinance programs. It also benefited
from the Bank's global experience in social funds design. The PPAP experience indicated that the
next operation should be simplified in terms of number of components and implementing
agencies and should remain focused on activities for which capacity is available or can be quickly
developed. Compared to PPAP, the design of the SPAP micro projects was improved by
increasing the role of the communities in needs assessment, project preparation, implementation
and maintenance; by strengthening the arrangements for project sustainability; and by introducing
the concept of community-driven innovative MPs ("sponsored MPs") along with the `traditional'
social infrastructure MPs. The MP coverage expanded geographically, and their role in gender
mainstreaming was reinforced. The SPAP increased the investment in people while improving the
standards of technical assistance and making it more demand-driven. Last, the SPAP design took
into account the need of strong management and leadership in promoting community involvement
and strengthening community ownership.

The project was prepared in a participatory manner and benefited from staff continuity in NSIFT
and the Bank. Participatory project preparation process was built-in at MP level as well. Donors
and NGOs were consulted. The design envisaged good amount of training of all project
stakeholders to foster their capacity for project work and for building of partnerships.

The Government of Tajikistan demonstrated its commitment at project preparation by issuing on
February 27, 2002 Decree No. 67 "On the National Social Investment Fund of Tajikistan" which
clarified the mandate and functions of NSIFT, regulated its relations with other institutions and
the provision of counterpart funds for financing of NSIFT maintenance and staff costs.

A number of risks were identified and mitigation measures were proposed at project design. The
highest risk rating was ascribed to the likely political pressure and interference in the selection of
MPs and partners following the history of political pressure and meddling, unaccountability,
corruption and misuse of funds which had occurred in the PPAP. In SPAP, this risk was
moderated through making the selection procedures for communities, NGOs and MP simpler and
more transparent, establishment of CDC, and training of NSIFT core staff and communities in
Bank procedures and fiduciary requirements. The risk related to the availability of counterpart
funds was mitigated through covenanting the counterpart funding in the legal agreement. The risk
associated with the accuracy of the targeting the poor and most vulnerable was reduced through
undertaking a social assessment which revealed that urban dwellers on average were 20% less
likely to be poor than the majority of the population who lived in the rural areas due to easier
access to basic social infrastructure (e.g., better-quality schools and hospitals) and economic
infrastructure (markets). These facts made rural poverty a more pressing issue in Tajikistan and


                                                  16

highlighted the variations in which urban and rural dwellers experience poverty. Further, the
SPAP design extended the work of NSIFT in targeting poor communities and groups through a
targeting strategy based on geographic and proxy poverty indicators. This work built on the
results of the available analytical work at the time, including the survey of living standards
carried out in 1999, the World Bank poverty assessment of the following year, the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, also on the social assessment done for the design of the SPAP by the
World Bank, and on administrative data and other donor agencies' data. In addition, NSIFT
undertook regional and community-level surveys to select the poorest communities in every
administrative district. NSIFT achieved greater outreach to especially vulnerable and poor groups
through applying selection criteria which favored proposals from selected vulnerable groups. The
level of community contribution was set at a level ensuring that the poorest are not excluded.

On the negative side, the SPAP design did not link explicitly the micro project concept and the
capacity building for NSIFT staff to a strategy for NSIFT's institutional evolution in parallel with
the country's move out of post-conflict status, and to building preconditions for NSIFT's
sustainable functioning beyond the completion of SPAP. During project implementation NSIFT
did evolve into a community infrastructure fund with capacity for community empowerment and
social infrastructure building, however, no clear vision of how NSIFT's human capacity, assets,
networks and know-how could be used in case of reduction of donor funding (e.g. for
management of government funds, for knowledge sharing of piloted community-based
approaches, for building of public private partnerships, etc.) existed at SPAP closure.

The SPAP design also underestimated the volatility of the microfinance sector. As a result, the
main risks that materialized were related to the microfinance program which by design was over-
reliant on replicating earlier NGO microfinance delivery models. The design did not address fully
the recommendations of the Social Fund and Microfinance Clinic for SPAP, especially with
respect to the need of developing institutionally sustainable MFIs. At implementation the inherent
problems of having a social fund as a delivery mechanism for microfinance were exacerbated by
unclear legal environment, divergent financing terms, performance and lending criteria across
donors, and rapid loss of NGO capacity when donor funding is disconnected. As a result the
Microfinance component was not implemented and SPAP could not provide affordable micro
credits and technical assistance to some poor and vulnerable groups. This was especially valid for
poor women heading households with elderly and many children in the rural and mountainous
communities. Awareness of the forthcoming legal changes and ex ante assessment of the status
and capacity of the microfinance sector along with linkages with the Bank project in the financial
sector could have led to reconsidering the existence and/or format of the microfinance component.

2.2 Implementation

The implementation of SPAP was successful. SPAP was only the second Bank project in
Tajikistan which was completed within its original implementation period of 4.5 years and was
fully disbursed. At effectiveness, SPAP was a high risk project, qualified as such because of the
troubled implementation history of its predecessor ­ the PPAP, and the subsequent likelihood of
facing similar issues of corruption, political pressure and meddling, unaccountability, actions
without Bank's no objection, etc. There was an understanding that during the first year of
implementation this rating will be revisited conditional on performance. The SPAP's risk status
was changed from high to substantive on March 6, 2003 as the project supervision team estimated
that those risks have diminished and the new NSIFT administration had started to prove itself.

SPAP managed to avoid the most serious risks associated with the implementation of PPAP. This
was achieved through intensive training and capacity building for good governance at NSIFT and



                                                 17

MP level; development of annual investment plans; putting in place of a structured process of
community participation in procurement; addressing the needs of a project in full as much as
possible, e.g. providing equipment for a school as well as the building. The Board of NSIFT
which included high level government officials and NGO representatives was well functioning,
effective in project oversight and added value through its guidance.

The implementation of the project was supervised regularly and the emerging issues were
addressed in a timely manner. Implementation was delayed in 2003-2004, but picked up later on
following the hiring of additional procurement staff, raising the ceiling on contracts which
required Bank no objection; raising the ceilings of MP approvals by NSIFT Executive Board,
initiating an amendment to the DCA to harmonize procurement and disbursement thresholds and
de-concentrating of NSIFT's functions to the regions. Procedures and reporting were simplified
to reduce processing time. The administrative costs of NSIFT which were alarmingly high in the
first 2.5 years of implementation (mainly related to the opening of new offices and expansion of
the project coverage throughout the whole country which is 93% mountainous) were cut down to
9.93% (or barely below the limit of 10%).

NSIFT was subject to external monitoring - an independent Process Review was completed in
January 2005 by an international consultant and a Technical Audit in November 2005 by a team
of international consultants. The Process Review concluded that: (i) positive social capital has
been accumulated during project implementation, (ii) the MPs are well targeted and implemented
with satisfactory quality and high level of community participation, and (iii) some of the
innovative MPs could be used as models and replicated in other communities. The Technical
Audit found the quality of NSIFT's civil works comparable if not higher than in similar projects.
Both the Audit and the Review acknowledged the structured community mobilization and
participation process as a main strength and comparative advantage of NSIFT.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project design identified indicators and possible data collection methods to monitor progress
towards the PDO outcomes and component results. The PDO indicators aimed at measuring the
impact of the project in terms of: (i) increase in poor people's access to quality social services and
infrastructure; (ii) sustainability of MP results / post-completion operation; (iii) sustainability of
the civil society organizations that have implemented MPs; (iv) increase in the access of most
vulnerable people to improved services and infrastructure; (v) beneficiary feedback on the
participatory experiences of planning and implementing MPs; (vi) creation of new temporary and
permanent jobs. Component-level output indicators were also identified to measure: (i) SPAP's
contribution to the expansion of social services and facilities; the scope of decentralization of
management and contracting to the communities; the NGO involvement in sponsored projects
and the number of their beneficiaries, and (ii) NSIFT's management capacity and institutional
strengthening. Some of the indicators could potentially measure certain aspects of community
empowerment. The PDO indicators were updated in the second half of 2003 to better capture the
focus of the project, become more measurable, concrete and amenable to data collection. The
update was followed by a workshop on mechanisms for collecting and processing data,
definitions of indicators and their use in the decision making process.

The information for tracking these indicators was supposed to be generated internally ­ by NSIFT,
through the MIS, the data collecting in the regional offices, site visits and inspections, NSIFT
annual reports. External sources were envisaged as well, as data submissions by NGOs, Bank
supervision missions, MTR and post-completion visits. This type of data was collected regularly.
Along with that, extensive administrative socio-economic data and household-level data on



                                                  18

consumption, incomes and assets was collected at project inception and used to underpin the
poverty targeting of MPs. Technical assistance was provided to NSIFT on planning, M&E but a
significant part of it took place as late as the middle of 2006, and was rather geared towards a
follow-on project. The technical assistance addressed the fundamentals of participatory M&E of
community-driven projects and impact assessment in the context of project management
decentralization to the regions and de-concentration to the community level, and in view of future
more intensified work with donors, civil society, central and local government, but in certain
instances it was fairly theoretical.

The project level data collected through the MIS and in other ways was used for management and
reporting purposes. The development of MIS modules started under the SPAP while the DFID
grant allowed integration of the modules into a M&E system. Under SPAP, the following
modules were put in place: cost estimation for infrastructure projects which uses the Russian
standards of construction for bill of materials; human resources management module; document
management system; accounting system for the MP portfolio. The NSIFT regional offices
supplemented the MIS data with surveys of the beneficiary satisfaction with the MP and the
participatory process, other qualitative and anecdotal data. The physical monitoring of the
implementation of micro projects was done through routine visits of NSIFT staff and consultants
from the central and regional offices to check the progress and quality of the works. Technical
and monitoring data was recorded in the project dossiers. A paper-based dossier for each project
was kept in NSIFT's office and documentation was available for internal monitoring at any stage
of the project cycle. At the time of the Technical Audit, the MIS capacity for recording of unit
costs, analysis of costs and efficiency at project level had been found insufficient. Since then the
analytical and informative value of the MIS data for construction works had improved and the
system has become capable of generating the missing data.

There are two major weaknesses in the M&E design, which affected implementation and
utilization, and which are also the sources of the gap in the information needs for this ICR:

· Absence of baseline indictors of living standards in the poor regions and communities. The
     household-level data on consumption, incomes and assets collected at project inception could
     have been used beyond its primary objective of poverty targeting (selection of poor
     communities where the SPAP interventions should take place). If it had been collected using
     a uniform methodology for measurement of consumption and certain non-income dimensions
     of poverty, this data could have served for the establishment of baseline indicators of living
     standards. Since this data had been collected shortly before selecting the beneficiary
     communities it could have been used for impact evaluation as well. It would have been even
     more useful to collect household-level consumption data in a way which would allow its
     comparability across regions and beneficiary communities. If complemented with end-of-
     project data, the baseline data on the living standards of beneficiaries would have allowed for
     a comprehensive measurement of the project's contribution to the change of living standards
     at community and region level;

· Conduction of a beneficiary impact assessment was not envisaged ex ante in the project
     design. Implementing of such an assessment became possible shortly after the completion of
     SPAP thanks to the DFID co-financing grant which was extended in 2004. The beneficiary
     impact assessment measured the change in living standards through self-reporting of incomes
     before and after the implementation of SPAP MPs in the treatment group of communities and
     compared the changes with those in the control group. Due to the long recall period of 5 years
     and other methodological limitations, this approach could not provide accurate measurement
     of the expected increase in living standards.


                                                  19

Another point worthy of mentioning is that the data collected during the project and the data
generated by the MIS has been used for project management and reporting but it has been less
important for informing decision-making and resource allocation processes. NSIFT used to
provide regularly reports on its projects to the line ministries and PRSP unit but it is not possible
to confirm that they have been used in policy making. At ICR, representatives of line social
ministries reported that the NSIFT reports were informative but mostly output and process-
oriented and of less analytical value, or of policy relevance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


The NSIFT's financial management systems, including project accounting and financial reporting,
internal controls, staffing, disbursements, and auditing arrangements were adequate during SPAP
implementation. There were no shortcomings in terms of delays in provision of counterpart funds,
and submission of annual audit reports happened in a timely manner.

Procurement and financial management reviews found no significant gaps in use of funds and
application of Bank procedures.

There were no environmental issues during project implementation given the relatively small size
of civil works. At submission for financing, the MPs were subject to environmental review as per
the Operations Manual. The review was conducted by NSIFT which had sufficient institutional
capacity. NSIFT's inspection visits to MPs sites scrutinized the environmental impacts and made
sure that MPs with likely negative environmental impact would not be financed. The
implementation of the approved MPs was done in compliance with the national environmental
legislation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


At project level NSIFT had introduced technical, financial and institutional provisions to ensure
post-completion maintenance of the MPs. They included:

· micro project maintenance / sustainability plans which ensured that user value of the services
    did not deteriorate. The requirements for the future operation and maintenance of each MP
    had been identified as early as at the design stage. The MP sustainability plan was then
    prepared for each project, including a rather detailed inventory of the sustainability
    requirements, covering both physical and financial requirements (costs of operation,
    maintenance, cleaning, spare parts) of the respective MP. These requirements were, however,
    generally not calculated, but estimated. Detailed and signed commitments from all concerned
    parties for meeting these requirements were also provided, including schedules of committed
    community in-kind and cash contribution over a period of 2-3 years;

· inclusion of the new or rehabilitated physical assets in the balance sheets of local councils
    and local governments (e.g. schools or social care centers) or regional hospitals (health
    centers) so that adequate financing of staff salaries and utility costs is guaranteed.

A follow on operation ­ Third Poverty Alleviation Project (TPAP) ­ was requested by the Prime
Minister of Tajikistan in the end of 2006. The agreement to support this operation was
communicated by the Bank on January 17, 2007. TPAP is included in the FY06-09 CPS. This is
expected to be a small-scale, less investment-intensive operation (IDA grant) with a catalytic role



                                                  20

for the engagement of other donors in technical assistance, co-financing and parallel financing.
TPAP is planning to focus on piloting of innovative investments in human and social capital
building. It will also aim at ensuring that follow up MPs fit into the local development strategies
and action plans, and enhance empowerment of poor communities while strengthening the
linkages of communities with local governments in the process of project planning and
implementation. A Memorandum of Understanding for a new (second) project was signed
between KfW and NSIFT on May 15, 2007. The KfW grant at the amount of Euro 5 million will
be allocated for school infrastructure financing in Khatlon region.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of the SPAP remain relevant and consistent with
Tajikistan's current development priorities outlined in the NDS for 2006­2015 and the second
PRSP for 2007­2009. Both strategies address what needs to be done to meet the MDGs and
reduce poverty. The PRSP for 2007­2009 provides a comprehensive and prioritized medium-term
program aimed at promoting sustainable improvements in the living standard of the population, in
particular of the socially vulnerable groups. This will be achieved through, inter alia, investments
in health and education services, empowering communities for development, and strengthening
the social partnership. Eradication of extreme poverty and hunger and decrease in poverty
measured by $2.15/day PPP indicator to 32% in 2015 are among the key objectives of the NDS.
The NDS identifies obsolete social infrastructure as a core problem, puts forward plans for
conducting inventory of infrastructure and sets specific objectives for further increase in the
capacity of social institutions and the quality of social services. The NDS envisages participatory
monitoring and assessment of program results with local self-government bodies and civil society.

The SPAP focus on improving the living standards of the poor and increasing their access to
economic and social services is compliant with the current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals outlined in the FY06-09 CPS and IDA's analytical and advisory
services. Despite the impressive growth rates the social indicators (primary and secondary school
enrollment rates, infant mortality, maternal mortality, incidence of tuberculosis, and child
malnutrition) have only recently begun to stabilize and reverse. Tajikistan remains the only
country in ECA unlikely to achieve most of its MDGs. The CPS leading country-level outcome is
improvement of the living conditions of the population and the potential for economic growth
through improved delivery of municipal services (water, sewage, waste management, increase in
poor people's access to essential economic and social services, improved access to and quality of
health services, increased consumption of safe water, improved learning conditions (as proxy for
improved learning achievement) in schools. The social investment fund type of project also
remains adequate as an instrument for coping with the shortcomings in regular service provision,
fostering local institutional development, and reaching the poor and underserved given the still
fragile public sector and limited decentralization.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The end-of-project values of the PDO indicators have been achieved, and the majority of
them were surpassed as follows:

· The target number of beneficiaries with access to improved infrastructure and services has
    been exceeded more than twice ­ from 600,000 to 1,488,000 persons. Their share in the total




                                                 21

    number of the poor (measured as 80 % of the population of 6.35 million, or 5.08 million as
    per the 1999 poverty rate) is 29.3% compared to target coverage of 11.8%.

· The number of fully operating and properly maintained MPs 9 months after project
    completion reached 217 in the end of 2006. The prospects of reaching the target of 274
    projects are very good, since by end-2006 less than 4% of the projects which have been
    completed 9 or more months earlier had operational problems. If the same rate of operational
    success/failure is extrapolated, by September 2007, 315 projects will be functioning without
    problems instead of 274, as planned. The achievement of this target would be feasible even if
    the success rate of the newly accomplished projects is as low as 52%.

· Out of all completed 328 projects, 323 are fully operational, 1 is partially operational (road,
    part of which is not rehabilitated by the co-financer / sponsor) and 4 are not in operation for
    similar reasons ­ the sponsoring organizations, rayons or communities have not met their part
    of the commitments to the project. The share of problem projects is only 1.5%.

· The targeted number of beneficiaries from especially vulnerable groups (elderly, disabled,
    etc.) with improved access to improved infrastructure and services of 4,000 people was
    surpassed significantly and, according to NSIFT MIS which records all beneficiaries of
    sponsored MPs, has reached 124,609 persons. The ICR finds this figure inflated since 41 out
    of 84 sponsored MPs took place in urban areas, including Dushanbe, and all inhabitants of the
    area or neighborhood where they were implemented, were counted as beneficiaries. At ICR,
    NSIFT came up with a more precise number of 22,406 direct beneficiaries of 43 sponsored
    MPs and 664,398 indirect beneficiaries of 41 sponsored MPs. The number of direct
    beneficiaries only is again significantly (5.6 times) higher than the target.

· The actual number of community-based organizations responsible for MP implementation
    continuing activity and/or undertaking new commitments one year after project completion
    (189) was also higher than the target value of 152.

· The MPs have created 3,760 new jobs, including 2,870 temporary and 890 permanent ones.
    These jobs were created by the innovative job creation MPs and through NSIFT's research,
    administration, training and capacity building activities. The stated numbers do not include
    the jobs created by NSIFT contractors.

· The project did not contribute to increasing poor people's access to and use of micro credit
    services since the microfinance component (amounting to close to 11% of the project funds)
    was dropped.

The end-of-project beneficiary impact assessment applied the difference-in-differences
analytical method to assess whether the SPAP PDO has been achieved. It concluded that the
monetary income (which has been used as a proxy of living standard) has increased more
significantly in the NSIFT project beneficiary communities (the treatment group) compared to the
control group. The difference in the increase of 20 somoni in 2002-2007 (22% of the increase in
nominal income) is indirectly attributable to the SPAP activities. The difference in percentage
change in household incomes is, however, insignificant (0.7 percentage points) and does not
provide statistically significant evidence in favour of NSIFT's contribution to living standards'
increase in the treatment communities. The scope of income increase in the project beneficiary
communities has not been measured rigorously by the beneficiary impact assessment, and is
possibly underestimated mainly because of the 5-year long recall period. As a result, the average
`recalled' 2002 household income in the treatment communities is higher compared to the


                                                 22

reported 2002 baseline income of the control group which should not be the case given the
application of poverty targeting for the selection of the beneficiary communities. Also, most MPs
are not commercial, therefore cannot lead to immediate increase in monetary incomes, but at the
same time through improving the health and education status of community members they create
preconditions for improving the earning potential and living standards in the long run. The
beneficiary impact assessment however highlighted important improvements in the access to
social services, as well as changes in the behaviour and beneficiary satisfaction in the
communities where NSIFT projects have been implemented. The access to economic and social
services can in itself be used as an indication of improved living standards. The same argument
applies to the increased level of optimism and satisfaction with the new services. For example,
the expectations for income increase are higher by 31.5% or 105 somoni for MP beneficiaries and
are combined with increased motivation to rely on own initiative in improving living standards
and quality of life. The beneficiary satisfaction with the outcomes of MPs is very high ­ 46% of
them are completely satisfied and 53% are mostly satisfied.

Along with the beneficiary impact assessment, in the absence of comparative baseline and end-of-
project data indicating the change in the living standards of the communities where MPs have
been implemented, a positive answer of the question whether the PDO has been achieved requires
assessing whether: (i) SPAP has reached poor communities and poor and vulnerable people; (ii)
adequate MPs have been implemented to increase the access of the poor to social and economic
services; and (iii) the communities have been empowered as a result of MP implementation.

Has SPAP reached poor communities, poor and vulnerable people? SPAP applied precise ex
ante targeting of the poor and vulnerable. The targeting methodology was designed especially for
the purpose of identifying the poor in each region which complied with the requirement for
nation-wide coverage of NSIFT micro projects. As a first step, in 2002, local NGOs were
contracted to produce 68 regional studies for which administrative and statistical data, household
surveys and qualitative assessments were used. These surveys identified the poorest jamoats in
each region by ranking them by poverty status on a 5-grade scale. The second step involved
additional studies to substantiate the analysis and identify the beneficiary communities within the
poor jamoats. Compared to the first stage, which was a one-time effort the second involved
continuous analytical work in the poor rayons and communities. After the poor communities had
been identified, NSIFT helped them establish CDC, assess the community needs and propose
projects based on the identified issues (water and electricity supply, school, medical center, etc.).
The poverty assessments of the Bank were also considered, especially the data on spatial
distribution of poverty, as one of the targeting criteria along with official statistical data. The
greatest weight in the targeting was however attributed to the population size, the average income
level and the distance from cities and industrial activities.

The Technical Audit of NSIFT (2005) concluded that the poverty targeting of SPAP was effective
since most MPs were implemented in poor communities or villages, since these projects appeared
as priorities on the lists of the communities and since they have been identified in collaboration of
local NGOs at project start-up. The audit also revealed, however, that the poverty targeting
although effective has been uneven between projects. Since the MPs targeted whole communities,
the most poor were not always among those who would be the first to benefit from certain micro
project, e.g. from the connection to gas or electricity supply.

Were the implemented micro projects contributing to increase in the access of the poor to
social and economic services? The infrastructure MPs, the sponsored projects and the innovative
job creation projects were designed to increase the access to services. NSIFT conducted a
beneficiary survey with 900 respondents (community members, CDC members, representatives



                                                 23

of the local governments, community and NGO activists from the targeted communities) where
94-96% of the respondents confirmed their all members of their community use the facilities
delivered by the micro projects; 93-95% found them of good satisfactory quality and relevance,
95-98% believed that the project's impact on the respective community is positive, and 92-95%
reported having saved money and time (for the business development projects they also reported
making profit). Anecdotal evidence from field visits indicated that children were able to prepare
lessons at home for at least two hours longer when electricity supply is increased, that the home
deliveries had decreased, the home care for elderly has been expanded up to 7 times in certain
cases and the immunization rate has been increased to close to 100% in certain beneficiary
communities.

A strong indication of the impact of the micro projects on access to services is the participation of
the communities in implementation, their commitment to maintain the facilities in the post-
completion period and to contribute in kind or cash for maintenance (see 2.5). Follow-on visits
for the preparation of the ICR and NSIFT Regional Offices reports have collected anecdotal
evidence confirming that the commitments of local authorities seem to be complied with, e.g. all
the visited facilities were properly staffed as foreseen in the sustainability plan, salaries were
budgeted and paid, medicines were supplied by the central rayon hospitals.

Have the communities been empowered as a result of the implementation of micro projects?
All communities which have implemented micro projects have established CDCs. The sponsored
MPs have been initiated by initiative groups of citizens which continue to exist after project
completion. They have received training in project management and some have approached other
donor agencies with new project proposals. The CDC and initiative group members report having
confidence in their ability to fundraise and resolve other community problems through micro
projects in ad hoc MP level beneficiary surveys. All communities have negotiated maintenance /
sustainability agreements with the local governments. The target of implementing 5% of the MP
through direct contracting by the communities has been surpassed ­ 33 MP were implemented bb
communities under the supervision of CDC, instead of 15. To ensure that the community needs
are properly identified and choices made by the community based on wide participation and
consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, the project provided good amount for training of
all project stakeholders. The required steps in the community consultation process were well
articulated in a special manual and guidelines on community empowerment.

The ICR concludes that the PDO has been achieved by the project since it helped poor people
access basic services; provided income generating opportunities in remote parts of the country
where the outreach of central government institutions was not sufficient; encouraged partnerships
between communities and local governments for maintenance of the services; empowered
communities to take the initiative in resolving their problems; contributed to improving the
quality of social services; built institutional, project delivery, monitoring and evaluation capacity
in NSIFT, regularly submitted community-level information to inform the PRSP process.

3.3 Efficiency

Net Present Value, Economic Rate of Return and Financial Rate of Return were not calculated for
this project.

The Technical Audit (2005) concluded that NSIFT MPs are equally cost efficient compared to
similar projects implemented by other agencies while their quality is in the most of the cases
higher. To make this conclusion, the audit looked at the technical quality and sustainability of
selected MPs, assessed their cost efficiency, unit costs (price per square meter and spending per



                                                   24

beneficiary) and the price determination mechanisms. The Audit also assessed the technical
compliance, physical completion and price competitiveness of contracts, as well as the
compliance with the procedures and guidelines as laid out in the Operations Manual. The
observations of the auditors were confirmed by additional comparisons of unit costs which were
commissioned at ICR to a construction engineer. The unit costs of construction were found
closely comparable between rural schools with the same design which were built in one and the
same period of time and using the same norms for inputs under SPAP and two other projects.
Unit costs of major refurbishment were also found comparable with the average for the respective
region in the same period of time.

NSIFT's operational costs which could be used as a proxy of efficiency were 9.93% of all project
costs. They are within the project limits and at the lower end of the average social fund
operational costs in ECA, which ­ according to a recent comparative study ­ amount to 10-13%.
The NSIFT operational costs were, however, higher in the first 2.5 years of the project ­ 14.7%
which is justifiable with the high initial costs of the outreach to the poor and vulnerable
communities which are often located in remote mountainous areas with poor communications and
physical infrastructure.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is satisfactory based on the relevance of its objectives,
design and implementation, the achievement of the PDO, the good quality of MP outputs which
was achieved at comparable cost.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The focus on vulnerable groups has been sharpened further through the introduction of sponsored
MPs which targeted the most vulnerable population ­ old people, street children, children in
institutions, residents of old-age homes, disabled, women. The definition and identification of
these projects and target groups was made on a demand-driven basis by intermediary
implementing agents (NGOs). The same effect had been pursued through innovative job creation
projects oriented at micro business development, empowerment of producers' associations, etc.

The empowerment of women has been addressed by: (i) targeting the MPs to poor and remote
areas where the population increasingly consists of women, children and elderly; (ii) financing
innovative MPs which aim at increasing the labor market skills and employment opportunities for
women, and (iii) encouragement of women's participation in CDC. At ICR, anecdotal evidence
from meetings with communities, NGO representatives and analysis of CDC membership
structure confirmed that consistent efforts have been made to ensure that the voices of women
count, especially at the needs assessment and project identification stage.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


The project contributed to the institutional strengthening of NSIFT. During SPAP implementation,
NSIFT evolved from an emergency and post-conflict social fund into a community infrastructure
fund. NSIFT increasingly became a motivated and dynamic institution capable of delivering a



                                                  25

large number of projects countrywide and mobilizing communities. The core staff is trained and
experienced and the key elements of the MIS are operational. Transparency and accountability
have improved compared to the PPAP period. By implementing in parallel IDA, DFID and KfW
projects, NSIFT has demonstrated capacity to absorb funds from multiple sources and flexibility
to accommodate needs and requirements of different donor agencies. Potentially NSIFT could
have a broader institutional impact in the future depending to what extent its `institutional model'
will be considered in the reorganization of project implementation units.

The project contributed to institution building at community level through the establishment and
operationalization of CDC, through encouragement of direct contracting of MP activities by the
beneficiary communities, strengthening local NGOs, promoting the creation of producers'
associations (in bee breeding for example) and through creating a platform for dialogue and
cooperation between communities and local authorities. Along with the capacity building for
NSIFT, the project provided a great deal of training to government officials, local leaders, and
communities - seminars and workshops, but also study tours to visit other projects, engineering
training abroad and the like. NSIFT did not only strengthen it's own institution. When MOE
needed designs for new schools, they adopted NSIFT's designs, and used their plans.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

n/a

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The end-of-project beneficiary impact assessment took place in March ­ May 2007. The main
results discussed at a stakeholder workshop on May 30, 2007 are presented in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is considered to be moderate, and mainly pertains to the
sustainability of the physical infrastructure provided under the SPAP and to the sustainability of
community empowerment which is considered sufficient based on the findings of the beneficiary
impact assessment, feedback from NSIFT and from CDC members, which indicate that many
CDCs have been registered as NGOs, members continue to meet, discuss development, identify
projects, lobby with the local government bodies for financing of priority social infrastructure and
services. As NGOs, the CDCs apply for funding under different donor programs and mobilize
community-level resources to increase the competitiveness of their project proposals.

The sustainability of the physical infrastructure is being achieved with the project level
sustainability / maintenance plans prepared by the service end-users and endorsed by the local
governments. Transition, operation and maintenance arrangements exist for each MP and CDC
have been established in each case. `Willingness to pay' among the users is generally well
ensured according to the Technical Audit and this is probably to be credited to the project's
efforts, since such willingness to pay is not a strong characteristic in the general population
countrywide, and especially in the rural areas. The main threats to sustainability of the physical
infrastructure could be associated with: (i) deterioration of the quality of the works which will
increase the need for maintenance and make it more expensive and frequent; (ii) missing elements
/ not fully completed projects, which could impair the quality of, or limit the access to the
respective services; and (iii) increasing of the poverty in the community for reasons outside the
project which could limit the access to the respective service.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project preparation was technically sound. The project was kept consistent with the
Government's development priorities. The project preparation benefited from the previous
involvement of the Bank in a social fund project and the good understanding of the main sector
issues by the Bank team. The identification process focused on critical gaps revealed with the
PPAP and on opportunities. During SPAP preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account
major risk factors and lessons learned from PPAP and social funds globally. Novel design
features were introduced like focus on investment in human capital, community empowerment
and institutional support. At preparation, the Bank played actively an intermediation and resource
mobilization role with respect to other donors. The project preparation was participatory and
supported by the Government of Tajikistan. A project preparation facility at the amount of
US$570,000 was extended for the purpose, of which US$150,000 were spent.

There were no major controversies over the relevance of the objectives of SPAP, however, among
the Bank social fund specialists there were disagreements with respect to its timing. Contrary to
the project preparation team, some were not in support of a quick project preparation and an early
start (the PPAP closed June 30, 2002 while SPAP became effective September 30, 2002), before
fully recapitulating on PPAP results, since significant evidence of improved governance was not
yet in place and before having detailed independent assessment of the scope of fiduciary risks.
The preparation team responded to these concerns by focusing on eliminating the grounds for the
emergence of problems similar to the ones faced by the first project. The project preparation
included social, fiduciary and procurement assessments.

Less attention has been given to other design aspects, for example on: (i) developing a medium-
term sustainability plan for NSIFT, including vision about its functioning beyond the time frame
of the SPAP and in the reduction or absence of donors finance; (ii) strengthening the institutional
relations of NSIFT with the line social ministries, formalizing the coordination with them of
deliverables and MP post-completion commitments, increasing the level of trust and building
partnerships; and (iii) emphasizing on outcomes and impact evaluations and on generally more
robust M&E arrangements, especially given the troubled history of the preceding project and the
well articulated governance risks.

Last, the relevance of the social fund mechanism for delivery of a microfinance program in the
Tajikistan country context could have been assessed more carefully before the start of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was supervised through regular technically sound missions. Supervision products
(aide memoires and follow-up letters) were timely prepared and informative about pending or
important issues to be followed up. Mission teams spent equally long time in Dushanbe and the
field, visiting project sites.




                                                27

The demand for intensive supervision was high. As mentioned, at effectiveness, SPAP was a high
risk project because of the troubled implementation history of its predecessor and the subsequent
likelihood of facing similar issues. During the first year of project implementation, this rating was
revisited and based on SPAP's good performance it was changed from high to substantive.

Supervision was generally proactive and forward looking. Disbursement delays were encountered
in 2003 and 2004, but in the end, the project disbursed US$2.2 million more due to exchange rate
gains. The supervision identified the problems with the Microfinance component in a timely
manner but formal actions were delayed. The restructuring of the project could have happened
earlier and more extensive and convincing arguments in favor of the restructuring could have
been provided in the MTR ISR and AM.

The Bank team worked closely with DFID, including through joint supervision missions. The
Bank team coordinated its activities and shared information with UNICEF, UNDP, KfW as well
as other donors. Given the reported high number of beneficiaries, the team could have strived for
more visibility and dissemination of results, as well as higher involvement and buy-in by MOF,
the President's and Prime Minister's offices and social and economic ministries.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance during project preparation, appraisal and supervision is rated satisfactory,
since the project was implement successfully in a difficult post-conflict environment without
compromising on its objectives, soundness of procedures and time schedule.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government was not directly involved in SPAP implementation since it was transferred to
NSIFT with the PA between IDA and NSIFT which was signed in parallel with the DCA, and
with a Subsidiary Grant Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of Tajikistan and NSIFT.
The commitment of the government was stated clearly in Decree No. 67 "On the National Social
Investment Fund of Tajikistan" of February 27, 2002 which regulated the provision of counterpart
funds by the Ministry of Finance, the financing of staff salaries, administrative and recurrent costs
of NSIFT. The government contribution amounted to US$3,8 million (20.8% of the initial and
17.7% of the actual project cost in US dollars). In the future, the NSIFT's community outreach
and empowerment expertise and its capacity to deliver social services to the poor could be linked
more closely with the poverty alleviation policies of the government and with local government
planning of social service provision.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The implementing agent's (NSIFT) satisfactory performance rating is justified for several
reasons: (i) the project met its PDO; (ii) it was implemented within the original project
timeframe; (iii) NSIFT demonstrated capacity to manage additional funds (provided by DFID and



                                                 28

KfW) in a transparent and effective manner; and (iv) NSIFT demonstrated ability to: (a) reach the
poor and vulnerable more quickly and more flexibly compared to the state institutions; (b) create
conducive conditions for the participation of the poor and vulnerable in decision making at local
level; (c) engage local governments is a dialogue with communities and facilitate sustainable
arrangements for local governments' participation in community needs assessment and in project
post-completion maintenance.

During implementation, NSIFT demonstrated good management and leadership capacity, sound
multi-level system for internal monitoring and evaluation of field activities, active work of staff
and consultants with the beneficiary communities during the community research, the
establishment of CDC, the community action planning and at all stages of the micro project cycle.
This enhanced the positive social capital in the beneficiary communities and motivated
community commitment and participation in project implementation, including community
project monitoring, procurement and contracting. NSIFT's unit costs for comparable quality of
civil works were compliant with the unit costs of projects implemented by other agencies. The
prevailing feedback from government agencies about the quality of construction and
rehabilitation work performed under NSIFT's management and supervision was positive. The
prevailing feedback from the end-of-project beneficiary assessment is also positive with respect
to satisfaction (quality) and increased access to social services.

NSIFT provided adequate support for the Bank mission teams, generated and filed the required
documentation and reporting.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory, since SPAP achieved the objective it
set to improve the living standards of poor and vulnerable people through micro projects and
community empowerment in areas served by the project. The actual values of the indicators
measuring the PDO suggest achievement and even surpassing the set targets. The end-of-project
beneficiary assessment confirms that the project is impacting positively the income levels in
communities where MPs had been implemented.


6. Lessons Learned

Social funds continue to be relevant as instruments for maximizing the development impact
through reaching remote communities which are underserved by government institutions
and the NGO sector for different reasons as lack of capacity or difficult outreach, especially in
post-conflict situations when different donors provide resources requiring community level needs
assessment and participation in all stages of the projects cycle. SPAP made systematical efforts to
target the poor and vulnerable, to reach them with projects and to foster community
empowerment. This effort confirmed that social funds, NSIFT included, have comparative
advantages as multi-sectoral, demand-driven and pro-poor instrument for community
mobilization, but are less cost-effective as management and implementing agency for micro
projects. For that reason, the TPAP would build upon, and scale up the community empowerment
approach by transferring to the communities project identification and management, including
procurement, financial management and fiduciary responsibilities, and will scale down civil
works to those justifiable with increasing the sustainable use and quality of existing services.



                                                  29

The community social infrastructure investments cannot be sustainable, especially in the
long run if they are not incorporated a priori in local government development strategies
and coordinated with line ministries. Central and local governments buy-in as early as at the
planning stage is important to ensure the sustainability of the newly created services by their
integrating in the overall social service network. It is also important for ensuring long-term
financing, optimal regional distribution of services (equality of access) and compliance with
standards for quality. With the strengthening of the public sector in Tajikistan, social services will
increasingly become a part of the regular sector programming. The decisions for their financing
will be integrated in the government expenditure management to avoid under-utilization of capital
stock and inadequate maintenance as a result of insufficient funding, or avoid misallocation and
excessive spending in case of multiple parallel programs.

Maximizing the developmental impact requires that the social fund type of interventions
are integrated well in the government policy making process. Social funds accumulate
knowledge on social service delivery and generate information with potential value for policy
making, e.g. design of targeted anti-poverty measures, selection of appropriate mechanisms for
outreach and delivery, involvement of communities to increase the relevance of the programs and
reduce the costs of delivery. However, they often address mainly current acute problems that are
not mainstreamed in the long-term priorities, thus aid is not always used as effectively as it might
be. A long-term government vision about the role of social funds at different stages of socio-
economic development is needed, and a strategy and action plan to facilitate this integration.

Maximizing the developmental impact requires that interventions align capital investments
with capacity building, testing, documenting and disseminating innovative good practices,
analysis and knowledge sharing. Investment in people increases the stream of benefits and the
impact of development project resources, especially when the technical assistance is of high
quality and demand-driven. Knowledge sharing, analysis and dissemination of innovations
beyond the communities where the specific social funds projects are implemented is a cost
effective way of expanding the geographical outreach of social funds as well as augmenting their
impact on policy making.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Project Component 1 ­ US$13.55 million (actual)
Micro Projects

This component envisaged the development of two types of micro projects: community based /
infrastructure MP and sponsored MP for especially vulnerable groups. The concept for the
community-based MP built upon those carried out under the PPAP. The grants for micro projects
were allocated for (i) social infrastructure (health centers and clinics, other medical facilities, pre-
schools, schools and special schools, old age homes and homes for veterans, community centers);
(ii) economic infrastructure (supply of potable water, irrigation systems, roads and bridges,
drainage, retaining walls, energy micro projects, electrical lines, gas supply); (iii) sanitation and
environmental infrastructure (sewage networks, waste disposal and treatment, micro-dams,
environmental clean-up, erosion control, etc.). The community and sponsored MP contributed to
the expansion of the community social infrastructure programs and services and to building the
institutional capacity of the communities and grass root NGOs.

In the period September 30, 2002 ­ December 31, 2006, this component supported 328 micro
projects nationwide with estimated number of 1,488,553 beneficiaries. In education, 40.661m2 of
school premises were built or refurbished for 16,600 new pupils' seats. In health care, medical
centers and rural hospitals were expanded with 19,288m2. 170km of tubes for supply with
drinking water were installed. Gas supply was extended with 15km. 8 new bridges were built,
along with 14km of rural roads, and 31 transformers.

The main outputs of its implementation are as follows:

sponsored MPs supported the establishment of 6 associations of bee producers with 134 new jobs,
and the start-up of 4 cattle breeding projects with 98 job openings. The sponsored MPs became
instrumental for the development of social services for vulnerable population groups (orphans,
single old-age pensioners, people with disabilities) by supporting the refurbishment and
equipment of 41 social centers. Other innovations involved building of a community mill and
micro-enterprise development for poor women, women widowed during the war, women who are
household heads and take care of young children alone.

The education sector ranks first in terms of number of implemented projects with 100 projects
which allowed increased access to education through building of 81 new schools with 32,298 sq.
meters of school premises for 14,330 students, and rehabilitation and reconstruction of 8,363 sq.
meters of school premises in 18 schools for 2,270 students. All new and rehabilitated schools (99)
received equipment, and one project envisaged only provision of equipment. The construction
took place in the most remote areas which are particularly difficult to reach by the state and other
donors programs. The social services sector ranks first in terms of number of beneficiaries,
followed by the health sector.

Component 2 ­ US$ 3,321 (actual)
Microfinance

Component 2 did not deliver results. The amount spent under this component was only US
$3,321. The Microfinance component at the initial amount of US$1.36 million represented
approximately 10% of the project funds. Its objectives included assisting the economically active
poor in their transition from poverty to self-sufficiency through the provision of quality financial
services; support for the sustainable growth of a few established MFIs which meet agreed legal,
operational and financial sustainability criteria and operate in the poorest areas of rural Tajikistan,
and by providing them with credit lines for short and medium-term loans which they could then
on-lend to eligible borrowers; and building capacity in the NSIFT to implement these activities.
The component was designed as a scale-up of the microfinance activities started successfully
under the PPAP. The expected benefits were related to employment generation and increased
household incomes through self-employment and micro-business development, especially for
women who were the overwhelming majority of the PPAP's microfinance client base. An
estimated total of 10,000-15,000 clients were expected to benefit over four years from the
microfinance program.

The implementation of this component started in a weak, not fully clear and evolving regulatory
environment. In mid-2003 the principal financial advisor to IDA traveled to Tajikistan to help
NSIFT prepare institutionally for working under the new microfinance legislation, and to advise
the Board of NSIFT on foreign exchange risk sharing between the government and the borrowing
MFI; and on the timing of NSIFT's on-lending disbursements vis-à-vis passage of the MFI law.



                                                  34

Meanwhile, a number of changes were taking place in the microfinance sector in the country.
Two of them emerged as critical for reconsidering the future of the microfinance component.
First and foremost, the new "Law on Microfinance Organizations" was enacted as of May 17,
2004, setting the regulatory framework and organizational grounds of the supply and demand for
microfinance and for microfinance entrepreneurship. The new law, inter alia, allowed the
establishment of two types of commercial microfinance institutions (limited liability and private
joint stock companies) and of micro credit funds (non-commercial microfinance institutions), all
under the licensing authority of the National Bank of Tajikistan. To comply with the new
regulatory environment, the NSIFT had either to reorganize and register as micro credit fund
which could have prevented execution of other commercial or non-profit activities except for
those pertinent for a micro credit institution, or to register a microfinance affiliate. In both cases
this could have had negative impact for the main stream of MP-related activities of NSIFT and
could have required extensive capacity building, staff expansion and strategic repositioning for
working in a new commercial and quasi-commercial environment. On the second place, at that
time more grant monies became available for microfinance from international donors, such as the
IFC and AKF. With a better regulated and improving financial environment, commercial banks
also became more viable and competitive for microlending. The two major NGOs, who were the
best candidates for working with NSIFT, received sizeable grants from other donors and so
withdrew from the NSIFT eligibility process. Similarly, other NGOs had been able to find more
competitive lending rates than those offered by NSIFT.

When deciding upon the future of the microfinance component, three options were considered.
The first option was to target remote areas where the new emerging MFIs were not yet available,
and where NSIFT might still have a competitive advantage. This option, however, would have
required a significant increase in NSIFT's staffing capacity, as they would need to be working
with considerably weaker NGOs and providing more support over a more dispersed area. The
second option was to work through a commercial institution, such as the Amonat Bank, which
has over sixty branches across the country. Though this would have helped to overcome some of
the obstacles involved, there remained questions as to whether this would truly address the
objective of the project, and second, there would still be implementation challenges working with
the micro borrowers. The third option was to reallocate the resources from this component to the
micro project component. Its advantage was that the funds would be going to where NSIFT has
its strongest comparative advantage. The main disadvantage was that the SPAP lost one of its
instruments for reaching the poorest of the poor and contributing to poverty alleviation in a
sustainable manner ­ through micro business and entrepreneurship mainly for women from poor
and remote communities where the households are increasingly headed by women. These women
are generally with no chance to borrow from commercial banks or other microfinance institutions
since they cannot provide collateral and since the liquidity risk is high and will not be taken by
commercial lenders. Moreover, commercial banks and non-bank financials do not provide
training for money management and small business development which is indispensable for the
success of poor entrepreneurs.

Component 3 (original) / Component 2 (after restructuring) ­ US$ 2.3 million (actual)
Institutional Strengthening and Project Management

The objective of this component is to support the development of NSIFT as an agency to carry
out the project and other programs, financed by donors in future. The component has set a
Community Development Program aimed at development the capacity of the local communities
and public organizations, involving the local authorities, NGOs in order to implement
independently the reconstruction and development programs in community level. The main

outputs of this component are community capacity building, measured by the number of
established community structures, as follows:
· CDCs and initiatives groups - their number reached 402 by the end of the project;
· Community associations (NGOs) ­ 3;
· Associations of bee breeders ­ 6.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


Net Present Value, Economic Rate of Return and Financial Rate of Return were not calculated for
this project.

The 2005 Technical audit concluded that the NSIFT MPs are cost/efficient.

At ICR, desk research on cost comparisons with similar projects implemented in Tajikistan by
the Bank and other agencies concluded that the cost of construction, the cost structure and the
prices of individual inputs for facilities with similar functions and design characteristics are very
similar across those projects. The most important factors for price deviations appeared to be the
location of the construction site (remoteness from roads) and time. These findings were
reinforced at ICR by commissioning additional cost comparisons to an independent consultant
(construction engineer) who (i) analyzed and found comparable the cost levels and structures for
schools of same design which were built in the same period of time in communities with similar
level of poverty and similar challenges in terms of access to roads, markets and labor force, and
(ii) analyzed and found comparable with the regional average the costs per square meter of major
refurbishment of social infrastructure facilities.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


The end-of-project Beneficiary Impact Assessment took place in December 2006 ­ May 2007.
The main results were discussed at a stakeholder workshop on May 30, 2007.

The main findings are as follows:

1.      The household income of all respondents have increased in 2002-2007, but in the
treatment group the income rose by 92 somoni, against 72 somoni in the control group. The
difference of 20 somoni represents NSIFT's impact on income / living standards. The difference
in percentage change in household incomes is, however, insignificant (0.7 percentage points) and
does not provide statistically significant evidence in favour of NSIFT's contribution to living
standards' increase in the treatment communities.

2.      The self-evaluation of respondents according to a 10-storey "ladder of well-being"
indicates that the project beneficiaries experience the highest increase in their perceptions of well-
being. In the past 5 years (2002-2007) the well-being in NSIFT communities increased by 1.57
points, against 0.82 points in non-NSIFT communities. The difference represents NSIFT's impact.

3.      Over the past 5 years, NSIFT beneficiaries have experienced higher improvement in
well-being as measured by possession of consumer durables.

4.      NSIFT projects have increased the beneficiary satisfaction with social services in their
communities. Satisfaction level in the treatment communities is very high: 99% of respondents
are satisfied with the MPs in one way or another. The highest level of satisfaction is registered
with respect to water supply MPs, followed by electricity supply MPs, health and education MPs.
The beneficiary satisfaction is low only in the case of road projects where the conclusion is based
on the implementation of a single project.

5.      The satisfaction of community members with community developments is high: almost
30% of them are completely satisfied and 50% are mostly satisfied. The degree of satisfaction in
the treatment communities (89.8%) is significantly higher than in the control group (68%). The
difference is broadly attributed to NSIFT's activities.

6.      The level of satisfaction with NSIFT training and capacity building activities is not high -
only 22% of surveyed beneficiaries underwent NSIFT training, and only 34% of those found it
useful. 40% of those trained applied the knowledge in practice and for 48% the knowledge
received during NSIFT training had proved useful in an unrelated to NSIFT MPs field.

7.      NSIFT MPs address priority needs of the treatment communities. 73.3% of respondents
in treatment communities note that there is no other more important problem than the problem
selected for the respective NSIFT MP, while for 20.6% the selected problem is not of top priority.
In the case of health, education and electricity supply MPs, the share of respondents considering
them top priority is less than 80%. In the case of water supply MPs, 96.3% of beneficiaries
believe that this issue has been of highest importance for their community at the time when the
respective MP was identified. Follow up focus group discussions indicate that it has been hard to
decide on the community priorities and needs, and that decisions do not always satisfy everybody.
Residents have been given the opportunity to voice their wishes, but in the perception of some of
them, the final decision has been made by NSIFT



                                                 40

According to the end-of-project beneficiary impact assessment, the usage of social services and
the level of satisfaction by major types of MPs have changed as a result of the implementation of
SPAP as follows:

· Healthcare. Practically all respondents in communities with health MPs have used the results
    of the rehabilitated/constructed medical facility (99.6%). And 93% stated that they are
    satisfied with the microproject. The level of satisfaction with Health services over the past
    five years in NSIFT communities increased by 57.6%, while in non-NSIFT communities ­ by
    13%. Thus, we see that NSIFT interventions have lead to a much more dramatic increase in
    satisfaction with health services in NSIFT communities as compared to non-NSIFT
    communities with similar issues. The following changes became noticeable to beneficiaries
    as a result of NSIFT health MPs: (i) reduction in the distance to health facility (91%); (ii)
    reduced cost of services (49%); (iii) increased number of medical staff (64%); (iv) reduced
    doctor waiting times (60%); (v) increase in the level of comfort (80%).

· Education. Although not all households need school services, 89% of respondents said that
    their household uses the services of the rehabilitated school, and 95% said that they were
    satisfied with the rehabilitated/constructed facility. NSIFT impact as measured by difference-
    in-differences method for education (schools) MPs was 41% in comparison with non-NSIFT
    communities. Respondents have noted the following changes in their community after
    construction/ reconstruction of a school: (i) reduced distance to the school (32%); (ii) reduced
    cost of services (28%); (iii) increased number of teachers (67%); (iv) improved equipping
    (70%).

· Water supply. In communities where a water supply MP was implemented (related to
    improvement in water supply), 91% of residents use MP results. NSIFT impact in these
    communities, as measured by difference-in-differences method, is 56%, which is the highest
    achievement for all studied MP typologies. This suggests that with these MPs NSIFT has
    reached its objectives to the highest degree. Respondents have noted the following changes in
    communities after water supply MPs were implemented: (i) reduced distance to the source of
    water (72%); (ii) increased water consumption (82%); (iii) improved water quality (89%),
    and (iv) reduced number of infectious diseases (78%).

· Electricity supply. In communities with electricity supply MPs, 94% of respondents have
    noted that their household uses the results of the NSIFT MP, but only 90% were satisfied
    with the micro project. The impact of NSIFT electricity supply MPs as measured by
    difference-in-differences method (before and after) is 50%, which is also a very good
    achievement. Respondents have noted the following changes after NSIFT electricity
    MP: (i) longer supply of electricity during the day (62%); (ii) increased payments for
    electricity (due to increased consumption) (54%); and (iii) reduced expenditures on other
    energy resources (38%).

The beneficiary impact assessment suggests areas of improvement of NSIFT's work as follows:

· Awareness. Beneficiary awareness of various development processes is still not at the highest
    level. In NSIFT communities, 40% of respondents know little or nothing at all about what is
    being done in the community. 56% of community members rarely or never participate in
    discussions concerning community development. Even though 88% of respondents were
    informed about NSIFT activities in their communities, NSIFT could do more on awareness
    building in experimental communities not only of NSIFT but other development processes.



                                                 41

 For that NSIFT should work not only with CDCs but also with already existing established
 social institutions (like mahalla committees, block committees, council of elders, etc.).
 Another aspect of awareness is that NSIFT does not promote the notion that it (NSIFT) is just
 another form of government's investments in communities. In the light of this, it is important
 that NSIFT explains more to people that NSIFT is a government investment and commitment
 to social investments in communities.

· Sustainability. Sustainability of micro project results is mostly ensured. Practically all micro
  project facilities are still in good state and running (1-3 years have passed since completion of
  micro projects that were included in the sample). According to surveyed beneficiaries, in
  47% of cases, the sustainability plan was discussed before the MP was implemented. The
  reasons for this relatively low figure could be poor awareness, non-involvement of
  community members in such discussions or absence of such discussions.

· Micro project implementation. In general, the majority of beneficiaries are satisfied with
  NSIFT work (98%). However, when village activists were asked to propose ways of
  improvement, 22.8% noted negative aspects. Among these the most significant in terms of
  number of responses were: (i) lack of funds for proper MP completion; (ii) extensions and
  delays with construction of the facility; and (iii) flaws in construction technologies. When
  CDC was responsible for tendering and selection of contractors and had more control over
  execution of works community complaints to quality were usually part of an active and
  constructive discussion on the responsibility for maintenance of the final result. Another item
  for dissatisfaction of community members was limited number of paid jobs (even temporary)
  that the MP created for the community.

· Current priority problems. Up to now NSIFT has been successful in identifying very
  important community problems via participatory community approaches. In the framework of
  the present study residents and activists of NSIFT and non-NSIFT communities were also
  asked to name current priority problem for their communities. It turned out that for most
  communities the most important current problems are water supply, construction of
  roads/bridges and creation of new jobs. There were cases in SPAP when community
  identified water problem as a priority problem, however, due to limited funding NSIFT could
  not meet the high estimated cost of such MP, so it was agreed that the second choice ­ an
  electricity supply MP ­ would be implemented instead.

I. Project Objectives and Background

The objective of the Second Poverty Alleviation Project (SPAP) is to improve the living
standards of poor people and vulnerable groups through implementation of microprojects and
community enhancement. The objective of the "Micro Project" component is to solve problems
of access to the social and economic infrastructures in the poorest Communities on the basis of
involvement of the beneficiaries into the Projects implementation, financing of new types of
initiatives and institutional capacity building, targeted for further development of the Community
and local NGOs. The objective of the "Project Management and Institutional Development"
component is to support the development of NSIFT as an agency to carry out the project and
other programs, financed by donors in future.

   Sub: Second Poverty Reduction Project Implementation Completion Report (SPRP)
                             ( ­ 36420  - 53063)

    State Committee on the Investments and State Property Management of the Republic
of Tajikistan is very grateful to the WB for the assistance and participation in the activity
aimed at the poverty reduction in the country.

    As you are aware, one of the mechanisms of the poverty reduction in the country for
the period from 2002 to 2006 is implementation of the Second Poverty Reduction Project
implemented by NSIFT.

    SPRP ended 31 December, 2006, was one of the most successful investment projects
with regards to its coverage and achievement of the goals of the PRSP, in particularly, it
relates to the issue of involving of the communities to the resolution process of the
priority poverty problems and the period of implementation.

    We asses the activity of this Project as the period of fruitful and constructive
cooperation between the Government of Tajikistan and the WB aimed at the common
goals.

      State Committee on Investments and State Property Management has reviewed the
Second Poverty Reduction Project Implementation Completion Report and would like to
mention that during the implementation of the Second Project NSIFT effectively
cooperated with the Government of Tajikistan and the local authorities in regions,
jamoats and communities. Also, it could manage to involve them to the process of
management and project implementation.

    We think, the SPRP has achieved all the planned ad expected goals and tasks of the
Project and the above Report gives a positive assessment of the activity of NSIFT on the
implementation of SPRP as well as a full and timely disbursement of IDA funds.

    We also accept the opinions of the WB that the Project is generally assessed as a
successfully-completed in the way of its realistic purposes; idea and implementation; and



                                            52

achievement of the development goals on the whole, that can be confirmed by the
document attached: Project Indicators.

    Considering the key role of NSIFT, as one of the institutes on implementation of our
Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government of Tajikistan would like to confirm its
willingness for the further cooperation with the WB and preparation and implementation
of the Third Poverty Reduction Project in Tajikistan.




       Best regards,


       Chairman                                                    Sh. Rakhimov.
