Based on a review of the environmental policy, and\n            regulations in Tajikistan, and of the Bank's policy\n            guidelines, the report offers environmental monitoring at\n            the construction, and operation stages, through the\n            following mitigation measures checklists. Soil degradation,\n            and water contamination due to spills, and sewer leakage\n            should be prevented by protecting soil surfaces, either with\n            covers, or by spraying, as well as by re-vegetation\n            practices, and, by conducting appropriate waste disposal\n            services, including adequate disposal of oil spills, and\n            hazardous materials. Regarding natural habitat degradation,\n            and vegetation losses, alternative project sites should be\n            considered if possible; otherwise, both compensation, and\n            biodiversity conservation measures should be taken into\n            account.
