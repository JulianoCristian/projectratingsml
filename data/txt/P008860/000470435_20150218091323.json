The young\n            boy's family and the rest of his community were\n            resettled by the government from a disaster-prone area in\n            mountainous Gorno Badakhshan to the arid plains of the\n            Kabadiyan district in southern Tajikistan and left to their\n            own devices. The new settlement, called \"Navruz\"\n            (Tajik for New Year), lacked even the most basic living\n            conditions and had no social or economic infrastructure.\n            However, the misery and isolation of this community have\n            abated. Ten-year old Khakim now has a house to live in, a\n            place to study and parents who can finally face the future\n            with hope rather than despair. Villagers have gained a sense\n            of confidence in their own fate thanks to the financial and\n            technical support provided by the National Social Investment\n            Fund of Tajikistan (NSIFT), an implementing agency for the\n            World Bank-funded Second Poverty Alleviation Project. When\n            the community of 346 people, comprising primarily women and\n            children, established Navruz in 2001, people had to walk\n            several kilometers to the nearest source of water. Villagers\n            lived in tents - an extremely uncomfortable arrangement\n            given the region\u0092s harsh climate characterized by severe\n            winters and scorching hot summers."}, "docdt": "2006-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
