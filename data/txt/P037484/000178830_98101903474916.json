The main problem concerning the\n            railways is that throughout most of the period since 1941\n            the Government of Spain has not provided sufficient funds to\n            modernize the railway system or even to replace obsolete\n            equipment. As a result, the railway system was never\n            properly integrated. The Railway project will correct this\n            problem. The components entail: 1) reorganizing and\n            strengthening management and supervision; 2) modernizing\n            train and yard operations and maintenance procedures; 3)\n            closing down uneconomic lines and stations; 4) adjusting\n            rates and fares; 5) reducing staff; and 6) improving\n            transport coordination. These measures will modernize the\n            Spanish railways in order to handle new traffic demands,\n            increase efficiency, and improve the quality of service."}, "docdt": "1964-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
