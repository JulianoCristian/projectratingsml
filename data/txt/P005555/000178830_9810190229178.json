least\n            100 population by 1987. The project would consist of about\n            5,000 km of 20-kv transmission and 380/220-volt distribution\n            lines and related equipment, about 70 MVA of distribution\n            transformer capacity and 33 man-years of consulting\n            services. The project would serve approximately 900,000\n            rural population in 1,200 villages in 11 out of the 14\n            Mohafazats (administrative districts) in Syria. No\n            particular project risks are presently envisaged; however,\n            the project is contingent on the completion of the related\n            66-kV transmission lines and 66/20-kV substations included\n            in EPE's 1977-82 construction program."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
