REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT - LOAN 1531-SYR
PREFACE
The Project. supported by Loan 1531-SYR for US$40.0 million made to
the Public Establishment of Electricity (PEE), consisted of about 5,000 km of
20-kV and 380/220-V distribution lines and related equipment, about 70 MVA of
distribution transformer capacity and technical assistance, to serve
approximately 900,000 people in 1,200 villages in the country. The closing
date of the loan was December 31, 1983. Final disbursement was made in
September 1984 raising the total disbursements to US$32.3 million, and the
unutilized amount of US$7.7 million was cancelled, US$7.0 million in April
1984 and US$0.7 million in February 1985. Tkis Project Completion Report
(PCR) was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office
based on the Bank's appraisal report, supervision reports and other documents
in the Bank's files, on the findings of a project completion mission which
visited Syria in March 1985 and a preliminary completion report prepared by
PEE and discussed with the Bank mission in March 1985.
The PCR summarizes the main points of interest. The loan was the
third of a series of Bank loans to PEE which began in 1974.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED has sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower for comments. However$ no
comments have been received from them.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT - LOAN 1531-SYR
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project aimed at the electrification of 1,200 villages in the
country, and as finally executed, consisted of 3,472 km of 20-kV lines, 4,900
km of 380/220-V distribution lines, 2,726 distribution transformers with a
capacity 127.5 MVA and technical assistance. The Bank financed the foreign
costs of the 20-kV system and distribution transformers and a cofinancier the
foreign costs of the 380/220-V lines and the technical assistance component.
Despite a substantial increase in the Project scope (662 increase in the
length of 20-kV lines, 68% increase in the length of 280/220-V lines, 1602
increase in the number of transformers and 82% increase in their capacity),
the final Project cost was only 90% of the appraisal estimate, the reduction
being entirely in foreign costs. The reduction in costs was mainly due to the
efficiency of procurement under ICB and substantial voluntary contribution of
villagers for the erection of 380/220-V lines (para. 3.06). As against the
original estimated completion date of December 31, 1981, the Project was
expected to be completed only by April 1985, a delay of 40 months (para.
3.01). The objective of the Project's physical facilities, namely, to extend
electricity service from the national grid to about 900,000 inhabitants of
1,200 villages across the country was achieved but the Project did not achieve
its institution-building objectives (para. 2.11).
The financial performance of PEE was far below expectations because
the Government did not approve adequate tariff increases; except in 1980, the
return was negative as against 9% required under the covenant. The nadir was
in 1984 when the operating revenues were only 612 of the operating expenses
(para. 5.04). In early 1982, as requested by the government, the Bank had
proposed alternative performance targets, which were more attuned to the
Government's social and other objectives but so far, there has not been an
adequate response from the Government (para. 5.05). The economic rate of
return on the Project could not be recalculated since costs exceed benefits in
every year of the Project (para. 7.02).
During the early part of the Project period, the Bank's supervision
efforts on this Project, as well as on projects in other sectors, declined
because of the cooling of the dialogue between Syria and the Bank. There was
also within the Bank a sense of futility of the whole effort of trying to move
PEE towards reasonable institutional goals (para. 8.01).



- vi -
The following points are of special interest:
(a) Poor technical features of the system and other factors such as
pilferage and deficiencies in meter reading, billing and accounting
contributed to a substantial increase in system losses (para. 4.03);
and
(b) though there were serious d.elays in procurement in the initial stages
of the Project, there was remarkable improvement in PEE's procurement
action towards the end of the Project period as it got a clearer
understanding of the Bank's procurement guidelines (para. 3.10).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT - LOAN 1531-SYR
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Prior to PEE's creation in 1965, the power sector in Syria was
fragmented in various isolated systems, private and municipal. Since its
creation, PEE has been responsible for generation, traasmission and
distribution of electric power throughout the country. However, mainly
because PEE has concentrated on the technical problems of operating procedures
and of integrating the numerous separate systems and plants into one system,
the power sector organization is substantially regional and fragmented. The
sector stands in need of vital institutional reforms aimed at improving PEE's
organization, including administration, accounting and planning and at
achieving an economical and reliable service.
Bank's Participation in the Power Subsector
1.02     Ia order to assist PEE in trying to improve the organization of the
subsector and to assure an economical and reliable service to the public, the
Bank made two loans to PEE before the subject loan, Loan 986-SYR dated May
1974 (and June 1975) for US$33.6 million for the First Mehardeh Project and
Loan 1144-SYR dated July 1975 for US$72 million for the Second Mehardeh
Project.  The Project Completion Report C-epared by the Region concluded that
the physical facilities under the Project were completed satisfactorily, and
to the extent that these loans helped PEE to establish efficient power
generation and transmission facilities at a critical time to meet the
ever-increasing demand, they were a success. However, in most other aspects
they were a signal failure. Project Performance Audit Report No. 5290
covering the above two projects was circulated to the Executive Directors on
October 15, 1984.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The second power loan to Syria (Loan 1144-SYR) included the financing
of a feasiblity study for a nation-wide rural electrification program. The
expatriate firm of consultants selected for the feasibility study started work
in August 1976. On reviewing the preliminary report of the consultants, the
Government and PEE decided that the best way to implement the national rural
electrification program was to dividc the program by sub-systems according to
voltage levels, one agency financing the 20-kV primary distribution system
including distribution transformers and another funding the 380/220-V
secondary sub-system. Accordingly, the Government of Syria, on behalf of PEE,
requested the Bank in December 1976 to finance a regional electrification
project which would constitute the first stage of the 10-year national
electrification plan aimed at extending electricity service to all villages
with 100 or more inhabitants. The major issues during appraisal through the



stage of negotiatiots .4    Lt(A slwfV,:  (it) iEE'S proposed 1977-1982 power
investment program appe.airod som;'nwlwat o.'trsived compared to the forecast
demand; (b) finastcing of thie power sectLir program required very large
Government contributions ond Lc.rpe tariff i-ncreases each y.~ar; and (c) the 9%
rate of return covnwinated unvu-r tle ,previotts Bank loans to be achieved
beginning in 1978 btuiWd v.i l!. ,i:  t snlv i.67 wsaF estimated to have been
achieved in 1976).
2.02     At thel negotiatiitis xThit  w ut&e l1eld during January 24-February 3,
1978, the following ct!aiL,es weie agreed:
(a)  Fuel Pricing           It was agreed to delete the requirement under
which the Government. 'ras to implement a comprehensive fuel pricing
policy based on the recommendations of the tariff study prepared by
the consultants appointed under an earlier loan, since:
(a) additionial sector studies were considered necessary to better
guide the Government decision; and (b) thie rationalization of
electricity tariffs which constituted an important part of the
pricinig policies within thie energy sector would be adequately covered
in the loan documents.
(b)  Tariffs:  In thle Bank's letter of September 1977 and again during
pre-negotiations in December 1977, PEE had been requested to furnish
at the laLest during loan negotiations a plan and a timetable for
tariff actions to achieve the rate of return of 9% required under
Loan 1144-SYR starting in 1978. At negotiations, the Government
informed the Bank thiat while it was not averse to the principle of
increasing tariffs in due course, it was not ready at that time to
commit itself to any specific increase in 1978. Following an
analysis of the financial implications of the Government's position
both at the level of the sector and at the level of the Government's
budget, it was agreed that PEE's attainment of a 9% rate of return
calculated on the basis of its revenues from electricity tariffs
would be deierred until 1981. Until then, the shortfall in PEE's
revenues would be made up by a Government subsidy. During 1978, the
Government would make a cash contribution to PEE equal to the full
difference of PEE's revenues from the 1977 tariffs and the amount
that PEE wouid have obtained had it raised its tariffs to a level
necessary to obtain a 9% return on its net fixed assets in
operations.  Tn 1 979 Lhe cash contribution would not exceed 70% of
the difference between revenues that would have been generated if the
1977 tariffs still :.pplied, and revenues that would have been
obtained had PEE applied tariffs sufficient to generate a 9% return
on properly revalued net tired assets in operation. In 1980 the cash
contribution wouid not exceed 40% api4 in 1981 PEE would be reouired
to set tariffs at a level sufficient to generate a 9% return without
recourse to any subsidy. Moreover, it was agreed that PEE would
prepare a satisfactoiy progressive rate structure for household
electricity consuLmption by dc-fiving the first block of consumption
that should henefit froml the lowest rates.  PEE's proposal would be
completed ty S3oLember 30, 1978, and implemented no later than
January 1, 1979. PEE also agreed to prepare, before September 30
each year, ;! revi.w, satisfactory to the Government, made on the



-3-
basis of realistic forecasts which would demonstrate the adequacy of
its electricity tariffs to enable it to meet its rate of return
covenant in the succeeding year. It was also pointedly made clear by
the Bank that if adjustment of PEE's tariffs could not be made as
agreed, a default situation would be created which would require the
Bank to resort to remedies under the proposed and previous loans.
One important reason for the Banks agreeing to the above was
recognition of the fact that the net fixed asset base of PEE would
rise very steeply between 1978 and 1981 while forecast sales were
developing at a pace slower than anticipated. The Bank also
considered that the Project, being essentially a rural
electrification (distribution) project, would contribute to
correcting the imbalance between generating and distributing capacity.
(c) Revaluation: It was agreed that starting from January 1, 1979 PEE's
net fixed assets would be revalued and that the Bank's proposals for
revaluing assets would be included in the terms of reference of the
accounting consultants proposed to be appointed for this purpose.
(d) Accounting System: The date for PEE to modernize its accounting
system would be postponed from March 31, 1978 to June 30, 1978 due to
delay in appointing consultants.
(e) Accounts Receivable: PEE would reduce its xccounts receivable to not
more than three months' sales of electricity from December 31, 1978
instead of from June 30, 1979 and PEE would thereafter maintain
receivables at not more than three months' sales of electricity.
(f) Cross-Effectiveness with Cofinancier's Loan: It was agreed that the
Bank's loan would be declared effective only after the Government and
PEE had met all the conditions precedent to the first disbursement
under the Cofinancier's loan.
(g) Reduction in PEE's Investment Program: PEE's 1977-1982 power
investment program would be reduced by US$221 million equivalent by
deleting generation plants X and Y costing US$144.3 million
equivalent, some 230-kV lines estimated at US$8.10 million equivalent
and some 230-kV substations estimated at US$45.6 million equivalent.
In addition, there would be a one-year slippage in various 66-kV
lines and 66/20-kV substations costing US$23.0 million equivalent.
Loan Effectiveness
2.03     The loan was signed on May 3, 1978 with the following effectiveness
conditions:
(a) Engagement of engineering consultants;
(b)  engagement of accounting and management consultants and taking of all
initial steps towards the introduction of a new accounting system
recommended in a previous study by the accounting consultants;
(c) establishment and adequate staffing of a project unit; and



-4-
(d) fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the first disbursement
under the Cofinancier's loan.
The engineering consultants were appointed on May 31, 1979. On May 15, 1980,
PEE also appointed an expatriate firm as accounting and management consultants
and initial steps were taken towards the introduction of a new accounting
system. Similarly, the Sank's supervision of April/May 1980 also verified
that a Project unit had been established with adequate staffing. Further, the
Cofinancier notified the Bank in writing that the conditions precedent to the
first disbursement under the Cofinancier's loan had been fulfilled; the Bank's
supervision mission of April/May 1980 had also verified that disbursements
were being made from the Cofinancier's loan. However, the Bank was reluctant
to declare the loan effective because the Borrower (PEE) was in default on the
reven'ne covenant. Meanwhile, six extensions in the effectiveness date of the
loan had been made, the last from March 1980 to June 30, 1980. Towards the
close of June 1980, the Government advised the Bank of its decision to
increase tariffs by an average of about 50% from July 1, 1980 and that the
Ministry of Electricity was taking steps to implement the increases. Based on
this advice, the Bank declared the loan effective as of July 1, 1980, about 20
months later than estimated at appraisal.
2.04     Attachment 1 sets forth the major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements and the extent of compliance with them.
Project Description
2.05     The Project was the first stage (years 1978-1981) of Syria's 10-year
National Electrification Plan (1978-1987) and had as its objective the
electrification of 1,200 villages in 11 of the country's 14 mohafazat
(administrative districts). It consisted of:
(a) the acquisition and installation of about 5,000 km of 20-kV and
380/220-V distribution lines;
(b) the acquisition and installation of 70 MVA of distribution
transformer capacity; and
(c) technical assistance for engineering services for (a) and (b) above
and for strengthening PEE's capabilities in manpower planning and
development.
Funding for the foreign cost of 20-kV distribution lines, distribution
transformers and technical assistance for strengthening PEE's capabilities in
manpower planning and development was provided by the Bank. The Cofinancier
provided funding for the foreign cost of 380/220-V distribution lines and the
engineering services for the Project. PEE funded the local costs of the
Project.
Changes in the Project Scope
2.06     There were significant changes in the scope of the Project as finally
executed. The 20-month delay in loan effectiveness resulted in a new list of
villages to be electrified and the procurement of additional material and



-5-
equipment (para. 2.07). Likewise, the method of installation and erectiov was
changed resulting in the procurement of construction tools and equipment
costing US$6.4 million that had not been envisaged earlier (para. 2.08). A
third change involved the supervision of the Project towards the end of
project implementation. When the services of the engineering consultants were
terminated in December 1983, PEE took over the supervision of the Project
(para. 2.09). Still another change was the cancellation of the training of
PEE's staff to strengthen its capabilities in manpower planning and
development (para. 2410). The completed Project consisted of the
electrification of a new list of 1,200 villages requiring:
(a) the acquisition and installation of 8,372 km of 20-kV and
380/220-Volt distribution lines, a two-thirds increase over the
appraisal estimate;
(b)  the acquisition and installation of 127.5 MVA of distribution
transformer capacity, an 82% increase over the appraisal estimate; and
(c) technical assistance for engineering services for (a) and (b) above.
List of Villages to be electrified
2.07     Because the Project was started late, PEE had, by the commencement of
the Project, completed the electrification of the villages in two Mohafazat in
the southern part of Syria, and therefore, a new list of 1,200 villages (from
the other 9 Mohafazat) was selected, in agreement with the Bank, from the list
in the Consultants' Project Report on which the Project was based. In the
course of implementation of the Project, PEE found that additional material
and equipment -d to be procured over and above what had been estimated.
First, because the Project comprised a new list of villages. PEE had
electrified the villages closer to the electrical grid using its own resources
and longer lengths of 20-kV and 380/220-V distribution lines were required for
the electrification of villages from the new list. Secondly, the Consultants'
Project Report had included the electrification of only the main villages and
not of the satellite areas. However, as the villages were being electrified,
PEE had to electrify the satellite areas as well, which required additional
lengths of distribution lines.
Method of Installation and Erection
2.08     The Loan Agreement included an allocation of US$12.4 million for
installation and erection work to be contracted according to the Bank
procurement guidelines. PEE had already electrified about 390 villages
outside the Project, following procedures other than international competitive
bidding (ICB) such as force account and awarding contracts to parastatal firms
and local private bidders. Based on PEE's experience in electrifying the
above villages, and given the wide geographical dispersion of project
facilities and the labor intensive nature of the work, the Bank agreed in the
course of Project implementation that ICB was not a feasible proposition and
therefore did not insist on it. Instead, PEE requested that part of the funds
allocated for installation and erection be utilized for buying distribution



-6-
line constuction tools and equipment which would help speed up Project
implementation. The Bank agreed and accordingly, in July 1983 reallocated
the sum of US$12.4 million provided for installation and erection, US$6.4
million for the procurement of construction tools and equipment and US$6.0
million for procurement of additional material and equipment (para. 2.07)
required for the Project.
Engineering and Supervision of the Project
2.09     As a condition of Loan effectiveness, PEE was required to engage the
services of a Consultant (to be funded by the Cofinancier) for engineering and
supervision, and engineering designs for the Project. Accordingly, PEE
engaged a firm of expatriate consultants for this purpose on September 13,
1979. By about mid-1983 the funds for financing the consulants' services were
fast getting exhausted and since the Project had still a long way to go, PEE
requested the Cofinancier to provide additional funding for extending the
services of the consultants through May 1984. However, the Cofinancier
informed PEE in June 1983 that no more funds would be provided-for the purpose
and that the expiration date of February 28, 1984 would also not be extended.
Accordingly, when the funds ran out the services of the consultants were
tevminated as of December 19, 1983 (i.e., about about two weeks before the
closing date of the Bank loan and 16 months before the physical completion of
the Project). Thereafter, PEE took over the supervision of the Project until
its completion. This was acceptable since, by that time, the duties consisted
largely of supervising erection, in which PEE staff had sufficient
experience. However, there were two unfinished items of work for which the
consultants were responsible.  One was the socioeconomic study of the Project
villages, which would have given information on the amount of electricity used
by households and businesses in the electrified villages and the contribution
of the Project to the socioeconomic dIevelopment in the Project areas. The
other was the installation of a '-:mputerized system for project monitoring
which included materials management and project accounting. Without the
consultants, PEE could not completely implement the system.
Training of PEE's Staff in Manpower Planning
2.10     At PEE's request, the Project included about US$26G,000 for the
services of a manpower development advisor. PEE, however, did not appoint the
advisor and therefore, nothing was done to achieve the institutional objective
of strengthening PEE's capabilities in drawing up long-range plans for
personnel selection, training and development.
Proiect Obiectives
2.11     The objective of the physical facilities of the Project was to extend
electric service from the national grid to about 900,000 inhabitants of the
rural regions across the country with a view to increasing agro-industrial
activity and improving the quality of life in rural Syria. The Project
succeeded in achieving this objective. However, the Project did not achieve
its other objective which was to build on the Bank's institution-building
efforts initiated under the earlier loans.

III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
3.01     The Project was expected to be completed by April 1985.  The delay of
about 40 months compared to the appraisal estimates arose on account of the
following:
-    about 20 months due to the delay in loan effectiveness (para. 2.03);
-    about 12 months due to the late opening of bids; and
-    about 8 months due to the late award of contracts and delays in
construction.
3.02     There was a delay of about 12 months due to delays in finalizing bid
specifications and documents and in inviting bids. Even though the contract
with the engineering consultants was signed on September 13, 1979, the
consultants could commence work only in December 1979 after the issuance of a
Letter of Commitment by the Cofinancier on October 30, 1979. The consultants
took about a year to: (i) prepare Distribution Design and Construction
Manuals; (ii) finalize detailed technical specifications for the materials;
and (iii) issue the bid documents after obtaining the Bank's "No Objection".
Bids for the various packages were invited in January/March 1981 and opened in
April/July 1981, a delay of about 12 months compared to the appraisal
estimates.
3.03     There was a further delay of about 13 months in the award of
contracts, which was offectively reduced to 8 months by:
(a) the use of distribution line material available in PEE's stores; and
(b) the use of distribution line construction tools and equipment (para.
2.07).
PEE's procurement problems are detailed in paras. 3.10-3.14. For the reasons
mentioned in para. 2.07, additional material had to be procured for the
electrification of the 1,200 villages according to the revised list. PEE, in
agreement with the Bank, procured the additional material for the components
funded by the Bank in accordance with ICB (20-kV lines and distribution
transformers). However, in the case of 380/220 V distribution line material
funded by the Cofinancier, PEE was unable to reach agreement with the
Cofinancier on the procurement of the additional distribution line material
required for completion of the Project (except for the wood poles). The
Cofinancier froze the funds in June 1983 and, even though funds (about US$8.0
million) were available, did not agree to accept any new commitments (only
US$26.7 million out of US$34.7 million was committed). PEE therefore utilized
distribution line material available in its own stores for completing the
Project.
3.04     Similarly the Cofinancier did not agree to finance the extension of
the engineering consultants' services through completion of the Project.
Therefore, after termination of the consultants' services in December 1983,
PEE's staff took over the supervision of the Project (para. 2.09).



-8-
Project Costs
3.05     The expatriate firm of consultants appointed to supervise and
administer the project was unable to set up a satisfactory system of project
accounting and budget control due to delays in implementation of the
computerized system envisaged for the project and the services of the
consultants being terminated before the completion of the project. The
deficiency in the maintenance of project accounts was brought to the attention
of Government and PEE by the Bank's supervision missions but PEE could not
keep the accounts up to date. Computation of actual project costs has,
therefore, been rather difficult. This is to be viewed in the context of
PEE's accounting work being badly in arrears (para. 5.06). In order to have
reliable project cost figures, the Bank requested PEE to furnish audited
project accounts. The summary cost figures used in this report are those
advised by PEE after completion of such audit. However, the Bank has yet to
receive the Project accounts certified by the auditors.
3.06     A comparison of the estimated and the actual costs of the Project is
given in Annex 2 and a similar comparison of the physical project components
is given in Annex 3. The actual total cost was only about 90S of the
appraisal estimate, the reduction being entirely in foreign cost. The actual
cost of 20-kV distribution lines was 681 more than the appraisal estimate
mainly because of a 661 increase in the length of the lines. However, in the
case of distribution transformers, for an 82S increase in MVA capacity over
the appraisal estimate, the costs increased by only 25%. The reason for this
is the lower foreign cost of the distribution transformers procured through
ICB compared to the appraisal estimate (installed cost of US$34,730 per MVA
vs. an estimated US$49,857). In the case of 380/220-V distribution lines, the
length increased by 681 over the appraisal estimate while costs went down by
31X. Since the procurement of materials was through tied funds of the
cofinancier, the appraisal report had generally assumed 20-301 higher costs
for the material compared to similar procurement under ICB. Further, as
mentioned in Annex 2, the cost of substantial voluntary contribution of
villagers for the erection of 380/220-V lines was not included in the actual
costs and could amount to about LS 25 million or even more. Even so, the
actual costs given by PEE for the 380/220-V distribution lines seem to be on
the low side, although these figures have been accepted in audit. It is
possible that additional material used from PEE's own resources has not been
fully accounted for.
Disbursements
3.07          Annex 4 compares the actual disbursements with the appraisal
estimate. Due to delays in Loan effectiveness and procurement action, the
actual disbursements lagged behind estimates by about 4 years. Due to its
complicated procedures and regulations, PEE had difficulties in opening
Letters of Credit in time, resulting in delays in delivery of material and
consequently in disbursments. The closing date of the loan wJas December 31,
1983 but the books were kept open until September 1984 to permit PEE to
complete disbursements against contracts awarded before the Loan Closing
Date. The final disbursements actually came to US$32.3 million. An amount of
US$7.0 million, estimated to be the amount likely to remain unutilized, was
cancelled in April 1984 and the amount of US$0.7 million finally remaining
unutilized was also cancelled in February 1985.



9-
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.08     The consultants did not always prepare for PEE progress reports
according to the loan requirments. They did not also complete all the tasks
included in their contract such as establishment of a system for the
monitoring of project activities, computerization of materials management and
accounting system for the project, and data collection and analysis for the
socioeconomic study of the project villages. This situation arose partly
because of: (a) the termination of the consultants' contract in December 1983
before the completion of the project; and (b) PEE's decentralized
organizational set-up at the Mohafazat level, which made it difficult for the
consultants and even PEE's Director of Rural Electrification Program to
collect the required data and coordinate activities in the different regions
regarding computerization of materials management and accounting systems. In
procurement, the consultants initially had difficulties in understanding the
Bank's procurement guidelines but their performance improved as they gained
more experience (paras. 3.10-3.14). In technical matters, the consultants
achieved their objectives of standardizing the designs and checking of the
low-voltage distribution line designs before giving approval for commencement
of construction work.
3.09        Despite occasional delays in payment affecting their work
schedules, the performance of suppliers of material and equipment was
satisfactory.
Procurement
3.10     As stated in para 3.03 there was initially a delay of about 13 months
in the award of the main contracts. PEE's difficulties in this respect were
mostly due to:
(a) lack of clarity in bid documents (especially regarding the basis of
bid evaluation);
(b) misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the guidelines; and
(c) the multi-tiered bureaucratic. system for bid evaluation and award of
contracts.
These features are highlighted in the following examples. The remarkable
improvement in PEE's procurement action towards the end of the Project period
as it gained a clearer understanding of the Bank's procurement guidelines is
illustrated in the award of contracts for distribution tools and equipment
within two to three months of bid opening.
Distribution Transformers
3.11     An example of the lack of clarity in bid documents about the basis of
evaluation was the case of distribution transformers. The bid documents had
not stipulated the criteria for evaluation of transformer losses for bid
comparison whereas PEE actually evaluated the offers taking into account the
losses. On the Bank's advice fresh bids had to be obtained after revising the
specifications to include the method of evaluation of losses. As a result,
the award of contract was delayed by about 14 months.



- 10 -
Wood Poles
3.12     An example of the misundertanding/misinterpretation of the Bank
guideiines was the procurement of wood poles regarding which a difference of
opiiion arose between PEE and the Bank.  Expatriate firm A offered poles as
per bid specifications and expatriate firm B gave a main offer for poles as
specified in the bid specifications and an alternative offer which was not
according to the specifications. According to the evaluation report, the
offer of firm A was lower than the main offer of firm B but was higher than
its alternative offer. The Bank disagreed with PEE's recommendation of
accepting the alternative offer of firm B and informed PEE that in case PEE
desired to modify the bid specifications, it should give equal opportunity to
all the bidders and invite fresh offers. After much exchange of views PEE
agreed with the Bank's view and the contract was awarded to firm A. Much of
the time elapsed between bid opening and contract award (about 18 months)
would have been saved had PEE and the consultants fully understood the Bank
guidelines.
Line Hardware
3.13     The delay in the award of contracts for line hardware is an example
of not only lack of clarity in bidding documents but also the slow
decision-making in a multi-tier bureaucratic set-up. The bid documents did
not ask bidders to indicate freight and insurance costs separately for each
item, and therefore many bidders quoted lump-sum amounts for all the 27
items. The various committees of PEE took about 12 months (involving three
validity period extensions) from the date of bid opening to decide on about
half of the 27 items in the bid. For the remaining items, fresh offers had to
be obtained resulting in a further delay of about 12 months in award of
contracts.
3.14     There were similar delays in the procurement of 380/220-V line
material funded by the Cofinancier. Because of these delays and the
subsequent freezing of funds by the Cofinancier, PEE could utilize only
US$26.7 million out of the sum of US$34.7 originally provided for the Project
by the Cofinancier.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     Based on the limited experience during the short time they have been
in operation, it would appear that the facilities constructed under the
Project are operating satisfactorily within the constraints under which the
system operates. Emergency outages and major breakdowns of system supply are
increasingly frequent but this is an indication of PEE's larger problems, such
as shortage of generating capacity and lack of trained personnt. and not
specifically of the quality of the project facilities in question.
4.02     Annex 5 compares PEE's actual sales of electricity with the appraisal
estimates for the period 1978-1982. It also gives the actual sales for the
years 1983-1984 for which no appraisal estimates were prepared. The actual



- 1}1 -
sales were very close to the appraisal estimates for the period 1978-1982, the
variations being within plus or minus 5% of the appraisal estimates. This
result was the effect of higher sales to domestic and commercial customers and
to small industries counterbalanced by decreases in sales to heavy industries
and to Government organizations. The actual sales to the domestic and
commercial customers were consistently higher than the appraisal estimate, the
variation progressively increasing from 16% in 1978 to 48% in 1982. The sales
to small industries also increased significantly during 1979-1982. No
separate statistics are available in respect of sales ge- Ated by the subject
Project.
Energy Losses
4.03     One feature of PEE's operations is particularly disturbing and that
is the high level of its energy losses. These losses, including station
supply (which probably does not exceed 5% of generation) steadily rose from
about 20% in the early seventies to 26.4% in 1980, 28.8% in 1981 and 32.8% in
1982, and then fell slightly to 30.8% in 1983 and 29.4% in 1984. While about
20% may be considered acceptable for Syria's extensive system (still badly
regulated with respect to reactive current), the remaining losses would be
mainly technical losses arising from poor technical features of the system,
and administrative losses arising from thefts and factors such as faulty
meters and unreliable meter reading, billing and accounting. The Bank
supervision missions had brought the matter to the notice of the Minister of
Electricity and the Director General of PEE with a view to having immediate
corrective measures taken to bring down the losses to a reasonable level of
around 20% by say, the end of 1984. Subsequently, PEE set up a committee to
study the matter and simultaneously also initiated various measures to reduce
energy losses, e.g. strengthening lines, installing capacitors, checking and
recalibrating faulty meters etc. Though the losses came down a little in 1984
from the high level of 1982, high energy losses continue to be a feature of
PEE's operations.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Reorganization of Accounts
5.01     In 1973 before the Bank commenced its participation in the power
subsector, PEE's accounting system required major reorganization, partly
because of its reliance on the Ministry of Finance for all non-routine
financial operations but also because the accounting organization was
fragmented and records were kept in a number of centers (Damascus, Homs,
Aleppo, Latakia, etc.) where the levels of accounting skills varied widely and
whose procedures and accounting principles were not always consistent.
Returns were being sent only annually to the head office in Damascus and the
consolidated accounts were therefore produced late. Clearly, the overall
general accounting and preparation of consolidation accounts were
unsatisfactory.
5.02     An zxpatriate firm of consultants was appointed under a contract
dated March 31, 1975 under Loan 986-SYR of May 1974 to study the accounting
problems and to recommend a suitable utility type accounting system. A system



- 12 -
expected to satisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Finance was proposed
by the consultants, and PEE and the Bank also agreed on the proposed
accounting system. However, no action was taken by PEE to implement the
recommended system. A second expatriate firm of consultants was appointed in
1980 under the subject loan to assist in the reorganization of PEE, to review
the accounting systems recommended by the first firm, suggest changes if
needed and to help train administrative and accounting staff. The firm
submitted its recommendations around March 1983, and again, since the contract
did not cover implementation of the recommended systems and procedures, PEE
was faced with the task of carrying out the implementation. Since PEE was not
able to complete the implementation phase by itself, it asked the firm in
March 1983, as suggested by the Bank, to give its quotation for implementing
the systems and procedures. However, the firm did not respond, apparently
because of its experience under the earlier contract. Thus, two expatriate
consulting firms, one in 1977 and the other in 1980-1983, made various
recommendations for reorganization and improved accounting systems and
procedures, but practically nothing has been done by PEE by way of
implementation. It is doubtful whether PEE would be in a position to
implement the recommendations without outside help.
Revenue Covenant
5.03     PEE's minimum tariffs are regulated by a law requiring tariffs to
cover in addition to operational cost, a reserve for construction of 32 of
gross revenues, and a recurn of 4% on invested capital. These requirements,
however, can be diluted or waived by the Cabinet. In order to ensure adequate
cash generation by PEE for financing its expansion requirements the agreement
under Loan 1144-SYR of July 1975 required PEE to earn from January 1, 1978 a
return of not less than 9% on average net fixed assets in operation. In order
that inflation may not result in depressing the level of self-financing, it
was also provided that the return be computed on revalued assets. The
management consultants appointed under the earlier loan were required to
formulate a standing procedure which would provide for a revaluation of PEE's
assets on an annual basis as may be necessary. The covenant was also extended
to the subject loan with the proviso that certain Government subsidies could
be taken into account for computing the return through 1980 and that PEE's
fixed assets would be revalued from January 1, 1979 (para. 2.02).
Performance Under the Covenant
5.04     As can be seen from PEE's Income Statements in Annex 6, PEE's
performance has been far below appraisal expectations through the entire
project period. In all the years except 1980, the operating revenues were
even less than the operating expenses; the nadir was in 1984 when they were
only 61% of the operating expenses. Even in 1980, despite the 50% tariff
increase from July 1, PEE earned a return of only 3.82 on unrevaluen assets;
the return would have been negative on revalued assets. It would also be seen
that PEE failed to generate any funds internally for financing expansion
during the project period, as against 27% estimated at appraisal. In fact, it
has had to borrow more and more to service its debt. Although under the law,
power tariffs are to be so fixed as to generate a specific return on invested
capital after meeting all operating costs, Government's actions in regard to
tariff-setting have not been such as to meet this legal requirement. Perhaps



- 13 -
this is a reflection of the Government's view that in a centrally planned
economy like Syria's, public sector enterprises such as PEE should operate in
the context of the overall national economic and pricing policies of the
Government and not necessarily as commercially viable enterprises.
5.05     Shortly after the tariff increase of July 1980 it became clear that
the Government did not agree with the Bank on the financial goals for the
sector. In fact in late 1980, the Syrian authorities proposed that the Bank
review with them the possibility of introducing an alternative covenant for
measuring PEE's financial performance more attuned to the Government's
philosophy, its social objectives and its income distribution policy. This
issue became part of the intensive dialogue which developed between the
Government and the Bank on economic issues in 1981-82. During this period,
PEE's poor performance on institutional matters was one of the factors in the
Bank's decision to decline to participate in the South Syrian Thermal Power
Project. In April 1982, the Bank agreed that it could conduct a review if the
revenue covenant as desired by the Government but that as a minimum there
should be:
(a)  proper recapitalization of PEE (whose accumulated losses now exceed
its capital) by conversion of PEE's long-term debt to the Government
into permanent capital;
(b) tariff action to generate sufficient revenues to achieve short-term
cost recovery (recoverl of operating expenses plus fixed assets
depreciation or debt service, whichever is greater); and
(c) Government's agreement in principle with the Bank for annual tariff
revisions that would eventually achieve the long-term objective of
efficiency pricing.
Despite the matter being regularly followed up by the Bank, the Government's
position on the minimum requirements indicated by the Bank is still not
known. In April 1983, in view of the lack of progress on this matter the Bank
specifically considered the question of suspending disbursements. However, on
country grounds and considering the substantial progress being made by PEE in
areas within its control such as procurement and electrification, reduction of
energy losses, efforts to appoint consultants to implement the new accounting
system etc., it was decided not to suspend disbursements but to continue the
Bank's efforts to secure tariff action. The Borrower was advised that unless
tariffs were substantially increased to enable PEE to breas  even, the Bank
would not extend the closing date. No action was taken tj raise tariffs and
the loan closing date of December 31, 1983 was maintained. In 1985, a tariff
increase of an average 75% from January 1985 was necessary for PEE to break
even in its operations but a tariff increase of only 72 was implemented
effective January 1985.
PEE's Accounts and Audit Reports
5.06     PEE's accounting work is badly in arrears.  Under the existing loan
covenants, its accounts for a year are required to be sent to the Bank within
four months of the close of the year. Yet, despite constant efforts on the
part of the Bank to get PEE to submit the accounts, the accounts and audit



- 14 -
reports for 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984 have not been sent to the Bank so far.
For 1980, only the accounts in Arabic have been sent to us, but not in
English. The status of overdue accounts is as follows:
1981      -  accounts prepared by PEE are under audit.  Audit is
expected to be completed by end-September 1985.
1982      -  PEE has completed the accounts.  Audit will be completed
by December 31, 1985.
1983      ---The accounts which were due by end-April 1984 are
expected to be completed by June 30, 1985 and audit by
March 31, 1986.
1984      -  The accounts are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1985 and audit by June 1986.
PEE is aware that accounts prepared so late are worthless as a management
tool. The above-mentioned serious delay in accounting work and in the
submission of the audited accounts to the Bank is within the knowledge of the
Minister and the Director General of PEE. For many years, PEE has been
constantly faced with a heavy backlog of accounts in arrears. Unless its
accounting system is revamped and its staffing situation improves
significantly, there seems to be little escape for PEE from the present
depressing state of affairs.
5.07     A question also arises regarding the acceptability of the auditing
arrangements, i.e., the audit conducted by the Central Agency for the Control
of Public Finances. The Bank would have to await the receipt of the Audit
Reports before commenting on this aspect.
Debt Service Coverage
5.08     Under the subject loan, PEE agreed to obtain the Bank's prior consent
to any borrowing it plans to undertake whenever its internal cash generation
is not sufficient to cover its debt service at least 1.5 times in any future
year. In 1978 and 1979 the debt service coverage was less than two-thirds and
in 1980 despite the revenues generated by the 50% average increase in tariffs
of July 1980 it was still an unsatisfactory 0.89. In 1981, the coverage fell
to 0.32. Since then it became even worse and in 1982, 1983 and 1984, PEE has
had a negative cash flow before debt service. Nevertheless, PEE kept on
making long-term borrowings throughout the period without obtaining the Bank's
prior approval. Therefore, the purpose of PEE and the Bank keeping under
review PEE's assumption of debt liabilities, as was the intention behind the
debt service covenant, was frustrated.
5.09     The consequence of the debt service coverage being less than one
during 1978-1984 except 1980 has been that PEE has had to keep on borrowing
more and more merely to meet its debt service obligations from year to year.
This unhealthy condition has arisen because of the low level of PEE's revenues
as a result of low tariffs and a large investment program necessitating
ever-increasing borrowings.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMLANCE
6.01     PEE's performance has been deficient in practically all respects,
except in the purely technical area. Power generation, transmission and
distribution facilities have been constructed, though with considerable delay,
and the energy flows to the consumers, but this is not at a high level of
efficiency or reliability. There are frequent interruptions in supply and
energy losses are at a high 29.4% (1984). PEE is far from being a strong
organization that manages its affairs, maintains its financial position, plans
its future expansion and carries on its operations, in accordance with sound
business, financial and public utility practices and under the supervision of
experienced a,id competent management, assisted by qualified and competent
staff.
6.02     PEE's main problems are:
- i)    poor organization and bureaucratic procedures;
(ii)    widespread shortage of experienced and qualified staff arising
from inadequate remuneration of staff causing a steady exodus of
experienced staff to the Gulf area, a situation exacerbated by
the long period of compulsory military service;
(iii)    inadequate accounting system;
(iv)    poor communications within the organization arising partly from
widely dispersed offices;
(v)    lack of delegation of responsibilities;
(vi)    lack of autonomy:  PEE forms a part of the Ministry of
Electricity and suffers from ad hoc Governmental decisions which
do not permit sound planning and a well defined and regularly
updated least cost development program; and
(vii)    poor finances:  during the period through 1984, rates were
increased only once in July 1980 (by an inadequate 50 percent;
this was largely offset by a subsequent increase in fuel
prices). The next increase - a small 7% - was in January 1985.
6.03     Management, organizational, administrative and accounting
recommendations made by consultants have yet to be implemented (para. 5.02).
Tle recommendations of a tariff study, completed under Loan 986-SYR of May
1974, with the objective of modernizing PEi's tariff structure, were never
implemented.
VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01     At the time of appraisal, the economic return on the project was
estimated to be 8.5%. In carrying out a re-evaluation, several adjustments
were made to the original method used. First, the actual 1984 average
electricity price was projected to remain constant in real terms as a measure
of the consumers' willingness to pay, although it is not in accordance with



'16-
the Government's recent practice. The original evaluation ass6ued a 142 real
increase in tariff rates above the 1977 level of LS 0.21/kWh. The 1984 price
is equal to only LS 0.157/kWh in terms of 1977 prices.  Second, the
re-evaluation omits from benefits an estimate of savings in diesel fuel used
in previously isolated villages since the available data indicate that the
savings are negligible. Third, the re-evaluation cal.ulates the marginal cost
of generation using the method currently recommended by the Bank "' based on
the costs of combustion turbines in place of the average incremental cost
method used in the original appraisal. Existing combustion turbines have
recently been used more intensively than in the past, and new units will
probably need to be built to meet higher than expected demands. Fourth, the
reappraisal takes account of the fact that rural consumers take much of their
electricity during peak periods. As a result, fuel costs in the reappraisal
are based largely on the relatively high price of diesel oil, whereas in the
appraisal they reflect the relatively low price of heavy fuel oil.
7.02     Annex 7 gives the assumptions used in the economic re-evaluation.  No
calculation of the rate of return was possible since costs exceed benefits in
every year of the Project. This result, however, should be regarded only as
an Lsstssment of the adequacy of tariffs. it is not a useful measure of the
economic merit of the Project as it understates the real benefits by not
quantifying certain social benefits (e.g., the benefit derived from extending
the productive day of people) and understating the consumer's willingness to
pay since it is based on existing low tariffs.
VIII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
8.01     The achievements under the project have not been commensurate with
the Bank's efforts. The Bank certainly identified the right issues at
appraisal and provided approoriate cov-nants even allowing transitional
arrangements for the achievement of th.. required rate of return. Although
supervision continued throughout the period, an increasing attitude of
resignation seems to have developed on the part of Bank staff, perhaps out of
a perceived sense of futility of the whole effort of moving PEE towards
reasonable institutional goals. A contributory factor was a cooling of the
dialogue between the country and the Bank that seems to have developed from
the early eighties regarding the overall strategy for the country's
development. As a result of this, the Bank decided to reduce its overall
sup'-rvision effort in the country resulting in the supervision of the subject
project also becoming rather desultory occasionally during the project
period. There was also during the early part of the project period a lack of
continuity of Bank staff for supervision work.

Analysis of Power systems" (June 1984), page 5.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     To the extent that the subject loan helped PEE to electrify most of
the villages included in the project, the loan could be deemed to have been a
success. But this is taking a very narrow view of the lending operation,
because in most other respects the operation has been a complete failure (see
Annex 1 for PFEs' lack of compliance with the loan covenants). PEE continues
to be plagued by a serious lack of competent and experienced staff. Its
organization and procedures are badly in need of streamlining. Its tariffs
are not based on the cost of supply. Its finances have deteriorated steadily
over time, until in 1984 its operating revenues covered only about 61% of its
operating expenses. Its audited accounts for four years beginning with 1981
have yet to be submitted to the Bank. Those for the past two years (1983 and
1984) have not even been prepared and so in a way, PEE is operating
practically in the darke- in the financial area. This state of affairs
essentially has its roots in a lack of commitment to make PEE a viable and
efficient utility, which in turn has led to lack of essential action=on
various fronts. Action to implement the recommendations of various studies
initiated under the previous loans and the subject loan would have led to
significant improvement in the operations of PEE and in its health.
Lessons to be Learned
9.02     The loan typifies the malaise that could arise in a lending operation
when there is no commitment t. project objectives. In this case, the laws of
Syria require power tariffs to be fixed to generate a return on capital
invested after meeting operating costs.  This was confirmed during
negotiations and the legal documents reflect the agreement reached between the
Bank on the one hand, and the Borrower and the Government on the other, on
project goals after an unusually frank exchange of views and after the Bank
had made it explicitly clear that in the event of non-performance by the
Borrower, the Bank would have to resort to the legal remedies available to
it. It was, therefore, reasonable for the Bank to assume that this agreement
by the Government and the Borrower indeed reflected a genuine commitment on
their part to the project objectives. In the event, the Government and the
Borrower did not live up to their commitments and requested the substitution
of the rate of return covenant by other targets (paras. 5.04 and 5.05), but
were unable to agree on the definition of such targets. The most important
lesson to be learned from this lending operation is that in the absence of a
genuine identity of goals between the Bank on the one hand, and the Government
and the Borrower on the other, and a firm commitment to secure these goals, no
lending operation will have any chance of meeting its objectives. A second
lesson is the success that can be achieved in procurement despite overwhelming
institutional and procedural problems if the concerned staff of the Borrower
could be coached to reach a clearer understanding of the Bank's procurement
guidelines. The award of contracts for distribution tools and equipment
within two to three months of bid opening is a clear example of such success
(para. 3.10).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT - LOAN 1531-SYR
Economic Analysis of the Project
An economic analysis was carried out in which the benefits of the
rural electrification project were compared to the costs. The benefits were
defined as the quantity of electricity sold times the average sales price,
assuming that the 1984 prices remains constant in real terms. The costs
include; marginal generation capacity costs, incremental transmission
capacity costs, fuel costs, and operations ani maintenance costs.
3eneffits
In the absence of data on the number of connections and quantity of
electricity sold attributable to the project, the following assumptions were
used:
- -1,200 villages electrified
- 120 connections per village
- 100 kWh/month/connection (15 kWh/month in first year,
40 in second year, 70 in third year, 100 in fourth
year and after).
Average sales prices (LS 0.226 in 1981, LS 0.23 in 1982, LS 0.246 in
1983, 1984 and after) were deflated to 1977 values using a price index equal



ANNEX 7
-26-                  Page 2 of 4
to the weighted average of the price indices for foreign and local inflation,
with the weights being the present values of foreign and local costs of
electricity supply.
Costs
Marginal capacity costs of generation were calculated on the
assumption that demands attributable to the rural electrification project
would occur mostly during peak periods and require the construction of
combustion turbines using solar oil as fuel. An investment cost of $408/kW in
1981 prices including interest during construction was assumed for combustion
turbine capacity. Requirements for capacity assume: 35% load factor, 20%
reserve margin and 32% losses in generation, transmission and distributior.
All generation capacity was assumed to come into service in 1981.
Capacity costs of transmission were estimated using the average
incremental cost calculated as the ratio of new transmission expenditures for
1981-1984 to the increase in national electricity sales over the same period.
Capacity costs of distribution are the project costs.
Fuel costs were calculated assuming 80% solar oil, used by the
combustion turbines during peak periods, and 20% heavy fuel oil, used ia steam
turbine units during off-peak periods. Heat rates are 3,100 kcal/kWh for the



ANNEX 7
-27-                   Page 3 of 4
combustion turbines and 2,300 kcal/kWh for the steam turbines. International
selling prices assumed are $275 per tonne for solar oil and $202 per tonne for
heavy fuel oil in 1984 prices.
Operations and maintenance costs were estimated assuming a ratio of
2% of capital costs per year.
All costs were deflated to 1977 prices using the following indices
(January 1, 1977 = 100)
Year                    Foreign         Local

1983                      1.37           2.20
1984                      1.33           2.42
Foreign costs were converted to Syrian pounds using the official
exchange rate of US$1.00 = LS 3.95.

Results
Detailed estimates are shown in tie Attachment.  Since fuel costs
alone exceed the benefits, no estimate was made of the internal rate of
return, which would be negative -/
1/ The cost per kWh of imported solar oil was LS 0.33 (US$0.08) in 1984
compared to the average selling price of electricity of LS 0.246.
