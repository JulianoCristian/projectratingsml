families on hitherto\n            unproductive land while raising rubber output, farm incomes,\n            living standards and export incomes. Seven thousand six\n            hundred families would settle on 38,000 ha located in Riau\n            and Jambi Provinces in Sumatera. Seven thousand five hundred\n            ha of existing rubber trees would be replanted, which would\n            benefit an additional 3,750 families in the same areas. An\n            additional 3,500 ha would be developed for the public sector\n            estate PTP IV at Air Molek, Riau.
