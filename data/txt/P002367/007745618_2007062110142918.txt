entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall 
be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR 2,000,000; 
2. 
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible

(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Association a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount 
or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On 
the basis of such request or requests, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower,

amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.  
 
(b) 
(i) 
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Association

Categories, minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into

Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the 
Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be
