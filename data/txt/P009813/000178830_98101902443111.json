      (UGC) System. It would: (a) replace the existing\n            (delapidated) main canal with a parallel lined canal\n            together with modern regulating and access structures; (b)\n            modernize 43,000 ha of the distribution system with lined\n            channels down to and including watercourses; and (c)\n            construct augmentation tubewells on the lined\n            distributaries. In addition, it would: (d) undertake a\n            reconnaissance drainage survey of the UGC command area and a\n            detailed drainage study and pilot works program within the\n            distributary blocks to be modernized; (e) initiate\n            construction of a modern canal communication system; (f)\n            construct one small hydroelectric station and initiate the\n            civil works of another station. Furthermore, the project\n            would: (g) set up a water and land management institute; (h)\n            strengthen the project organization, train staff and provide\n            study tours, visits and technical assistance; and (i)\n            provide vehicles, plant and equipment."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
