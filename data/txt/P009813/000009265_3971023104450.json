It would:  (a) replace the existing\n            (delapidated) main canal with a parallel lined canal\n            together with modern regulating and access structures; (b)\n            modernize 43,000 ha of the distribution system with lined\n            channels down to and including watercourses; and (c)\n            construct augmentation tubewells on the lined\n            distributaries.  In addition, it would:  (d) undertake a\n            reconnaissance drainage survey of the UGC command area and a\n            detailed drainage study and pilot works program within the\n            distributary blocks to be modernized; (e) initiate\n            construction of a modern canal communication system; (f)\n            construct one small hydroelectric station and initiate the\n            civil works of another station.  Furthermore, the project\n            would:  (g) set up a water and land management institute;\n            (h) strengthen the project organization, train staff and\n            provide study tours, visits and technical assistance; and\n            (i) provide vehicles, plant and equipment."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
