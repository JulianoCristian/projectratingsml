The main objectives of the project\n            were to: (a) avert a serious risk of failure of several\n            major structures in the upper reach of the Upper Ganga Canal\n            (UGC) system; (b) rehabilitate and modernize the system and\n            use the savings in water supplies to increase the irrigated\n            areas; (c) increase water supply through conjunctive use of\n            groundwater; (d) improve the State's capacity for\n            sectoral planning and overall management of irrigation\n            schemes; (e) enhance the benefits from sunk cost in the\n            Madhya Ganga Canal (MGC) system which interrelates with the\n            UGC system; and (f) maximize crop production and\n            farmers' income in the project area. The performance of\n            the Bank during supervision was mixed since they failed to\n            push the integrated approach of the project.  The main\n            lessons learnt are: (a) As in many other projects in India,\n            part of the reason for partial completion of the project in\n            Uttar Pradesh is due to the allocation of counterpart funds\n            among too many projects. It is essential that the scale of\n            the project be tailored to the availability of financial\n            resources of the government and to match institutional\n            capabilities.It is essential to have proper designs and\n            adequate investigations of major structures available for\n            review during appraisal and in any case prior to\n            negotiations.  There is a need for future projects to\n            resolve the problem of inadequate operation and  maintenance\n            funding and the related issues of level of water charges and\n            collection rates. In-depth monitoring is an essential tool\n            for improving project performance and for providing reliable\n            data for estimation of project benefits. Follow-up surveys\n            should therefore be encouraged."}, "docdt": "1995-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
