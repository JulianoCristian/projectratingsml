project is to make\n            Bangkok's existing transportation system more efficient\n            with minimum additional investments and to strengthen\n            appropriate traffic related institutions. The project would\n            consist of: (a) specific policies to discourage the use of\n            low occupancy vehicles including pricing, parking controls,\n            and staggering of working and school hours; (b)\n            strengthening of urban traffic management through provision\n            of technical assistance, training and traffic monitoring\n            equipment; (c) low-cost measures to increase the capacity of\n            the urban road network, such as traffic signalling\n            improvements, construction of selected road flyovers and\n            road links, street widening, junction improvements and\n            improved road signing, and (d) improvement of the management\n            and operation of public transport through technical\n            assistance and training. The project entails risks,\n            principally related to political acceptance and enforcement\n            of the proposed area pricing scheme. These risks, however,\n            should be weighted against the exceptionally large economic\n            benefits that successful project implementation would\n            generate. All road users in Bangkok will benefit, with\n            lower-income groups who travel by public transport\n            benefiting relatively more than the more affluent."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
