In\n            addition, the project sets several milestones for the Bank:\n            first use of a partial risk guarantee; largest private\n            sector infrastructure project supported by the Bank to date;\n            first Bank-financed infrastructure fund to support private\n            sector projects; and first co-guarantee with another\n            financial institution, the Japan Export-Import Bank. The\n            Bank's guarantee, which protects commercial lenders\n            against sovereign risks associated with the project,\n            establishes a new method of supporting build, own, operate\n            (BOO) projects which are normally financed on a project\n            finance or limited-recourse basis. Prior to Hub, Bank\n            guarantees were utilized as co-financing instruments\n            designed to help mobilize commercial funding for\n            Bank-supported public sector projects. It is expected that\n            the Bank guarantee for the Hub project will serve as a model\n            for future guarantees in support of other BOO projects."}, "docdt": "1995-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
