is\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            institutional development impacts are negligible. Both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory, given that not enough attention was paid by\n            the Bank, to the manner in which the Government was\n            implementing its 1994 Private Power Policy. Several lessons\n            are drawn from the project, among which it is suggested that\n            once independent power producers (IPPs) start operations in\n            a power system, it would be advantageous that an integrated\n            utility sector be unbundled, in order to introduce\n            competition; additionally, an automatic indexation formulae\n            should be set, to protect the utility's purchasing\n            power from fuel costs, currency devaluation, and the cost of\n            purchased power. The support to privatized power\n            infrastructure boards, and organizations, may have had the\n            unintended effect of enabling vested interest in the sector\n            to \"capture and stall\" structural changes\n            envisaged in the 1992 Strategic Plan for privatization,\n            i.e., the single buyer model had risks in terms of\n            preserving the role of the sector ministry in investment\n            decisions, shielding financiers from market risks, and\n            government interference in electricity wholesale trading.\n            Thus institutional, and regulatory frameworks are being\n            finalized, designed to protect a competitive wholesale\n            market. IPP programs need to be tailored according to public\n            financial support, and guarantees to facilitate efficient\n            investments; limit the size of the first IPP to enable ready\n            substitutions; and, have an efficient fuel supply policy,\n            with managerial, contracting capacity."}, "docdt": "2001-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
