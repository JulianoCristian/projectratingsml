Development\n            Project provides:  (a) up to 2300 MW of power generation\n            capacity, 2 million tons per year of domestic coal and 132\n            million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) of natural gas by FY93,\n            financed through a newly established Energy Development\n            Fund.  The project further provides (b) consulting services\n            to train and support the staff of:  (i) the institutions\n            responsible for the approval of private sector proposals,\n            and (ii) the Fund in the appraisal, finance of subprojects\n            and the supervision of their implementation.  The proposed\n            project would assist the Government of Pakistan (GOP) in\n            attracting the participation of the Private Sector (PS) in\n            the development of energy.  It would facilitate the\n            achievement of the objectives of the Seventh Plan, and\n            create the framework and procedures during the Seventh Plan\n            that could lead to an even bigger PS participation during\n            the Eighth Plan. The project, with an installed capacity of\n            1,292 MW, comprises fo conventional oil-fired power\n            generating units of 323 MW each and assoc facilities,\n            including a 500 kV switch yard, access road, and fuel oil\n            tanks.  The project will be undertaken by the Hub Power\n            Company (HUBCO Build-Own Operate basis. Fuel for the project\n            will be supplied by a p to be constructed and operated by\n            the Pakistan State Oil Company (PSO) public sector company.\n            Two single circuit 500 kV lines of 200 kilomet each, to be\n            constructed by WAPDA under the Transmission Extension and\n            Reinforcement Project (Loan 3147-PAK) will connect the\n            project to the transmission grid.
