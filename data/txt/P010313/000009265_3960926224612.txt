MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomnendation on a proposed loan to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan for US$150 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, and repayable over 20 years  including 5 years grace.  It would help
finance subprojects for the development of energy under the auspices of the
private sector. The project will be cofinanced by bilateral donors as well as
private sector equity participation, commercial loans and suppliers' credit.
Background
2.       Pakistan's economic performance during the Fifth and Sixth Plans has
been  impressive.   Growth  of  GDP  has  averaged  over  62  annually.   The
deregulation of imports, the introduction of flexible exchange rates, the
rationalization of prices, and the concentration of public expenditures on
priority  investment  have  contributed  to  the  improvement  in  economic
performance.   Despite this achievement, a number of structural constraints
remain. In the energy sectnr, shortage of financial resources and inadequate
implementation capabilities impeded the actievement of the supply targets.
The shortfalls, together with the rapid growEh of consumption, increased the
country's dependence on  imported energy.   Consequently,  GOP accorded high
priority  to  restructuring  the sector during  the  Sixth  Plan  (FY84-FY88).
However, as concrete policies to restructure the sector were not introduced in
the first two years of the Plan, only one-half of planned investments for the
sector  was  achieved,  energy  prices  declined  in  real  terms,  and  the
institutions in the sector were unable to respond adequately to the needs of
the economy.  Moreover, the role envisaged for Private Sector (PS) under the
Plan did not materialize as proposals for the expansion of coal mining and
power generation capacities were inadequate.  As a result, shortages in the
supply of energy ensued.   This  prompted  GOP  to formulate  in  1986,  with
assistance from the Bank, a Long-term Energy Strategy (LES) aimed at
addressing the main issues in the sector to better cope with the future needs
of the economy.  The first phase of LES was implemented under the Energy
Sector Loan (ESL I) which provided the policy umbrella and the resources to
implement a minimum investment program of high priority projects during the
last three years of the Sixth Plan.  Among the issues addressed under ESL I
was the introduction of measures to increase PS investment in the energy
sector.
3.       The  second  phase  of  LES,  covering  the  next  two  plan  periods,
concentrates on the formulation of development plans based on a more rational
means of allocating public expenditures by limiting the investments to be
undertaken by the public sector to what could realistically be implemented and
financed. If this approach to planning is maintained, significant shortages
in energy would be experienced during the Seventh and Eighth Plans:  (a) the
deficit in electricity supply would increase from 1,000 MW in 1988 to 2,000 MW



-2
by 1993 and 4,000 MW by 199d; (b) the shortfall in the supply of coal would
inctease from 2 million tons in 1993 to 4 million tons in 1998; and (c) the
shortage of natural gas would increase from 132 MMCFD in 1993 to 200 MMCFD in
1998.  These  shortfalls  would  impede  the  growth  of  the  economy  through
frequent and prolonged interruption in the supply of electricity to industry
and agriculture, which account for 75% of total consumption of electricity,
802 of the annual coal production, and 602 of natural gas consumption.
Alternatively, if substitute fuels are to be used to eliminate the expected
shortages, the annual cost of additional imports of petroleum products would
reach US$200 million by 1993, and increase to about US$400 million by 1998.
This would have an adverse impact on the economy, particularly in view of the
expected constraints on the availability of foreign exchange during the
Seventh and Eighth Year Plans. Consequently, GOP concluded that only PS
investment could bridge the expected shortages in energy.
4.       In  order  to  ensure  the  timely  implementation  of  the  energy
development  plan,  PS  investments  in  energy  would  be  undertaken  under
b-tild-own-operate-transfer   (BOOT)   arrangements   involving   the   design,
construction, commissioning and operation of projects by private investors,
and the transfer of the facilities to the Government after the completion of
their economic life.  In addition, GOP decided that only BOOTs requiring no
direct sovereign guarantee, i.e. limited recourse financing, would be
considered.   GOP requested the assistance of the Bank Group in outlining a
framework that would provide incentives to PS to consider BOOT type
investments under limited recourse financing. A study was undertaken by the
Bank and IFC with the assistance of consultants, financed by ODA and USAID, to
identify the institutional and policy constraints to be addressed to achieve
this objective.   The study recommended:  (a) strengthening the  institutions
responsible for the evaluation and approval of PS proposals; (b) creating a
vehicle to provide long term financing for PS investments; and (c) designing a
framework of incentives for PS development of energy.
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
5.       The Bank Group has played a major role in assisting GOP to create an
institutional framework which wou'ld facilitate the participation of PS in
energy development on a hitherto unprecedented scale. PS participation on the
scale envisaged could not have been contemplated without such a framework,
which resulted from the Bank's strong catalytic role in bringing together the
investors,  lenders,  suppliers,  cofinanciers and GOP.   In  particular,  the
creation of a Fund within NDFC would not only serve as a vehicle for
mobilizing resources from bilateral cofinanciers and the Bank, but for
channeling  funds  to  viable  enterprises  on a basis  which would  generate
resources from the PS in the form of equity, foreign commercial loans, and
suppliers' credits, on a scale which will substantially exceed the Fund's own
contribution.
6.       While  the  institutional  framework noted above  serves  as  a  good
foundation for the proposed Project, there is a continuing role for the Bank
Group during its implementation. All cofinanciers would rely, wholly or in
part, on the Bank in ensuring that the preparation of guidelines for PS
participation, the recruitment and appointment of consultants, the selection
of subprojects, and the adoption of appropriate safeguards with regard to
environmental and resettlement matters would not only meet high technical
standards but would be fully consistent with the Bank's guidelines. Moreover,
the Bank would coordinate on behalf of all the cofinanciers the requirements
concerning procurement, disbursements and reporting.



-3-
Project Objectives
7.       The proposed Project would assist GOP in: (a) mobilizing resources
for cofinancing private sector investments in energy development to contribute
towards the achievement of the objectives of the Seventh and Eighth Plans; and
(b) setting an institutional framework to sustain PS investment and operation
in the energy sector.
Project Description
8.       The  proposed  Project would provide:  (a) up to 2,300 MW of power
generation capacity, 2 million tons per year of domestic coal and 132 MMCFD of
natural gas by FY93, financed through a newly established Energy Development
Fund (Fund) to be administered by National Development Finance Corporation
(NDFC) to cover up to 302 of the total cost of private sector subprojects to
be implemented under BOOT arrangements through limited recourse financing; and
(b)  consulting  services  to  train  and  support  the  staff  of:  (i)  the
institutions responsible for the approval of private sector proposals, and
(ii) the Fund in the appraisal, finance of subprojects and the supervision of
their implementation.  The estimated total cost of the proposed Project is
about US$1,893 million equivalent.  The proposed Bank Loan of about US$150
million, together with loans and grants from bilateral aid agencies amounting
to US$380 million,  would  finance  the Fund and consulting  services.   The
remaining US$1,318 million would be provided by PS, comprised of US$470
million (252) equity and US$893 million (472) in local and foreign commercial
loans and suppliers' credits.  Of the total PS equity, about US$235 million
would be in foreign exchange and the rest would be provided by Pakistani
institutional and individual investors. The proposed loans from the Bank and
bilateral agencies to finance the Fund would be made to GOP with sovereign
guarantee. The commercial loans and suppliers' credit of US$893 million would
be provided under limited recourse financing arrangement involving no direct
sovereign guarantee. Project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Methods of procurement and estimated disbursement are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan are given in Schedule C & D, respectively. A map are
also attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 7226-PAK dated June 10, 1988 is
being circulated separately.
Institutional Framework
9.       Under  the  proposed  Project,  the  institutions  involved  with  PS'
development of energy would be rationalized, their capabilities strengthened,
and  procedures  streamlined.   This  would be achieved within  the existing
overall organizational framework. Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) would be
responsible for approval of power proposals, and Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Resources (MPNR) for oil/gas and coal proposals. The ministries would
seek, on a case-to-case basis, the views of other ministries and entities
concerned, e.g. Planning, Transport, Finance, Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA), Karachi Electric Supply Company (KESC), Sui Northern Gas
Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), etc.  In addition, the creation and operations of
the Fund would provide the long-term financing required for PS investment.
The Fund will be responsible for the appraisal of PS subprojects and the
supervision of their implementation in accordance with standards acceptable to
the Bank and Cofinanciers. The proposed Project would also assist GOP in
attracting PS investments under a BOOT arrangement through limited recourse
financing.   This approach  to project development would  require a  set of



-4-
criteria, measures, provisions and agreements, together referred to as
Security Package (SP), which would safeguard the interests of the lenders,
investors and the Government. GOP has requested the Bank to take the lead in
outlining a framework for SP to serve as a basis for the formulatior of
subproject specific SPs to be agreed among those involved.
Subprojects
10.      All subprojects approved by GOP and financed by the Fund should meet
the eligibility criteria, which among other things, requires that prices for
energy produced by subprojects are lower than the cost to the ecnnomy of
producing the same product.   Presently,  proposals for  the  installation  of
about 2,000 MW and increasing annual domestic coal production by about 1..
million tons have either been issued a letter of intent (LOI) or are under
review by GOP. The proposals which have been iss'ted an LOI are:
(a) Habibullah Mines of Pakistan and Siemens of Germany to install 2X50 MW
domestic coal power stations; (b) Xenel Industries of Saudi Arabia and Hawker
Siddeley Power Engineering of the UK to install 4X300 MW steam power stations,
and (c) Fecto of Pakistan to install 6X20 MW diesel units. In addition, two
proposals are currently under review:  (a) PakLand of Pakistan, and Pyropower
and Bechtel of USA to install a 3X44 MW station, based on domestic coal; and
(b) INTRAG of USA to install a lX80 MW domestic coal station.   Two other
proposals are currently at an advanced stage of preparation:   (a) Deutsch
Babcock of Germany to install a 2X80 MW domestic coal-based station; and
(b) Kumagai-Gumi of Japan and Davy McKee of UK, in a joint venture with PMDC,
to develop a coal mine at Lakhra for the production of 1.2 million tons per
year. The LOI is based on a prefeasibility study and an indicative financing
plan, and provides the sponsors an exclusive right to prepare the subproject
under agreed conditions. The sponsors would be required to submit a detailed
feasibility study to GOP and the Fund within six months of issuance of the
LOI, after which the Fund would appraise the subprojects to establish their
technical, economic and financial viability, prior to providing financing,.

14.      GOP has approved  tn:e establishment  of  the Private  Sector  Energy
Development  Fund  and  its  administration  by  NDFC.  PPC  in MWP has  been
established and key staff appointed. NDFC has also appointed the senior vice
president and recruited two professional staff for the unit which will
administer the Fund. Consultants for the preparation of guidelines for the
operation of the Fund, including guidelines for appraisal, approval and
supervision of subprojects and the brochure, have been recruited.
Benefits
15.      The proposed Project would assist GOP in attracting the participation
of PS in the development of energy.  It would facilitate the achievement at
least cost of the energy sector objectives of the Seventh Plan, and create the
framework and procedures during the Seventh Plan that could lead to an even
bigger PS participation during the Eighth Plan. By introducing fluidized bed
combustion technology for using low-quality domestic coal in power generation
and state-of-the-art coal mining and oil/gas production techniques, the
proposed Project would assist in overcoming the technological barriers to
energy development currently being experienced by the public sector agencies.
16.      The proposed Project would also introduce the concept of  limi ted
recourse financing in Pakistan which could be applied to other sectors,
particularly  industry and  transport.   The  Fund  to  be  createC  under  the
proposed Project would mobilize resources for the future development of the
energy sector by recycling the revenues attributable to the interest rate
spreads. These funds could be leveraged to mobilize additional resources for
financing future PS energy subprojects, particularly if the study for
assessing the future structure for the Fund recommends its evolution into a
separate energy development finance institution.



-7
Risks
17.      The proposed Project faces two types of risks.  The first is that the
expected participation by the local financial institutions, other than the
Fund, may not be sufficient to mobilize the very large amounts of local
financing  involved.   Alternatively,   the  project-related  investments  may
pre-empt such a large share of the local investible resources that the
non-energy sectors might become constrained.   In anticipation of a possible
domestic credit shortfall, GOP will allow an expansion of credit by local
institutions to accommodate the incremental financing needs of PS projects in
energy.   Moreover,  in order to avoid the possibility of overburdening  the
local institutions, GOP will reach an agreement with overseas investors that
any shortfall  in the contribution of  local institutions  (equity or loans)
would be made up by overseas investors on the understanding that the local
institutions could subsequently assume the equity or loans when they are able
to do so. The second source of risk associated with the proposed Project is
that the pipeline of subprojects may not be built up to fully utilize the
resources of the Fund. However, the subprojects, for which letters of intent
have already been issued, would utilize about US$300 million from the Fund.
Moreover, the three other proposals, which are now being prepared for
submission  to  GOP.  could  utilize  a  further  US$115  million.   The  above
subproject pipeline was built prior to the establishment of the Fund, and it
is expected that the establishment of the Fund will lead to other subproject
proposals.
18.      A third risk associated with the project pertains to the possible
failure of PS companies to generate the revenue required to cover their
financial commitments. Revenue generation is a function of the agreed price
and the quantity to be delivered to energy purchasing agencies. The price for
sale of energy is stipulated in EPAs, which are structured to cover operating
costs, debt service and provide returns. Automatic adjustment mechanisms would
be introduced in these agreements to ensure that investors are compensated for
changes in the costs of their inputs, including the erosion in the value of
the rupee relative  to foreign currencies.   Energy sales by PS enterprises
would be carried out under a letter of credit to ensure that payments would be
made in a timely fashion. As for the willingness of agencies to purchase the
quantities stipulated in EPAs. the likelihood of a failure in compliance with
this agreement is fairly minimal in that the investment undertaken by PS are
complements rather than substitutes for public sector investments, and also
that there is a  -ubstantial unsatisfied demand for energy.  In addition, the
EPAs are designe to allow for a delivery of specified quantities of energy
for which GOP would guarantee purchase irrespective of whether the energy is
taken or not under a take-or-pay arrangement. These provisions would minimize
the possibility that the revenues associated with the operation of PS
subprojects would not materialize.
Recommendation
19.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
