US$20.0\n            million equivalent will be on-lent for the same purpose to\n            three \"special\" large \"projects\" already\n            tentatively identified which have special

consultants) for KBP and its\n            industrial clients, all in the Autonomous Province of\n            Kosovo, the poorest region of Yugoslavia.
