                          .
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Metropolitan Manila (MM), the capital of the Philippines is located in the hydraulically
complex Pasig River - Laguna de Bay - Manila Bay watershed. Manila Bay is an important
economic zone, producing 35-40% of the national GDP. All MM waterways are heavily polluted
and the key watercourses, the Marikina and Pasig Rivers, are biologically dead. Up to 75% of
pollution is caused by domestic sewage, with the rest originating from industry. Within MM less
than 15% of residents are connected to a sewerage system, and most of the wastewater from
sewerage and septage is discharged without treatment.

2.       The water pollution control sector is complex and fragmented; many government
agencies are involved, including: Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR),
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) - and its two concessionaires, Manila
Water Company Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) - Department of Health
(DOH), Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission
(PRRC), and local government units (LGUs). The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has
taken steps to address the problems in the sector, including policy changes and investment. The
GOP enacted the Clean Water Act 2004 (CWA-2004) 1 which aims to protect the country’s water
bodies from pollution from land-based sources and provides for a comprehensive strategy to
prevent and minimize pollution through a multi-sectoral approach. DENR is the primary
government agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this Act; the
responsibility for environmental sanitation, specifically domestic wastewater was a new extension
to its mandate.

3.       The World Bank has been involved in wastewater sector development in MM for many
years, primarily through a series of investment projects under the leadership of MWSS. The GEF
project was developed to provide technical assistance (TA) to the Manila Third Sewerage Project
P079661 (MTSP) financed by an IBRD loan of US$64 million (approved by the Board in 2005
and closed 2012) and implemented by MWSS. The GEF project was also initially envisaged to be
implemented by MWSS and preparation started at around the same time. However the scope of
activities required in identifying and targeting hot spots and water quality monitoring meant that
it was ultimately within the mandate of DENR. At the time of appraisal, despite their assigned
mandate, DENR did not have any experience in domestic wastewater management projects, had
no dedicated sanitation department and did not consider domestic wastewater as a high priority.
The level of ownership within DENR and enthusiasm to take on this new role in domestic
wastewater was relatively limited. On the contrary MWSS has an established role in
implementing wastewater management projects, but no mandate in overall water quality
management and monitoring. There was therefore a level of tension over the potentially
competing and overlapping responsibilities and mandates. The discussions between the
implementing agencies took almost two years before the GEF project eventually started in 2007.


1
  Key relevant aspects of this Act are; (a) the requirement for DENR to designate water quality
management areas and establish multi-sectoral governing boards to manage water quality issues within
their jurisdiction; (b) the requirement for all owners or operators of facilities that discharge wastewater to
get a permit to discharge from the DENR or the Laguna Lake Development Authority; and (c) the
development of Fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for LGUs, water districts, enterprise, private entities and
individuals who undertake outstanding and innovative projects in water quality management



                                                      1
4.      This project was financed by the Strategic Partnership Investment Fund for Pollution
Reduction in the Large Marine Ecosystems of East Asia (the Fund), under the GEF’s
Contaminant-Based Operational Program No 10. The objectives of the project were consistent
with the World Bank, 2001 Global Environment Strategy and the 2005 EAP Environment
Strategy.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
5.      The GEO is to assist the GOP in the Project Areas in:
a. identifying essential adjustments to administrative, institutional, and regulatory practices and
    existing legislations in order to attract private investments in the Recipient's wastewater
    sector;
b. promoting innovative, simple and effective wastewater treatment techniques; and
c. increasing the effectiveness of the agencies responsible for water pollution control through
    improved coordination.

6.     Key original GEO indicators are as follows:
a. Coverage of sewage service in MWSS jurisdiction (% population); increase from 12 to 20
b. Coverage of sanitation service in MWSS jurisdiction (% population); increase from 24 to 57
c. Pollution reaching Manila Bay (1,000 metric tons of BOD5/year); reduction of 9

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
7.       There were no changes to the GEO. Following the midterm review the baseline and the
targets for the key indicators were revised as follows:
a. Coverage of sewage service in MWSS jurisdiction (% population); increase from 8 to 18
b. Coverage of sanitation service in MWSS jurisdiction (% population); increase from 24 to 100
c. Reduction of pollution reaching Manila Bay (1,000 metric tons of BOD5/year); no change

8.      Changes were made to the baseline and target values for the intermediate indicators as
described in the project data sheet. One additional indicator was added; establishment of Water
Quality Management Areas (WQMAs). Both the GEO and the intermediate indicators were
revised with the aim to reflect realistic baseline conditions and achievable targets.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.       The project activities will have a direct impact on around 19 thousand people, including
the following beneficiary groups:
a. 18,500 people within Quezon City, whose wastewater will be treated in the Joint Septage and
    Sewerage Treatment Plant (JSSTP), benefiting from improved sewerage and septage services.
b. 14 LGUs who have been supported through an MoU with DENR to develop action plans to
    improve wastewater management
c. 60 staff from; DENR, MWSS, MWCI, MWSI, DPWH, DILG, MMDA, PPRC and 11 LGUs
    who have been trained on data management systems and Geographic Information Systems
d. 160 staff from DENR, LLDA, DoH, MWSS and concessionaires, MMDA, PRRC and nine
    LGUs (including Barangay officials) who benefitted from workshops on community
    organizing for sanitation and sewerage improvement and water quality monitoring
e. LLDA who benefitted from technical assistance market based instruments, including (i)
    extending and restructuring the Environmental User Fee (EUF) and (ii) innovative financing
    models for investments into environmental sanitation
f. DENR who benefitted from technical assistance to develop draft policies on sanitation and



                                                 2
   sewage management. In addition, Makati and Quezon LGUs which benefitted from the draft
   policy on septage management to develop Ordinances
g. MWSS, and DENR, who benefitted from technical assistance to draft updates to the
   Sewerage and Sanitation Master Plan (SSMP), pilot the Public Assessment on Sewerage and
   Sanitation Services (PASS) and improve the rate rebasing process

10.     Indirect beneficiaries are extensive and include (a) Low income-class communities
around the JSSTP who benefit from improved quality of effluent and reduced odor; (b) National
and local institutions benefitting from support to the implementation of the CWA-2004; (c) Large
sections of MM who are expected to benefit from improved water quality in the long term; and
(d) National and local agencies as well as MM communities that will benefit from the future
implementation of the policies.

1.5 Original Components
11.      The seven GEF project components are described below. Component 1-6 combine to
identify impediments to cooperation among sector agencies and to investments in sewerage and
sanitation. Component 7 supports project management, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination.
   1. Partnership strengthening among the Government agencies responsible for water pollution
        control ($1.00M)
   2. Planning and policy development ($0.5M), including Updating the 2013 MM SSMP.
        Developing or updating relevant policy instruments
   3. Innovative financing ($0.5M): Development and testing of financing options and
        identification of incentives for private sector participation
   4. Use of Market-based Incentives ($0.1M)
   5. Support to MWSS Rate rebasing ($0.6M)
   6. Joint sewage and septage treatment plant (JSSTP) ($4.7 million - $1.3 million financed by
        GEF, remainder from the Counterpart funds)
   7. Project Management ($1.0 Million) support to DENR

1.6 Revised Components
12.    During restructuring one activity was added to Component 1; establishment of three
WQMAs.

1.7 Other significant changes
a. The end of the project was extended from November 30, 2012 to May 31, 2014. This 18
    month extension was required to ensure that the joint septage and sewage treatment plant
    (JSSTP) to be fully operational before the grant closing date. There was no increase to the
    project budget as a result of this extension.
b. The name of the Technical Assistance (TA) recipient agency for rate rebasing was changed
    from Manila Water Company Inc. (MWCI) to Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI). MWCI
    had completed rate rebasing negotiations before the Grant was approved.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.      Application of Lessons Learned. The GEF project preparation was supported by
analysis and experience gained through the previous Manila Sewerage Projects. The project made
efforts to identify and incorporate lessons learned. One of the issues highlighted was the need to
engage all stakeholders, including civil society, in order to catalyze large-scale structural change



                                                 3
in the sector. The project incorporated a strong focus on building partnerships between different
agencies in order to increase efficiency and impact. In addition, the project took on board the
lessons learnt during the 2002-03 rebasing exercise when the Government had insufficient
information to prioritize environmental issues during its negotiations with concessionaires.

14.     Stakeholder Participation. Stakeholder participation during preparation was good. All
participating agencies were involved in consultation and their concerns were incorporated into the
project which led to a much broader project scope. While this process increased ownership by the
different stakeholders it also contributed to the complexity of the project. Several public
consultations were done during the Environmental Assessment, including meetings with local
residents, communities, local government representatives, and analysis of public opinion.

15.     Implementation arrangements: A number of agencies were responsible for project
implementation, reflecting the complexity of the water pollution control sector and the different
responsibilities and mandate of each agency. Components 1-3 were led by DENR’s
Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). Component 4 was implemented by the Laguna Lake
Development Authority (LLDA). Components 5 and 6, and also part d of Component 1, were
carried out by Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS). Coordination of these
agencies and day-to-day management of the project was carried out by the Project Management
Office (PMO) within DENR. General administration (including procurement, financial
management, selection and contract management of consulting services), and progress reporting,
was provided by the Foreign Assisted and Special Projects Office (FASPO), also within DENR.
The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) and the Manila Bay Coordinating Office
(MBCO) were involved in the activities to harmonize water quality monitoring.

            Hosting PIC                                implementation


16.     The institutional and technical capacities of DENR and MWSS were reviewed during
preparation and found to be largely adequate. Some capacity building needs were identified and
conducted during project implementation.

17.    A detailed study of the capacity of LGUs to improve environmental sanitation was not
completed. LGUs were known to have relatively low capacity in the domestic wastewater sector
and not to see it as a priority area for budget allocation; these constraints were the drivers for
engaging the LGUs in the project as important stakeholders.

18.     Risks and their mitigation. The majority of the risks identified during preparation did


                                                 4
materialize during project implementation, and led to delays including; (a) procurement delays
due to low capacity, (b) the risk of low investment from the concessionaires (c) the difficulties of
reaching efficient working partnerships among the major agencies; and (d) potential
administrative bottlenecks given the numerous participating agencies. There were no new risks
found during implementation and in this sense the identification of risks was very accurate.
However the ‘modest’ risk level identified during preparation did not fully reflect the fact that
DENR had previously done little work on regulation of domestic wastewater, had limited
capacity in the sub sector, regarded domestic waste as a relatively low priority and had no direct
mandate in sanitation infrastructure provision. For example both (a) the risk of low investment
from the concessionaires; and (b) difficulties in partnering among the major agencies; should
have been set at ‘high’, rather than ‘modest’. Mitigation measures were integrated into the design
of the project – for example through partnership development, but were not sufficient to address
the difficult context. Additional measures should have been taken, such as reducing the scope and
simplifying the GEO to include a single aim. With hindsight, despite the small size of the project,
given the complex design and ambitious scope the risk level should have been assessed as
‘substantial’.

19.      Assessment of overall design. The project was relevant and responded to the needs and
priorities of DENR and MWSS. It directly supports the implementation of CWA-2004 and also
contributed to the Country Assistance Strategy’s (CAS 2006-2008) focus on efficient provision of
basic services and the importance of good environmental management to support growth. The
preparation met Bank fiduciary, social and environmental safeguard policies, including public
disclosure of all required documents.

20.     The project design attempted to reflect the realities of the water pollution control sector
and such is highly complex, with seven components covering a diverse range of technical areas
and three implementing agencies. Locating the PMO under the supervision of both FASPO and
EMB introduced additional reporting and approval steps in the project management. Combining
the implementation of sewage treatment works under the auspices of the environmental
regulatory authority, DENR, introduced additional complexities and, as described above, there
was an inherent tension in the project due to the new mandate of DENR and the existing role of
MWSS. In addition during project preparation there were limited attempts to provide systematic
support which might have made partnership development more successful, for example the
project did not complete an assessment of each agency to determine how their organization and
procedures might help or hinder partnership development. The design of the monitoring
framework reflected the complexity and ambition of the project; with GEO indicators projecting
ambitious MM wide improvements in sanitation and sewerage.

21.    There was no formal Quality at Entry review for the project. Due to the high level of
complexity in the design, and under estimation of the risk, this ICR concludes that Quality at
Entry was Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

22.     Overall Implementation was rated as consistently Moderately Satisfactory in
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Although the project has completed the majority of the
planned outputs, and disbursed the full grant allocation, only 8 of the 15 intermediate indicators
and none of the GEO indicators, have been achieved. In the final ISR the Implementation
Progress was therefore downgraded. The project implementation faced a number of challenges as
summarized below;
a. Rapid staff turnover of all PMO members, for example the Project Manager changed four


                                                 5
      times during implementation. This high turnover was due in part to a requirement that the
      Project Manager be at Director Level which aimed to increase the profile of the project, but
      instead led to reduced management support as Directors had few incentives to stay with the
      project. The technical staff assigned to the project were only assigned part time and were
      therefore also working on their regular tasks which made it difficult for them to focus in
      accomplishing their project assignments on a timely basis. This turnover has led to loss of
      institutional memory, poor information management, weakened coordination and slowed the
      momentum behind implementation. The most tangible impact of this is in the delivery of the
      SSMP; which was drafted and consulted upon, but not finalized under the project;
b.    Lack of resources to provide sustained follow up, particularly with LGUs. LGUs are often
      under resourced and sanitation and sewerage is typically a low priority. The 3 year election
      cycle for LGUs also made developing long term partnerships difficult;
c.    Delays in procurement. Implementation of TA started in earnest 2-3 years after approval due
      to difficulties in finding qualified consultants. The first bidding process for the Joint Sewage
      and Septage Treatment Plant (JSSTP) failed due to the low quality of submissions – leading
      to the main project delay and need for a grant extension;
d.    Difficulties in contract management; the rate rebasing contract was based on person-weeks,
      rather than outputs which meant that work was completed by Government agencies; the
      consultant drafting the policies moved away from the Philippines and transferred this task to
      a sub-contractor without a full handover of documents;
e.    Working across a number of implementing agencies and LGUs and with supervision from
      both EMB and FASPO within DENR delayed implementation. For example, during
      construction of the JSSTP the project team found a number of points where the different
      procedures of DENR and MWSS contradicted each other or had different requirements; the
      team had to develop shared procedures (including reconciling billing procedures and health
      and safety procedures) during implementation.

23.      The roots of these problem stem from project design as (i) the project was attempting to
advocate for an increased priority to be given to domestic wastewater by DENR, from within the
organization, and (ii) Partnering between organizations is widely recognized to take additional
resources, including substantial political will, and the PMO was not adequately resourced for the
task. However it should also be noted that a number of good practices were developed during
project implementation to support partnership development, for example;
a. The implementing agencies developed TWGs for each component to review the procurement
    and deliverables of all consultants and civil works. The head of each TWG also served as the
    focal point for that component. These TWGs were made up of permanent staff which
    supported internal capacity building even with the overall reliance on consultants for
    implementation;
b. In the initial stages of the project the main focus was on consultation and training with LGUs
    to develop the base for implementing CWA-2004. The large number of LGUs engaged with
    DENR through MoUs (14 in total) proved difficult to support in practice. Introducing the
    establishment of WQMAs, a provision under the CWA-2004, during the project restructuring
    facilitated LGU engagement.
c. Frequent Partnership meetings were used for cross agency coordination and to resolve
    problems in implementation. These meetings resolved many of the issues faced during the
    construction of the JSSTP, for example working times and haulage in crowded urban spaces,
    and are partly credited with ensuring that the construction was completed on schedule.
d. The draft reports and policy instruments have undergone extensive stakeholder consultations
    and the project has supported public release of water quality data.

24.       Mid Term review and restructuring. During the mid-term review, when the


                                                   6
restructuring process was started, the project was rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The team
noted at the mid-term review that the GEO indicator targets were impossible to achieve by project
closure and were not consistent with the MWSS business plan. The main aims of the restructuring
were to: (a) Amend Indicators to reflect realistic baseline conditions and realistic and less
ambitious, achievable targets; (b) Corrected name of Recipient Agency for rate rebasing. (c)
Extend the Grant closing date to enable financing equipment for the JSSTP and support the
process proofing.

25.      The restructuring was approved in November 2012 and met aims (b) and (c). Aim (a) was
also partially met; the baseline was amended and targets for intermediate indicators were revised
to be more realistic. An additional intermediate indicator to complete the establishment of three
WQMAs was introduced to support an integrated approach to water quality management in the
catchment. These WQMAs were also used to facilitate the engagement of LGUs in this project
which has proved to be an effective approach. However, at the GEO indicator level targets for
sanitation and sewerage coverage and BOD loading were either unchanged or made more
ambitious. At the mid-term review the Bank team advised the Client that they should reduce the
ambition of the project, given the challenges faced. However the Client felt strongly that the
activities included were essential and that the contribution of the project to wider impacts in terms
of improved sanitation should be measured. The restructuring did not consider changing the
implementation arrangements as the work under DENR, LLDA and MWSS were already well
advanced.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.      The GEO indicators were chosen to reflect the links with the IBRD financed investment
projects and to keep all actors focused on the long term aim of the partnerships. This important
objective has unfortunately impacted negatively on the evaluation of the project as the GEO
indicators are well beyond the scope of the project activities and the implementation timeline and
have therefore not been met. The monitoring completed by the PMO and participating agencies
has focused largely upon the intermediate indicators, which are specific, achievable and relevant
for the scale and period of the grant. Regular reports have been completed capturing progress on
outputs and the intermediate indicators. MWSS has provided regular updates on the sewerage and
sanitation coverage in MM. It has not been possible to measure the “before and after” BOD load
for the whole of Manila Bay so the numbers presented were based on good engineering
assessment. LLDA have provided regular updates on the pollution rates in Laguna Lake and the
institutions monitored. In general reporting has been consistent, although there has not been
extensive monitoring of the impact of outputs and indicators once they had been achieved, so this
last link in the project cycle is not always clear, as described later in the ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

27.     Safeguards. The project complied with Environmental and Social policies and
procedures. The project was determined as a Category B project with OP/BP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment triggered, due to the construction of the JSSTP, and a partial environmental
assessment required. No other policies are triggered as there is no resettlement, the work is within
an existing site used for wastewater storage/treatment and there are no indigenous groups. The
project overall had positive environment and social benefits; the new construction has improved
the local environment through reduced odor and improved effluent quality and new techniques of
wastewater reuse are also being piloted as described later in the ICR. The quality of the treated
effluent from this facility now meets the required standards improving the local environment.
Given the scale of the pollution in MM the impacts on the greater Manila Bay and Laguna Lake


                                                 7
areas may be difficult to establish.

28.      The JSSTP is located in a dense urban area. The site was previously the location of an
Imhoff tank; effectively a large septic tank, refilled by desludging trucks. The site footprint was
unchanged and therefore impacts were minimized; there were no land acquisition issues and no
increase in disturbance due to desludging trucks. The property is owned by the Quezon City
government and its continuing use was secured through Usufruct Agreement between the Quezon
City government and MWSS. Using an intensive community relations approach the support of the
neighborhood was achieved, through collaborating with Barangay leaders, regular community
awareness and education programs, hiring local people as laborers and effective traffic
management. The original Imhoff tank was constructed in 1955 and had long exceeded its design
life. Due to the highly polluted effluent from this tank MWSI has been paying penalties regularly
for at least the last six years.

29.     The environmental impact of the civil works for the JSSTP was analyzed using the
Philippines environmental assessment process (largely compatible with World Bank OP 4.01).
The MWSI submitted an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to DENR, and the World Bank,
in 2006 and was granted a Certificate of Non Coverage (CNC No. 0610-16-011). The scope of
the environmental monitoring program carried out by MWSI was comprehensive. Overall the
project showed good compliance; third party monitoring of environmental parameters were
carried out during different phases of construction and provided the basis for mitigation actions,
all documentation was in place, good industry health and safety practices were utilized and there
were zero lost man hours during construction. An environmental report was completed as part of
the construction completion report which cited the compliance requirements that were
accomplished during the construction, commissioning and operation phases of the project.

30.     The social and environmental safeguard supervision missions were carried out as part of
the project implementation support missions. There were no significant findings recorded. All
other work under the project was Technical Assistance aiming to improve domestic wastewater
management and did not trigger any safeguard policies.

31.     Procurement. Generally procurement has improved over the project implementation
period following a number of delays in the early years of the project. In addition to the issues
noted above, the following challenges were faced:
a. It was often difficult to find staff with the required qualifications and expertise; a number of
    contracts had to be re-advertised. In one case, for the Water Quality Monitor, the procurement
    process was ultimately cancelled due to repeated delays.
b. The finalization of some deliverables proved difficult as contracts were by person-months,
    rather than outputs; these include the study for the Rate Re-basing process and for the seven
    policies, where Consultants moved off the project before submitting final documents. These
    deliverables were therefore finalized by the Client under counterpart funding.
c. For the SSMP the consultant firm changed individual consultants without completing the
    required assessment to ensure they met or exceeded the specified qualifications
d. During construction of the JSSTP, procurement was managed by both DENR and MWSS.
    The lengthy process of obtaining approvals delayed payments to the contractor.

32.      Financial management. Financial Management (FM) performance was generally rated
as Moderately Satisfactory and FM risk rated moderate to substantial throughout the life of the
project. The project has substantially complied with the financial covenants which include the
submission of the quarterly Interim Financial Reports (IFR) and the annual audited project
financial statements. The IFRs were submitted regularly and were acceptable to the Bank and


                                                8
there were no issues arising from their review. Only one IFR was received on time and at least
half of the IFRs were more than 30 days late. Similarly, despite delays every year, annual project
Financial Statements have been submitted and the opinions of the auditor were always acceptable
to the Bank. Out of the six audit reports submitted, three have unqualified audit opinions and
three have qualified audit opinions. Reasons for qualifications include (a) failure to conduct
physical inventory-taking casting doubt on the existence, validity and accuracy of the Property,
Plant and Equipment (PPE) balances, (b) unreliable cash balance resulting from the unreconciled
difference between the general ledger and subsidiary ledger, (c) overstatement of Consultancy
Services and Bank Charges, and understatement of Cash in Bank resulting from the double
recording of payment to Consultant, and (d) erroneous recording of taxes withheld on payment to
Consultant causing overstatement in the Prior Years’ Adjustment and understatement of the
account Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue. Appropriate actions had since been taken by the
project to resolve the issues raised by the auditor. During implementation, there were also delays
incurred by the project while waiting for government approvals. Savings made in some
components, including the JSSTP and the PASS, have been reallocated effectively to finance
other components. However overall management of fund flows has been challenging, partly due
to the separation of administrative oversight (FASPO) and technical management (EMB). Over
the last two years the fluctuation of exchange rates has impacted the project (at appraisal the
exchange rate was 51PhP/US$, now reduced to 43PhP/US$). The project ran short of funding by
about US$451,322 due to continuous depreciation of US Dollars against the Peso. GOP has
responded positively by financing or incorporating activities into Agencies’ future work plans.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
33.      Overall. The continued implementation of CWA-2004 and the 2008 Supreme Court
Mandamus 2 are the drivers supporting the outputs of this project. DENR will be supported
through the Manila Bay Integrated Water Quality Management Project (MB-IWQM) to develop
monitoring and evaluation systems for Manila Bay and establish the mechanisms for management
of the Manila Bay Catchment. In addition the ongoing IBRD financed MM Wastewater
Management Project, effective since 2012, will continue to support investments into wastewater
treatment in priority environmental areas. Specific support for different outputs post completion
is described below:
a. The JSSTP is transferred to MWSI in August 2014. The operation and maintenance (O&M)
    manual has been completed and MWSI staff are working in parallel with the contractor to
    ensure a smooth transition. The O&M of the plant will be financed using established systems;
b. DENR is supporting the formation of the Governing Board for the WQMA (San Juan River
    System) designated under Component 2. DENR will complete the designation of the
    additional two WQMA (NMTT and Las Pinas) developed under the project;
c. The integration of the PASS into the existing Public Assessment on Water Services (PAWS -
    developed in 2000) is fully supported by MWSS- Regulatory Office (MWSS-RO);
d. EMB National Capital Region (NCR) has committed to both hosting the Partnership
    Information Centre (PIC) website and also setting up a physical space to support access to
    information. The PIC website has continued to be updated following project closure;
e. The restructuring of the EUF and the additional parameters is awaiting review by the LLDA
    board, but are expected to be formally adopted;
f. All draft policies have been consulted on internally were endorsed by the Inter-agency

 The 2008 Supreme Court Mandamus ordered Government agencies to work together to restore to and
maintain Manila Bay water quality at Class SB (safe for swimming).

      Technical Working Group, reviewed at the Director level and submitted by the PMO
      to EMB-DENR on May 30, 2014 for endorsement and recommendation to other national

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
34.      Rating: High. The relevance of the aims and scope of the project continues to be high.
Pollution from industrial and domestic wastewater is leading to the significant degradation of the
ecosystem in MM; fecal coliform levels in Manila Bay and Pasig River still greatly exceed the
DENR standards leading to problems of eutrophication. The 2008 Supreme Court Mandamus
underlines the relevance and also gave increased impetus to implementation. The activities under
this project were reported to the Supreme Court as part of the main interventions in response to
the Mandamus. However the project provides only a fraction of the solution; a massive
investment (approximately US$5 billion) into wastewater management is required in order to
return Manila Bay to a good status. The alignment with CWA-2004 is demonstrated through the
continued investment in elements of the project, described in Section 2.5. The relevance of the
project was underlined during the joint Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank run
conference on wastewater management in January 2014 where a number of Water Districts and
other actors highlighted the support needed in order to meet the requirements of CWA-2004. The
project aligns with the objective in the Philippines Development Strategy 2011-2016 (NEDA) to
improve environmental quality for a cleaner and healthier environment. The project is highly
relevant to the World Bank Philippines Country Assistance Strategy 2010-2013 and its
commitment to invest in water quality management.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
Overall Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

35.     Overall the project did not manage to achieve the indicators for the Global Environmental
Objectives. Coverage of sewage service in MWSS jurisdiction did not markedly increase during
the project period. Coverage of sanitation services in the MWSS jurisdiction increased by 14%
over the last 7 years (compared to the target of 76%) and the reduction in pollution reaching
Manila Bay is estimated as 2000 metric tons of BOD5/year (compared to a target of 9000).
Attribution of these changes to this project is very difficult.

36.    Despite not meeting these high level indicators the project did make some progress
towards achieving the GEO. In total 8 of the 15 intermediate indicators were fully achieved, 3
intermediate indicators were partially achieved and the majority of the planned outputs were
completed satisfactorily. This progress is described in the following section, broken down by the
three major elements of the GEO. Details of the outputs under each component are provided in
Annex 2 and further information on the intermediate indicators is given in Section F of the
Datasheet. The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory takes account of the large amount of work,
completed across a wide range of sectors, in a difficult context.

Identifying essential adjustments to administrative, institutional, and regulatory practices
and existing legislations in order to attract private investments in the Recipient's
wastewater sector (US$ 1.95 million)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

37.       This component of the GEO was supported through three main areas of Technical



                                                  10
Assistance; (i) rate rebasing, planning and survey support to MWSS and Concessionaires (ii)
policy support to private sector investment and (iii) innovative approaches to financing using
market-based instruments; environmental user fees and investment proposals.

38.      The main outputs and outcomes of the project are described below. Four of the eight
related indicators have been achieved or exceeded. Achievement of the indicators is as follows:
 a. Testing of Public Assessment of Water Services with sewerage and sanitation parameters:
      1000 households, 100% of target met
 b. Sewerage and sanitation master plan with new criteria updated: Master Plan is updated, but
      not yet approved, target not met
 c. Number of investment proposals using innovative financing mechanism for sewerage and
      sanitation in Metropolitan Manila: 3, 133% of target achieved
 d. Number of establishments covered by the environment user fee: 2922, 122% of target
      exceeded - difficult to attribute to the project
 e. Parameters covered by the environment user fee: No change from baseline, 0% of target
      achieved
 f. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) discharged from all regulated sources: Reduced by
      1098 metric tonnes per year, target exceeded, difficult to attribute to the project
 g. Coverage of sewerage service in Manila Water Company, Incorporated (MWCI) concession
      area as result of 2008 rate rebasing adjustment: 12% of water connections, 40% of target
      increase reached, attribution to rate rebasing is difficult
 h. Coverage of sanitation service in MWCI concession area as result of 2008 rate rebasing
      adjustment: 47% of water connections - 66% of target increase reached, attribution to rate
      rebasing is difficult

39.      Support to MWSS and Concessionaires
a. MWSS and MWSI were supported to complete rate rebasing (renegotiating the tariff within
    the MWSS service area) during 2008. The tariff restructuring removed the sewer connection
    costs and sewerage fee and replaced them with an increased environmental fee which is
    mandatory for all households. This environmental fee covers desludging services and sewer
    connections; meaning that these are effectively seen as ‘free’ services. This new tariff
    structure is expected to increase uptake of these services. Over the project period in the
    MWSI concession area coverage of sanitation services increased from 5 to 47% and coverage
    of sewerage service increased from 8% to 12%, however it is difficult to attribute this
    specifically to the project. MWSS-RO noted that the TA provided during the 2008 rate
    rebasing resulted in a much greater involvement of the corporate office during the 2013 rate
    rebasing exercise and, linked to this, in 2014 MWSS ordered a reduction in water rates in
    Metro Manila for the first time since services were privatized in 1997.
b. The draft 2005 MWSS Sewerage and Sanitation Master Plan (SSMP) was largely updated
    under the project to respond to the Supreme Court Mandamus, clarify the strategy and ensure
    consistency with the business plans of the two private concessionaires. At project closure
    some elements of the SSMP were still under discussion and there was not yet a final
    consensus on the scope, for example the inclusion of solid waste. These challenges were
    partly due to the implementing arrangements (EMB was responsible for the procurement of
    the SSMP consultant and MWSS for the supervision of deliverables) and also due to the
    much wider consultation with other Government stakeholders than previously. Therefore,
    although this indicator was not achieved, the development process is thought to have had
    some positive impacts in terms of bringing different actors into the discussion on water and
    sanitation services in MM.
c. The Public Assessment of Sewerage and Sanitation Services (PASS) was developed under
    the project and a pilot survey was completed in 1,000 households within MM. The PASS


                                              11
   collects data from customers on the perceived performance of the MWSS concessionaires,
   including local issues on quality of service, politeness and responsiveness of staff and so on.
   The suitability of the PASS to rate performance of the services provided (and thereby
   increase accountability and inform operation and investment decisions) was demonstrated
   through the pilot survey. At the time of writing both the PAWS and PASS had been
   temporarily suspended due to lack of funding, therefore the immediate impact of this activity
   has been limited. These surveys are expected to restart within the next few years.

40.     Policy support to private sector investment. Two key policy areas to increase private
sector investment were identified through extensive consultation; making septage manage
compulsory and increasing minimum standards for industrial pre-treatment. The following
policies were then drafted under the project; (a) Septage Management Ordinance; (b) Guidelines
for the Adoption of New Design Parameters for Septic Tanks; (c) National Registry of
Desludgers or Entities Engaged in Septage Management; (d) Pre-Treatment Standards for
Wastewater Effluents Discharged by Commercial and Industrial Wastewater Sources to Publicly-
owned Sewer Systems. The draft policies are expected to put into place a stronger framework for
private sector investment; both by supporting a consistent framework for septage management
which facilitates both public and private investment from septage collection to treatment and
disposal and by promoting private investment in pre-treatment. There has already been some
impact from this policy development as the draft Ordinance template for mandatory septic tank
desludging was issued by DILG and adapted by Makati and Quezon City - these initial
ordinances are expected to serve as a model for adoption by other LGUs. The four policy
documents were submitted for endorsement from EMB-DENR in May 2014; two policy
documents for septic tanks and desludging have been endorsed by EMB-DENR and
adopted by the LGUs through an administrative order. The remaining two policy
documents are going through the technical review process and are expected to be
endorsed in 2015.

41.     Innovative approaches to financing using market-based instruments;
a. LLDA manages industrial effluent into Laguna Bay through imposing an Environmental User
    Fee (EUF). A study was completed examining options to enhance the effectiveness of the
    existing EUF framework and assess the ways in which the systems for LLDA and DENR
    could be harmonized. The technical study has been submitted to the LLDA Board and
    feedback from LLDA on the process and deliverables has been very positive. During the life
    of the project there has been an increase in coverage of the EUF from 1000 establishments to
    2992 and a reduction in BOD from 5202 to 4104 from establishments monitored by LLDA;
    exceeding the intermediate indicator targets. These indicators include the combined impacts
    of the Laguna de Bay Institutional Strengthening and Community Participation (LISCOP)
    project and the GEF project. The major contribution of the GEF project has been through
    awareness raising activities and stakeholder engagement. For example the project supported
    partnership strengthening between LLDA and LGUs, which then triggered additional actions
    including (i) an MoA that requires all businesses to have an LLDA permit in order to get an
    LGU business permit and (ii) LGUs opening up their business permit database for LLDA to
    verify who has a permit and which businesses are not compliant.
b. A long list of potential investments was identified within LLDA’s catchment area. Sanitation
    investment proposals using innovative approaches to financing were prepared with three
    prospective borrowers and submitted to several financial institutions for consideration and
    possible financing. Currently Quezon City LGU is in the process of site selection and Los
    Baños Water District is awaiting LGU ordinance before proceeding. San Jose Water District
    ultimately decided not to move forward with private sector financing.

Promoting innovative, simple and effective wastewater treatment techniques (US$4.70
million - US$1.30 million financed by GEF, remainder from the Counterpart funds)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

42.      This component exceeded the indicator for the reduction of costs per cubic metre of
septage collection, treatment and disposal using joint treatment as compared to separate septage
treatment. The JSSTP has achieved a 40% reduction of costs per cubic meter of septage collection,
treatment and disposal using joint treatment as compared to separate septage treatment (compared
to a target of 20%).

43.     The JSSTP combines and treats sewage from the piped network and sludge collected by
truck from septic tanks. It therefore gives greater flexibility in areas where both systems are in
use and offers cost savings over separate treatment of sewage and septage. The JSSTP is only the
second of its type in the Philippines and the first to use a Sequencing Batch Reactor, thereby
having a much smaller footprint.

44.      The selection and construction of the JSSTP has been highly satisfactory and includes
examples of good practice already being replicated elsewhere. During the process proving the
contractor identified a number of cost-saving measures including reducing aeration time to save
energy and more effective coagulants reducing chemical use. Promotion of the JSSTP has been
active and involved site visits and presentations for Water Districts (WD) and civil society groups.
A number of WDs have already requested further information and support in applying this
technology. MWSI has identified the following elements within the JSSTP which they are
replicating elsewhere; (a) Technology Selection Study to improve quality of design and build
contracts; (b) Wastewater reuse; using activated carbon filters to allow wastewater to be reused
on site for flushing toilets and washing cars; (c) SCADA system for remote monitoring and
control; and (d) Automatic receipt system to record and document septage delivery.

Increasing the effectiveness of the agencies responsible for water pollution control through
improved coordination (US$ 1.75 million)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

45.      This component of the GEO included three main areas of work; (i) partnership building
(ii) harmonizing water quality monitoring and increasing access to data; and (iii) policy support
for a coordinated response. Outcomes and outputs are described below. Three of the six indicators
have been met or exceeded. Progress on the indicators is given below:
a. Agencies responsible for water pollution control signing a Memorandum of Understanding
     (MOU): 7, 100% of target achieved
b. Other stakeholders signing on to this MOU: 17, 121% of target achieved
c. Bi-annual Partnership meetings: 19, 190% of target achieved
d. Numbers of policy issuance (administrative orders) on sewerage and sanitation related
     matters issued by national authorities: Four, 50% of target achieved
e. Publication of annual Metropolitan Manila (MM) Water Quality Monitor: Zero, 0% of target
     met
f. Water quality monitoring areas established: One, 33% of target achieved

46.      Partnership building. One of the main aims of the project, and also the main risk
mitigation measure, was partnership building between the implementing agencies. A number of
activities supporting the partnership building process were completed under this project,
including (i) a total of 19 bi-annual partnership meetings (ii) MoUs signed between DENR and


                                                13
six Agencies responsible for water pollution control and (ii) MoUs signed between DENR and 14
LGUs. These MoUs laid out agreed responsibilities on water pollution control and were
supported by workshops where action plans for sewage and sanitation were developed aiming to
motivate LGUs to invest in sanitation. A Water Quality Management Area has been designated
and Governing Board appointed (San Juan WQMA); two additional WQMA have been identified
and base lines developed. Notifications have been issued on these three WQMAs.

47.      It has been noted during interviews for the ICR that all agencies now recognize the need
to work in partnership to achieve improvements in water pollution control and also give higher
priority to consultation with other actors. For example, both LLDA and EMB-DENR reported
that it was increasingly easy to access data and get inputs/feedback from other partner agencies
due to closer working relationships. In addition the San Juan River System WQMA (integrating 7
of the 14 LGUs targeted) is currently setting up its Governing Board and has enthusiastic support
from businesses, service providers and LGUs. The WQMA appears to be a successful model for
partnership for water pollution control – bringing together a wide range of stakeholders around
common issues. The level of support seen for the San Juan WQMA illustrates the potential of this
framework for partnership development. In comparison, the use of MoUs with individual LGUs
was not found to be effective as the PMO did not have the resources for continued follow up with
each LGU on the action plans developed and the initial momentum for change was not sustained.

48.     Harmonizing water quality monitoring and increasing access to data. A key positive
impact of the ongoing policy dialogue with the government has been the release of the water
quality data on the Open Data Initiative of the Office of the President. The project has also
supported DENR to provide water quality data to MWSS which helped them to guide their
investments to areas with highest pollution load. The impact is illustrated through the ongoing
World Bank financed MM Wastewater Management Project which targets pollution hotspots.

49.     Integrated water quality monitoring guidelines have been developed and issued to
stakeholders and the recommendations have been incorporated into the development of the draft
policy for Procedural Guidelines for Harmonized Water Quality Monitoring in NCR. The policy
was submitted to EMB-DENR for endorsement and is currently going through the technical
review process; it is expected to be endorsed in 2015. The implementation of the guidelines has
been supported by training in water quality monitoring, including provision of demonstration kits.
The budget to roll out the full implementation of these guidelines is currently being reviewed by
EMB.

50.      A Partnership Information Centre (PIC), aiming to provide a shared space for all agencies
to access data, has been developed and launched. A wide range of training was completed to
support different agencies to improve data management and link to this system. Some
implementing agencies are submitting data for inclusion into the on line database under the PIC,
including the PASS survey data. The PIC website is also linked to the MBCO water quality
database and has supported MBCO to respond to the Supreme Court Mandamus as referenced
earlier. At the time of writing, the PIC did not yet have a dedicated physical space and the
website is still hosted by the Consultant. The objectives of the PIC have been partially met –
further investment is required by EMB to ensure that this becomes a fully functional service that
promotes and facilitates data sharing.

51.    Policy support for a coordinated response. Two key policy areas to increase
coordination were identified through extensive consultation; water quality monitoring and
management of waste. Water quality monitoring is described above, in addition the following


                                               14
policies were drafted; (a) Industry- Specific Effluent Standards for Sewerage and Septage
Treatment Facilities Operated by Public Water Utilities, and (b) Joint DENR-DOH
Administrative Order on Bio-solids. The two draft policy documents are expected to put into
place standard approaches to harmonize responses on water quality management. The policies
would for example increase the limit for Biological Oxygen Demand (from 50 to 100mg
BOD/liter), for sewage treatment plants, making treatment more cost effective. The policy
documents were submitted for endorsement from EMB-DENR. The Industry Specific
Effluent Standards has passed the second review by the policy technical working group
and is expected to be endorsed in early 2015. The Joint DENR-DOH Administrative
Order was endorsed by EMB-DENR and has been adopted by the Department of Health
through a Department Order issued in October 2014.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

52.      During project preparation an incremental cost analysis was completed for the GEF
project. The analysis predicted that the grant would catalyze a significantly higher additional
investment during the period 2005 - 2025 through replication of the technology demonstrated
under the project, and infusion of new investment in pollution control from private sector
investors using the project’s financial innovations. During the period 2007-2014 the
concessionaires have increased investment into the sector, however it is difficult to attribute this
directly to the GEF project as the investments were not linked to replication of the JSSTP or
implementation of the financial instruments developed.

53.      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the JSSTP is estimated to be 15% with benefits
comprising of environmental benefits, health benefits, savings from non-payment of discharge
fees to LLDA, and benefits from water re-use. This reduces to an ERR of 10% with either a 20%
increase in assumed O&M costs or a 20% reduction in assumed health benefits. The ERR reduces
to 12% with a 20% reduction in inflow. An additional benefit, which was not estimated due to
incomplete data but which would increase this economic rate of return, is the cost saving from
reduced distances for septage collection. Calculation details are included in Annex 3.

54.      The key value added of the GEF financing was to support the introduction of an
innovative technology (the JSSTP) which led to a 20% reduction in O&M costs and introduced
many aspects which are now being replicated as noted above. The project is expected to lead to
future efficiency through further knowledge sharing and replication; the guidelines developed
under the project for the establishment of WQMAs are now being applied elsewhere, improved
data sharing will enable MWSS and the MM concessionaires to target investments to pollution
hotspots, increasing environmental efficiency. The draft policies, once in place, are expected to
lead to an improved framework for investments into septage management and pre-treatment. The
future efficiency improvements from the PASS can be inferred from the use of the PAWS to
target service improvements – including increasing monitoring in some areas and
resolving local problems of poor water quality.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
55.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. This overall rating is determined from the
combination of the high relevance, moderately unsatisfactory achievement of the GEO and a
modest level of efficiency. The project has developed technical assistance which will form the
basis of many essential adjustments to administrative, institutional and regulatory practices;
including policies on septage management, changes which would expand and restructure the EUF,


                                                15
and support to MWSS in their management of the two private concessionaires in MM. Simple
wastewater treatment technology has been supported through the completion of the JSSTP and
extensive promotion of this technology. Coordination between the different agencies has been
supported and there are some examples of increased effectiveness. However, some important
elements were not finalized and most TA has only been endorsed at the level of the Technical
Working Groups and PMO. Budget allocations and higher level endorsement which will enable
the TA to be translated into real impacts are not yet secured in most cases.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
56.     The impacts of the project on poverty, gender aspects and social development would be
realized in the future through increased coverage of sewerage and sanitation services. Sanitation
improvements would have a greater impact on women as the main care givers and domestic
support. This was reflected in the PASS where the vast majority of respondents were women. The
rate rebasing is considered to have a positive impact as the increase of the environmental fee
supports wastewater management services to all households, whether connected to the sewerage
system or not. The Policy on the National Registry of the De-Sludgers or Entities Engaged in
Septage Management also aims to legitimize the informal desludgers through the policy and
therefore have an impact on poverty alleviation. Meetings were held with a number of
representatives; these discussions and the recognition that a valuable service is being provided is
thought to have opened the gates for smaller desludgers to be engaged by concessionaires.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
57.      In addition to the points outlined above the project has contributed to the increased
awareness of the importance of sewage and sanitation within DENR through active stakeholder
engagement within Government Agencies. This is evidenced by the increased resources provided
to the sector; for example during the recent restructuring DENR introduced new units specializing
in sewage and sanitation and increased staffing levels, including the new post of Sanitary
engineer, at a time when many other sectors were being downsized. The persistent policy
dialogue with DENR in building the water quality monitoring database using the PIC has
contributed to the release of water quality data as part of the GOP’s Open Data initiative. The
water quality dashboard is available on www.data.gov.ph as one of the 6 featured dashboards. It
represents the only dashboard focused on environmental issues. This data sharing has been seen
as a catalyst for increased transparency and discussion about water quality issues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
58.     The technical assistance helped to catalyze a twinning program, financed by the
Government of Spain, on innovative financing mechanisms in support to the scaling up of
investments on sewage and sanitation services. As part of this a study tour was undertaken in
March 2013 by DENR FASPO, EMB and LLDA officials and staff involved in the GEF project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
59.    Stakeholder workshops for implementing agencies were completed as part of the Client’s
PCR and details are given in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

60.     Rating: Substantial. As described in Section 2.5 the JSSTP, WQMA, restructured EUF
and PIC have well established plans for follow up and future support. These elements are
believed to be mainstreamed and will support sewage and sanitation expansion. The draft policies



                                                16
relating to septage management and water quality monitoring have gained momentum and have
follow on support from the sanitation units now formed within DENR. In addition the Joint
DENR-DOH Administrative Order on Biosolids has been adopted and the review of the Industrial
Effluent Standards has completed the second round. The remaining policy endorsement is
pending however all policy documents are expected to be endorsed within 2015. The time
required is highly uncertain; however there are some recent positive steps, including progress in
endorsing related policy documents such as the General Effluent Standards (GES) which are
expected to be endorsed before the end of 2014. The updated SSMP will need additional work,
before it can be an effective tool and meetings are ongoing with the support of MWSS in order to
finalize the document.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
61.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. During project preparation the Bank task team
ensured that all safeguards and Bank procedures were complied with and supported extensive
consultation with partner agencies. However sufficient attention was not paid to the complexities
of the outdated policies, overlapping agency mandates and institutional arrangements and lack of
national support to sanitation and sewerage. In addition wide consultation led to scope creep and
a high level of complexity in project design. The Bank team should have pushed for the project to
be simpler and more focused. The risks from the complexity of the project and the ambitious
results framework were not mitigated by a properly supported PMO and a comprehensive
assessment of the ability of the government agencies to partner effectively.

(b) Quality of Supervision
62.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Overall all implementing agencies noted that the
Bank team were very supportive and provided clear recommendations on how to improve
performance. The Financial Management and Procurement teams provided training and ongoing
support. The Bank team took an active role in supporting coordination and communication
between the different implementing agencies. During the life of the project four different Task
Team Leaders were assigned to the role, which caused some disruption.

63.      Enhanced candor in the ISRs could have led to increased project support and improved
outcomes. The ISRs were too optimistic in their ratings; despite a significant delay in progress,
ratings were often higher than what could have been concluded from the project performance.
Realistic ratings would have focused management attention and increased problem solving
support, especially in the first half of the project. The project restructuring did not go far enough
to address the problems clearly identified before the mid-term review. The opportunity to
significantly revise the GEO indicators re-orientate the project and potentially revise the
implementing arrangements was not fully taken

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
64.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Many of the problems faced under the project were
due to the complex design and implementing arrangements. The rating given reflects the lack of
evidence of action taken to address the issues faced. There was also a high turn-over rate of the
World Bank task team leaders given the ongoing reorganization of the sectors in the East Asia
Region.

5.2 Borrower Performance



                                                 17
(a) Government Performance
65.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. GOP ensured that counterpart funds were provided in
a timely fashion. This included financing the PMO during the last months of the project in order
to ensure that the project was closed successfully. However high level interventions from
overseeing agencies to resolve implementation issues and improve coordination were limited.
Problems found stemming from conflicting aims and unaligned processes are very typical in
developing new partnering arrangements and often need additional management support to be
resolved.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
66.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. DENR has committed to moving the sewerage and
sanitation agenda forward and has integrated a number of deliverables into the future work
program. The high turnover of the PMO and complex design of the project has made coordination
difficult. In addition insufficient resources were allocated to the PMO during project design; both
the project manager and the assistant project manager were only allocated part time to the PMO
and the team was slowly downsized during project implementation, for example the role of the
Project management specialist was removed in 2010. The weak PMO, and specifically the loss of
institutional memory, was identified by many project participants as limiting the momentum and
progress of the project. Although MWSS and DENR were very successful working together on
the construction of the JSSTP, there were difficulties in managing the consultant for the SSMP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
67.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Borrower complied with the fiduciary and
safeguards policies of the Bank and implemented many aspects of the program despite the
complicated implementing arrangement. As outlined in the sections above there has been a
change in the perception of the importance of domestic wastewater within GOP. This shift needs
to be translated into practical outputs, including implementing the project outputs or supporting
the implementation of policy changes.

6. Lessons Learned

68.      As in many projects, the problems faced were caused due an overly ambitious design and
limited restructuring. Additional actions should have been taken during preparation to reduce
project complexity and ambition in order to reduce risks; implementing arrangements should have
been kept as simple as possible, the project should have focused on fewer activities with
partnership built into the process – as illustrated by the WQMA - and components 3 and 4 could
have been merged. More generally time invested in preparatory work, both to ensure the design is
optimized and to more procurement forward as far as possible, is critical to avoid significant
delays after approval. The results framework should have been based upon data available from
existing monitoring systems, rather than on assumed improvements to be developed during the
lifetime of the project and the GEO indicators should have been within the scope and timeframe
of the project. .

69.      Time and resources, including strong leadership, are needed to build partnerships, both
within DENR and also with other agencies. Active and credible champions are needed to effect
institutional and policy change in traditionally low priority areas such as septage and sanitation
and a properly supported PMO is critical to project success. Assessments of mandates, functions
and processes, in national and local agencies - a fit for partnering assessment - should have been
be completed during the design of the project and actions to build institutional capacity to partner
effectively identified



                                                18
70.    Financial incentives and increased awareness can bring results; for example the feedback
from LLDA that expanding the pollutants covered under the Environmental User Fee (through
LISCOP) and the awareness raising (through GEF MTSP) has led to reduction of pollution

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
71.      As described in the Project Completion Report (PCR), in Annex 7, the Borrower and
implementing agencies have rated the project considerably higher than the Implementation
Completion Report; Satisfactory to Highly Satisfactory as compared to Moderately unsatisfactory.
There is overall agreement in terms of deliverables completed. The main area of difference is in
terms of the approach used for project evaluation. The PCR rated the project in terms of outputs,
rather than in terms of the project results framework, results attributable to the project and likely
future impact.

(b) Cofinanciers
72.     Not applicable

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
73.     No issues raised.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The project’s objective was to support the development of the policy environment for the
scaling up of investments in pollution control, and to improve environmental efficiency of
investments through better targeting of environmental hotspots. The baseline scenario for
investments in sewerage and sanitation management at appraisal was estimated at US$104
million for the period 2005 - 2025. The GEF provided incremental financing in the amount of
US$8.35 million, of which US$5 million constituted the grant and US$3.35 million, the
counterpart funding from Maynilad Water, the west zone concessionaire. It was expected that the
incremental financing would catalyze significantly higher investment levels through the scaling
up of technology demonstrated in this project within the mechanism of the rate rebasing exercises
every five years.

2.       There were three project components that were completed and officially accepted by the
government as of loan closing date, as follows: (a) expansion of public assessment to cover
sewerage and sanitation services; (b) technical assistance to MWSS in the rate rebasing; and (c)
upgrading of a communal septic tank in Project 7 (Quezon city) to a upgrading of a communal
septic tank in Project 7 (Quezon city) to a JSSTP. The economic impact of these completed
components is potentially significant. However, quantifying the benefits is difficult except for
the JSSTP where the economic rate of return was estimated. The other remaining components are
in different stages of completion, and official adoption by the government is pending.

Expansion of Public Assessment to Cover Sewerage and Sanitation Services

3.      The design and piloting of this component was completed and the results officially
accepted by the government. As it has with the public assessment of water services (PAWS)
earlier implemented, the public assessment of sewerage and sanitation services (PASS) is
expected to improve concessionaire performance and to enhance regulation through direct
consumer assessment of performance. Based on the PAWS experience, the concessionaires have
been attentive to the survey results and responsive to the complaints and shortcomings in service
provisioning as perceived by the consumers, resulting in improved services to the benefit of the
consumers. The PASS was to be implemented together with the PAWS. The PASS was
completed in 2010; however, the survey has not been repeated or rolled out to date.
Implementation of the PAWS has been suspended since 2009 due to policy issues raised by the
MWSS-RO, and this has affected the roll out of PASS. At the technical level, MWSS RO is
hopeful that the PASS would be implemented and mainstreamed once policy issues are resolved.

Assistance to MWSS in the 2008 Rate Rebasing

4.       The assistance to MWSS in the 2008 rate rebasing was specifically to assist in the
restructuring of the environmental tariff, and to institutionalize involvement of government
environmental agencies (DENR, LLDA) in the review of investments particularly in aligning
these to environmental hotspots. While the environmental tariff was eventually restructured to a
single tariff (i.e., increasing it to 20% from 10% of the water bill and to cease the 50% sewerage
charge), it is not clear to what extent the project contributed to the work inasmuch as the
consultancy commissioned for this purpose was terminated prematurely, and that remaining work
was done in-house by MWSS-RO with this project providing logistical support. With regard to
the targeting of investments towards environmental hotspots, this was expected to be achieved
through the participation of the concerned government environmental agencies in the review of
business plans of the concessionaires. However, it is not clear how this was done, if at all.
Nonetheless, in a follow-on loan by the World Bank on sewerage and septage management to the


                                               23
two concessionaires in 2011 (Manila Water Management Project with the World Bank loan
provided through the Land Bank of the Philippines), the investments funded supported
environmental hotspots identified by DENR. Total cost of the program was US$343.275 million,
with the World Bank loan amounting to US$275 million, and the balance financed from
concessionaires’ counterpart. In this sense, the objective of the component was achieved,
although the contribution of this project is at best implied. MWSS updated the Manila sewerage
and sanitation master plan through this project. Review of the master plan by the government
environmental agencies would mainstream the process of aligning investments in sewerage and
sanitation to environmental priorities.

Joint Sewage and Septage Treatment Plant (JSSTP) in Project 7, Quezon city

5.      Prior to this project, the Project 7 facility was an Imhoff tank serving a sewered area
under the management of Maynilad. The facility had outlived its design (facility was constructed
in 1955), and as consequence, Maynilad had been paying penalties to LLDA for non-compliance
to effluent standards. The project upgraded the facility into a 2640 MLD joint sewage and
septage treatment facility that would serve the same sewered area in Project 7 as well as accept
septage in the non sewered areas in the vicinity. Total project cost was P266 million, with the
grant financing P57 million and the balance provided by Maynilad to be recovered through the
rate rebasing. The project cost included the investment, the operation and maintenance cost
during the commissioning period of three months and during one-year of process proving, net of
tax and contractor’s profit. The technology adopted (Sequencing Batch Reactor or SBR) was
selected based on a Technical Options Study and the selected technology garnered the lowest net
present value. The facility is operating at full capacity.

6.       The economic rate of return of this component was estimated to be 15% with benefits
comprising of environmental benefits, health benefits, avoided cost from non-payment of
discharge fees to LLDA, and benefits from water re-use. An additional benefit but which was not
estimated due to incomplete data is the cost savings of diverting vacuum trucks to a closer
destination for treatment rather than to the Dagat-dagatan treatment facility of Maynilad.

7.      Environmental benefits. Environmental benefits are difficult to measure. Benefits were
estimated based on willingness to pay for improved water quality, and using as proxy, the
environmental fee of 20% of the water bill. In the calculation, per capita water consumption was
assumed at 130 liters per day, a return rate for wastewater of 80%, and a tariff of P38.25 per m3
(the average for the west zone in 2013). Only consumers served by the JSSTP were included in
the calculation, although benefits are expected to accrue to a larger population.

8.      Health benefits. Health benefits would come from reduced risk of people coming in
contact with raw wastewater from overflowing septic tanks. The impacts of poor sanitation on
health, water, tourism, and other welfare impacts were estimated for the Philippines to be in the
order of US$1.4 billion per year, equivalent to 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2005. 3 Health
impacts represented 72% of total economic costs, and these include health care costs, productivity
costs due to adult and child sickness and premature mortality, and 23% accounted for the impact
on water resources. For purposes of these calculations, a per capita sanitation benefit of US$65

was assumed which include only health impacts. 4 Benefits were assumed to grow by 2% a year
to represent the increase in the level of incomes. BOD elimination from treatment was assumed
to be 10% of sanitation benefits.

9.       Avoided cost from non-payment of discharge fees to LLDA. 20% of total treated effluent
discharge is being re-used in the facility, generating an organic load of 5.28kg BOD per day. The
discharge fee imposed by LLDA is P5 kg BOD. Annual savings from non-payment of discharge
fees to LLDA is estimated to be P9,636.

10.     Benefits from water re-use. The benefit from water re-use is the cost of water supply
saved, equivalent to 20% of the design capacity of 2640 MLD. Annual savings from water re-use
is estimated to be P18,912,000.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      The workshop to develop the PCR was held over three days January 27-30, 2014. The
following Agencies attended; FASPO, EMB, Philippine Coast Guard, LLDA, DOH, MWSS,
Maynilad, APTES, LGU Mandaluyong. The structure of the workshop was as follows:
    a. Review overall status of project implementation and PCR process
         Discuss overall status of the project implementation; develop a Common
           Understanding of the Status of Project Implementation To-Date
         Level-off on the Process and Content of the Project Completion Report (PCR)
           Preparation; develop a Common Understanding on the Process and Content of PCR
           Preparation
         Discuss activities that are relevant in the PCR preparation; List of PCR Activities,
           People Involved & Timelines in the PCR Preparation
    b. Stakeholder data gathering and validation for the PCR
         Review the project component implementation and provide information on the
           accomplishment vs. targets, achievement of Development Objectives, challenges,
           Issues and Concerns facilitating and hindering factors lessons learned and good
           practices
         Analyze Results & draw policy recommendations for consideration in future
           interventions
    c. Critical next steps
         Identify recommendations and next steps in the PCR preparation

2.      There were a number of open forums to discuss the development of the Master plan. This
are not summarized here apart from overall status. Many of the issues were addressed through
question and answer sessions and are presented in their original form below.

3.       Progress on deliverables was summarized and is as shown in Annex 2. The following
additional information was given in terms of unresolved issues and efforts at mainstreaming
outputs:
    a. The scope of work required to complete the update of the MWSS Master Plan
         (Component 2) needs to be clarified. The consultant believes that the scope of work is
         still unclear and the demands are greater than the update described in the original ToR.
         The range of comments which have been received was very wide and some issues are not
         suitable for inclusion in the Master Plan
    b. All tasks for Use of Market-based Incentives (Component 4) were finished in 2013 and
         LLDA has worked on mainstreaming the recommendations since this time, including
         requesting the Operating Department to review the recommendations and roll out the
         priority reform agenda based on the roadmap. New parameters, such as Chemical Oxygen
         Demand, will be included once the General Effluent Standards are approved by DENR
    c. All seven draft policies were presented to the public for consultation before the policies
         were developed. However some documentation is missing which may mean some
         consultation processes need to be redone. The policies are unlikely to be institutionalized
         before the end of the project as they are for DENR and other agencies

4.      Project Preparation:
Q: Was the design of the project appropriate? Why/Why not?
A: Yes, the design is appropriate since the main objectives of the project were attained, and the
different components were assigned to appropriate agencies.
Q: Was preparation made prior to project proposal sufficient? In what ways?
A: Yes; the concerned agencies were properly consulted in the preparation of TORs, KPIs, etc.

Q: Did the Bank provide adequate advice and facilitation? Please provide examples.
A: Yes;
• During the first failure of bidding for Component 6 JSSTP, the Bank approved the re-bidding
   based on one pre-selected technology in order to have an “apple to apple” evaluation of bids.
• The Bank approved the Grant extension up May 2014.
• Bank’s issuance of “NOL” on the request for the amendment of APTES’ (consultant) contract
   to include general/conceptual design of the P7 JSSTP.

5.       Project Implementation:
Q: What difficulties did you face in implementing the project (e.g. procurement and
financial management)? Could any of these have been avoided?
A:
Component 1 Partnership strengthening: There were difficulties in the management of LGUs
Component 2 Planning and policy development: The scope of works was not clear and the
resource requirements were underestimated. Consultants were paid by person months, rather than
deliverables, leading to problems in completion of outputs. Documentation of public policy
consultations were not retained in all cases meaning that they may need to be repeated in order
for policy approvals to move forward
Component 4 Use of Market-based Incentives: Expansion of EUF is dependent upon external
factors; lack of COD standard in DAO 35 and delays in approval of GES by DENR may block
implementation
Component 6 JSSTP: Change of procurement route led to some delays during the bidding stage.
Minor delays were also caused due to increase in local counterpart funding and delays in
possession of the site
Q: Are there ways which DENR/MWSS/Bank could have worked on to turn around things
earlier/more effectively?
A: Yes, changes should have been made during the project preparation stage
Q: Were the capacity building components effective? If so, in what ways and how was this
demonstrated? Are there any ways to enhance the mode in providing capacity building?
A: Transfer of knowledge for Component 6 JSSTP was effective through trainings conducted on
proper operation. Other trainings were also conducted (GIS, others) for LGUs
Q: What factors within DENR/MWSS’s control (e.g. management effectiveness, staffing
adequacy and quality and effective use of TA) affected project implementation?
A: Component 4 (Use of Market-based Incentives) and Component 6 (JSSTP); Effective project
management; inter-agency cooperation
Q: What factors beyond the control of government or implementing agencies (e.g. credit
conditions in the post financial crisis period) affected the success of the project?
A: Change in exchange rate (peso devaluation) leading to a shortfall in project funding. Problems
with the limited capability of Consultants working on Component 1 (Partnership Strengthening)
and the change in Consultants without consultation on Component 2 (Planning and policy
development)

7.      Additional information, challenges and lessons learnt:
Q. In what ways has the project affected the Sanitation and Sewerage Sector?
A: It improved the sanitation and sewerage project and services through the Pilot Project of
JSSTP; Strengthened collaboration/coordination and Policy Development and Compliance

Q. What is the regulatory framework like and how has this changed?
A: The regulatory framework is the same, however, additional mandates of the Clean Water Act
of 2004 and DPWH Sewer design criteria need to be addressed.
Q. Were any of these factors attributable to the project?
A. No
Q: Are there other co-benefits that have transpired?
A: Job generation resulting from projects investments. A healthy environment equates to a
healthy community
Q: Is there any gender impact?
A: None
Q: What circumstances (other than those raised earlier) helped/hindered the project?
A:
Helped:


                                                  32
•   Expertise and technical capability of each implementing agencies’ staff assigned to the
    project;
• Support of the top management of each agency;
• Support of the Bank
Hindered:
• Insufficient records of consultation and project decisions (for example lack of consultation
    records is hindering issue of the draft policies
• Changes in personnel, e.g. PMO’s Project Manager, consultants
• Multi-level approval process of the different partner agencies
• Change in LGU leadership
• Too much autonomy of LGUs in terms of policy crafting, implementation, etc. They tend to
    do it their own way.
• Unclear deliverables of the Consultant to merit an acceptable report (e.g. SSMP)
Q: What lessons can we learn from the project that would be applicable to future bank
projects in the Philippines?
A.
• Each agency should assign a dedicated group to handle and closely monitor the project;
• PMO should conduct regular coordination meetings among partner agencies to get updates
    and immediately address problems
• Project design should incorporate the approval processes, i.e. payments, acceptance of
    reports/outputs, etc.
• Project leadership should be maintained from the beginning of the project until the end of
    implementation
• Increase capacity building component for all stakeholders
• For multi-stakeholder project, commitment and active participation is essential. Lesser
    commitment/participation results to delay in project implementation.
• Project objectives, timelines, and deliverables of Consultants/Contractors should be known
    by top management of concerned government agencies/entities.
Q: How was the bank’s performance?
A. Very satisfactory; timeline for WB actions are strictly followed, NOLs are issued promptly
and funds are released on time, technical advice supported implementation.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

1.     The context, project description, project beneficiaries and basic data in the Borrowers
PCR are essentially the same as the information contained in this ICR and is not repeated here.
The overall assessment, challenges, lessons learnt and conclusions are summarized below.

2.       The key differences between the PCR and the World Bank ICR are the much higher
ratings given in the PCR. Ratings are higher in the PCR due to the different approaches used to
evaluate success; the PCR assesses deliverables finalized by the PMO and gives greater weight to
anecdotal feedback, the ICR assesses achievement by the project results framework and outcomes
attributable to the project. However, despite these differences in ratings the Borrower and Bank
teams are largely in agreement on the achievements of the project and challenges faced.

 Overall Assessment of Project Implementation

3.      The overall rating of the project is as follows (translated from a 6 point score):

         Relevance                                  Highly relevant
         Effectiveness                              Satisfactory
         Efficiency                                 Moderately satisfactory – Satisfactory
         Implementation                             Satisfactory


4.      The project has encouraged greater understanding of sectoral issues and needs for many
 stakeholders, resulting in more positive behaviors. Most Agency staff felt their capacity was
 increased through being involved in the program; including increased confidence to coordinate
 with other agencies and helped them to appreciate the ‘big picture’ and need for integrated
 approaches. Component 3 helped to open up new options and orientate LGUs away from public
 financing. Component 4 created a road map that outlines the strategic direction for improving
 and expanding the Environmental User Fees (EUF) for LLDA. Component 6 set a new industry
 benchmark for constructing a sewage and septage treatment plant. Social impacts; about 11
 families raised issues and concerns about odor and noise during the works, these concerns were
 discussed and resolved with the support of barangay officials. .

5.      Assessment by component:
 a. Component 1: Partnership Development.
     i. The 21 MoAs were signed as planned
    ii. The strategy to create three WQMAs was approved by DENR
   iii. A site for the PIC was launched online including databases which are planned to be
        populated with water quality information. It is recommended that, in order to make the
        PIC fully functional, water quality data should be regularly uploaded and budget and staff
        need to be assigned for maintenance and operation of the site
   iv. Annual Metro Manila Water Quality Monitoring Reports were not published under the
        project
    v. PASS was developed and pilot was completed. MWSS need to confirm whether the
        mainstreaming of the PASS is covered by a legal document and will continue in the
        future
 b. Component 2: Master Planning and Policy development
     i. The updated SSMP was submitted on May 30, 2014. This key output has been delayed
    ii. Seven policies were drafted and packaged and issued by the PMO. It is recommended
        that these policy documents be approved for adoption and implemented by concerned


                                                 34
        agencies.
 c. Component 3: Innovative financing Mechanisms
     i. Detailed proposals have been completed and LGUs have completed initial coordination
        to source financing. San Jose del Monte has passed a municipal ordinance on sewerage
        and septage. Los Banos is waiting for a similar ordinance to be passed. Quezon City has
        an existing ordinance.
 d. Component 4: Use of Market Based Incentives
     i. The study has been completed and the recommendations developed in agreement with
        LLDA, including restructuring the EUF and developing market based industry for
        domestic sewage
 e. Component 5: Technical Assistance for Rate Rebasing
     i. Technical assistance was provided to MWSS in 2008 to support rate rebasing with MWSI.
        It was intended that this would be guided by the updated SSMP, however this was not
        possible due to delays
 f. Component 6: JSSTP
     i. The design, construction and commissioning of the JSSTP was completed on schedule.
        Training was completed for MWSS, MWSI, DENR and the contractor. All operators and
        engineers were trained and also completed on the job training with guidance from the
        JSSTP design consultant. Operation and maintenance manuals were produced.
    ii. The treatment cost has reduced from PhP 165 to PhP 100 and in addition MWSI has seen
        cost savings from re-diverting loads from Dagat Dagatan to Project 7

6.      Financial status: Total disbursement is around 87%; total obligated funds are 97% of total
 grant. Organization and management: A total of 29 key stakeholders were involved in project
 implementation

Challenges

7.      The following challenges were faced during implementation:
           a. The delay in finalizing the SSMP affected the process of establishing a clear
                strategy and approach, including the advocacy for policy documents. These
                delays therefore limited the impact of the project.
           b. Project management issues including high turnover of project managers and the
                separation of technical and fiduciary roles which left the PMO with little control
                – these led to many problems including the loss of institutional memory,
                weakness in contract management and monitoring consultants, lack of quality
                assurance and less effective dissemination of key information among
                stakeholders
           c. Delays in billings and procurement – particularly for the JSSTP where
                centralization of payment led to delays.
           d. Frequent delays in the issue of the sub allotment release order for the project led
                to delays in the release of funds for salaries and wages of the PMO staff as well
                as shortage of funds to pay contracts
           e. Institutionalization of results of technical assistance and outcomes; the TA
                provide recommendations which should be seriously considered for formal
                adoption and implementation in order to achieve the grant objectives. However
                there was a lack of effort and no mechanism was developed to campaign and
                advocate to partner agencies to make water quality improvement a priority
           f. The fluctuation of the peso against the dollar caused problems in financial
                management
           g. The system for ensuring quality outputs from the consultants were not adequate


                                               35
8.      For component 3 it was found that the workshops held were sufficient to stimulate the
demand for financing mechanisms, but not sufficient for implementation. The time required to
obtain institutional (municipal) approvals of project components was longer than expected.

Lessons learnt

9.      The benefits of collaboration between implementing Agencies far outweighed the risks.
The project resulted in heightened awareness and improved Agency responses to emerging issues.
Stakeholder views of the implementation arrangement were positive and there were increased
opportunities for collaboration. Partner agencies were able to improve coordination and working
arrangements contributed to professional growth and advancement. The Technical Working
Group (TWG) was an effective mechanism to address the lack of regular venues for project
review and provided a troubleshooting role – helping to identify solutions to emerging issues.

10.     The approach to capacity building by consultants varied. Some agencies reported that
there benefitted from working together with the consultant. However this was not an explicit
capacity building role in the ToR for most consultants.

11.     Integrating all components is not easy. Some stakeholders still view their component as
an independent project resulting in a fragmented view of the goal and objectives of the project.

Conclusions and Recommendations

12.    The following main conclusions and recommendations are made for future
implementation:
    a. The integration process is critical. Joint activities and events should be programmed to
       support partnership building.
    b. Under similar projects in the future the PMO should be strengthened, including combined
       control over technical and fiduciary functions and regular review and updating of its
       functions. The PMO should have an explicit function to support advocacy within DENR,
       monitor components and improve the implementation and organize events for all
       agencies to update on progress.
    c. The approach to capacity building should be more proactive to address implementation
       issues. Trainings should be preceded by a needs assessment and be designed to promote
       institutionalization of results and sustainability of benefits. The delivery of capacity
       building should be a part of the Terms of Reference
    d. Terms of reference for consultants should have had greater inputs from DENR and the
       World Bank to ensure they were aligned to the actual needs and expectations of the donor
       and client including setting standards for quality of deliverables
    e. Programming and scheduling of project outputs should have been improved, for example
       the draft policies should have been programmed to be produced near the beginning of the
       project so that their implementation could have been supported during the project
    f. Sustained LGU participation needs to be ensured by getting LGUs involved in the project
       design, implementation and review. Mechanisms are needed to monitor and document
       engagement.
