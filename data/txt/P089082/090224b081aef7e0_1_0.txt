                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making significant progress towards achieving project development objectives with the accomplishment of the following milestones: (i) one water quality management
                         area (WQMA) in the San Juan sub-basin has been established and two others, Paranaque and Navotas-Malabon-Tenejeros, are being created, which operationalizes the framework
                         for partnership development with the LGUs and other water districts; (ii) a Sanitation Ordinance for Makati has been issued providing guidelines for septic tank construction and
                         management and is serving as a model for other LGUs to emulate; (iii) setting up of a Harmonized water quality monitoring system, compatible with other existing databases and that
                         of the Manila Bay Coordinating Office (MBCO), has been developed for the Partnership Information Center (PIC), and is in operation along with the website; (iv) the model is linked
                         with all LGUs who also have received training in data collection and are generating water quality data; (v) LGUs are mainstreaming the action plan into their annual investment plans;
                         (vi) innovative financing mechanisms for financing LGU projects have been prepared for three municipalities namely, Quezon City, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, and Los Banos,
                         Laguna and (vii) the final draft of the Metro Manila sewerage and sanitation master plan is being prepared which will be presented in a series of public consultations and is expected
                         to be completed before the end of the first half of 2013.
