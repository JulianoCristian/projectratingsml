A. SUMMARY

The GEF-Manila Third Sewerage Project (MTSP 3) was originally approved on June 27,
2007 for a total grant amount of US$ 5 million (TF 057296-PH) from the Global
Environmental Facility (GEF). The proposed changes include amendments to the
Performance Indicators, the extension of the Grant closing date and the change of
beneficiary agency. The amendments to the Performance Indicators are being requested
to reflect realistic targets as adjustments have to be made to coincide with recently
published official baseline data. The 18-month extension of the Grant closing date is also
being requested to ensure that the joint septage and sewage treatment plant (JSSTP) to be
fully operational before the grant closing date. This is the first extension of the closing
date. The last amendment is the proposed change in the names of the beneficiary agency
of technical assistance (TA) for rate rebasing.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Based on the Implementation Support mission held last June 18- 22, 2012, the project has
made significant progress with a moderately satisfactory rating for overall
implementation progress and for completing the procurement of the remaining goods and
services. It has a disbursement rate of 64.78%.

The recommendations made as a result of the technical assistance outputs such as the
policy studies, local government ordinances, new financing options, and pollution
reduction incentives are slowly being incorporated in the ongoing policy reform in the
sanitation sector.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

      Amendment of Indicators (Amendment to Annex 2 to Schedule 2 of Grant
       Agreement). Proposed changes represent realistic baseline conditions and less
       ambitious, achievable targets. Annex 1 illustrates the changes compared with
       those originally agreed and the proposed changes to Annex 2 to Schedule 2 of the
       Grant Agreement. (Refer to Annex 1 of this paper)

      Correction of Name of TA Recipient Agency for rate rebasing (Amendment to
       Annex 2 to Schedule 2 of Grant Agreement). It is proposed to amend the Grant
       Agreement to indicate that the recipient of the consultant services for rate
       rebasing was the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) for
       their rate rebasing negotiations with the concessionaire Maynilad Water Services
       Inc. (MWSI), rather than concessionaire Manila Water Company Inc. (MWCI),
       which had completed rate rebasing negotiations before the Grant was approved
       (Refer to Annex 2 of this paper).

                                             6
   Grant Closing Date (Amendment to Schedule II, Section IV B: Withdrawal
    Conditions; Withdrawal Period \of Grant Agreement). It is proposed to extend the
    Grant closing date by 18 months to May 31, 2014, to enable financing equipment
    for the JSSTP. An updated Implementation Plan has been submitted and agreed
    upon to reflect the proposed timelines to accomplish the remaining activities up to
    the requested Grant closing date.
