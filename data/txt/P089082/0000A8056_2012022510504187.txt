                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress Towards Achieving GEO. The project is making good progress towards achieving project development objectives: (i) a more effective approach of water quality
                         management areas (WQMA), based on drainage areas has been adopted as the framework for partnership development with the LGUs and other water districts; (ii) a Sanitation
                         Ordinance has been issued providing guidelines for septic tank construction and management; (iii) a water quality monitoring model, compatible with other existing databases and
                         that of the Manila Bay Coordinating Office (MBCO), has been developed for the Partnership Information Center (PIC), and is in operation along with the website; (iv) the model is
                         linked with all LGUs who also have received training in data collection and are generating water quality data; (v) action plans are being prepared for the LGUs; (vi) innovative
                         financing mechanisms for financing LGU projects are under development; and (vii) the updating of the Metro Manila sewerage and sanitation master plan is under preparation and
                         expected to be completed in the first half of 2012.

                         Status of Implementation. All consultant services have been procured, some outputs have already been delivered, and others are expected to be completed in the next six months.
                         Even though 11 out of the 17 MOAs were completed, no further inputs are planned because the new WQMA framework adopted provides a more effective platform for partnership
                         development. The 17 LGUs and water districts are within the WQMAs, and the WQMAs will have a legal status, and budgets, and will be headed by an Under Secretary of the DENR.
                         Re-bidding for the only works contract for the Joint Sewage-Septage Treatment Plant (JSSTP) has been completed, and approval of the award decision by the DENR is awaited;
                         MWSI’ has confirmed its agreement with the contract price, and to finance the contract, as the project support will be limited to US$ 1.2 million of the contract cost. MWSI would need
                         to be a party to this contract, through an appropriate agreement with FASPO (who will sign the contract) The task team has stressed the importance of early commencement of
                         construction of this sole works contract as it is critical to completion of implementation and a decision on the Grant amendment. Amendment of the Grant Agreement is required to
                         reflect the changes identified during the mid-term review including revision of some ambitious targets of the performance indicators, and extension of the Grant closing date by about
                         12 months until completion of the JSSTP. The amendment will be considered by the Bank after the signature of the contract for the JSSTP. Water quality equipment was procured in
                         2009, and has been deployed. Grant disbursement has improved to 50%, from 33% in December 2010.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Good progress is being made in project implementation, and towards achieving the project development objective. Progress made includes: execution of MOAs by all the 11 LGUs;
                         formation of three water quality management areas (WQMAs), based on drainage catchments, incorporating all the seventeen stakeholders; provision of training to all agencies in
                         water quality data collection; completion of harmonization of water quality measurements; completion of the water quality model for the Partnership information Center, compatible
                         with the database of MBCO; completion of public assessment of sewerage and sanitation services (PASS); early completion (in 2008) technical assistance support for rate re-basing
                         negotiations with concessionaires; consultants engaged for Metro Manila sewerage and sanitation master plan updating, development of innovative financing instruments for LGU
                         investments; enhancement of the environmental use fee (EUF).

                         Although the rebidding for the joint septage-sewerage treatment plant (JSSTP) has been completed, signature of the contract has not taken place yet, pending approval of the DENR
                         and formal confirmation of financing by MWSI. This is currently on the critical path of activities. The grant agreement extension could be considered at the request of the government
                         after signature of the contract to incorporate: additional activities to be financed with grant savings; adjustment of performance indicators and extension of the grant closing date by 12
                         months until completion of the JSSTP. The amendment will be considered after the signature of the contract, and upon receipt of a formal request from the Department of Finance.
