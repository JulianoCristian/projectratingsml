                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has continued to move towards meeting the GEO. Many of the technical assistance outputs have been completed, including recommendations for expanding and
                         restructuring the Environment User Fee and guidance for harmonizing water quality monitoring. However translating the Technical Assistance into real impacts is expected to face
                         many challenges. Some major deliverables under the Technical Assistance are close to completion including drafted policies on sewerage and septage management and the updated
                         MWSS Master Plan, however there is a risk that these may not be delivered before project closure.

                         Support to MWSS in their management of the two private concessionaires in Metro Manila has also advanced including initiation of the Public Assessment of Sewerage and
                         Sanitation and support to rate rebasing in 2008. These have been satisfactorily implemented.

                         Coordination between the different agencies has been supported and there are some examples of increased effectiveness. In total 14 LGUs have signed MoUs with DENR and
                         developed action plans. About three LGUs are making active improvements to septage and sanitation within their areas â€“ however follow up by the project team has been limited and
                         attribution to the project is difficult. San Juan River System WQMA designation has been completed and the Governing Board has been set up. Two other WQMAs have been
                         identified and DENR is proceeding with designation under their 2014 work plan.

                         Implementing agencies have reported improved data sharing and policy dialogue due to the joint Technical working Groups, meetings etc under the project. However partnership has
                         not advanced as far as anticipated; for example the Partnership Information Center is not fully operational and LGUs are not working closely with EMB-DENR on wastewater
                         management.

                         Simple wastewater treatment technology has been supported through the completion of the JSSTP and extensive promotion of this technology and lessons learnt. Elements of the
                         JSSTP are already being replicated.
