                         17 stakeholder/Local Government Units (LGU) have signed the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), and a number of partnership meetings with stakeholders have been conducted. A
                         new framework for partnership, the Water Quality Management Areas (WQMA) based on river basins, has been formulated, incorporating the local government units (LGU) and other
                         stakeholders. Three WQMAs, covering the Manila Third Sewerage Project (MTSP) project area, are in the process of being established, and are expected to be formally established
                         with the issue of administrative orders by the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), expected in the first quarter of 2011. The Performance
                         Assessment of Sewerage and Sanitation (PASS) services has been completed.

                         (b) The water quality monitoring equipment procured in early 2010 has been deployed and is in use by the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). EMB has provided training to
                         Local Government Units (LGU) in the conduct of monitoring and the use of monitoring equipment. There is interest and demands from some LGUs to take on the monitoring activities
                         and set up monitoring stations in their jurisdictions. The water quality monitoring consultant is currently working on the development of a standard method and procedures for water
                         quality monitoring to support data gathering and consolidation at the data center in the Partnership Information Center.

                         (c) Other grant-financed consultant services activities under implementation include: (i) planning and policy development, (ii) innovative financing, (iii) use of market based incentives,
                         (iv) design of the Partnership Information Center information system design; and (iv) design of the joint sewage- septage treatment plant (JSSTP)
