PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
.
This completion report reviews the preparation, implementation and
achievements of a sewerage engineering project for which Loan S-7-MOR was made
in August 1977 to the Kingdom of Morocco for US$ 1,500,000 of which US$ 51,371
was cancelled in early 1984.  The implementing agency was the Prefecture of
the City of Casablanca.
This report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office on the basis of the findings of a project completion mission
which visited Morocco in November 1983 and a review of the President's report,
the loan documents, supervision1 reports, progress reports and other documents
related to project implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Government and the implementing agency for comnmmt. Comments were received
from Regie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricite de
Casablanca; these have been taken into account and are attached as Appendix I.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SEWERAGE ENGINEERING PROJECT
LOAN S-7-MOR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Bank had been involved in the Moroccan sewerage sector through
the Bay of Agadir Tourism Project (Loan 1202-MOR of February 1976).
Engineering Loan S-7-MOR, which was approved in August 1977 for
US$ 1.5 million, was the Bank's first free-standing loan to the Moroccan
sewerage sector. Subsequently, Loans 1528-MOR, 1944-MOR, 2245-MOR and 2272-
MOR provided relatively small amounts for the construction of sewers and slum
upgrading and land development components of urban development projects.
Project preparation was carried out expeditiously with the assistance
of the Bank and WHO. The project consisted primarily in the preparation of a
sewer system feasibility study and a first-stage project for the Casablanca-
Hohbanedia area (para. 2.01).
Substantial time overrun was incurred due to lengthy coordination
problems during project start-up (para. 3.01). Consultants mobilized rapidly
however, and project implementation progressed smoothly.   The  Consultants'
contract was amended in September 1982 (para. 3.02). The project studies have
been successfully completed.   In addition  to  setting  the  stage  for  the
development of sewerage in the Casablanca-Mohammedia area, the studies will
assist the Government to address the major aspects of the sewerage sector in
general (para. 3.03).
Preparation of a follow-up sewerage project for the Casablanca-
Mohammedia area is well advanced, although progress is being held up because
of difficulties arising out of the stringent limits placed on foreign borrow-
ings (para. 3.04).
Project costs amounted to uS$ 3.0 million (appraisal US$ 2.5 mil-
lion). The overrun was due to delays in project implementation and the exten-
sions of the project scope (para. 3.05).
The start-up delay underscores the need for timely establishment of
an executing agency with requisite decision-making authority (para. 4.01).



KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
SEWERAGE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S-7-MOR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     At the time of appraisal, the development of the sewerage sector had
failed to keep pace with the urban population growth of over 5% per annum and
the country's rapid industrialization.  The existing infrastructure consisted
essentially of combined waste and storm water collection systems in the major
urban centers and primitive excreta disposal systems in rural areas.  Institu-
tions were weak, lacking technical expertise and financial autonomy.
1.02     The Government had become increasingly aware of the need to assign
high priority to the sewerage sector, and the 1978-82 Development Plan under
preparation was expected to allocate more funds for sewerage.  Engineering
Loan S-7-MOR was the first direct Bank Group operation in the sewerage sector.
Prior to this, the Bay of Agadir Tourism Project for which Loan 1202-MOR had
been approved in February 1976, had included US$ 1.7 million for the construc-
tion of sewers and for carrying out a sewerage study in the Agadir area. Sub-
sequently, Loans 1528-MOR, 1944-MOR, 2245-MOR and 2272-MOR proviaed relatively
small amounts for the construction of sewers in slum upgrading and land
development components of urban development projects.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION
2.01     The project was identified in November 1976.  Preparation consisted
in defining the scope of the work to be carried out by the sewerage unit of
the Ministry of the Interior.  This work was carried out expeditiously with
the assistance of the Bank and WHO. The project consisted of (i) the prepara-
tion of a feasibility study of the sewer system for the Casablanca-Mohammedia
area (see Map No. IBRD 18032); (ii) the preparation of a priority project
constituting the first implementation stage of the sewerage master plan; and
(iii) the acquisition of oceanography equipment. The terms of reference for
the studies were discussed and a draft proposal agreed upon in Morocco in
April 1977.
2.02     Loan S-7-MOR for US$ 1.5 million was negotiated in Morocco in June
1977 and approved  in August 1977.   It was intended to finance the entire
foreign exchange requirements of the project, the total cost of which was
estimated at US$ 2.5 million. The hiring of consultants was a condition of
effectiveness which was expected to take place in December 1977.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation
3.01     The project was advertized internationally in September 1977 and, of
the 24 companies and joint ventures which expressed interest, eight were pre-



selected in November 1977.   Although the project had been prepared by the
Ministry of the Interior, other agencies, e.g. the Ministry of Equipment and
the Prefecture of Casablanca were directly concerned and lengthy coordination
problems appear  to have existed until April  1980, when the  Prefecture  of
Casablanca was designated as executing agency for the project /.This coincided
with the signing of the contract of the joint venture of BCEOM-SAFEGE (France)
SAEM (Morocco) and Engineering Science (USA) to carry out the project studies.
Long before this, in October 1978, the Consultants had been selected and the
Bank had  declared  the loan effective.   A detailed  implementation schedule
appears in Annex 1.
3.02     The consultants mobilized rapidly and began working in Casablanca in
early May 1980.  Project implementation progressed smoothly according to con-
tract schedule, and was completed two years and eight months after contract
signing.  The Consultants' contract was amended in September 1982, to include
topographical and geotechnical studies required for the first-stage follow-on
project, and a study of the rehabilitation component of the project.  These
were completed in December 1983.
Outcome of the Studies
3.03     The studies have been successfully completed.-  They form the basis
for the medium and long term development of sewerage in the Casablanca-
Mohammedia area, the largest urban and industrial center in Morocco.   They
also address the questions of design criteria for wastewater collection,
treatment and disposal facilities; the monitoring of receiving waters and
industrial wastewater effluents; the development of domestic and industrial
wastewater management practices and of technical criteria for wastewater
reclamation for agricultural and industrial purposes and for possible use of
sewage solids for soil conditioning; the creation of regional autonomous
sewerage authorities; and the establishment of adequate charges for industrial
and domestic wastewater disposal services. The project will thus assist the
Government directly in implementing its long-range program to reorganize the
sewerage sector.
Follow-up Project
3.04     Preparation of a follow-up project for the Casablanca-Mohammedia area
is well advanced and 2ould be appraised as soon as the question of project
financing is resolved, 2 The difficulty has arisen in recent months as a result
of the austerity program on which the Government of Morocco has embarked and
the stringent limits on foreign borrowing.  The possibility of financing the
proposed project without recourse to the Government is currently being
examined.
Project Costs and Loan Disbursements
3.05     Total project costs amounted to US$ 3.0 million (appraisal US$ 2.5
million).   The cost overrun was due to delayed project  implementation and
expanded scope. The entire overrun was in local currency and was financed by
the Government.
OED Notes: 1l Responsibility was assigned to Regie Autonome Intercommunale de
Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricite de Casablanca, a public agency
with financial autonomy. See Items B and C- of Appendix I.
2/ See items D and E of Appendix I.



- 3 -
3.06     The loan was fully disbursed except for US$ 51,371 which was can-
celled in early 1984.  Reflecting the implementation slippage caused by the
delayed hiring of consultants (para. 3.01), the longer implementation schedule
for the original project components (para. 3.02) and the extended scope (para.
3.02), the last payment was made in early 1984, some three years later than
originaLly foreseen.
Borrower, Consultants and Bank Performance
3.07     The  Borrower  experienced  some  coordination  problems  in the early
stage of project execution (para. 3.01).  However, with the setting up of a
project Steering Committee under the chairmanship of the Governor and the
appointment of the Prefecture of Casablanca as executing agency, project
implementation  progressed  smoothly.   The  consultants'  performance was also
excellent.   For its part the Bank  provided  the necessary  support  to  the
Government in independently reviewing progress and helping to ensure that the
studies produced would meet the requisite standards of appropriateness, com-
pleteness and quality.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
4.01     The project was successfully completed albeit with substantial time
overruns during start-up (para.  3.01).  This underscores the need for the
early establishment of a competent and effective coordinating body empowered
with the requisite decision-making authority.

SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Morocco
Casablanca-Mohamnedia Region Sanitation
Prolect (Loan S-7 MDR)
SHIV S. KAPUR, Director, Operations Evaluation Department, World Bank.            OED Notes
Ref: Your letter of April 18, 1984
Following your letter cited in reference, in which you asked
for my comments on this report, I am pleased to inform you that the
description of the project's progress from signing to the date of
completion (December 1983) needs some additional information, as
followt:
A. The project consisted of 3 phases:
1.  Phase 1   -  Feasibility study                                       PCR, para.2.01
2.  Phase 2   -  Before project study, examining the organizational,
institutional and financial aspects of the project;  PCR, para.3.03
3.  Phase 3   - A study of the rehabilitation of the waste water
pipelines and identification of an urgent first        PCR, para.3.02
stage component.
B. The Moroccan Government decided to give the responsibility for          Footnote added
managing the sanitation works to a public agency with financial            to PCR, para.3.01
autonomy. That agency was R.A.D.
C.  The management contract made with R.A.D. and the city of               Footnote added
Casablanca became a concession contract. The city council recently         to PCR, para.3.01
met to discuss this subject.
D.  The financial equilibrium of the project is tied to numerous           Footnote added to
administrative constraints of a financial and technical nature.            PCR, para.3.04
For this balance to be maintained, a number of steps must be taken
very soon.
E.  In conclusion:
All the studies are finished.  We now have the plans for the          Footnote added
most urgent works (the new works and rehabilitative works).  Nov           to PCR, para.3.03
the financing of this part must be set up in direct and indirect
currencies and this must be made firm by modification of the pro-
curement conditions for the sanitation works in the greater
Casablance area by R.A.D. on the one hand and through tariff
measures taken as a result of the study done, these two aspects
being linked, besides. It is these five points which in my opinion
warrant inclusion in the report. The rest of the report did not
raise any observations from me.
