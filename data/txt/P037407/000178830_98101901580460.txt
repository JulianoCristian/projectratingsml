SUMMARY
1.        The Industrial Development Bank of Israel, Limited (IDBI) was
established in 1957 to assist private industrial development in Israel.
The Bank has so far made IDBI tw-o loans, totalling US$35 million; the
first loan of $20 million in September 1965 and the second of $15 million
in November 1967.
2.        Of IDBI's presently issued share capital of IS 379 million, only
Ordinary A shares of IL 15 million carry full voting rights. 55% of the
Ordinary A shares are held by private domestic investors, 26% by the Govern-
ment and 19% by foreign investors. IDBI's Board of Directors numbers 56,
and its functions have largely been delegated to three committees on which
the main share holding groups are represented.
3.        IDBI is well organized and expertly managed.  Its staff is
competent and experienced. The standard of appraisal work is satisfactory,
and IDBI's investment decisions are soundly based. Its follow-up work is
well performed.
4.        Although IDBI is empowered to undertake a wide variety of
functions, IDBI has concerned itself almost exclusively with lending. As
a general rule, IDBI does not make equity investments. From its inception
to December 31, 1969, IDBI had approved 2,568 operations for a cumulative
total of IL 1.39 billion. As of December 31, 1969, the loan portfolio
amounted to IL 901 million, of which the repayment of IL 106.5 million or
about 12% is guaranteed by the Government. As of the same date, IDBI's
investment in shares amounted to IL 33.7 million or 3.5% of its total
portfolio.
5.        IDBI's financial record is satisfactory.  Net earnings increased
from IL 21.9 million in 1966 to IL 25.1 million in 1969, representing a
range from about 13% to 15.5% of average year-end share capital. The amount
overdue is relatively smXall and actual losses to IDBI are likely to be
minimal. The ratio of non-current debt and guarantees to equity was about
1:1 at the end of 1969.  Reserves and retained earnings increased from
IS 12.5 million in 1966 to Il 22.4 million in 1968. Total reserves together
with provisions amounted to about 9% of the total portfolio as of December 31,
1969.
6.        IDBI is an institution of national importance.  The average
annual amount of IDBI's financing for industrial development has been
equal to about 25% of total gross industrial investment in the country.
IDBI's relations with the Government and the commercial banking system are
close and harmonious.



- ii -
7.        IDBI has projected loan commitments of about IL 475 million
(US$ 136 million) during the two years from July 1970 to June 1972. The
projections appear reasonable and attainable. During the same period,
IDBI will need additional capital of around IZ 319 million to help meet
expected demands for financing.  IDBI has made considerable efforts to
raise funds from as many sources as possible. It expects to obtain IZ 169
million out of the required IL 319 million from dcmestic and foreign
markets.  For the shortfall of I£ 150 million or US$ 43 million IDBI is
relying heavily on the Bank. The provision of around half this sum, up to
US$ 25 million, would keep the pressure on IDBI to continue searching
for new capital while assuring it of resources until about February 1972.
A loan of $25 million is recommended.
8.        IDBI is a sound development finance company and continues to
deserve the support of the Bank. The financial projections for the next
two years are satisfactory and debt service cover will be adequate through-
out the projected life of the loan. The proposed loan should be on the
Bank's usual terms for recent loans to development finance companies. In
view of the high standard of IDBI's operation, the "free limit" should be
raised to US$ 750,000, with a limit on the aggregate to be credited below
the free limit of 50% of the amount of the loan. A debt-to-equity ratio
should be included in the loan agreement and the limit should be set at
3:1.

APPRAISAL OF
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPM1ENT BANK OF ISRAEL, LTD.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Industrial Development Bank of Israel (IDEI) has applied to the
Bank for a third loan, of $55 million, to cover part of its projected foreign
exchange requirements for a period of five years. So far, the Bank has granted
two loans:  the first loan, US$20 million, in September 1965 and the second,
US$15 million, in November 1967. This report, which examines the suitability
of IDBI to receive a third Bank loan, is based on a continuing relationship
between the Bank and IDBI since the first Bank loan was made and on the find-
ings of a Bank mission that visited Israel in October-November 1969.
II.  ENVIRONMENT AND ROLE
2.        A review of the economy of Israel is given in the economic report
dated July 22, 1969 "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Israel"
(EM4A-7b). This was updated by a memorandum dated March 20, 1970 (EMA-18a).
General Economic Setting
3.        Israel's economic growth in the past has been remarkable considering
her scarce natural resources, limited domestic market and inability to
establish trade relationships with neighboring countries. Between 1960 and
1966, real MNP expanded at an average of 9%d a year while per capita production
increased by about 5%. Investment rose to an average annual rate of 26%. The
rate of export growth was about 15% per year. This growth performance was made
possible mainly by a relatively large and sustained inflow of foreign capital
and by a broad base of well-educated people.
4.        More recently Israel's resources have been strained by heavy defense
expenditure. This strain was reflected in growing budgetary and balance of
payments deficits. The balance of payment deficit was further aggravated
by the high growth rate of the economy. The 1969 deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments was estimated at about $930 million which
was some 30% higher than the 1968 deficit and about double that of 1967. The
Bank of Israel lost foreign exchange reserves of more than $250 million during
1969. A large increase in the price level was avoided. Wages, which have
been frozen for the past two years, were renegotiated early in 1970 and
effectively the freeze has been reimposed for a further two years. Rates of
savings and investment declined sharply in 1967 and despite some revival in
the following two years remain well below levels recorded in the first half
of the 1960's. The Government faces a difficult task in containing internal
demand and the balance of payments deficit, and in rebuilding the country's
foreign exchange resources.



-2-
Industrial Setting
5.        The industrialization of Israel has played a key role in the
country's economic growth. From 1950 to 1968 industrial output rose at an
average rate of over 10%. In 1968, industrial output accounted for 27% of
MP and for some three-quarters of the yearly export of commodities excluding
diamonds. Employment in the industrial sector was 226,000 or about 25% of
the total of gainfully employed in the country. The strong upsurge in the
industrial sector has continued through 1969. Industrial output increased
28% in 1968 and is estimated to have increased 17% in 1969 at constant prices.
Industrial investment amounted to IL 470 million in 1968 and is expected to
have reached about I£ 750 million, in 1969, or about 19% and 22% of the total
fixed investment in the country, respectively.
6.        The impressive industrial development in the past would not have
been possible without substantial Government support and encouragement. As
early as 1950, the Law for Encouragement of Capital Investment was enacted
to attract foreign capital to IsraeL, to channel domestic investments into
key sectors, to increase exports, to reduce reliance on imports, to absoxb
immigrants and to populate the underdeveloped areas. The Law has been amended
from time to time to meet changing conditions. The latest amendments were
made in 1967. Investment projects which assist in the achievement of the
aims of the Law may benefit from special advantages and financial assistance;
incentives include tariff protection, cash grants, subsidies, drawback of
customs duties, and low cost financing. Applications for such incentives are
filed with and processed by the Investment Center, a Government body created
to administer the Law.
7.        Aware of the possibility of distortions in production costs that
could result from protection and Government subsidies, the authorities have
been taking steps to rationalize the existing structure and increase the
intexnational competitiveness of the industrial sector. Following the 1962
devaluation, quantitative import restrictions were replaced primarily by
tariff protection. Since the 1967 devaluation, the Government has been
making efforts to reduce the effective tariff levels and to rely less on
subsidies and preferential treatment. At the time of the 1967 devaluation,
for instance, tariff protection of at least 50% was given to two-thirds of
total industrial output exposed to foreign competition. One-third enjoyed
more than 100% protection.  However, tariff reductions of between 10% and
30% were announced for a wide range of industrial commodities in October 1968
and January 1969. In May 1969, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry approved
a five-year plan to reduce average duties to under 3)% by January 1, 1975.
Also, the Government has promoted mergers and modernization and expansion of
enterprises, to improve efficiency of output, by providing low cost long-term
financing and sometimes Government subsidies. Although the present level of
protection remains high, the gradual reduction of tariffs and the encouragement
of various measures for cost reduction are significant steps in the right
direction.



8-        In the early 1950's, owing in large part to the need to absorb
immigrants, Government support for industrial development was directed prin-
cipally to labor intensive industries for domestic market consumption, such
as textiles and food processing. Increasing emphasis has been placed on
capital-intensive metal, chemical, and rubber industries. Recently, such
sophisticated science-based industries as electronics, scientific instruments
and netro-chemicals have been encouraged. An increasing demand for industrial
development loans is expected from such new science-based industries.
Financial Setting
9.        There are 27 commercial banks with 648 branches, 17 credit coope-
ratives with 83 branches and 20 mortgage banks operating in Israel at the
present time. Twenty-two of the banks are authorized to deal in foreign
currency. These banks mainly make short-term credit and participate in
industrial financing by providing working capital.
10.       Investment banks, as distinguished from commercial banks, provide
medium- and long-term credit for industry, construction, public services and
the like. The most important investment banks in the respective sectors are:
IDBI in the industrial sector; the Israel Bank of Agriculture Limited in the
agriculture sector; Tefahot Mortgage Bank Limited in the construction sector;
and Tourist Industry Development Corporation Limited in the tourist and
transportation sectors. The Israel Corporation Limited, established in
April 1968, may become important in channeling funds from abroad to finance
industrial and other projects and in providing managerial services. Two-thirds
of the funds available to investment banks are derived from the Government,
particularly from the development budget. In addition to this source, the
investment banks mobilize funds by issuing securities in the local market and
abroad.
11.       The Minister of Finance is authorized by Law to fix maximum interest
rates for loans. However, at the end of March 1970 the ceiling on interest
rates for commercial credits was removed.  Until 1967, IDBI charged 12%. How-
ever, under an agreement with the Government effective October 1, 1967, DBI
charges interest rates ranging from 6.5% to 9% per annum for its long-term
loans to industry, the rate depending on the location and nature of projects.
When IDBI charges an interest rate of less than 9% per annum, the Govermment
pays IDBI the difference between 9% per annum and the rate charged to the
borrower.
Role of IDBI
12.       IDBI is the largest institution in Israel providing medium- and
long-term credit for industrial development. Its assets amount to about 80%
of the assets of all the investment banks operating in the industrial field.
IDBI's loan approvals have represented, on the average, about one-fourth of
gross annual investment in industry.  IDBI administers some Government funds
for certain development loans to Government-controlled enterprises, and acts
as agent for the U.S. Agency for International Development. It closely cooper-
ates with the Government in implementing industrial development programs and
continues to play a key role in financing the Israeli private industrial sector.

III. DESCRIPTION OF IDBI
Establishment and Purposes
13.       IDBI was established in 1957 on the joint initiative of the
Government of Israel, the three largest commercial banks in Israel, the
Histadrut (General Federation of Labor) and the Manufacturers' Association.
Its main objective is the provision of medium- and long-term finance to
private industrial enterprises in Israel. DBI is also empowered by its
Articles of Association to undertake a variety of functions including
participation in equity capital of entexprises, underwriting and promoting
security issues, guaranteeing obligations and providing managerial, financial
and technical assistance to industries.
Share Capital and Ownership
14.       Of the presently authorized share capital of I£417 million, only
Ordinary A shares of I116 million carry full voting rights, of which
I£15.1 million had been issued and subscribed as of December 31, 1969. The
Ordinary A shares were widely distributed among the Government, private
domestic and foreign investors, as shown in Annex 1; the Government held
26%; private domestic investors, 55%; and foreign investors, 19%. The
proportion of the Government's shareholding gives it, in terms of Israeli
Company Law, veto power in regard to major changes in IDBI's Charter.
15.       Other than the Ordinary A shares mentioned above, there were eight
classes of ordinary or preference capital stocks issued, totalling about
I£364 million, as of December 31, 1969.  Of these shares, Government held
about 52%, foreign investors 28%, private domestic investors 4% and enter-
prises jointly held by the private domestic and foreign investors 16%.
Annex 2 describes the distribution of the shares other than Ordinary A.
Organization,_Management and Staff
16.       Board of Directors.  IDBI's Board has 56 members representing the
Ordinary A shareholders. All holders of I£250,000 or more in Ordinary A
shares are entitled to appoint one director. 12 directors represent the
Government, 13 represent foreign shareholders, and the remaining 31 represent
domestic shareholders and the enterprises jointly owned by domestic and
foreign interests. The Board represents a broad cross-section of financial
and business institutions in the country, and foreign investors. IDBI's
Board members are listed in Annex 3(A). The Board meets three or four times
a year, reviews the record of activities of the Executive Committee and
decides key policy matters referred to it by the Executive Committee. The
Board is responsible for the election of the Chairman and the appointment of
the Managing Director.
17.       Dr. Y. Foerder who had been the Chairman of the Board since IDBI's
inception relinquished office in March 1970 because of ill health. Mr. Moshe
Sandberg, Executive Vice-Chairman, who was active in IDBI's day-to-day
management on a full-time basis from his appointment in 1968 until November
1969, is now acting as Chairman and works on a part-time basis.

18.       Committees.  Three committees operate in IDBI: The Executive
Committee, the Vice-Chairments Committee and the Loan Committee. The powers
and duties, chairman, members and the number of meetings of these committees
are described in the following.

Mlembers of both Executive and Loan Committees are listed in Annex 3(B).
19.       Management. Dr. Avraham Neaman has been the Managing Director, who
is the chief operating executive, since 1961. He has four senior assistants:
the Deputy General Manager who directly supervises the Economics, Engineering
and Follow-up Departments; the Assistant General Manager who is responsible
for the Implementation, Collection, and Accounting Departments; the General
Counselor and Assistant Manager who heads the Legal Department; and the
General Secretary who heads the Secretariat Department which is also in charge
of Administration and Statistics. The day-to-day management team consists of
these five members plus the Executive Vice-Chairman and meets once a week to
discuss management problems. IDBI is well led and well managed.
20.       Organization and Staff.  IDBI is organized in eight departments,
mentioned above.  The staff numbers 135, including 6 members of the management
team and 43 professional staff members. The professional staff includes 15
economists, 10 engineers, 8 lawyers and 6 accountants. The staff are
generally competent and experienced.  IDBI has been training less-experienced



- 6 -
staff on the job and sends its staff members to various training courses
outside IDBI. It also plans to add new staff members, provided qualified
professionals are found, to enable it to deal with an expected increase in
the volume of appraisal and end-use work, The organization chart is shown
in Annex 4.
Procedures
21.       Appraisal of Investment Proposals.  Loan applications are given a
preliminary review by an initial screening committee consisting of the
management, department heads concerned, two representatives from the Govern-
ment, one from the government's Investment Center and three Board members.
This committee decides whether an application deserves further examination or
should be rejected for reasons of Governmental priority or on various other
grounds. If the committeets decision is favorable, an appraisal team,
consisting of one engineer and one economist, is assigned to the project.
The Engineering and the Economics Departments, acting together, prepare the
appraisal report and recomendations, assisted by the Legal and other
departments. The appraisal report thus prepared is reviewed by a working
party, consisting of the management team, the department heads concerned and
their deputies. This working party decides whether to present the appraisal
to the Loan Committee (or the Executive Committee), possibly with revisions of
the terms and conditions, or whether to return the report for further study
and justification. The Loan Committee or the Executive Committee reviews the
report screened by the working party and makes a final decision on the
project.
22.       IDBI's appraisal is carefully done; the appraisal report covers all
pertinent aspects, including prospects for the international competitiveness
of the project. The standard of the underlying appraisal work is satisfac-
tory; IDBI's investment decisions are soundly based.
23.       Follow-up.  The Engineering Department closely follows the project
during the construction.  Engineers visit the project site several times to
assure proper performance of construction and installation. Upon the comple-
tion of the project, the Follow-up Department is responsible for obtaining
the reports and accounts from clients and examining them, for making site
inspections and for recommending actions to the management where necessary.
Because of the relatively large number of clients (about 850 as of December 31,
1969), the Follow-up Department has adopted a policy of selection and reviews
about 10 clients per month. The firms which are selected are in arrears, or
in default, or in some difficulty.  The selection of clients is made mainly
on the basis of a monthly ttcollection status report" prepared by the Collec-
tion Department, supplemented by other available information. The Follow-up
Department produces about 120 follow-up reports in a year. The reports are
well organized and comprehensive, and contain necessary recommendations. In
general, the follow-up work is well done. Nevertheless, IDBI feels that this
activity creates a heavy load on its staff and, therefore, has recently com-
missioned a consultant firm to devise a more efficient method to select clients
which require close attention. IDBI will inform the Bank of any revisions in
its procedures arising from the consultantst recommendations.



-7-
Resources
24.       IDBI's main resources consist of its paid-in share capital, reserves
and retained earnings, Government deposits, debentures, loans from AID and
IBERD, bonds floated in Europe and other borrowings. The resource position as
of December 31, 1969, is summarized in Basic Data, shown in pages iii-iv.
25.       Share Capital. As of December 31, 1969, the authorized share
capital was s17;million of which I£379.2 million was issued and paid-in.
At present, there are 9 classes of authorized capital, each having, istinctive
characteristics as to voting powers, redeemability, value-linking _, dividend
rights, profit participation and rights in liquidation.
26.       Two of the classes of non-voting shares, one ordinary and one
preference (redeemable), are fully owned by the Government and carry dividends
at the rate of 3% and 3.5% respectively; these in effect provide a subsidy.
The five classes of shares held by private investors and the Government are
exchange-linked and are entitled to dividends at the rate of 6% (three
classes), 7%" and 7.5%othe first three also participate in profits. The
highest fixed dividend is 8%, paid on the preferred ordinary shares. A
detailed description of each category of shares is given in Annex 5.
27.       Reserves and Iletained Earnings. As of December 31, 1969, IDBI's
linking fund, reseirves and retained earnings amounted to I£71.6 million.
28.       Government Deposits. IDBI receives deposits from the Government
from time to time. The Government deposits are classified into three
categories: (1) the Government places its funds from time to time to cover
the defaulted amount of IDBI loans, the repayment of which is guaranteed by
the Government (aI8.6 million as of December 31, 1969); (2) the Government
makes deposits, from which IDBI withdraws funds for loans to projects
designated by the Government on the terms specified by the Government
(I£74 million as of same date); (3) the Government places long-tern deposits
with IDBI at an interest rate of 3% per annum to augment IDBI's resources
(I£45 million as of same date). The Government deposits totalled I£126.6
million as of December 31, 1969.
29.       Debentures. Five issues of debentures bearing interest at the
rate of 6% totalled I£i54.8 million, of which I£24.8 million was outstanding
1/ In Israel, Government bonds are issued with the principal linked to the
cost of living index. Other financial transactions in the private sector are
often likewise index-linked. Also, financial transactions connected with
foreign currency borrowings are sometimes linked with exchange rate. Until
1963 IDBI loans Ere linked with both the cost of living index and exchange
rate. IDBI abolished linking loans in 1963, but both assets and liabilities
linked with exchange and index still remain in connection with these trans-
actions. IDBI also holds some Government bonds which are index-linked. In
addition, IDDI has a part of its equity linked to the U.S. dollar. IDBI
maintains a special account, "linking fund"., for the adjustments on such
linking transactions (see also paragraph 65).



- 8 -
(including linking increments of I£11 million) as of December 31, 1969.
A description of those debentures is presented in Annex 6. Since December 31,
1969, IDBI has issued additional debentures totalling If35 million which
consist of I£2l million, cost of living index-linked, with interest at 5.5%,
and IL1h million, dollar-linked, with interest at 7%, both redeemable during
1975-1985.
30.       AID Loans and Managed Funds. IDBI received two AID U. S. dollar
loans, one in 1959 and the other in 1961, each $10 million at an interest rate
of 5% per annum for 12 years, including two years of grace. I£S20.5 million
equivalent in total was outstanding as of December 31, 1969. IDBI also
received an AID counterpart fund loan of I£40 million in 1964 at an interest
rate of 3.5% per annum for 25 years including three years of grace. IZ35.6
million was outstanding as of December 31, 1969. Furthermore, IDBI acts as
agent for the U.S. Government to administer local currency loans which AID
grants to Israeli industrial enterprises within the framework of the Cooley
fund authorization.!/ IDBI is responsible for the disbursement and collection
of the loans; it occasionally guarantees the loans. For its services, IDBI
receives a one-time commission of 1% on amounts up to I£l million and 0.5%
on amounts exceeding I M million.  As of December 31, 1969, the managed fund
amounted to about I£ 25.5 million.
31.       IBRD Loans. The terms, conditions, and the status of two IBRD
loans are summarized below:
(US$ million)
First Loan (1965)    Second Loan (1967)
Amount                      20.0                  15.0
Date of Approval       September 1965        September 1967
Interest Rate          5.5% per annum        Variable rates
Amortization              Flexible              Flexible
Status on ]Narch 31, 1970
Credited             20.0                    15.0
Disbursed            20.0                     9.8
Outstanding          16.7                     9.8
As of December 31, 1969, the World Bank loans represented 11.1% of IDBI's
total resources.
32.       European Bonds.  IDBI issued bonds in the amount of $15 million,
which were fully subscribed in the Eurcpean market in 1967. The bonds carry
a 7% coupon, giving an effective cost to IDBI of about 8.23%. The bonds are
redeemable in eleven installments by 1982.
1/ The fund was created under Section 104(e) of the U.S. Agricultural Trade
Development and Assistance Act of 1954 and was available from accruals in local
currency of the proceeds from the sales of U.S. agricultural commodities.



- 9 -
33.       Loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. IDBI has utilized lines
of credit at an interest rate of 6$ per annum from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank for financing imports of capital goods from the U.S. The amount out-
standing as of December 31, 1969 was I£28 million.
34.       Loans from the U.K. Export-Credit Guarantee Department.  IDEI
received two 'ana at an interest rate of 6.47$ per annum from the U.K.
Export-Credit Guarantee Department, totalling UK£5 million in 1968 and 1969.
The outstanding amount as of December 31, 1969 was I1F23.0 million.
35.       Participation of Third Parties in Loans Granted.  IDBI has received
loans fro -local commercial banks and American Palestine Association to
participate in IDBI-financed projects. IDBI is responsible for repayment of
such loans, The amount outstanding as of December 31, 1969 was I£9.7 million.
36.       Other Sources.  IDBI borrows, from time to time, at short-term
from the Bank of Israel to accommodate its short-term needs. The amount
outstanding as of December 31, 1969 was I£15 million. IDBI has recently
entered into an agreement with a consortium of four Belgian banks for a loan
of $10 million equivalent at an interest rate of 7% per annum, for a period
of up to ten years. As noted above, IDBI has made considerable efforts to
raise funds from many sources.

IV. POLICIES AND OPERATIONS
Policy
37.       IDBI does not have a comprehensive statement of general business
policies. Its lending policy has evolved in the course of operations, guided
by its Articles of Association and the Government's policies for industrial
development. Individual loan applications are judged on their own merits,
and profitability for IDBI is an overriding consideration.
38.       Although the Articles of Association provide IDBI with a wide
variety of functions, IDBI has concerned itself almost exclusively with
lending.  Loans are granted for fixed capital including land, buildings and
equipment for industrial projects, primarily in the private and cooperative
sectors.  With minor exceptions, IDBI does not provide loans for working
capital. It has not lent to Government-controlled enterprises from its own
resources including the proceeds of Bank loans. Loans to Government-controlled
enterprises are made only from special funds so provided or arranged by the
Government. IDBI has no stated policy on lending in the occupied territories,
and would consider such applications, if any, on an ad hoc basis on their own
merits, but only against full Government guarantees. So far, IDBI has made
only two such loans, neither involving Bank funds. The proposed Bank loan 4
would finance only projects within the borders of the state of Israel as of
January 1, 1967, and would be used only for t"productive purposes", i.e. it 0
'would not be used for investments in projects primarily or mainly devoted t
the production of defense items.
39.       IDBI also engages in two types of guarantee operations:  first,
guarantee of letters of credit to finance imports of equipment abroad; and
secondly, guarantee of long-term loans including AID (Cooley) loans.
Loan and Guarantee Operations
10.       Summary of Operations.  IDBI's statistics and accounts show, from
its inception, not only loans from its own resources but also Cooley loans
and long-term guarantees, on the ground that all these operations have
involved management decisions on the part of IDBI. From its inception to
December 31, 1969, IDBI had approved 2,568 operations for a cumulative total
of l£ 1.39 billion. Loan approvals, commitments and disbursements since 1966
have been as follows:
(IL million)
1966     1967     1968      1969
Approvals                           96.2    175.6    164.8    278.3
Commitments                        100.4   112.7    175.3    230.1
Disbursements                       94.7      80.2    128.3    206.4



- 11 -
It is apparent that IDBI's operations have grown since 1967, reflecting the
strong upsurge in industrial activity, following the recovery from the 1966
recession. The growth of loan activities in 1969 is particularly noteworthy.
A summary of loan operations since 1958 is shown in Annex 7, and an analysis
of loans approved in Annex 8.
41.       Size of Loans. IDBI is reluctant to consider applications for loans
below IU50,000, but about one-fifth by number (only 1.2% by value) of loans
approved are below that figure. There are no specific restrictions on the
maximum size of a loan or on total commitment to a single enterprise. The
largest loan so far made and the maximum exposure in a single enterprise is
I£44 million to a chemical company, equivalent to about 10% of IDBI's equity
as at December 31, 1969. The average size of loans is IF£540,000. Loans
above I£1 million account for 11% in number, but 64% in amount.
42.       Commitment Fee and Other Charges.  IDBI does not impose a uniform
rate of commitment fee, but passes on the same amount of commitment fee to
the borrowers as it must pay to its lenders, when the lenders charge a
commitment fee. It charges a one-time commission of 1% on the amount of each
loan and a guarantee fee of 2% per annum on the guaranteed amount outstanding.
43.       Interest Rate and Exchange Risk.  As noted in paragraph 11,
IDBI charges rates up to 9% per annum. In cases where it charges less
than 9%, the Govermment pays IDBI the difference. By agreement with IDBI,
the Govexnment assumes the exchange risk on foreign borrowing without charging
any premium. IWhenever IDBI negotiates foreign credits from abroad, it does
so only with the prior approval of the Government, which approval also
conveys the Government's undertaking to assume the foreign exchange risk on
the credit.
44.       The Government's interest rate policy is part of a complex system
of incentives, which include development grants, export subsidies, drawbacks
of customs duty and other devices, designed to promote economic and social
objectives such as the encouragement of exports and the development of under-
populated areas. During negotiations, the Bank received assurances from the
Government and IDBI that they recognize the importance of adequate economic
justification of investment projects, and that economic as well as financial
costs and benefits were being carefully assessed. IDBI's representative
confirmed that IDBI would continue to address itself with particular care
to the economic justification of projects during their appraisal, and that
the reports submitted to the Bank would reflect the economic analysis made.
h5.       Security. IDBI's loans are made on a secured basis, mainly against
first mortgage but sometimes supplemented by the guarantee of either
sponsors or third parties including the Govermment. Collateral is assessed,
based on estimated realization on liquidation. The size of the loan is
usually limited to 55% of the estimated project cost.



- 12 -
46.       Maturity. With a few exceptions, IDBI does not lend for less than
four years. Its longest maturity has been 20 years. The maximum grace
period for repayments is two years and a half. Of the loans approved up to
December 31, 1969, about 71% by value were repayable over nine years, but
about one-half by number were repayable in between six and eight years. The
average maturity is about eleven years.
47.       Industrial Distribution.  Loans are fairly evenly distributed among
various industries. The textile and leather industries have received about
24% of the total loans by value, the metal industry about 17% and the chemical
and rubber industry about 16%, the food and tobacco industry about 12%, non-
metallic minerals about 10%, paper and printing about 5% and miscellaneous
about 16%. Loans to the chemical and rubber industries and the metal
industry have proportionately increased by value recently. No statistical
data on export industries as distinguished from industries producing goods
for domestic use are available.  Howvever, IDBI estimates that more than
two-thirds of the enterprises it finances are export-oriented.
48.       Geographic Distribution.  The regional distribution of loans
approved indicates Government's emphasis on development areas, i.e. on the
borders where the availability of infrastructure and skilled labor is
inadequate, and risks are substantial, as are also the Government's incen-
tives. Loans do not show heavy concentration in a particular region.
49.       Mew or Existing Industries.  About three-fourths of IDBI's lending
by amount has been to existing enterprises for modernization and expansion.
The balance of one-fourth has gone to support new ventures. Recently, loans
for expansion and modernization have further increased, reflecting the
necessity and efforts for balancing and rationalization of existing indus-
tries for cost reduction.
50.       Guarantees.  IDBI's guarantees outstanding amounted to I$39.8
million, I£30.9 million and I£29.3 million as of December 31, 1967, 1968
and 1969 respectively.
Government-Guaranteed Loans
51.       As of December 31., 1969, an outstanding amount of about I£275
million or 31% by value of IDBI's portfolio consisted of loans which were
partially or wholly guaranteed for repayment by the Government of this total,
the portion guaranteed by the Government was IL1O6.5 million. The Government
guarantees repayment of IDBI's loans because of its interest in stimulating
the growth of development areas, in promoting exports or import substitutes,
and in encouraging projects with a high value added, especially those based
on local raw materials. IDBI seeks Government guarantees for projects
located in areas which are handicapped by inadequate infrastructure and
skilled labor supply. Over 80% of the Government-guaranteed projects are
in such areas. Another group for which guarantees are sought is projects



- 13 -
which meet the criteria set by the Law for the Ecnouragement of Capital
Investments, but for which the security is inadequate in IDBI's judgment.
52.       The Government guarantees are of two types, "general" and "special".
The Government obligations in the "general" guarantees are met from a fund to
which the Government credits an amount (according to an agreed formula) for
each guarantee given. The present size of this fund is adequate in relation
to the size of the outstanding amount of guaranteed loans and to the likely
claims. In the event of default, IDBI is compensated up to 8O% of the
outstanding balance of a loan.  As of December 31, 1969, the amounts covered
by the "general" guarantees totalled IT 100.1 million. The "special"
guarantees may be extended up to 100% of the value of the loans and are given
on an individual basis without using the funds for the "general" guarantees.
The value of outstanding loans covered by the "special" guarantees was IL 6.4
million, as of the same date.
53.       The Government guarantees are not conditional on the exhaustion of
legal remedies by IDBI. In the event of default, the amount of repayment due,
both principal guaranteed and interest accrued is immediately paid to IDBI.
54.       Before the second Bank loan was made, the Bank noted IDBI's
inadequate appraisal reports on a few projects guaranteed by the Government.
In making the second loan, the Bank required IDBI to obtain the Bank's prior
approval on all sub-loans to be guaranteed by the Government, regardless of
their size. This has helped ensure adequate appraisals. Also, about two
years ago, it was determined that Government guarantees would be given only
after specific approval by the Israeli Legislature. This requirement too
has prevented IDBI from excessive reliance on Government guarantees, which
can now be obtained only rarely and with difficulty. In view of the good
standard of IDBI's appraisal work and the more stringent conditions for the
grant of Government guarantees, it is no longer necessary for the Bank to
stipulate prior approval of all projects guaranteed by the Government for
which Bank funds are used.
55.       IDBI made two loans totalling about IL 4.5 million to enterprises
in the occupied territories in 1968 (Bank funds were not involved), but it
has made no such loan in 1969. IDBI's loans to Government-controlled
enterprises made through special funds provided by the Government amounted
to IS 74 million or rather less than 10% of its portfolio, as of December 31,
1969. Risks in all these loans are fully assumed by Government.
Investment in Shares
56.       IDBI, as a general rule, does not make equity investments, except
when necessary to rescue its borrowers or in connection with mergers or the
reconstruction of clients' companies. In fact, IDBI has been inactive in new
share investment since 1965 when the first Bank loan was granted. This
inactivity largely resulted from the fact that Israeli industry is character-
ized by a high proportion of debt and considerable reluctance to expand



- 14 -
equity ownership. The depressed condition of the stock market in recent
years has further aggravated the difficulty of making good equity invest-
ments. IDBI's present management believes that development lending should
not be mixed with share ownership. Many of IDBI's investments in shares
were made in connection with its loan operations in earlier years.
57.       As of December 31, 1969, IDBI's investment in share capital,
including its holding in its subsidiary investment company, amounted to
I£33.7 million, 3.6$ of its total portfolio. The bulk of the share invest-
ments are not quoted on the stock exchange. As of December 31, 1969, the
market value of the quoted shares and securities was about 88% of cost.
Investment Company of IDBI
58.       The Investment Company of IDBI was established in 1963 to operate
in the field of equity investment, following legal advice on the requirements
of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, in order to enable IDBI to
continue to be exempt from SEC's classification "investment company". If
IDBI had not remained exempt it would have been able to seek funds in the
U.S. capital market only after complying with substantial restrictions. (For
example, IDBI's Board would have had to include United States citizens as
a majority.)  The share capital of the Investment Company, I£20 million, is
owned by IDDI (74.9%) and Government (25.1%).  The Investment Company
operates in accordance with IDBI's policy towards investments in shares
mentioned above, and functions virtually as a department of IDBI, having no
separate staff of its own. The Investment Company was originally intended to
take over most of the equity investment activity of IDBI, but in the circum-
stances its activity has been limited mainly to rescue operations of IDBI's
clients in trouble.
59.       The Investment Company's total assets amounted to about I£32.6
million, 3.3% of IDBI's total assets, as of December 31, 1969. Its total
portfolio, consisting of investments in shares, debentures and loans, amounted
to about I£26 million at cost, of which I M9.6 million or about 75% was
invested in share capital. Quoted securities amounted to IL 11.2 million,
the market price of which was about IL11.8 million, slightly higher than the
cost. The balance sheets and income statements of the Investment Company since
1966 are shown in Annexes 9 and 10, respectively.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORIANCE
Income Performance
60.       ID3I's income statements for the years 1966 through 1969 are given
in detail in Annex 11 and are summarized below.
(I£ million)
1966    1967    1968    1969
Gross income                              62.2    72.0    76.5    83.7

Profit before financial charges and tax
as % of average total assets             7.2     7.4     7.7      8.4
Profit before tax and provisions as %
of average total assets                  4.7     4.9      5.2     5.4
Profit before tax and provisions as f

Profit after tax and provisions as %
of average year-end share capital 2/   14.9    14.0    15.5    13.2
61.       IDBI's income performance is satisfactory.  Gross income
increased from I£ 72 million in 1967 to I£ 83.7 million in 1969.  Net income
increased from If, 22.7 million in 1967 to IL 28.6 million in 1968, but
decreased to If 25.1 million in 1969 owing to higher tax payments. Adminis-
trative and general expenses have been below 0.6Z of average total assets.
1/ Excluding Ordinary B and Preference A shares owned by the Government, but
including net linking funds.
2/ Excluding Ordinary B and Preference A shares owned by the Government.



- 16 -
62.       IDBI's calculation of the difference betwieen yield from funds used
and cost of resources (including in cost the payout on shares which rank for
dividends ahead of Ordinary A shares) was 155% in 1966.  The margin increased
to 2.05c- in 1967, 2.11% in 1968 and 2.51s in 1969 owing to the new arrangement
with the Government whereby payment to the Government of insurance premiums by
ID3BI for exchange risk was eliminated.
Financial Position
63.       IDBI's balance sheets as at December 31, from 1966 through 1969,
are given in detail in Annex 12 and are summarized below:
(I£ million)
1966     1967     1968     1969
Assets
Short-term assets and deposits              46.4      98.3     38.9     34.2
Long-term deposits                          36.2      33.3     30.1     23.9
Loans                                      650.5    696.1    805.4    901.1
Investments in shares and subsidiary
company                                   39.2     39.1      37.3     33.7
Fixed assets and deferred charge             4.9       7.3      5.2        0
777.2    874.1    916.9    992.9
Liabilities
Short-term liabilities                      72.9      62.8     44.9    102.9
Special deposits and participation          93.6      82.8    123.6    117.5
Long-term debt                             189.4    279.1    280.6    321.6
Linking funds                               63.5      65.8     62.1      41.8
Share capital and retained earnings        357.8    383.6    405.7    409.1
Except in 1967, IDBI's current ratio was less than 1.0.  However, IDBI has
been able to meet short-term requirements through long-standing arrangements
for short-term accommodation with the Bank of Israel. The annual rate of
growth of total assets was 4.9% in 1968 and 8.3% in 1969. Reserves and
retained earnings increased from It 16.5 million in 1967 to IZ 22.4 million in
1969. IDBI's financial position is generally sound, although its liquidity
position remains tight.
64.       The only restriction on IDBI's borrowings in relation to its equity
is contained in the first AID loan agreement, which provides that IDBI's
indebtedness should not be more than twice the share capital and surplus.
The ratio of non-current debt and guarantees to equity was 0.92:1 in 1968 and
1.06:1 in 1969. In view of IDBI's low debt to equity ratio, the Bank did not
impose any such restriction for the previous loans. However, IDBI's first AID
loan is scheduled to mature in 1972. For a new Bank loan, it would be prudent
to limit IDBI's indebtedness to not more than three times the share capital and
surplus. The draft documents for the proposed loan have been negotiated
accordingly.



- 17 -
65.       Linking Funds.  Since April 1963, IDBI has not made loans linked with
the dollar or the cost of living index. All linking increments accrued on
linked loans made before that date were cancelled effective January 1967 under
an agreement with the Government, whereby the Government undertook to compensate
ID3I for any amounts that would otherwise have become due to IDBI. Linking
increments on linked loans will remain as assets in IDBI's accounts until the
final settlement is made. Also, IDBI has index-linked assets in certain local
bonds, as well as dollar and index-linked liabilities in connection with its
shares and borrowings. The combined net balance shows a surplus of linked
assets over linked liabilities. As of December 31, 1969, the net balance in
the linking funds amounted to If 32.6 million, out of which the sum of If 28.1
million wlas earmarked to adjust the par value of the linked share capital.
66.       Dividends.  All classes of shares except Ordinary A shares carry the
right, statutory or conventional, to certain minimum rates of dividend.
Consequently, dividends have commanded a substantial share of disposable
income. IDBI has also paid dividends on Ordinary A shares at moderate rates
since 1959 and has since 1967 maintained a rate of 8.9% per annum on those
shares. Total dividends paid amounted to I£ 24.0 million or about 76%0lo of
disposable income in 1968, and I£ 19.5 million or about 78% in 1969.
67.       Reserves.  The Articles of Association require that after payment
of dividends and dividend arrears on all Preference shares, a part of
"ordinary" profit, up to 10%, must be credited to a reserve fund. There is
no lower limit, so that theoretically even a token sum can be set to reserve.
Further amounts (unspecified) may be credited to the reserve fund at two
stages: after payment of the specified dividends on Ordinary shares; and after
distribution of specified participating dividends on Preference shares. The
reserve fund may also be credited with sums from the surplus of the linking
accounts. As of December 31, 1969, the general reserve was IL 18.5 million.
68.       The following table lists the various items of reserves and shows the
reserves position in the past three years:
(I£ million)
December 31
1966       1967        1968       1969
General reserves                     11.5       13.5        16.0        18.5
Other free reserves                   0          2.5         7.0           0
Share premiums                        6.4        6.5         7.2         7.5
Capital linking fund                 33.8       36.7        33.6       32.6
Unappropriated                        1.0        0.5         0.5         3.9
Total       527         57          WI 9J7
Total reserves at If 62.5 million as of December 31, 1969, represented 6.7% of
IDBI's total portfolio.
69.       Provisions for Bad Debts.  The cumulative provisions for bad and
doubtful debts, net of amounts written off, as of December 31, 1969 were
If 8.1 million. A provision has also been made of about IL 4.5 million for



- 18 -
diminution in value of share investments. The provisions appear to be
adequate in the light of the position described below.
Quality of Portfolio
70.       As of December 31, 1969, the amount of overdue installments on loan
repayments was It 16.5 million (of which I£ 15.1 million had been in arrears
for more than a year). The amount in arrears was less than 2% of the loan
portfolio and the total principal of loans in arrears was I£ 113.1 million,
or about 12.6% of the loan portfolio (Annex 13). Legal proceedings were in
progress in respect of outstanding loans amounting to Ia 16.9 million, of
which I£ 8.3 million was guaranteed by the Government for repayment.
71.       Of the amount of I£ 16.5 million in arrears, IL 13 million was due
from one textile company, Wooltex. The loans to Wooltex were made early in
IDBI's life, and Wooltex has long been in difficulties. Its present management
was installed by IDBI in an attempt to improve its condition, but the attempt
has not been successful. IDBI is considering whether to change the management
again, or to secure the appointment of a Receiver. !rjhatever the outcome, IDBI
does not expect to lose any part of its loan. IDBI has collateral security as
well as an 80% Government guarantee.
72.       As of December 31, 1969, the total amount of loans and investments
in shares written off from provisions for bad debts was I£ 3.3 million, of
which the Government, under its guarantees, reimbursed IDBI IL 2.8 million
(Annex 14). As of the same date the Government had a deposit with IDBI of
Ir 8.4 million in respect of Government-guaranteed loans in default which were
undergoing legal proceedings.
73.       IDBI's portfolio is fairly well diversified in various industrial
fields. Bearing in mind that IDBI deliberately takes risks, within limits,
the proportion of its outstanding loans which are in trouble is not excessive.
Actual losses to ID3I are likely to be minimal, taking into account the
Government guarantees and collateral security. IDBI's portfolio is
satisfactory and its reserves and provisions are adequate.
Share Value and Audit
74.       IDBI's Ordinary A shares, Preferred Ordinary shares and the dollar-
linked Preference B, C, CC, CC1 and D shares are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange. Quoted prices on December 31, 1969, were about 70% of par (except
Preference D share which were quoted at about 90%), reflecting generally
depressed conditions in the stock market. The average book value of all
classes of shares as of the same date (including the reserve for linked share
capital) was about 117% of par.
75.       IDBI's accounts are audited by Messrs. Somekh Chaikin, Citron and
Company, a firm of independent public accountants acceptable to the Bank.
The 1969 accounts were certified by the auditors without qualification.

VI. PROSPECTS
General
76.       Industrial Investment.  The Government is now preparing an
industrial investment plan for the period through 1980.  IWhile no defini-
tive figures are yet available, the present draft envisages an average
annual growth rate of industrial output of 10.4% over the next ten years
at 1968 prices. Gross industrial investments of more than IS 16 billion
are projected for the period. This level appears feasible on the basis of
current favorable economic conditions, accomplishments in the past and the
need for replacement of the fixed capital already invested. The annual
gross investments in industry in 1970-74 are estimated as follows:
Year                       Amount (I. million)
1970                                800
1971                                900
1972                             1,000
1973                             1.150
1974                             1;350
Total          5,200
77.       IDBI's Share in Industrial Investment.  In the past, the average
amount of IDBI's financing for industrial development has been about 25% of
total industrial investment in the country, and the ratio was as high as
36% in one year. IDBI envisages the amount of its financing for the next
five years to be about the same proportion of total industrial investment
as the average in the past.
IDBI's Requirements and Resources
78.       Projections of IDBI's loan operations for the five years from
1970 through l974 appear in 'nnex 15. Sums of past and projected loan
approvals, commitments and disbursements are summarized below:
(IL million)
Approvals    Commitments    Disbursements
1967 (actual)                 176            113               80
1968 (actual)                 168            175              128
1969 (actual)                 278            230              206
1970 (estimate)               230            258              250
1971 (estimate)               230            230              245
1972 (estimate)               230            230              233
1973 (estimate)               240            236              233
1974 (estimate)               250            246              240



On the basis of these projections, IDBI will commit IS 1,200 million and
disburse the same amount over the next five years. The projected disburse-
ment of IL 1,200 million is about 23% of the projected total gross investment
in industry, or slightly less than IDBI's average share in total industrial
investment in the past.
79.       IDBI has projected loan commitments of about IS 475 million ($136
million) during the two years from July 1970 to June 1972. On the basis of
IDBI's past and present performance, the current economic outlook, the
Government's industrial investment plan and loan applications already in the
pipeline (IL 243 million, as of December 31, 1969), IDBI's projections
appear reasonable and, if resources become available, practicable.
80.       Resources projected for the same tio-year period from July 1970
to June 1972 are summarized as follows:
Equivalent in
Domestic sources                                 IL million      $ million
Government deposits, debentures, etc.              141             40
Loan collections (net) and retained earnings       105             30
Sub-total         246             70
Foreign sources
Uncommitted funds under existing agreements          51            15
New borrowings from abroad                         178             51
(of which Exim Bank)                            (28)            (8)
Sub-total          229            66
Total              475           136
Of the total resources requirements projected for the two-year period,
IS 475 million, IDBI estimates that IL 105 million will become available
from loan collections (net) and retained earmings and IL 51 million from
funds uncommitted under existing agreements with financial institutions
abroad. Thus, IDBI will have to seek additional financing from domestic
and foreign sources of around IL 319 million or US$91 million equivalent.
IDBI expects to raise I;J 141 million from domestic sources, including the
Government.  The balance, II 178 million or US$ 51 million equivalent, it
will seek from abroad. Of the amount of IS 178 million, IDBI expects to
receive I628 million or $8 million equivalent from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, of which $5 million is already under negotiation. IDBI therefore
proposes to seek IS 150 million or US$ 43 million equivalent abroad to fill
the remaining gap in its projected resource requirements.



- 21 -
81.       Assuming that imports (including the identifiable foreign exchange
component of local expenditure) constitute the same proportion of IDBI's commit-
ments in the two years ending June 1972 as in the recent past, IDBI will need
about $66 million for use in that period. The proposed Bank loan of $25 million
could therefore be used entirely to finance imported goods and services. A part
of the equipment requirements of investment enterprises can be met from goods
manufactured in Israel from imported raw materials and components; another part
can be met from off-the-shelf purchases of imported goods. It is proposed that
the foreign exchange component of such goods be financed out of the loan, and
for the sake of administrative convenience it is intended to use as the measure
of the foreign exchange component 20% of the cost of goods produced in Israel and
50% of the cost of goods produced outside Israel and purchased from local
suppliers. As usual, the loan will be subject to the 90 days restriction on the
financing of prior expenditures but in order to provide continuity of Bank finan-
cing (the second Bank loan being fully credited by January 31, 1970), the loan
documents provide that the Bank will consider applications for withdrawals
covering expenditures incurred after February 1, 1970.
Projected Income and Profitabilit
82.       Projected income statements for the five years ending December 31, 1974
are given in Annex 16. Net income is expected to grow from Ib 32.3 million in
1970, to IA 34.6 million in 1972. The ratio of profit before taxes to average
net worthi/ should be maintained at around 20% to 21% throughout 1972. With
payment of required dividends, IDBI should be able to appropriate to the reserve
account Il 7.5 million in 1970, IL 8.6 million in 1971 and IS 10 million in 1972,
amounts slightly higher than those in the past.
Projected Balance Sheet
83.       Projected balance sheets for the forecast period are presented in Annex
17. Although the current ratio is less than one throughout the projected period,
IDBI will be able to manage current requirements through the Bank of Israel's
short-term accommodation, as it has done in the past. Loan portfolio is expected
to increase to Ib 1,093.7 million in 1970 and to IL 1,320.3 million in 1972.
Pnnual rate of growth of total assets is estimated at 10.4% in 1971 and 6.5% in
1972.
Debt Service Cover
84.       On the basis of projected cash flow statements (Annex 18) and the
projected income statements (Annex 16), debt service cover would be 1.67:1 in
1970, 2.16:1 in 1971 and 2.01:1 in 1972. Because of the relatively large net
worth against debt (debt equity ratio being less than 3:1 throughout the
projected period), a sound debt service cover will be maintained during the life
of the proposed loan.

VII. CONCLWSION AND RECOENDATIONS
Conclusion
85.       Since the second Bank loan was made in 1967, IDBI has continued
to grow and to play an important role in industrial development in Israel.
Project appraisals cover all pertinent aspects and IDBI's investment
decisions are soundly based. Despite the large number of IDBI's clients,
end-use supervision is relatively satisfactory.
86.       IDBI is and will continue to be the most important financial
institution for long-term financing of industrial development in Israel and
an organization of national importance. It is closely integrated with the
commercial banking system of Israel. The Government has continued to assist
IDBI by paying in share capital, maintaining special deposits with IDBI,
guaranteeing some IDBI loans for repayment and assuming the foreign exchange
risk on IDBI's liabilities. Despite the close relationship with the Govern-
ment, IDBI's decisions in making individual loans have been independent.
Government guarantees have helped reduce the risk to IDBI on some of its
loans.
87.       IDBI is a sound development finance company and continues to be a
suitable borrower.  mBI will need additional capital of around IL 3l9
million, equivalent to about $91 million, to help meet expected demands for
financing over the next two years. It expects to obtain IL lhl million from
domestic sources, including the Government, and IL 128 million from abroad.
The shortfall is thus IL 150 million or US$ 43 million, and for this sum
IDBI is relying heavily on the Bank. The provision of $25 million towards
the shortfall would keep the pressure on IDBI to continue searching for new
capital both at home and abroad, while assuring it of resources at least
until around February 1972.
Recommendations
88.       It is recommended that the Bank make a loan to IDBI of $25 million
to help provide IDBI's estimated requirements of capital during the next two
years, on the terms usual for loans to development finance companies.
89.       In view of the quality of IDBIfs management and staff, of its
loan appraisals and of its follow-up work, the limit for projects needing
the Bank's prior approval under the proposed loan should be increased from
the current I£ 1.5 million to US$750,000 (equivalent to IL 2.6 million).
The amount of the free limit should be designated in U.S. dollars, as is
usual for development finance companies. Even with this increased free
limit, the Bank's prior approval would be required in about one-half by
value of IDBI's loans using Bank funds, judging from the size distribution
of IDBI's past operation. To assure that the Bank will review an adequate



- 23 -
number of projects, however, it is recommended that withdrawals from the
loan account without the Bank's prior approval should not exceed an aggregate
limit of 50% of the amount of the proposed loan.
90.       The debt-to-equity ratio as calculated under the definition now
usually applied to development finance companies should be applied to IDBI
under the proposed loan and the ratio should be set at 3:1.
