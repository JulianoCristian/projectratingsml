PROJ.,TF023560-NORWEGIAN GRANT FOR ENVIRONMENT\n            - ASTEN,TF028184-REG. SECONDMENT ANTHROPOLOGIST (ASTHR)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4008", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated unsatisfactory.\n            What is most striking about the data is the lack of linkage\n            between development investments and conservation of\n            biodiversity, the major focus of the project. Data presented\n            in Annex 10 show that during the project period (1995-2001)\n            the greatest rate of forest loss during the project was in\n            the Kabupatens Kerinci and Solok which received the largest\n            proportion of Village Conservation Grants (VCGs). This\n            indicates that the linkage between village/district level\n            activities and biodiversity conservation failed. A key\n            constraint throughout project implementation has been poor\n            and indifferent coordination and collaboration between\n            different agencies within the Ministry of Forestry. The\n            overall sustainability of the project is rated as\n            \"unlikely\" mainly because of the lack of regular\n            budget and insufficient institutional capacity to implement\n            the management plan. The Bank's performance in project\n            identification and design was unsatisfactory. Supervision\n            performance was satisfactory. Overall Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory. The Borrower's overall performance is\n            rated as unsatisfactory also, mainly because of overall\n            project management and supervision. A number of lessons was\n            learned or reinforced during the implementation of the\n            project. Some of the most important were: 1) The project was\n            probably overly complex, with too many activities and\n            institutions involved and no overall coordination. 2) The\n            original project design was an ambitious attempt to\n            integrate the national park and conservation objectives\n            within regional and spatial planning. As preparation\n            continued, the emphasis evolved away from major development\n            planning to a focus on small-scale village development based\n            on the (flawed) assumption that poverty and the lack of\n            alternative livelihoods were driving deforestation and\n            agricultural encroachment into the park (they might have\n            been a contributing factor, but were not the main one). 3)\n            There was never any commitment from the Bank to a\n            multi-phased project (e.g., as might have been achieved via\n            an Adaptable Program Loan) nor was any real strategy\n            developed to ensure that provincial/kabupaten governments\n            could sustain integrated activities beyond the\n            project's lifetime. 4) An overall institutional\n            analysis was not undertaken as part of project design.\n            Budget flows and delays in budget delivery were a serious\n            constraint (which will be further exacerbated by the new\n            Presidential Decree (Kepres 42) which prevents multi-year\n            budgeting. 5) Changing the behavior of societies is complex\n            and slow, and understanding the incentives for certain types\n            of behavior is of key importance. Where forests are also\n            under threat from outsiders, unenforceable covenants of\n            uncertain value are unlikely to be successful. One\n            conclusion is that the same conservation benefits might have\n            been achieved by a simpler project design focusing on\n            interventions in all 460 villages and more directly\n            concerned with conservation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
