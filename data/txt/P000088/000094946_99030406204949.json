There are four major lessons emerged from the\n            project: a) Strong government commitment and participation\n            in the design and implementation of a Public Enterprise (PE)\n            Reform Program is a sine qua non condition to the success of\n            reforms. b) In 1985-86, when the project was being prepared,\n            the approach to PE reform centered around restructuring and\n            strengthening PE management and financial performance, while\n            maintaining them in the State portfolio. In retrospect, the\n            Bank should have included privatization and private sector\n            participation in the project objectives instead of focusing\n            solely on rehabilitating viable PEs and liquidating\n            non-viable ones. c) An efficient project implementing agency\n            played a key role in the design and implementation of the\n            Divestiture Program. d) The inability of project funds to\n            cover the severance pay resulting from the liquidation of\n            PEs was one of the major causes of delays in closing\n            liquidations. e) Consensus building and public information\n            campaigns to seek support of stakeholders and civil society\n            should have been an integral part of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
