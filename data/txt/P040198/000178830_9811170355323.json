The project consists\n            of three components. First, community-based subprojects will\n            support pre-investment feasibility studies for small-scale\n            infrastructure and services subprojects, such as schools,\n            health posts, water supply, sanitation and latrine systems,\n            bridges, and cultural heritage. Second, community training\n            will provide training for beneficiaries, and local staff of\n            line ministries and municipalities. Third, institutional\n            development will support consultancies to promote\n            participatory planning, women's participation in FIS\n            subprojects. It will also finance the decentralization of\n            the FIS operation."}, "docdt": "1998-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
