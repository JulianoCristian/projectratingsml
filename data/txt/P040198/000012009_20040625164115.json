The rapid response by\n            Social Investment Fund or FIS, and the Bank to the damage\n            caused by Hurricane Mitch onto transportation\n            infrastructure, showed the effective role social funds play\n            in emergency situations, due to their unique design and\n            procedures, able in addition, to invest in community\n            infrastructure, fostering employment opportunities. Specific\n            to the project experience, lessons convey the FIS was one of\n            the better-rated institutions in the country regarding the\n            effectiveness of poverty targeting. However, FIS lacks\n            adequate coordination with other funds, and particularly\n            with line ministries. Because FIS has traditionally focused\n            on the provision of basic infrastructure, it would be\n            beneficial to increase investments in training and\n            strengthening community organizations, with investments\n            related to income generation activities, in some promising\n            areas such as agro-forestry. It is important to note that,\n            while one of the main indicators used by Bank management,\n            was the level of disbursement, as learned in this project\n            (and even being a high performing project), attention should\n            be paid to under-performing aspects, for although financing\n            may not be large, may well have the potential to enhance\n            subproject sustainability."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
