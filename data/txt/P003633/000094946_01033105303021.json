The Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, having provided substantial advice to the\n            Government on cost-based tariffs, and, the Borrower's\n            performance is assessed as highly satisfactory, given the\n            outstanding performance of implementing agencies,\n            particularly regarding the timely procurement\n            implementation. Lessons address primarily, the extensive\n            interaction between the Bank, and the Government to achieve\n            the policy action plan, based on a comprehensive sector\n            study, which fostered sector reforms in an open dialogue\n            with stakeholders, leading to the success of the project.\n            The dramatic achievements made by China in sector\n            performance, within the current competitive, market-driven\n            economy environment, led the Government to recognize the\n            crucial need for institutional, and legal framework, in\n            attaining sector reforms, through the Bank's\n            assistance. The borrower not only strictly complied with the\n            Bank procurement guidelines, facilitating speedy\n            procurement/disbursement processes, but motivated an\n            absorbing capacity, to benefit from the technical assistance\n            provided to accelerate sector reforms. This unquestionably\n            contributed to the expansion of telecommunication networks\n            in rural areas, and secured, in part, financing for the\n            investment plan, aimed at reaching a hundred percent coverage."}, "docdt": "2001-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
