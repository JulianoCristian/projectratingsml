      towards allocation of resources on the basis of market\n            forces.  The project will include priority tasks that are\n            part of an agreed Medium Term Policy Action Program of\n            sector reform for 1994-97, thus helping develop conditions\n            for increasing competition and private participation.  The\n            government expects the reforms will enable sustained rapid\n            sector development as needed to overcome widespread\n            telecommunications shortages which result in high costs\n            throughout the economy and impede effective implementation\n            of development programs in other productive and social\n            sectors.  In the course of helping the government achieve\n            these objectives, the project will finance investments in\n            modern technology for fiber optic long distance links\n            connecting eleven provinces and local digital switching in\n            three provinces."}, "docdt": "1994-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
