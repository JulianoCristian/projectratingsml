Municipal\n            Finance Project for Morocco were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. The lessons learned include: issues of\n            municipal finance are better addressed within the context of\n            municipal management projects that assume a balanced\n            approach to simultaneous development of a local finance\n            framework, municipal capacity and matching capacity with a\n            specialized lending intermediary. Decentralization reforms\n            can be slow to implement, and projects should provide\n            sufficient capacity building assistance to municipalities to\n            increase their creditworthiness and support continual\n            development of bankable investments. Successful performance\n            of municipal finance markets and financial intermediaries\n            depend to a large extent on the \"enabling\n            controls\" of the regulating authorities. Therefore, a\n            project seeking to increase municipal investment through\n            access to long-term credit should explicitly address the\n            rationalization of administrative control procedures between\n            the: (a) local governments and other public agencies; (b)\n            central government; and (c) financial intermediary. The\n            project highlighted the negative effect on municipal\n            investment efficiency of excessive ex-ante controls over the\n            activities of local authorities and long approval delays\n            they face when borrowing from Fonds d'Equipment\n            communal (FEC). There is a need to include financing for\n            monitoring and evaluation activities to adequately assess\n            the impact sub-projects have on local communities. Local\n            governments in cooperation with central governments should\n            perform such activities. Municipalities differ both in terms\n            of financial resource levels and management capacity. The\n            Government expressed a legitimate concern that in order to\n            achieve the country's poverty reduction goals, small\n            and/or poor municipalities should receive special treatment\n            and targeted funding that cannot be offered by the market.\n            Guidance should be provided on a case-by-case basis, and\n            funding tailored to meet specific poverty and equity\n            objectives of small- and medium-sized local governments."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
