First Manpower Development Project\n            will help alleviate current and projected shortages of\n            skilled and semi-skilled workers in the industrial and\n            health sectors as well as improve training programs for\n            public and private sector managers. The project includes:\n            (i) constructing, equipping and furnishing four trade\n            training centers, extensions to two existing trade training\n            centers, a new occupational safety and health institute;\n            (ii) equipping a management training institute; (iii)\n            providing fellowships and expert-services for introducing\n            new disciplines, developing curriculum, establishing\n            training organization techniques as well as enhancing\n            management training programs. The project will strengthen\n            Jordan's manpower development system. It is expected to\n            benefit about 2,000 trainees per year, mostly from urban and\n            rural low-income groups, by enhancing their opportunity for\n            employment. The project does not involve any special risks."}, "docdt": "1985-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
