A\n            number of external factors had considerable impact on this\n            project. Political instability that led to the resignation\n            of four governments within the time-frame of the\n            implementation had a substantial detrimental impact on the\n            implementation of the highly politicized enterprise reform\n            program. The key lessons drawn from the project: 1)\n            State-owned enterprise reform is extremely difficult to\n            achieve even in the best of circumstances and requires years\n            of dedicated effort and a highly committed government. 2)\n            Projects need to be designed for the desired output, not\n            just to provide a core input with the \"hope\" that\n            this will lead to the output. 3) Twinning can be an\n            effective methodology for the transfer of technical skills,\n            especially when the recipient institution has a clear idea\n            and strong interest in what they want out of the\n            arrangements. 4) Any project activities that are intended to\n            be \"pilots\" should really be set up as such, with\n            provision for a joint WBG-client review and dissemination of\n            the \"pilot experience\" built into the project design."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
