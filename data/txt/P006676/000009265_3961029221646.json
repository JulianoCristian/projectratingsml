The Secano's\n            diverse and fragile resource base, along with a lack of\n            effective regional poverty alleviation strategies, argues\n            for a project which can validate alternative development\n            approaches. The heterogeneity of Secano conditions call for\n            a micro-regional approach starting with pilot-scale\n            sub-projects in representative areas to test the\n            technological, social and institutional actions considered\n            to be most likely to succeed. The project will develop\n            viable strategies which will: a) improve natural resource\n            management to reverse soil degradation and establish\n            sustainable production systems; and b) expand off-farm\n            economic activities and improve economic infrastructure to\n            diversify income sources and boost regional development. The\n            results of the micro-regional endeavors will serve as\n            economically viable and environmentally sound models for\n            possible eventual larger government-funded programs,\n            covering a greater area of Secano. Project components will\n            be: a) natural resource management and sustainable\n            development; b) off-farm poverty alleviation; c) support\n            services; d) technical assistance; e) land title\n            regularization; and f) studies."}, "docdt": "1995-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
