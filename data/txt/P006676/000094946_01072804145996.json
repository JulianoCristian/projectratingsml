Some\n            lessons learned from the implementation of the project\n            include: 1) The project ratified the validity of the\n            proposal to tackle poverty through an improvement in both\n            agricultural and non-agricultural activities. 2) The\n            development of non-agricultural activities needs to be based\n            on detailed feasibility studies, especially concerning the\n            marketing of output which should be incorporated into the\n            analysis from the earliest stage of identification and\n            preparation. 3) Sub-project proposals presented for\n            financing should be subject to strict selection criteria\n            which puts emphasis on the quality of the analysis of the\n            technical, economic, and social viability of the proposals.\n            4) An integrated approach must be made to farm development.\n            Land degradation must be approached from the perspective of\n            the farm as a whole, rather than from that of individual\n            crops, and sustainable production systems must be defined\n            and introduced according to farm's capabilities. 5) The\n            tendency in this pilot project was to concentrate on-farm\n            development efforts on those aspects of the production\n            system likely to produce short-term benefits, to the\n            detriment of natural resource conservation activities that\n            have longer-term returns."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
