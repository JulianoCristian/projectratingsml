                         The project has a two-pronged development objective: (i) improving irrigation service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable increase in
                         irrigated agricultural productivity; and (ii) improving national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The WMIP is designed to achieve its' objectives through three project components: (i) Component 1: Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to secure the water
                         supply to around 85,000 ha ; (ii) Component 2: Management of water resources to achieve sustainable and efficient water resources management through implementation of the
                         Water Code, support to the State Committee for Water Resources and Land Improvement (SCWRLI) and support to Water Users Associations (WUAs) ; (iii) Component 3:
                         Organization of beneficiaries, supporting the formation and development of WUA Federations and the transfer of minor irrigation schemes to WUAs, thereby alleviating some of the

                         pressures on the SCWRLI to operate and maintain these systems.

                         The implementation of the project has been too slow to achieve the objectives before the project closing date of December 31, 2012. Under Component 1, rehabilitation works have
                         been delayed due to the 2010 events in the south, under-resourced contractors and shortcomings in the construction planning/supervision process. If the project is not extended, it is

                         expected that around 6 schemes, benefiting 80,000 water users, will only be partially completed. This would have serious negative consequences, as Government will probably lack
                         the financial resources to complete the schemes, and incomplete schemes would have inadequate water delivery to the targeted beneficiaries, and are prone to be damaged by
                         uncontrolled water flows.

                         Under Component 2, in spite of earlier assurances, the implementation of the Water Code remains constrained by the fact that the Government has not yet convened the National
                         Water Council (NWC) to give essential policy guidance on the institutional organization of the water sector. It was expected in April 2012 that this would be resolved with the new
                         Government in place, and a date for convening the NWC had been set, but changes at the ministerial level in September 2012 delayed the NWC meeting. A new date has now been
                         tentatively agreed for January 2013.

                         Under Component 3 good progress has been made. Most notably, equipment to manage and maintain irrigation systems managed by WUA Federations (including both off-farm and
                         on-farm infrastructure) has been purchased and transferred to the Federations, and is currently being used for system maintenance.

                         Since the project is projected to finalize all construction works by September 2013 only, a project extension is currently being considered.
