I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       Country. The Kyrgyz Republic covers 200,000 km² of mostly mountainous land at
altitudes ranging from 400 m to 7,400 m ASL out of which less than 8% (1.4 million ha)
are arable and just 5% forested. Forty percent of the country’s territory is above 3,000 m
and one third of it is under permanent snow cover. With a population of 5.2 million in 2006
at the time of appraisal, the Kyrgyz Republic achieved a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of
US$ 2.4 billion, corresponding to US$ 460 per capita. In 2006, 77% of its population had
access to an improved water source, 48% lived below the poverty line, and 64% in rural
areas at a poverty level significantly higher than in urban areas. The Kyrgyz Republic is
geographically and culturally divided into North and South where the three oblasts of the
Fergana Valley have a distinct regional identity vis-à-vis the North. The southern regions
are also affected by smaller land holdings, lower per capita incomes, higher unemployment,
lower human development indices and more limited access to services.
2.       Agriculture. During the past ten years, the agricultural sector consistently
contributed around 35% to the GDP and ensured employment for over 50 percent of the
working population. Irrigated agriculture is estimated to cover about 1.1 million ha (80%
of total arable land), rendering it as one of the most important economic sub-sectors of the
country. The most profitable crops were vegetables, cotton, and sugar beet, but wheat was
most popular and widespread because of its importance as a subsistence crop, and its use as
collateral within the traditional barter system. Crop yields are at a low to moderate level.
3.       Water Resources. The Kyrgyz Republic is well endowed with water resources.
While there are no inflows from other countries, all river basins except for Issyk-Kul are
shared with neighboring states located downstream. Snowfall constitutes a significant part
of the total precipitation, and snow storage plays an important role by delaying runoff and
thus preserving the water for the agricultural growing season. Total annual runoff is in the
order of 47 billion m³ of which the Kyrgyz Republic could use a maximum of 12 billion m³
under international agreements with its neighbors. Up to 90% of these 12 billion m³ was
used for agriculture, 7% for industry, and 3% for other needs, including potable water.
4.       There were many organizations involved in the water sector, the most important one
being the Department of Water Resources and Land Improvement (DWRLI), but also the
Environmental Protection Department, Hydrogeology Department, Hydro-meteorological
Service, State Water Inspectorate, Bulk Water Suppliers, and Water Users Associations
(WUAs). Significant overlap and duplication of water resources management functions
contributed to a degree of confusion on the institutional location, roles and responsibilities
of the respective organizations. This was a legacy of the Water Code that was adopted in
1994 and at that time did not yet address the fragmented water resources management, and
data sharing arrangements that remained at Independence in 1991.
5.       In early 2005, a new Water Code was signed into legislation. This Water Code of
2005 is a comprehensive and modern piece of legislation that reflects best practice and
international experience. It includes recognized basic principles, such as integrated water
resources management; the recognition of the economic value of water; the consolidation of
water resources stewardship functions under a new, single apex government water
administration, supervised by a high-level council of senior government officials providing


                                              1
policy direction; the organization of water resources management along river basin lines;
the polluter pays; and the participation of users in decision-making. However, many parts
of this Water Code were not implemented as intended or were not sufficiently considered,
such as the provision for a system of transparent, legally grounded relationships between
the provider of bulk irrigation water and related services, and an emerging growing body of
irrigation water users and service customers.
6.       Irrigation. Irrigation has been practiced in the Kyrgyz Republic for generations.
The irrigated area comprises a total of 631 irrigation schemes ranging in size from 100 to
over 50,000 ha of which approximately 430 schemes totaling 147,000 ha are each less than
1,000 ha in size. The DWRLI of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Improvement
(MOALI) has been mandated with the management, operation and maintenance (MOM) of
the diversion structures and the main and inter-farm canals supplying on-farm systems.
7.       Due to technical, managerial, and financial constraints since independence,
deterioration of irrigation and drainage infrastructure has led to unreliable supply and
distribution of irrigation water, as well as drainage and water logging problems. In March
2002, the Resolution of 1997 allowing the formation of WUAs and for the transfer of on-
farm irrigation infrastructure to WUAs was upgraded and passed into law, forming a solid
base for the transfer of responsibility at the on-farm level. Some of the smaller irrigation
schemes with independent diversion structures were since then transferred to WUAs, and
already then there was considerable interest to form federations of WUA (FWUAs).
8.       Rationale for Bank involvement. During the last eight years preceding the appraisal
of the Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP), the World Bank had been the
principal donor to assist the Kyrgyz Government in the development of the irrigation sub-
sector. The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (IRP) and the On-Farm Irrigation Project (OIP-
1) contributed significantly to the recovery of the sub-sector, but could not come close to
satisfying existing needs. The projects met the immediate needs of Government through a
major focus on rehabilitation of irrigation systems and to a lesser extent on the much
needed institutional reform. The World Bank-financed projects have been the catalyst for
the development of legislation, including the Law on WUAs of 2002 and the Water Code of
2005. The Bank’s involvement in WMIP was considered to be crucial for continued
coherent design and implementation of its Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management
Program. A principal contribution from the Bank was to bring in considerable world-wide
and regional experience in the development of integrated water resources management
institutions, including the provision of training programs. Development interventions in the
Kyrgyz Republic were guided by the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), which
emphasized priority objectives to which the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) were closely linked. The WMIP was designed to contribute to the CAS objectives of
stemming the deterioration of key infrastructure with local communities having a voice in
setting priorities’ and ‘addressing governance constraints including increasing transparency,
accountability and capacity building at all levels’.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
9.       The project had a two-pronged development objective: (i) improving irrigation
service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable increase in irrigated
agricultural productivity; and (ii) improving national water resource governance for the
benefit of water users and the nation as a whole. Key performance indicators included: (i)
at least 90% of agreed irrigation services fee (ISF) tariff within two years after completion


                                             2
of the project’s rehabilitation works collected; (ii) at least 80% of the project schemes
judged to be properly operated and maintained following completion of rehabilitation
works; (iii) number of WUAs receiving water at the requested level in each period of
delivery each year; (iv) evidence of high satisfaction rates among water users with the
performance of the bulk water supply agency (DWRLI); (v) increase in crop yields by at
least 10% within four years after scheme rehabilitation; and (vi) quantities of water used for
various purposes as per approved river basin plans.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
10.     The PDO has not been changed during the project. The results framework was
formally revised in a Level-2 restructuring in June 2013 to reflect actual progress and
possible achievements. The need for corrective restructuring resulted from poor
performance due to significant implementation delays. Revisions regarding the key
outcome indicators including the rationale for change are presented in Table 1. All other
key outcome indicators remained as established in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
albeit a number of intermediate outcome indicators were adjusted to an extended project
completion date of 30 November 2013 as follows:
         18 systems ready to supply the requested water volume at WUA off-take;
         2 river basin plans prepared and approved;
         Delegation of State Water Administration (SWA) authority to DWRLI approved
           by Government;
         SWA functions, staffing and budget prepared and approved by Government;
         National Water Strategy prepared and submitted to National Water Council
           (NWC);
         14 MOM plans prepared and implemented;
         30 minor irrigation schemes transferred to WUAs; and
         10 WUAF own maintenance equipment and use it effectively.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.    The primary target groups identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO were
40,000 farm families who would have irrigated about 85,000 ha of productive agricultural


                                                          3
land. They were expected to benefit from the project through rehabilitation and
modernization of their irrigation schemes, through improvement of irrigation service
delivery, through support in operation and maintenance (O&M) of their schemes, and
through assistance in further improving the performance of WUAs and organizing those in
federations where and when appropriate. The second group of beneficiaries included a large
number of civil servants from the Government in Bishkek (particularly from the DWRLI)
as well as from raions where irrigation schemes are rehabilitated and modernized. Private
consulting and construction companies are also expected to benefit from the project through
know-how transfer and assistance in carrying out their assignments and contracts.
1.5 Original Project Components
12.      The PDO was to be achieved by four project components: (i) rehabilitation and
modernization of irrigation infrastructure; (ii) management of water resources; (iii)
organization of beneficiaries; and (iv) project management.
13.      Component 1: Rehabilitation and Modernization of Irrigation Infrastructure
(US$ 19.8 million). Component 1 aimed to contribute to achieving the first part of the PDO,
improving irrigation service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable
increase in irrigated agricultural productivity. Twenty priority irrigation and drainage
(I&D) schemes were selected for rehabilitation, with several potential rehabilitation
schemes in reserve. A wide range of rehabilitation works were proposed to overcome the
persisting irrigation water supply problems, such as construction or repair of headworks;
construction or repair of sediment settling basins and ejectors; repair or replacement of
canal lining, and the like. The implementation/completion of these works was expected to
result in the provision of a more reliable water supply to irrigators and other water users
through reduced leakage of water from canals, better water management, with reduced
operational losses, reduced MOM requirements and the prevention of catastrophic failure of
structures. For irrigation schemes situated along trans-boundary rivers, the design work
included the preparation of river basin management plans to fully understand the water
sharing agreements and determine the physical needs to be able to properly measure water
flows and abstractions. Services for design and construction supervision by a team of
national and international consultants were intended to carry out construction works of
good quality in a timely manner.
14.      Component 2: Management of Water Resources (US$ 4.85 million). This
component was to achieve the second part of the PDO, improving national water resources
governance for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole. The main tasks to be
accomplished included: (i) implementing the Water Code; (ii) improving DWRLI’s
technical and financial performance, turning it into an efficient and client-orientated bulk
water supply and management organization; (iii) supporting further WUA development;
and (iv) implementation of information and dissemination programs. A broad range of
institutional measures were proposed to strengthen water sector organizations through
organizational restructuring, training and capacity building, and improved financial
management and costing of actual sectoral financial requirements and derived benefits.
Implementation of this component was supported by consulting services, and by the
provision of goods, mainly office equipment, civil works, and incremental operating costs
for the SWA. The National Water Council (NWC) was to provide policy directions for the
water sub-sector, and to establish and support the SWA, the River Basin Councils (RBCs)
and the Basin Water Administrations (BWAs). The project was further to support


                                             4
preparation of a National Water Strategy and Basin Water Plans. Key hydro-meteorological
measuring stations were to be repaired and modern procedures established for data
collection, processing, analysis, and distribution. The project was also to assist the DWR in
carrying out a detailed study to establish the required MOM budgets for different types of
irrigation systems and to establish the current and future financial requirements of the
DWRLI. This was supposed to be facilitated through the improvement of DWRLI’s
management information system (MIS).
15.      The project further intended to support WUAs through the improvement of on-farm
water management by establishment of four demonstration plots in each oblast which were
planned to be also used as a focus for other extension services, e.g. by the Rural Advisory
Services (RAS) to support improved crop husbandry and crop production. It was also
planned to disseminate content and implications of the Water Code to all stakeholders in
the water sub-sector and to carry out capacity building in integrated water resources
management through study tours as well as in-country exchange visits to successful project
activities.
16.      Component 3: Organization of Beneficiaries (US$ 2.50 million). Under this
component, the project was to support the formation and development of at least five pilot
FWUAs with a view to fully understand the processes and ascertain the viability of the
envisaged irrigation management transfer. Each of the pilot FWUAs was to be provided
with critical maintenance equipment, such as an excavator backhoe, a tractor with blade
and trailers, and a truck. For minor irrigation schemes with less than 1,000 ha irrigable area,
the project was to provide technical support to establish the desirability and feasibility of
transferring the entire system to management by WUAs. While the immediate benefit for
the farmers was expected to be improved water supply, the long-term success of the project
was to be measured by the impact that it will have on the livelihoods of its beneficiaries,
such as better water management and crop husbandry through technical advice, as well as
credit, input supply and marketing support.
17.      Component 4: Project Management (US$ 0.99 million). Under this component,
funding for the staffing and operation of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), integrated
within the DWRLI was provided so that project implementation could be carried out in a
timely and effective manner. Additional to new recruitments, some qualified staff from the
OIP PIU, was to be transferred to the WMIP PIU to ensure daily project management,
including procurement and financial management right from project beginning. This
component also provided the means for monitoring and evaluation /M&E) consultants and
an independent audit of project accounts
1.6 Revised Components
18.    None of the components have been revised throughout project duration.
1.7 Other Significant Changes
19.    No change in project design but in scope and scale has taken place. Implementation
arrangements and work plans needed to be adjusted to slow project progress1 which led to
the two level 2 extensions of the project up to November 30, 2013 and a reduction from 20


1
  Due to under-resourced contractors, underestimated construction periods for sites at remote locations, and
the events in the South in 2010.


                                                      5
to 14 I&D schemes as well as of from 85,000 ha to 70,300 ha irrigated area. Two Level-2
restructurings in February 2011 and November 2012 extended the project closing date from
December 31, 2011 to November 30, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
20.      Lessons learned elsewhere but also and particularly in IDA funded projects (IRP
and OIP-1) were well considered: Above all, weak maintenance due to an ever low DWRLI
MOM budget and low Irrigation Service Fees (ISFs). Therefore, special attention was given
to supporting Water Users Associations (WUAs) through advisory services and the
provision of equipment, training to WUAs’ representatives and key staff, convening
workshops, and technical backstopping by specialists – always emphasizing the crucial
importance of adequate MOM budgets for sustainability purposes. At project preparation,
stakeholder workshops were held in Bishkek as well as in the oblasts, benefiting from
active participation of rather motivated participants. The objectives and tasks of WMIP
were explained and the intended scope of rehabilitation works was discussed and agreed
upon. Farmers showed a high level of interest in these meetings and attended them in large
numbers. For many years, the DWRLI had been under-funded severely limiting its ability
to provide adequate services to WUAs and farmers. The project design recognized that the
Government consistently allocated insufficient funds to MOM for off-farm irrigation
infrastructure. Together with the very low ISFs paid by water users, these two sources of
funding barely reached 50% of the funds needed for adequate and effective MOM. It was
acknowledged that a significantly larger budget should be made available for off-farm
MOM, and that ISF rates should be increased, instead of being maintained at very low
levels by the Parliament.
21.      The project design further correctly recognized that to reform DWRLI’s technical
and financial performance, turning it into an efficient and client-orientated bulk water
supply and management organization, it would be necessary to continue rebuilding and
considerably enlarging DWRLI’s capacity to undertake adequate operation and
maintenance of higher-order physical infrastructure, such as head works and inter-farm
irrigation canals, as well as the timely delivery of irrigation water on demand.
22.      The selection and prioritization of irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated took place
in close collaboration with WUAs, water users not organized in a WUA, and Government
officials form the Raion Department of Water Resources (RDWR). Applying a multi-
criteria analysis to the many more irrigation schemes requested for rehabilitation, 20
schemes were eventually ranked for implementation (with an additional 12 schemes as a
reserve) but later reduced to 16 schemes due to increased construction costs.
23.      At project design, two major risks were rated as being moderate and substantial,
respectively, while they proved to be substantial and high. They included:
          Certain resistance to be expected from agencies and departments when reforms
            start affecting their mandate and staffing - considered to be ‘moderate’ but
            eventually proving ‘substantial’; and
          Government does not provide sufficient budget for adequate MOM of higher-
            order infrastructure on a continuing basis to supplement ISF collected from
            users considered to be ‘substantial’ but eventually being ‘high’.



                                              6
24.     The risk mitigation measures planned, such as implementing the reforms in a
gradual manner with full involvement of affected stakeholders, or the maintenance of
continuous contact with Government officials and water users, did not achieve the desired
impact.
2.2 Implementation
25.      A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was prepared at the beginning of the project
aiming at specifying implementation modalities and schedules. However, the many
unforeseen events (two revolutions, several national elections and the civil unrest in the
Ferghana Valley) soon put the action plan defined in the PIP in jeopardy. The project faced
implementation delays due to a number of reasons, including the inability of the DWRLI to
adhere to canal schedule closures to enable the contractors to do the work, weaknesses in
construction supervision and management, and procurement delays. Eventually, these
events contributed to the project not completing the planned activities within the scheduled
project period. The most serious handicap for the successful implementation of the project
was the postponement in the convening of the NWC and the establishment of the SWA.
26.      Component 1. The scheduled works comprised the rehabilitation of 14 off-farm
irrigation schemes, the upgrading of an inter-canal transfer, and the rehabilitation of a
storage dam. The total command area of the 14 off-farm-irrigation systems was estimated at
70,300 ha which supplied water to about 41,100 households (corresponding to some
352,000 people). Due to the rapid deterioration of some off-farm systems and the poor
social situation prevailing in remote districts, the priority list of schemes to be rehabilitated
was amended. These amendments were initiated by local authorities. Priority schemes were
revised for two Oblasts, namely Batken and Jalalabad. All amendments were agreed with
the DWRLI management in Bishkek, governors of Oblasts, Akims, and representatives of
the DWRLI oblast offices. 24 minor irrigation schemes, and five hydro-posts on Chu and
Talas rivers, respectively, were repaired as planned. Rehabilitation works faced significant
cost increases, under-resourced contractors and shortcomings in procurement and
supervision, and were further delayed due to the 2010 events in the South. Additionally,
long cold winters in 2007/2008 and 2011/2012 as well as the long wet spring in 2009 did
not allow civil works to be carried out as planned. Fourteen off-farm irrigation schemes
have been rehabilitated and modernized by 30 November 2013.
27.      One of the major reason leading to construction delays does not refer to external
events not foreseen but rather inadequate contract management practice, both within the
PIU and the supervising engineering consultants. There was a lack of adequate formal
correspondence among all parties involved to address irregularities and shortcomings in
time. There was no proper assessment of delays, extra works, variations, contractor
performance, and actions being taken to expedite the works. Although these shortcomings
were well recognized during the regular implementation supervision missions, the proposed
correcting measures did not significantly improve the situation, regardless of restructuring
efforts and additional implementation time of two years. Eventually, the most serious
shortcoming is seen in the fact that the main off-farm infrastructure rehabilitated under the
project is not being properly maintained and operated by the DWRLI - as evidenced by the
reported poor technical conditions of the off-farm structures rehabilitated under the
previous IRP.
28.      Component 2. Under this component, the project wanted to support “Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM)” through institutional reform and the establishment


                                               7
of rules and regulations for the implementation of the Water Law, and thus contribute to
adequate water resources management at national level. According to stipulations inscribed
in the Water Code, recommendations pertaining to the restructuring and/or establishment of
government agencies for water resources management, such as the creation of the SWA,
the BWAs, and the River Basin Councils (RBCs) could only be implemented following
directions of the NWC whose members are representatives of key ministries and state
committees. Not convening the NWC was a direct breach of the WMIP Development Grant
Agreement (DGA). When in late 2011, the Government had still not convened the NWC as
a result of frequent changes in government associated with changes in the senior manage-
ment of the DWRLI, the Bank requested the immediate preparation of an NWC meeting.
After discussions with the Minister of MOALI, it was agreed that MOALI will take the
lead in establishing a Working Group which will prepare the agenda and the documentation
for the meeting of the National Water Council. This was eventually done and 11 ministries
were informed about the NWC meeting by end of March 2011. In spite of this positive
reaction from the Minister, the NWC meeting had still not taken place at the end of 2012.
29.     Following yet another government ministerial reshuffle, a second project extension
by another year, and the Bank informing the Government of considering the suspension of
Component 2 and delaying the preparation of a follow on project, the NWC chaired by the
Prime Minister eventually convened in February 2013. Thus, by continuously insisting on
the government(s) to convene the NRC meeting, the actual achievement under this
component was eventually the late adoption of a comprehensive road map for further
development of the water sector and the implementation of the Water Code as well as of
resolutions giving the DWRLI the mandate of the State Water Administration (SWA) as a
pre-cursor to establishing the SWA as an independent agency.
30.     Another contra-productive development was the unauthorized demobilization by the
international consulting firm at the beginning of December 2011 with many deliverables
still pending. Consequently, three international short-term consultants were recruited to
salvage whatever could be salvaged. They adequately assisted the PIU in contributing to
water resources management and the establishment of the SWA, carried out maintenance
and MOM studies of sample I&D schemes, and economic studies of pump irrigation
schemes.
31.     With regard to institutional reforms, the same international consulting firm assisted
the PIU to establish two pilot Basin Water Councils (BWCs) and two basin development
plans, one for the Talas river basin in 2008 and one for the Kugart river basin in 2009,
defining their functions, duties and responsibilities, and developing organizational
procedures, staffing and budgets for BWAs. Although the two pilot river basin plans were
formally approved in a workshop by rather passive participants and local authorities, no
follow-up activities took place. A critical shortcoming was that 200 MOM plans were
scheduled to be prepared (out of which 175 plans to be implemented) but only four MOM
Plans were eventually finalized but not approved, thus not implemented. This was due to
the over-optimistic assumptions made at appraisal on the one hand, and additionally a
consequence of the firm’s inexperienced specialist on the other hand, who was eventually
replaced by another one with little MOM experience as well. The preparation of a draft
National Water Strategy (NWS) was also poor. It went through several iterations, but the
final draft version was not deemed satisfactory by the international specialist brought in
following the firm’s departure.



                                             8
32.     One of the recruited three international specialists eventually provided guidance and
support to the DWRLI on MOM as required, but there was no time anymore left for imple-
mentation, now expected to be realized under the proposed National Water Resources
Management Project-Phase 1 (NWRMP-1). Very low ISFs were paid by 80% of water
users but they need to be increased significantly to cover some 30% of DWRLI’s O&M
expenditures which are estimated to be US$ 18.50/ha.
33.     Concerning the planned web-based Water Information System (WIS), hardware and
software were purchased and installed in the head offices of DWR and BWA and a
contractor identified to develop the network. No further action was completed by end of
project on 30 November 2013. A study tour was made to Spain and Portugal for 10 persons
in November 2012 to learn about water resources management processes and farmer
involvement in irrigation management.
34.     Component 3. The project supported the formation and development of 10 pilot
FWUAs with the aim of understanding the processes and determining the viability of
transferring off-farm irrigation systems to water user organizations. At last in 2012,
machinery and equipment was bought and given to the 10 FWUAs as a ‘technical credit’,
although credit agreements still remain to be signed, by April 2014. In October 2012, 24
minor irrigation systems were transferred from DWR to WUAs and FWUAs.
35.     Following the transfer of the minor irrigation schemes to WUAs and FWUAs, it
was evident that there was a significant improvement in water supply as well as an increase
in the amount of water fees collected from water users, on top of the Government-set ISF.
With an increase in the MOM budget, the FWUAs were able to increase expenditure on the
repair and maintenance of off-farm infrastructure. An overall increase in the crop yields
within the command area was also noted but could not be quantified on the basis of
available (very short) records. It is too early to evaluate the full impact of the WMIP off-
farm rehabilitation works on irrigated areas, and consequently the overall impact on crop
yields (see also Annex 3).
36.     Mid-Term Review. In November 2009, a Mid-Term Review was carried out. It
concluded that there was no need to restructure the project, that components were still
relevant and that there was a high likelihood that the three project components could be
successfully completed, albeit most likely with some delay. The PDO was also still relevant
and could be achieved with the successful completion of all activities; but it was unlikely
they would be met within the current project duration. However, already at the MTR in
2009, before the civil unrest started in the country, there was a concrete risk of achieving
the expected outcomes, and the MTR conclusions were too optimistic. Though this was
indicated by downgrading (i) PDO achievement, (ii) project management, and (iii)
procurement from ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate satisfactory’, stringent correction measures
such as, for example, tighter supervision including verification of agreed actions and
deadlines at shorter intervals or reducing the 200 MOM plans to a realistic number were not
undertaken.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
37.     Monitoring and evaluation procedures were well designed. But despite the
collection of a large amount of relevant M&E data, there was very little monitoring of the
project’s outcome and results indicators (as set out in the project’s Results Framework)
during the first project years. Thus it was rather difficult if not impossible to assess whether


                                               9
the project would be able to achieve its PDO. To eventually address this shortcoming, an
international M&E Consultant was recruited in November 2011 (Project year 5) to provide
support to the PIU M&E Specialist, particularly with respect to data processing methods
required to monitor the project’s outcome and results indicators. Guidance was also
provided on the preparation of survey procedures, questionnaires and data analysis. The
PIU M&E Unit evaluated 8 off-farm schemes completed between 2009 and 2012 and 7 off-
farm schemes completed in 2013. An impact evaluation study conducted by a local
consulting firm covering 6 off-farm schemes and 19 WUAs was also completed in 2013.
Results of these studies are presented in Annex 5.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
38.     Safeguards. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and its
implementation and adherence supervised by field staff coordinated by the PIU. No
significant problems were reported. The safety of dams concerned only the Papan and
Naiman Dam which did not raise any serious concern. Though OP 7.50 was triggered, it
was rightly determined (1) that the project will not significantly change abstraction volumes
for the irrigation systems, (2) that it will not have any adverse impact on the quality or
quantity of river water flows, and (3) that the project-funded works will not change the
nature of the original systems, so the obligation to notify downstream riparians was waived.
39.     Fiduciary Compliance. Most of the Financial Management (FM) supervision
missions of the project confirmed that in general the PIU has established acceptable FM
arrangements including accounting, reporting, budgeting and funds flow, internal controls
and staffing. All project audit reports except for the last one were submitted in time. The
project audit reports and the accompanying project financial statements were considered
acceptable to the Bank. Financial Management Reports (FMRs) were satisfactory and
submitted in time. As a result of an accounting error, IDA funds in the order of
US$ 350,000 were misallocated, and were refunded to the designated accounts.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
40.     The Bank’s WMIP provided guidance to the PIU on carrying forward key aspects
from WMIP into the NWRMP-1 which has already been prepared and is now before
negotiation. Recommendations were made for DWRLI staff training including RDWR staff,
and details of areas provided in which training is required and could be taken up under
NWRMP-1. Most training subjects consist of basic engineering knowledge. Much care was
taken to ensure post-project O&M arrangements which are presented in the Borrower’s
Report.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
41.     The preparation of the NWRMP-1, financed by the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation, clearly proves that the WMIP has not lost its relevance of objectives,
design and implementation. It may be argued that the WMIP preparation team in 2005 was
too optimistic regarding the outcomes of the project but at that time nobody could foresee
the significant changes in the political landscape of Kyrgyzstan as they eventually unfolded
in 2010. The aftershocks of this turbulent period four years ago are still felt today and
manifest themselves in political fragility in general (e.g., high staff turnover at all levels),
and indecisiveness of Government officials, in particular, concerning important issues of


                                              10
national interest, such as convening the NWC and caring for O&M procedures to sustain
the irrigation infrastructure rehabilitated under WMIP. Current development priorities of
the country include the irrigated agriculture sub-sector as well as better use of the available
land and water resources. These priorities are also reflected in the Bank’s new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY14-17 which includes “better management of
natural resources” as one of three pillars to fight poverty, especially in the South.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs)
42.      In an environment of political instability and frequent government changes, the
implementation of projects – including WRMP - suffered accordingly. Alternating
government officers lacked experience and decision power, and the Parliament had to
provide its approval of any proposal for institutional change. Notwithstanding the very
difficult circumstances the country went through during the last four years, particularly in
the Ferghana Valley, the achievements under the project are remarkable but fall
considerably short of achieving the PDO in its entirety. Although the project fully
disbursed the credit and 14 irrigation schemes were satisfactorily rehabilitated by project
closure, the overall rating for achievement of the PDOs can only be rated ‘moderately
unsatisfactory’. The main reason for this is that the sustainability of investments in
irrigation system rehabilitation is not ensured. The investments should have been enhanced
by improvements in management, operation and maintenance which were supposed to be
piloted (over the original project period of six years) as part of the project, and which only
at the end of the project found the necessary attention. Studies under the project indicate
that the overall budget allocated for O&M of the schemes is only around 25-30% of what is
required, jeopardizing the sustainability of rehabilitation investments and the long-term
reliability of adequate water supply.
43.      Component 1 had five result indicators (see Table 2 in Annex 2) to achieve
improved irrigation service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable
increase in irrigated agricultural productivity: ISF collection rate increased by 18% but
remained yet 11% under target and a high satisfaction rate concerning water delivery was
observed by 92% of WUAs. Though the volumes of irrigation water supplied improved by
12-16%, the investment in irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation must be considered
unsustainable as not a single MOM Plan was implemented; and practiced IFS contribution
reaches just a fourth of the required maintenance budget, with actual allocations in the
order of US$ 4-5 per ha, whereas sustainable levels are in the order of US$ 18-20 per ha.
Especially since Component 2 was not able to introduce substantial improvements on the
MOM procedures, the concern with regard to the sustainability of investments made
remains, and the Component is thus rated ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’.
44.      Component 2 had six result indicators (see Table 4 in Annex 2) to achieve an
improvement of national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the
nation as a whole. This component would have required significant policy interventions in
order to achieve its original outcome indicators. Only after the NWC convened in the last
project year, some progress was achieved in producing the desired outputs, such as the
adoption of a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the water sector as well as
resolutions giving the DWRLI the mandate of the State Water Administration as a pre-
cursor to establishing the SWA as an independent agency. Eventually, some important
activities were accomplished which will contribute to a good start of the succeeding
NWRMP-1. These included the preparation of i) a SWC/SCWRLI Charter, ii) guidelines


                                              11
for the establishment and operation of the SWA/SCWRLI, iii) a draft for the establishment
of processes, procedures and staff for BWAs and BDWRs, and many more documents
supporting the much needed institutional change. However, as none of the six results
contributed in a significant manner to the expected outcome in order to achieve the
component’s objectives, the results produced under project Component 2 are rated
‘unsatisfactory’.
45.     Component 3 had four indicators (see Table 5 in Annex 2) to contribute to the
achievement of an improvement of national water resource governance for the benefit of
water users and the nation as a whole. All four results contributed to the expected outcome,
the most noteworthy among them being the establishment of 10 pilot FWUAs, double the
number proposed in the PAD, and the transfer of 24 out of 26 identified minor irrigation
systems to WUAs. Hence, the achievements under project Component 3 are rated
‘satisfactory’.
3.3 Efficiency
46.     The rehabilitation works on most I&D schemes were only completed during the last
two years of project implementation. Therefore, the economic analysis was undertaken
based on actual benefits achieved in the six irrigation schemes that were completed in 2009
and 2010. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) varies from 17% to 57%. In terms of
sustainability, the analysis examined the EIRR under the scenario that assumes that the
current level of the O&M spending remains resulting in decreased crop productivity at 2%,
the EIRR dropped significantly. For two schemes, namely Sarykamysh and Mogol, EIRR
reduce to below 12%. Furthermore, to evaluate the likely economic impact of potential
increases in the irrigated area by 5% and 10%, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken. It is
evident from the analysis that the EIRRs would rise significantly. For a 5% rise in irrigated
area, EIRRs of between 17% (Sary Kamysh) and 71% (LB Kugart) would be achieved
while, for a 10% increase in irrigated area, the EIRRs would range from 23% to 80%.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
47.     The quantification of outputs under the preceding Sub-chapter 3.2 clearly shows the
shortcomings under the three project components; those ones under component 2 being the
most serious ones and rated ‘unsatisfactory’. Component 2 is the most crucial one for
achieving the PDO which stipulates to achieve a sustainable increase in irrigated
agricultural productivity and improved national water resources governance. Crop
production increased only by 10% and water resources governance did neither improve at
central nor significantly at local level. Consequently, in spite of more favorable ratings for
component 1 (‘moderately unsatisfactory’) and component 3 (‘satisfactory’), the overall
outcome must be rated ‘moderately unsatisfactory’. The available MOM budgets are
insufficient and jeopardize the investment made, already in the short-term.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
48.      Poverty impact was not explicitly measured. The high EIRRs presented in Sub-
chapter 3.3, however, support the assumption that farm families in the rehabilitated
irrigation schemes will continue to raise their incomes due to high EIRRs, through crop
production that is currently increased by 17% (in schemes where rehabilitation was
completed in 2009 and 2010); thus poverty will be reduced. As usual and necessary, the


                                             12
project tried hard to involve women in the decision making process in the WUAs and
WUAFs – with modest success. Very few women have the courage and attract sufficient
respect from male members to be entrusted to management positions in the WUAs and
WUAFs2. It goes without saying, however, that the successful establishment of 10 WUAFs
will certainly support more efficient management of the available water resources at local
level, providing new opportunities to make irrigated agriculture more profitable and thus
contribute to a better living standard.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
49.      The project did not achieve the desired institutional change due to a number of
events and shortcomings described above. There is no impact on longer-term capacity
increase at central level in sight. To a lesser extent, this is also true at local level, but here
Oblast and Raion staff are directly and daily facing the needs for improvement, and thus
more demanded to act upon – but with not much success when recognizing the very high
staff turn-over.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
50.    No unintended outcomes and impacts were noticed.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
51.      The beneficiary survey was carried out in 2012/2013 by a local public association.
The survey focused on four groups of WUAs and water users that have benefitted from
irrigation systems rehabilitated under WMIP. Questionnaires were used to collect data from
WUA council members and officials, and representatives of the BWA and the RDWR. 20
representative WUAs located in Batken, Jalalabad, and Osh Oblasts were surveyed.
52.      Detailed results of the survey are presented in Annex 5. Some major results
included i) the positive effect of the project in guaranteeing water supply to WUAs and thus
preventing conflicts between water users ii) the WUA representatives’ perception of
positive changes in improved water supply, and iii) the lack of elementary water use skill in
some WUAs in spite of RDWR inspectors’ and specialists’ organizing workshops and
training seminars.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
53.      The risks are low on the technical and environmental side. The main concerns are of
a financial, institutional, and to a lesser extent economic nature. There is much concern:
(i) that financial resources will be insufficient already in the short-term to operate and
maintain (and further improve) the rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure, (ii) that DWR will
not become an integrated water resources management agency and an efficient bulk water
supplier, and (iii) that the country’s political and economic situation may not remain stable
and thus the agricultural sector would not be able to take full advantage of the rehabilitated
and modernized irrigation infrastructure. The long-term O&M of the irrigation infra-
structure continues to be an issue. DWRLI maintains that it receives less than half of the
budget it requires. Hence, increasing both DWR budget allocation for MOM and the ISF
rate are indispensable for the sustainability of irrigation infrastructure.

54.     In spite of the satisfactory organization of the beneficiaries in WUAs and WUAFs,
the moderately unsatisfactory achievements in irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation
definitely jeopardize the PDO. Consequently, the risk to the overall development outcome
can only be considered to be ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
55.      Following some minor amendments made to the Project Concept Note, a large team
of experienced Bank staff and consultants started the preparation of this project, which
benefitted from lessons learned from the previous irrigation projects IRP and OIP, such as
insufficient MOM budgets and low ISFs. Readiness of the Government to institutional
reform was articulated by Government key staff in personal communication with Bank staff
preparing the project. In 2005, a stakeholder workshop was convened in Bishkek, the main
objectives having been the familiarization of stakeholders with the planned project
activities and the selection of irrigation infrastructure to be rehabilitated. Ensuring quality
at entry, the meticulous project preparation may have given the impression that project
implementation would go smoothly and that the Government would be ready and prepared
for institutional reform. This, however, was not the case due to many external as well as
internal reasons, both in the rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes as well as in the attempt
to successfully support the water sector reform, the latter having certainly been an overam-
bitious undertaking as experience from other countries (for example Georgia) clearly show.
The target set at preparation for the preparation and implementation of MOM plans (200)
clearly underestimated how a complicated endeavor this was, as eventually only 4 plans
were prepared, without being implemented yet. These obvious shortcomings in ensuring
quality at entry contribute to an only ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ rating.
(b) Quality of Supervision
56.     Besides regular contact with the DWRLI via the World Bank Office in Bishkek, 14
implementation supervision missions including a mid-term review in October 2009 were
carried out. Several specialized consultants took regularly part in these missions, ensuring
the best possible support to Government and the PIU of DWRLI. The missions regularly
carried out field visits, and initiated lively discussions with beneficiaries and DWRLI staff
at national, Oblast and Raion levels. Fiduciary and safeguard policies were continuously
observed and regularly supervised by specialists. Also the change of Team Leaders early in
2010 did not cause any delay or friction in the implementation of the project. However, the
Mid-Term Review has to be considered rather weak, missing – on the one side - to
acknowledge the impossibility of achieving the PDO within the scheduled project period of
six years, and on the other side that the Government should have been reminded to the
covenant of holding the decisive NWC meeting immediately in 2009. In spite of the
significant progress made through tight high quality supervision and backstopping in the
last year after the NWC met, the quality of supervision can only be rated to have been
‘moderately satisfactory’. A notable achievement during supervision is the preparation of
the follow-up NWRMP-1.




                                              14
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
57.     The WMIP initially seemed to be a straightforward prepared project based on
experience and lessons learned from preceding IDA funded projects (IRP and OIP). This,
however, was not the case; not only because of the crucial role (and thus its political
relevance) the DWRLI was expected to play in the future, but also because of the
unexpected civil unrest in the country in 2010. In spite of these unforeseen events, the two
team leaders maneuvered the project through difficult times, albeit not without persistent
shortcomings regarding the achievement of the expected outcomes. Having gone through
an intensive project identification and preparation period setting very ambitious targets,
followed by regular implementation supervision missions with Bank staff and consultants
of high reputation, but missing the opportunity at Mid-Term Review to adjust the outcome
indicators to the special political and economic climate in the country at that time, the
overall Bank performance must be considered to have been ‘moderately unsatisfactory’
because ensuring quality at entry is rated in the unsatisfactory range.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
58.     It is well understood that particularly during 2010 and 2011 the Government was
fully occupied with more important things than backstopping the WMIP. The
Government’s weak performance, however, goes back to the very beginning of the project,
and culminated in the Bank’s statement in the 7th ISR of 20 February 2010: “The delays
facing this project are worrisome, and while the recent reorganization of government
structures has been disruptive, the delays reflect a far deeper issue of institutional weakness.
One may also question the authorities' commitment to this project.” This statement in the
7th ISR certainly was the result of the repeated postponement of the decisive NWC meeting,
and the frustration that the DWRLI did not follow up the recommended – and agreed
actions – brought forward by the Bank’s supervision team. In light of the Government’s
rather indifferent attitude towards the project needs (except for the MOF), and its lack of
decisiveness at important times during project implementation, the Government’s
performance can only be rated ‘moderately unsatisfactory’.
(b) Implementing Agency Performance
59.     The PIU is located in the DWRLI under the MOA. Throughout project
implementation, DWRLI management collaborated well with World Bank supervision staff
but less well with World Bank Management, particularly with respect to adhering to the
actions agreed after implementation supervision missions. Project Component 2 activities
did not only suffer from the weak performance of the international consulting firm, but also
from passive DWRLI management3. PIU staff worked hard, albeit not always as focused as
needed. In spite of continuous training the PIU’s and RDWRs’ staff capacity hardly in-
creased during the project. Deficits in adequate contract management caused unnecessary
delays enhanced by the many variation orders not really due to poor design but due to the
ambitious construction volumes planned in spite of limited funds. The performance of the
implementing agency is therefore considered to have been ‘moderately satisfactory’.


3
 E.g., in the 6th ISR of 9 June 2009, it was noted that “T here is concern that the management of the DWRLI
has so far not submitted any proposals to Government, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) re main weak”.


                                                    15
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
60.     In spite of MOF’s positive attitude towards the project and recognizing the efforts
undertaken by PIU staff, the Borrower’s overall performance has to be rated ‘moderately
unsatisfactory’ because the outcome is rated in the unsatisfactory range.
6. Lessons Learned
61.     Instead of requiring organizational change, it may have been more adequate to work
with the existing DWRLI divisions in order to establish processes and procedures for
improved water resources management. Such a focus on practical and achievable activities
would have had more chances to yield results within the originally six year period. A more
focused approach on selected ‘model irrigation schemes’ and employing specialized short-
term consultants could have provided an opportunity to test and refine the measures chosen,
especially for improved MOM, before up-scaling those measures to other irrigation
schemes in the country. This approach would have been commensurate with the limited
financial and human resources of DWRLI and would have enabled senior DWRLI
management to effectively guide changes emanating from the project.
62.     Consequently, the proposed NWRMP-1 has carefully set its targets, gradually and
stepwise increasing them throughout the project, clearly stating targets to be achieved in the
short-term (during project duration) and in the long-term (after project closure). For
example, capacity building within DWRLI to take up the role of the SWA is given priority
and a short-term objective, whereas the institutional separation of water resources
management and irrigation & drainage functions is considered a long-term objective. Or the
MOM budget issue is addressed in such a way that only a certain number of priority
schemes is expected to function profitably with an adequate MOM budget at the end of the
project; all the others should follow in the long-term. WMIP has successfully supported the
establishment of 10 FWUAs, whilst Second On-farm Irrigation Project (OIP-2) has worked
well with supporting and strengthening WUAs, particularly in relation to water manage-
ment, system maintenance and asset management. Any follow-up project like NWRMP-1
should build on this past experience, learning lessons from the relatively new FWUAs and
strengthening the irrigation water management and maintenance capability of WUAs
initiated under OIP-2. A key factor will be provision of suitable technical expertise in order
to build local capability, which is currently weak in the associated disciplines.
63.     As experienced elsewhere in Central Asia, it is crucial for the Kyrgyz Republic to
modernize its systems of water resources management, particularly regarding the collection,
processing, analysis and use of water resources and irrigation data. Assisting the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic in these endeavors, it is compulsory for the Bank to
adjust the need and speed of institutional reform not only in the water sector to the
sometimes very special political and cultural conditions prevailing in the recipient country.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
64.     The PIU in its Borrowers Completion Report rates the project moderately
satisfactory both for achievement of PDO as well as for the performance of the World Bank
and the DWRLI. Also the comments on the draft ICR, provided by the Director General of
the DWRLI noted that the indicators set-forth at appraisal of the WMIP were overly
ambitious, but that given the revisions of the indicators for evaluation, the project was


                                             16
moderately satisfactory. The Director General also notes the positive impact of the project
on improving living standards of the rural population and the improvement of irrigation
infrastructure.
65.     The ICR task team acknowledges that the project indeed would be rated moderately
satisfactory against the revised Results Framework, but refers to the last Aide Memoire and
Management Letter which clarify that according to World Bank ICR guidelines the final
ICR rating is for the project over the entire project duration, and not only against revised
Results Framework.

2.      Twenty priority off-farm schemes (main headwork and canal infrastructure) have
been identified at the Project design stage. The actual works comprised the rehabilitation of
14 off-farm irrigation schemes, the upgrading of an inter-canal transfer, and the renovation
of a storage dam (see Table 3). The total command area of the 14 off-farm-irrigation
systems was estimated to be 70,390 ha (or 82.5% of the original target) which supplied
water to about 41,100 households (or 352,000 people). Total expenditure on civil works
contracts was US$ 17.79 million. About three quarters of the contracts (by value) were
located in the South of the country.

*Contrary to the Borrower’s judgment, the main off-farm infrastructure that was rehabilitated under the
WMIP is considered not to be properly operated and maintained by the DWRLI as evidenced by the poor
technical conditions of the off-farm structures rehabilitated under the previous IDA-financed IRP and the con-
tinuous dilapidation of the systems selected for improvement under the WMIP.

Component 2: Water Resources Management
3.      Component 2 had six result indicators (Table 4) to contribute to the achievement of
an improvement of national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and
the nation as a whole. As none of the six results contributed in any significant manner to the
expected outcome, the achievements under Project Component 2 are rated ‘unsatisfactory’.

4.      This component would have required significant policy interventions in order to
achieve its original outcome indicators. Only after the NWC convened in the last project
year, some progress was achieved in producing the desired outputs, such as the adoption of
a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the water sector as well as resolutions
giving the DWRLI the mandate of the State Water Administration as a pre-cursor to
establishing the SWA as an independent agency. The outputs are summarized as follows:
Implementation of the Water Code – Towards Integrated Water Resources Management
(IWRM):
    Review information on the experience of other developed countries was provided.
    A report on the functions, structures and staffing of the SWA was prepared but not
      used as the SWC was not formed.
    A SWC/SCWRLI Charter was prepared but not used as SWA was not formed.
    Key work processes and procedures for the SWA/SCWRLI were identified and job
      descriptions for key positions produced but not applied as SWA was not formed.
    Guidelines for the establishment and operation of the SWA/SCWRLI were partially
      prepared but not fully completed because SWA was not formed.
    Training needs assessment of staff performing water related work was carried out
      but the training only partially realized.
    Boundaries of seven river basins were identified but not accepted by the Govern-
      ment.
    Two river basin plans for the Talas and Kugart rivers were prepared following the
      formation of the respective River Basin Councils.


                                                     21
      A draft for the establishment of processes, procedures and staff for BWAs and
       BDWRs was completed but not applied as SWA was not formed.
      A budget for IWRM was prepared but not applied as SWA was not formed.
      An IWRM road map and a DWRLI restructuring/water resources financing plan
       were prepared.
      Financial analyses for SWA/SCWRLI and BWA/BDWR offices were carried out
       but it is not known if they are applied.
      A national water strategy was partially prepared.
      An inventory and analyses of existing hydrometric stations were carried out and
       improvements proposed including low-cost emergency repair measures for priority
       stations.
      Hydrometric staff requirements and skills were reviewed, with focus on data pro-
       cessing and integration with the new BWAs, the latter not having been possible
       because no BWAs were formed.
Service Delivery – Reforming the DWRLI
    Studies to identify and quantify the costs associated with maintenance of the I&D
       systems were carried out.
    A detailed assessment to establish the required MOM budgets and procedures was
       carried out and recommendations made.
    Needs and justification for ISFs were formulated.
    A report about options for turnover of smaller I&D systems to water users was pre-
       pared and recommendations made.
    Advice was provided and recommendations made on how best to set up and operate
       Water Management Committees (WMCs).
    Limited assistance to improve DWRLI’s MIS was given (a study for the needs of an
       MIS with resulting Action Plan partially implemented; training and installation of
       computers).
    A feasibility study about DWRLI owning I&D maintenance equipment was carried
       out (with negative result).
    A young professionals program was formulated but not followed up.
    A report about an investigation on costs and benefits of electrically driven pump
       irrigation systems was prepared by analyzing 16 out of 107 identified systems
       resulting in the fact that the electricity costs alone consume around one-third of
       DWRLI’s annual budget.
    An overall plan for the improvement of DWRLI institutional structure, financial
       management and information system was prepared, training provided and hardware
       installed but not yet used.
Supporting WUAs with Improved Water Management
    21 demonstration plots were established (three in each oblast), equipment bought,
      farmers trained in modern agricultural production technologies, and the plots
      operated for three seasons.



                                           22
             WUA Support Unit Staff was trained in improved water management procedures.
Information and Dissemination
     Leaflets, brochures, newspaper articles and a video were prepared for on-field
       water management and agricultural practices, and distributed to water users, interest
       groups and the general public.
Training and Capacity Building
    A study tour to learn about water resources management and involving farmers in
       irrigation management was carried out to Portugal and Spain from November 11-18,
       2012 with 10 participants comprising the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and
       Melioration, project staff, local government administrators and WUA staff.
    Relevant university courses were strengthened by providing some technical support
       such as giving guest lectures.



Component 3: Organization of beneficiaries
5.      This component had four indicators to contribute to the achievement of an
improvement of national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the
nation as a whole. All four results contributed to the expected outcome (see Table 5); hence,
the achievements under Project Component 3 are rated ‘satisfactory’.

6.     Under this component, the Project has worked successfully with FWUAs to
increase their capacity. Its outputs are summarized as follows:

Formation and Support for Pilot Federations of WUAs
    105 pilot FWUAs, double the number of pilot FWUAs proposed in the PAD.




5
    Double the number requested as minimum in the PAD


                                                       23
      Technical support to propose and assist with the development of the necessary legal
       instruments to facilitate the process of establishing and operating FWUAs was
       provided.
      Some awareness raising and training in relation to the 10 FWUAs were carried out.
      Business plans were prepared to enable the FWUAs to purchase maintenance
       machinery and equipment through the Project.
      Tenders were prepared and machinery bought (mostly excavators, tractors, trailers
       and ditchers), delivered in late 2012/early 2013.
      MOM of infrastructure was transferred from DWRLI to the 10 FWUAs.
Transfer of Minor Irrigation Systems to WUAs
    24 out of 26 identified minor irrigation systems were transferred to WUAs which is
       considered to be a rather significant development as - with further TA and capacity
       building of WUAs - more schemes can be handed over to FWUAs in the future
       relieving the budgetary pressure on the DWRLI.
Monitoring and Evaluation of Results
   Technical assistance (TA) over 2 years was provided to the PIU M&W Specialist in
          o Design and implementation of an M&E system suitable for WMIP;
          o Development of data analysis, reports and information dissemination on the
             Water Code implementation;
          o Creation of relevant tools to monitor the activities of key WUAs with
             demonstration plots;
          o Internal monitoring of WUAs; and
          o Training of PIU staff and key WUAs.



Component 4: Project management
7.     Overall project management is considered to have been moderately satisfactory.
Although construction management and management of Project Component 2 could have
been substantially better, the PIU was able to complete construction of most schemes
amidst a situation of conflict in the South. Eventually it helped the NWC to prepare the
roadmap for future water sector development in an environment of political instability and
frequent government changes. Project management often displayed a lack of organization
and pro-activeness requiring significant implementation support from the Bank’s task team.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Introduction
1.      The current analysis re-estimated the financial and economic analysis for the Water
Management Improvement Project (WRMIP) that was completed in 2013. The objectives
of the project were to: (i) improve irrigation service delivery and water management for the
benefit of a sustainable increase in irrigated agricultural productivity; and (ii) improve
national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole.
2.      At appraisal, the analysis estimated the likely financial and economic returns to
water users that would largely derive from an increase in crop yields and a limited
expansion of irrigated area. The crop yield assumptions were: (i) with project crop yields
would increase by 10% over a 4 year period following rehabilitation; and (ii) without
project crop yields would decline at a rate of 1% per annum over 25 years due to the
deterioration of the off-farm system. Furthermore, the irrigated area was expected to
increase by an average of 7% over a three year period. No benefits from changes in
cropping pattern were expected. The benefits and costs of 10 sample schemes were
determined, and the results of the economic analysis indicated that 9 out of 10 sample sub-
projects achieved very high benefits relative to rehabilitation costs, with benefit-cost ratios
ranging between 2.0:1 and 6.8:1 (at 12% discount rate) and EIRRs varying from 21% to
73%.
3.      The initial project design and objective remained unchanged over the project
implementation period. Therefore, the current analysis re-estimated the project benefits
using the methodology of the appraisal analysis but by applying (i) actual yield
achievements and changes to cropping patterns recorded in six schemes where
rehabilitation of irrigation systems were completed in 2009 and 2010; (ii) updating benefit
phases; and (iii) project costs. These schemes, namely Tatyr (Batken), Sary Kamysh (Osh),
Yujniy (Osh), Mogol (Jalalabad), Left Bank Kugart (Jalalabad), and Chon (Issyk-Kul)
represent both Southern and Northern regions that have different agro-climatic zones. In
terms of changes to crop yields and cropping patterns, the analysis uses the findings of
impact assessment survey that was carried out in 2012-2013 by the independent survey
company.

B.   Agricultural Benefits

a.   Irrigated Area and Cropping Patterns
4.      The irrigated areas for each of the selected schemes, both before and after the
implementation of the off-farm rehabilitation works, are presented in Table 1. As data
demonstrate there has only been a very minor expansion in irrigated area within one sub-
project (Yujniy) following the implementation of rehabilitation works. The full command
areas were irrigated prior to rehabilitation but timeliness and volume of supplied irrigation
water varied significantly within the scheme command areas with limited or no water
supply to tail end sections during the peak of the vegetation seasons. For example, in
schemes Levaya Vetka (Jalalabad), TMR (Osh) and Chon (Issyk-Kul) where rehabilitation
works were completed only 2012; before rehabilitation only 85%, 88% and 95% of the
respective command areas were irrigated. Some expansion in irrigated areas in those
schemes, therefore, is expected to take place.


                                              25
5.      Table 6 demonstrates the cropping patterns of the six selected schemes before and
after rehabilitation. Wheat and maize were the most commonly grown crops in southern
schemes and accounted for over 50% of the cropped area. Overall, wheat and maize
accounted for 33% and 21% of the cropped area respectively. A further 13% of the cropped
area was under oil crops, while vegetables/potatoes accounted for 14% of the cropped area.
Other notable crops were perennial fodder (8%) and orchards (5%).
6.      The findings of the impact assessment surveys revealed that changes in cropping
patterns have occurred since the completion of the off-farm rehabilitation works. The most
notable change is the significant decline in the area of winter wheat, while other crop areas
increased, e.g. fodder, vegetables, potatoes and orchards. This provides some evidence that
an improved supply of irrigation water is contributing to changes in cropping patterns
towards production of more profitable cash crops.

b. Crop Yields
7.      The wheat yields before rehabilitation varied from 1.6 tons/ha in At-Tatyr to 3.0
tons/ha in LB Kugart with the overall average at 2.3 tons/ha. Maize yields were signifi-
cantly higher and ranged from 4.1 tons/ha in At-Tatyr to 5.9 tons/ha in Yujniy, with an
average of 5.4 tons/ha. The average yields of other crops were estimated at: vegetables
(14.5 tons/ha), orchard crops (5.7 tons/ha), fodder (4.4 tons/ha), cotton (2.4 tons/ha) and
oilseeds (1.0 tons/ha). Crop yields within each selected scheme before rehabilitation are
given in Table 7.
8.      The findings of the impact assessment survey suggest that in the selected six
schemes the overall yields of major crops increased by about 9% following rehabilitation.
There were, however, notable differences between schemes and overall increases crop
yields per hectare varied from 1% in Yujniy to 30% in At Tatyr. Similarly, there were also
substantial variations between the major crops with yield changes ranging from 0.7% for oil
crops in Yujniy to over 100% for orchard crops in At Tatyr.

9.      The improved and guaranteed water supply is expected to result in adoption of
improved cropping practices and increased investments in production inputs that would
lead to further increases in crop productivity. It is therefore highly likely that future crop
yields will exceed the levels assumed in the original economic analysis.


C. Economic Analysis

a.   Economic Pricing
10.     Economic prices for internationally traded goods (e.g. wheat and maize) were
derived from border prices. Non-internationally traded agricultural goods were based on
financial farm gate prices within the scheme areas. Unskilled labour costs were based on
the wage rates prevailing within the scheme areas. A shadow wage rate conversion factor of
0.60 was used to reflect the opportunity cost of unskilled labour. Taxes (such as VAT and
import duties) were omitted from financial prices to convert them into economic values.
11.     The economic analysis was undertaken in 2013 constant prices and opportunity cost
of capital of 12% was assumed. Discounting was undertaken over a scheme life of 25 years.
The Kyrgyz som (KGS) was used as the unit of account and an exchange rate of KGS 54 to
US$1.0 (March 2014) was applied when converting to US$.


b. Economic Crop Gross Margins
12.     Crop gross margins were estimated for all the main crops grown within the scheme
command areas. These gross margins were prepared based on 2013 financial outputs and
inputs prices that were converted into economic prices by applying appropriate economic
conversion factors. Economic crop gross margins for the six selected schemes, both before
and after rehabilitation, are presented in Table 8.

c.   Incremental Economic Benefits
13.    In the without project situation, it was assumed that the before rehabilitation
economic benefits would decline by 1% per annum over the life of the scheme. The present
values (discounted at 12% per annum) of with and without project benefits, as well as
incremental economic benefits, for each scheme are presented in Table 9.

D. Economic Costs

a.     Rehabilitation Costs
14.     The capital investments used in the analysis were the actual expenditures incurred
during implementation of the off-farm rehabilitation works at each of the schemes. In the
derivation of economic rehabilitation costs, taxes and import duties were omitted and the
cost of unskilled labour was reduced by applying the shadow wage rate factor of 0.60. The
financial cost of foreign goods and services remained unchanged. It was estimated that
foreign and local material/machinery costs accounted for 60% and 20% of the expenditure
respectively, while 10% was spent on labour, and taxes/import duties account for a further
10%. The specific economic conversion factor for rehabilitation works was estimated at
0.86 and this factor was then applied to the financial costs of each scheme. The economic
rehabilitation costs of each scheme are shown in Table 10, and it can be seen that the
economic costs ranged from KGS 10.06 million (US$ 209,940) in At-Tatyr to KGS 45.76
million (US$ 953,375) in Mogol, with an average of KGS 31.60 million (US$ 658,300).
With respect to the economic rehabilitation costs per hectare, these varied from KGS
5,859/ha (US$ 122/ha) in LB Kugart to KGS 29,999/ha (US$625/ha).

b. Economic Benefit-Cost Analysis
15.     The results of the economic analysis are presented in Table 11 and it can be seen
that the NPVs range from KGS 20.0 million (Mogol) to KGS 100.7 million (LB Kugart),
while the EIRRs vary from 17% (Mogol) to 57% (LB Kugart). This analysis clearly
demonstrates that all the schemes are economically viable and that the rehabilitation of
most schemes will generate significant economic benefits. For schemes with lower EIRRs,
i.e. Sary Kamysh and Mogal, this was mainly due to the higher rehabilitation costs per
hectare relative to other schemes.

16.     The findings of the impact assessment studies show clear evidence that crop yields
are likely to increase further and the irrigated area is also expand in some schemes where
rehabilitation works were completed just recently. In this regards, the results of the current
economic analysis is conservative. Thus, to evaluate the likely economic impact of
increases in the irrigated area by 5% and 10%, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken (Table
12) and it is evident from the analysis that the EIRRs of the schemes would rise
significantly. For a 5% rise in irrigated area, EIRRs of between 21% (Mogol) and 81% (LB
Kugart) would be achieved while, for a 10% increase in irrigated area, the EIRRs ranged
from 23% to 80%.

c.     Operation and Maintenance Costs and Sustainability
17.     Before the project, annual O&M costs of off-farm systems were very low; ranging
from KGS 29 (US$ 0.60 per ha) in LB Kugart to 243 per ha (US$ 5.35 per ha) in Yujniy,
with an average of KGS 155 per ha (US$3.23 per ha). At the project completion, the annual
spending on the off-farm systems increased. However, the current O&M level is much
below the US$18.5 per ha which was recommended by the Management, Operation and
Maintenance Study (2013) as the adequate O&M level required to keep the systems in an
efficient operational condition. The current analysis assumed that the future annual O&M
spending will be equal to the recommended O&M level (base case).
18.     Furthermore, it examined the economic returns under the scenario that assumes that
the current level of the O&M spending will remain leading to 2% declines in crop yields
after Year 5 (due to deterioration of systems). Under this scenario the EIRRs notable
reduced for schemes with higher rehabilitation costs (i.e. Sarykamysh and Mogol).
However, the EIRRs for schemes with modest rehabilitation costs, the EIRRs were not
significantly affected (see below table).

                        Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      The beneficiary survey was carried out in 2012/2013 by the Institute for
Development Evaluation (IDE) Public Association. The survey focused on four groups of
WUAs and water users that have benefitted from irrigation systems rehabilitated under
WMIP. Questionnaires were used to collect data from (1) WUA council members and
officials, and (2) representatives of the BWA and the RDWR. Some 20 representative
WUAs located in Batken, Jalalabad, and Osh oblasts) were surveyed during 2012/13.

2.    IDE carried out the following tasks to reach their conclusions and
recommendations:
     Review of all the relevant documents including the project appraisal documents,
      quarterly and annual project progress reports, and the results framework of the
      project;
     Identification and evaluation of project impacts with respect to beneficiaries of
      rehabilitated irrigation systems;
     Survey of WUA Councils. At least three representatives from each WUA including
      one WUA council member and two senior WUA officials were interviewed. Key
      questions for discussion focused on the following:
       Command area, source of irrigation water and number of water users;
       WUA assembly, number of WUA meetings, and contact with raion
          representatives;
       WUA budget, expenditure and water distribution plan;
       Irrigation water supply and area irrigated;
       Repair and maintenance of on-farm irrigation and drainage infrastructure;
       ISF payments and collection rates;
       Training and support services provided by the WUA Support Unit;
       Disputes between WUA administration and RDWR;
       Water management procedures and seasonal water allocation plans; and
       Membership in Water Councils, FWUAs and National Union of WUAs.
3.    The results of the beneficiary survey are summarized as follows:
  a.   The comparative analysis performed to measure the Project’s impact on water
       resources management as well as on operation and maintenance of the rehabilitated
       irrigation and drainage systems shows that the Project had a positive effect in
       guaranteeing irrigation water supply to WUAs and thus prevented conflicts between
       water users.
  b.   The institutional reorganizations stipulated by the WMIP and aimed at water
       resources management improvement had a positive result on the revival of the
       NWC’s activities who approved the Road Map for the implementation of the Water
       Code and water resources management procedures at river basin level. The
       institutional reorganization of the water sub-sector, however, still requires the
       finalization of the Water Law and the issuance of by-laws in order to ensure water
       access by water users country-wide.



                                           35
c.   The practicality and significance of the WMIP was highly appraised, but at the same
     time there are still rehabilitation needs of off-farm canals which were not included
     in the priority list for rehabilitation.
d.   Almost all WUA representatives noted positive changes in improved water supply,
     manifested in timely delivery of increased amounts of water. Some WUA
     representatives complained that many on-farm and field canals have been left
     unrepaired, and the amount of water delivered to some problematic zones still
     remain at low level. WUA representatives are continuing to raise their request for
     the provision of maintenance equipment including bulldozers, excavators, ditch
     digger, etc.) to better maintain and repair their irrigation systems.
e.   A reduction of cropping area of some major crops (such as wheat and tabacco) has
     been noticed. The reason for this is evident in the very low sale prices of these crops.
     It was also mentioned that there are good quality fertilizer, seeds and pesticides.
f.   A high staff turnover and incompetence of specialized staff (accountant, hydraulic
     engineers and hydro-technicians) working for WUAs was observed. This is due to
     low salaries causing the specialists to leave the WUA in search of better paid jobs.
     WUAs are, however, not in a position to pay better salaries due to lack of funds.
g.   Many WUA Directors could not find previous years’ data referring to staff turnover,
     saying that former Directors did not hand over any document to them; hence not
     observing existing transfer procedures stipulating proper Take-over Acts signed by
     the relevant Committee members in presence of the Ayil Okmotu and RDWR
     officials.
h.   Almost all WUAs face problems of individual, unauthorized diversion of irrigation
     water not abiding to the agreed water supply schedule. Apparently, such malpractice
     can be stopped by means of enforced administrative penalties, such as happened in
     the case of Kok-Sai-3 WUA in Talas raion, where the WUA Council has introduced
     KGS 500 penalties against water users diverting irrigation water without
     authorization. As a result, there was no unauthorized water taking any more in said
     WUA.
i.   In some WUAs, a lack of elementary water use skills was observed. RDWR
     inspectors and specialists organize workshops and training seminars, but they have a
     very limited impact on the skills of WUA managers in the light of the high staff
     turnover. It was suggested to improve WUA managers/members potential by
     inviting not only one person but 3-4 persons from each WUA to the workshops and
     training seminars, so that in case of retirement of key staff another staff would be
     familiar with the respective WUA issues.
j.   Almost all WUA managers have failed to answer the questionnaire’s questions
     addressed to them. This is not a good sign of accepting responsibility for WUA
     members.
k.   ISF collection level is relatively high (see graph below), representing 80% of the
     requested payment in 2012 (12% more than in 2011). WUA meetings are mostly
     held with raion representatives. Male water users are not very active in meetings,
     female water users not at all.

                        Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR

1.     The Government, through the DWRLI and its PIU, produced a comprehensive
“Project Completion Report” dated February 2014. It contains a main report summarizing
the achievements of the Project and the problems encountered by the PIU as well as con-
clusions and recommendations. In principle, the Borrower’s report follows the structure of
this Implementation Completion Report.

2.      The Report indicates that the design of the Project was judged consistent with
Government priorities and the need of the country. It acknowledges that the project design
also correctly identified the weak technical and financial performance of the DWRLI
requiring substantial improvement. Furthermore, it was accepted that there should be major
changes in the management and operational procedures as well as greater accountability
and transparency, in order to transform the DWRLI into an efficient and client-oriented
bulk water supply and management organization. The PIU noted that the priority list of
schemes prepared at appraisal was amended. These amendments were initiated by local
authorities due to the rapid deterioration of some off-farm systems and the poor social
situation prevailing in remote raions. The revised priority list was eventually agreed with
the Bank.

3.      The Report provides a detailed assessment of the implementation of all project
components and the outputs achieved. Particular attention is given to the implementation of
project component 2: water resources management. Though it is admitted that the Govern-
ment should have much earlier convened the NWC, much of the blame is attributed to the
international consulting firm’s weak assistance by inexperienced staff and the latter’s
demobilization without completing the contractually agreed activities, and without prior
approval by the PIU. With regard to lessons learnt from those activities implemented under
component 2, the following conclusions and recommendations have been drawn by the
PIU:
     Involvement of BWCs in basin planning is critically important to formulating well
        prepared and relevant basin plans and to actively engaging local organisations in
        water resource planning and management;
     Data collection systems have significantly deteriorated over the past 20 years and do
        not currently constitute an adequate or credible basis for basin water planning and
        management;
     Basin water planning at five-year intervals does not justify the creation of separate
        basin water planning unit within each basin. A central basin planning unit should
        therefore be established in the water resources wing of the SWA to assist BWAs in
        undertaking this periodic task. Routine tasks at the basin level should focus on data
        collection and analysis, as well as maintaining an up-to-date water balance for the
        basin, along with water and land cadastres;
     A small BWA unit could be created within the primary Obvladkhoz in a basin at
        minimal cost by drawing on existing personnel resources in the Obvladkhoz. This
        unit would be linked administratively to the Oblvodkhoz, but accountable to the
        SWA water resources unit which would be financed by donors;



                                             38
      BWAs which identify fundamental infrastructural deficiencies should have access to
       funds to address those deficiencies. As Government funds are limited, donor
       resources are critical in this regard and need to be linked with the requirements
       identified in basin plans; and
      The small size of the Kugart Basin suggests that planning and co-ordination in this
       and similar basins should be organized at the raion level and not at the oblast level.

4.      Regarding the low ISF charges covering only 20 to 25% of the required MOM
budget, the Report postulates the Government’s willingness to double the national budget
for O&M, together with targeted interventions to support the rehabilitation of I&D
infrastructure, which are constraining system performance. It recognized the significant
improvement in water supply as well as an increase in the amount of ISF collected from
water users following the transfer of the minor irrigation schemes to WUAs and FWUAs. It
was obvious that with an increase of the MOM budget the FWUAs were able to increase
expenditures on repair and maintenance of off-farm infrastructure. An overall increase in
the crop yields within the command area was also observed.

5.      The Report recognizes shortcomings in M&E during the first project years with
were eventually addressed by an international M&E Specialist recruited by the PIU rather
late in November 2011. Following his guidance, the PIU M&E Specialist then conducted
detailed impact evaluation surveys for 8 schemes completed between 2009 and 2012, and
for 7 schemes completed in 2013 comprising a total of 58 WUAs.

6.      Project impact was analyzed and ratings attributed to outcomes achieved as follows:

7.      Activities undertaken in project component 1 were considered to have been
successful, albeit with some minor shortcomings, such as contractors’ performance and
delays in implementation. It was emphasized again that the ISF levels for both off-farm and
on-farm works were set at levels which were not sufficient for an effective MOM of the
I&D systems. This component was rated in the Borrower’s Report as being ‘moderately
satisfactory’.

8.     Activities undertaken in project component 2 were considered also considered to
have been successful, although the late NWC meeting was considered to have significantly
delayed the implementation of this component which was also given a rating of
‘moderately satisfactory’.

9.      Activities undertaken in component 3 emphasized the successful establishment of
FWUAs and the fact that the originally planned target was exceeded. It is stated that the
Project had also demonstrated that the establishment of FWUAs is a viable activity, and
that the formation and provision of support to FWUAs should therefore continue in the
future to ensure that FWUAs become a key element of water resources management in the
country. This component was given a ‘satisfactory’ rating.

10.   Given that components 1 and 2 were rated as moderately satisfactory and that
component 3 achieved a satisfactory rating, the Report considered the overall rating for
WMIP as being ‘moderately satisfactory’ which is – it said - “a fair reflection of the


                                             39
project’s achievements with respect to its objectives, efficiency and relevance”. “Although
the shortcomings of Component 2 do raise some concerns about the future maintenance of
the off-farm systems and consequently the sustainability of the rehabilitation works”, it
continues, “further reforms of the DWRLI’s technical and financial procedures under
NWRMP will facilitate an improvement in the MOM of off-farm systems throughout the
country”.

11.     The Report also provides an economic analysis of the rehabilitation works of six
surveyed I&D schemes. The results of this analysis show that the net present values (NPVs)
range from KGS 20.0 million (Mogol) to KGS 100.0 million (LB Kugart), while the EIRRs
varied from 17% (Mogol) to 57% (LB Kugart). The analysis clearly demonstrated that all
the schemes are economically viable and that the rehabilitation of most schemes will
generate significant economic benefits. For schemes with lower EIRRs, i.e. Sary Kamysh
and Mogol, this was mainly due to the higher rehabilitation costs per hectare relative to
other schemes. However, when the analysis texted the EIRR assuming that the current
spending on the system O&M remains and capital repair every five year will be required,
the EIRRs dropped to below acceptable level for Sary Kamysh and Mogol.

12.     The performance of the World Bank was judged ‘satisfactory’ in view of the quality
and frequency of the implementation supervision missions. It was also well acknowledged
that the missions based their advice on field visits and thorough discussions with primary
stakeholders such as DWRLI (national, oblast and raion levels), Ministry of Finance,
WUAs and water users. The only minor shortcoming was seen in the early missions having
been “engineering-biased” with less attention being paid to agricultural and economic
aspects. However, this shortcoming was eventually addressed during the supervisory
missions carried out in the last three years of project implementation.

13.     The performance of the Borrower was also judged ‘satisfactory’ in the light of “the
DWRLI remaining fully supportive to the institutional changes required to improve the
management of water resources throughout the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as the
establishment of FWUAs and the transfer of minor irrigation works to WUAs. “However”,
the Report continues, “greater engagement of the DWRLI during the implementation of
Component 2 activities would have been beneficial”.
