                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project has a two-pronged development objective: (i) improving irrigation service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable increase in
                         irrigated agricultural productivity; and (ii) improving national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The WMIP is designed to achieve its' objectives through three project components: (i) Component 1: Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to secure the water
                         supply to around 85,000 ha ; (ii) Component 2: Management of water resources to achieve sustainable and efficient water resources management through implementation of the
                         Water Code, support to the State Committee for Water Resources and Land Improvement (SCWRLI) and support to Water Users Associations (WUAs) ; (iii) Component 3:
                         Organization of beneficiaries, supporting the formation and development of WUA Federations and the transfer of minor irrigation schemes to WUAs, thereby alleviating some of the

                         pressures on the SCWRLI to operate and maintain these systems.

                         The implementation of the project has been slower than planned. Under Component 1, rehabilitation works have been delayed due to the 2010 events in the south, under-resourced
                         contractors and shortcomings in the construction supervision process. If the project is not extended, it is expected that around 6 schemes, benefiting 80,000 water users, will only be

                         partially completed. Under Component 2, the implementation of the Water Code remains constrained by the fact that the Government has not yet convened the National Water
                         Council to give essential policy guidance on the institutional organization of the water sector. It is expected that with the new Government in place, this matter will be resolved.
                         Under Component 3 good progress has been made, and the transfer of minor irrigation schemes, the repairs on some schemes and the provision of equipment to manage these
                         schemes, is on-going.

                         In February 2011, the closing date of the project was extended by one year to December 31, 2012. However, the current rate of implementation is not sufficient to meet the PDOs
                         within the closing date, and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the implementing agency are to implement a number of actions to bring the project back to satisfactory
                         status.
