                         The project has a two-pronged development objective: (i) improving irrigation service delivery and water management for the benefit of a sustainable increase in
                         irrigated agricultural productivity; and (ii) improving national water resource governance for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The WMIP is designed to achieve its' objectives through three project components: (i) Component 1: Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to secure the water
                         supply to around 85,000 ha ; (ii) Component 2: Management of water resources to achieve sustainable and efficient water resources management through implementation of the
                         Water Code, support to the State Committee for Water Resources and Land Improvement (SCWRLI) and support to Water Users Associations (WUAs) ; (iii) Component 3:
                         Organization of beneficiaries, supporting the formation and development of WUA Federations and the transfer of minor irrigation schemes to WUAs, thereby alleviating some of the

                         The implementation of the project has been extended by almost two years in order to achieve the objectives before an extended project closing date of November 30, 2013. Under
                         Component 1, rehabilitation works have been delayed due to the 2010 events in the south, under-resourced contractors and shortcomings in procurement and the construction

                         planning/supervision process. Thirteen schemes have been completed, and 6 schemes are scheduled to be completed by November 30, 2013.

                         Under Component 2, the implementation of the Water Code was constrained by the fact that the Government had not convened the National Water Council (NWC) to give essential
                         policy guidance on the institutional organization of the water sector. It was expected in April 2012 that this would be resolved with the new Government in place, and a date for
                         convening the NWC had been set, but changes at the ministerial level in September 2012 delayed the NWC meeting. The NWC convened at last in February 2013 and adopted a
                         comprehensive road map for further development of the water sector and implementation of the Water Code. The project is currently supporting the Government with identifying and
                         preparing the technical assistance required for implementation of this roadmap. In June 2013, the project was restructured to make some of the target outcomes of the project more
                         realistic and in line with actual implementation progress.

                         Under Component 3 good progress has been made. Most notably, equipment to manage and maintain irrigation systems managed by WUA Federations (including both off-farm and
                         on-farm infrastructure) has been purchased and transferred to the Federations, and is currently being used for system maintenance.
