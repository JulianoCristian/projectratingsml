   Improvement Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: instead of\n            requiring organizational change, it may have been more\n            adequate to work with the existing department of water\n            resources and land improvement (DWRLI) divisions in order to\n            establish processes and procedures for improved water\n            resources management. Such a focus on practical and\n            achievable activities will have had more chances to yield\n            results within the originally six year period. Any follow-up\n            project like National Water Resources Management\n            Project-Phase 1 (NWRMP-1) should build on the past\n            experience, learning lessons from the relatively new\n            federation of water users associations (FWUAs), and\n            strengthening the irrigation water management and\n            maintenance capability of WUAs initiated under Second\n            On-farm Irrigation Project (OIP-2). A key factor will be\n            provision of suitable technical expertise in order to build\n            local capability, which is currently weak in the associated\n            disciplines. As experienced elsewhere in Central Asia, it is\n            crucial for the Kyrgyz Republic to modernize its systems of\n            WRM, particularly regarding the collection, processing,\n            analysis, and use of water resources and irrigation data.\n            Assisting the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic in these\n            endeavors, it is compulsory for the Bank to adjust the need\n            and speed of institutional reform not only in the water\n            sector to the sometimes very special political and cultural\n            conditions prevailing in the recipient country."}, "docdt": "2014-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
