                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The WMIP was designed to achieve its' objectives through three project components: (i) Component 1: Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to secure the water
                         supply to around 85,000 ha ; (ii) Component 2: Management of water resources to achieve sustainable and efficient water resources management through implementation of the
                         Water Code, support to the Department for Water Resources and Land Improvement (DWRLI) and support to Water Users Associations (WUAs) ; (iii) Component 3: Organization of
                         beneficiaries, supporting the formation and development of WUA Federations and the transfer of minor irrigation schemes to WUAs, thereby alleviating some of the pressures on the

                         DWRLI to operate and maintain these systems. The project closes November 30, 2013.

                         The implementation of the project has been extended by almost two years in order to achieve the objectives before an extended project closing date of November 30, 2013. Under
                         Component 1, rehabilitation works have been delayed due to the 2010 events in the south, under-resourced contractors and shortcomings in procurement and the construction

                         planning/supervision process. Seventeen schemes have been completed, and 3 schemes are scheduled to be completed by November 30, 2013, providing an area of around 70,200
                         ha with improved water supply. For 6 off-farm schemes rehabilitated in 2010, results indicate that water users satisfaction increased from 68% before rehabilitation to 84% after
                         rehabilitation, with collection of Irrigation Service Fee increased from 74% to 89%. However, studies under the project indicate that the overall budget allocated for Operation and
                         Maintenance for the schemes is only around 25-30% of what is required, jeopardizing the sustainability of rehabilitation investments and the long-term reliability of adequate water
                         supply.

                         Under Component 2, the implementation of the Water Code was constrained by the fact that the Government had not convened the National Water Council (NWC) to give essential
                         policy guidance on the institutional organization of the water sector. It was expected in April 2012 that this would be resolved with the new Government in place, and a date for
                         convening the NWC had been set, but changes at the ministerial level in September 2012 delayed the NWC meeting. The NWC convened at last in February 2013 and adopted a
                         comprehensive road map for further development of the water sector and implementation of the Water Code. The project is currently supporting the Government with identifying and
                         preparing a new project which will provide the technical assistance required for implementation of this roadmap. In June 2013, the project was restructured to make some of the target
                         outcomes of the project more realistic and in line with actual implementation progress. Core achievements under this component include: (i) the delegation of the functions of a State
                         Water Administration (SWA) to the DWRLI, as a pre-cursor to fully establishing the SWA as an independent agency; (ii) preparing detailed staffing and budget plans for the SWA; (iii)
                         preparation of a National Water Strategy; (iv) establishing two pilot River Basin Councils in Talas and Kugart basins, and preparing basin plans; (v) developing detailed management,
                         operation and maintenance plans according to revised procedures for 14 schemes; and (vi) introducing revised accounting practices for 6 schemes.

                         Under Component 3 good progress has been made. Most notably, equipment to manage and maintain irrigation systems managed by WUA Federations (including both off-farm and
                         on-farm infrastructure) has been purchased and transferred to the Federations, and is currently being used for system maintenance. Also, 24 minor irrigation schemes were
                         rehabilitated and transferred to the balance sheet of WUAs and WUA Federations.

                         Making further improvements to water resource management and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems are essential to the sustainability of water supply in Kyrgyzstan,
                         and have not been substantially achieved under this project. Additional support for these activities are to be provided under the proposed National Water Resource Management
                         Project - Phase 1, which is scheduled to start early 2014.
