THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          The Republic of Upper Volta
Amount:            SDR14.9 million (US$17.0 million)
Terms:             Standard
Relending Terms:  Government to OPT:  11.6 percent interest per annum, 20
year term, 5-year grace. The French Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will contribute US$13.0
million equivalent at 5 percent for 15 years including a
5-year grace period.
Project
Description:      The proposed project would provide the necessary further
extension of existing local and long distance services
and reliable telecommunications services in the south-
western and western provinces. Its main objectives are
to: (a) expand and improve telecommunications facilities
in and between towns with important economic activity,
population and demand for services; (b) strengthen the
institutional framework necessary for higher levels of
achievement in the sector; and (c) develop a sound financial
basis for future operations and investments. It would also
aim at providing technical assistance for planning, design,
installation of network extensions, maintenance and repair.
Benefits:          The principal beneficiaries of the project would be the
business sector, Government and other administrative
services. The project will stimulate commerce, encourage
decentralization, provide services to rural populations, and
reduce communications-related transport costs. Although not
all subscriber demand will be met, the present situation
will be greatly improved.
Risks:             Risks may arise due to delays in civil works or receipt/
installation of material or equipment. These risks are
considered to be acceptable with the proposed provision of
technical assistance to supervise installation and due to
the fact that in telecommunications projects, which comprise
a large number of independent activities, a delay in the
completion of a few works does not generally prevent the use
of the newly created assets. Institutional risks may result
due to poor management performance; however, these would be
minimized by the proposed Management Improvement Program,
which includes further technical assistance and training.

their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta in an amount equivalent
to SDR 14.9 million (US$17.0 million) on standard IDA terms to help finance
a Third Telecommunications Project. The French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) will contribute US$13.0 million equivalent on terms of 5
percent interest per annum with repayment over 15 years, including a five-year
grace period, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands will contribute a grant of
US$3.2 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum; Upper Volta"
(2146-UV) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 14, 1979.
Information from that report, together with information obtained during
economic missions in June 1980 and May 1981, is incorporated in the para-
graphs which follow. Annex I contains country data.
Socio-Economic Background
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$180 in 1979, Upper Volta is one of
the poorest African countries and is classified among the 29 "least developed
countries" by the United Nations. The economy is overwhelmingly rural. Total
land area is 274,000 km2, of which 194,000 km2 can be used for agriculture.
The physical constraints to development of the economy include extreme vari-
ability of rainfall, generally poor soils, few exploitable minerals, and the
country's landlocked position.
4.        The uneven distribution of population and severely underdeveloped
state of human resources pose major additional constraints to the country's
economic progress. Almost two-thirds of the resident population of 5.7
million (1979) is concentrated on the central plateau, which comprises one-
third of the arable land. The pressure of population on the plateau has led
to extensive degradation of soils in that area, resulting in persistently low
crop yields, and has given rise to large migration to the more fertile south-
west and to neighboring countries. Approximately 1 million Voltaics--over
half of the male labor force--is estimated to be working abroad, mainly in
Ivory Coast. The 1 percent annual outflow of migrant workers has reduced the
net population increase to only 1.6 percent over the past two decades despite
consistently high birth rates. While resettlement to the wetter regions of the
country and emigration represent important means of improving incomes for many
individuals and should be encouraged, Upper Volta will continue to face a



- 2 -
difficult, long-range development challenge to raise the productivity of food
production on the central plateau where most of the population will continue
to live. Enhancing the economic opportunities for the population as a whole
will also require an accelerated development of human capital, including
particularly an expansion of primary education which presently serves only
17 percent of the school age group. 1/
Performance of National Output
5.        Recent economic work has determined that real output of the primary
sector, which contributes almost 40 percent of total value-added, increased
by about 1.5 percent annually during the past decade, roughly equivalent to
the rate of population growth. This performance although modest, is better
than that of many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa over the period.
Cotton production expanded rapidly in response to the development of extension
and provision of inputs. Food output per capita declined slightly over the
decade. Because of the progressive loss in fertility of the central plateau,
the country has only been able to maintain approximate food self-sufficiency
through increasing reliance on the southwest, which has limited the resources
available in that region for greater cultivation of higher-value export crops
(mainly cotton). The livestock subsector suffered a severe setback as a
result of the major drought in 1974. An upward trend in production has been
apparent since 1975; however, the sector overall has shown no real growth in
value-added over the 1970-79 period.
6.        The official data on industrial production have recently been
revised and estimates of the trend in total output are still incomplete, buL
the information available suggests that the industrial sector, which accounts
for 12-14 percent of GDP, grew no faster than population during the past
decade. The main sources of growth in the economy were construction, commerce,
and other services, with the greatest expansion in these activities reflecting
the substantial increase in externally-financed development projects which
followed the drought in mid-decade.
7.        In sum, the Voltaic economy held its ground during the 1970s and
some increases in per capita income were obtained from the tertiary sector.
However, the dominant features of the Voltaic economy -- continued overculti-
vation of soils on the central plateau under traditional methods, a predomi-
nantly illiterate work force, extreme vulnerability to climatic variation and
to international price movements -- make it evident that the country still has
a very weak basis for sustained economic growth.
Balance of Payments
8.        Upper Volta's trade balance has progressively deteriorated over
the past decade as the growth of exports, which consist almost entirely of
agricultural and livestock products, has failed to keep pace with the growth
1/   As compared to over 50 percent in all low income countries in sub-Saharan
Africa. See Annex 1.

of imports. Factors enlarging the deficit have included credit expansion and
rising domestic investment, which enhanced the demand for capital goods, and
shortfalls in food production coupled with the rising cost of fuel and related
imports. Until 1975, however, private transfers, especially workers' remit-
tances, and increasing aid flows kept the overall balance of payments in
surplus. From 1976 to 1978, the deficit in the external account widened
annually as the trade gap grew faster than the inflow of official aid. The
external account showed a temporary surplus in 1979 as a result of loans
received to pay off budgetary arrears and a buildup of external funds in
certain project accounts, but a substantial shortfall reappeared in 1980.
Public Finance
9.        Prior to 1975, the Government's conservative fiscal policies enabled
it to accumulate large budget surpluses which were reflected in an accumulated
cash balance of CFAF 9.3 billion (US$39.6 million) in 1974. This pattern of
tightly restrained expenditure changed in 1975 with an increased commitment to
investment and heightened spending on defense, personnel and administration.
Despite a doubling of government current revenues from about CFAF 16 billion
(US$68.2 million) in 1975 to CFAF 31 billion in 1979 (US$145.7 million), an
overall Treasury deficit of at least CFAF 2 billion (US$8.5 million) has
appeared each year since 1976. This imbalance reached nearly CFAF 7 billion
(US$35.7 million) in 1979.
10.       The sources of this increasing deficit in Treasury operations are
multiple: expanded investment expenditure, increases in public sector wages,
a slowdown in tariff receipts, and weaknesses in tax collection. The deficit
has been financed largely by drawing-down deposits with the Central Bank,
external borrowing (including assistance from the IMF and commercial banks)
and an accumulation of payment arrears to domestic suppliers, many of which
were cleared in 1979. The financial situation of the Treasury is complicated
considerably by the lack of coordination between investment planning and the
programming of budgetary expenditures. Moreover, the Government suffers
from generally weak financial controls as evidenced by a proliferation of
extra-budgetary accounts in the Treasury, the lack of centralized reporting of
foreign assistance receipts, and an inadequate review of budgetary requests.
The Government and the IMF are presently discussing an adjustment program for
1982, including measures to strengthen the financial situation of public
enterprises, limitations on civil service salaries and recruitment, and
improvements in tax administration.
Foreign Assistance and Investment
11.       Gross domestic investment, which averages about one quarter of GDP,
is financed almost entirely by foreign official inflows. The planning of
development expenditure has consisted largely of compiling projects for which
donor financing is assured or likely. Although three development plans have
been prepared, the latest covering the 1977/81 period, the process of formu-
lating the investment programs has involved little evaluation and selection of
projects by Government based upon economic criteria and development priori-
ties. In cooperation with the IMF, the Bank has reviewed with the Government



- 4 -
needed reforms of the financial management and investment planning process
and a possible technical assistance project to implement them is under discus-
sion.
12.       Despite the absence of a distinct investment program, foreign aid to
Upper Volta has continued at a high level, with both commitments and disburse-
ments of official inflows exceeding total budget revenues throughout most of
the 1970s. Most of this aid is on highly concessional terms. The principal
foreign donors are France, the European Development Fund, Canada, the Nether-
lands, Germany, the United States, the Association, and the UNDP.
13.       Foreign capital and technical assistance clearly have a vital role
to play in the development of Upper Volta. In view of the country's poverty
and limited resources, it is appropriate for external lending agencies to
continue to provide assistance on highly concessionary terms and to finance
a high proportion of project costs, including a substantial amount of local
costs.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN UPPER VOLTA
14.       The Bank Group's commitments in Upper Volta, as of March 1, 1982,
amount to US$191 million and cover twenty-two IDA credits. IFC has one
investment. About US$87 million have been disbursed. The IDA projects
include eleven agriculture (including two supplementary credits), five trans-
portation (including one supplementary credit), two education, two telecom-
munications, one small and medium scale enterprise, and one urban development
project. The IFC investment is for plastic production. Of total IDA lending,
the agriculture and transportation sectors account for 44 and 40 percent,
respectively. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC
commitments as of March 1, 1982. It also includes information on the status
of ongoing projects.
15.       A few projects have experienced implementation delays necessitating
extensions of closing dates and world price inflation has led to cost overruns,
requiring supplementary financing (Third Highway Project, Cr. 653-UV, US$20.0
million, 1976, and EEC Special Action Credit 38, US$3.5 million, 1980; West
Volta Agricultural Development Project, Cr. 706-UV, US$3.6 million (IDA) and
Can.$3.0 million (Canada), 1977, and EEC Special Action Credit 49, US$3.0
million, 1980; Urban Development Project, Cr. 766-UV, US$8.2 million, 1978)
or eliminating lower priority components. Financial control on some projects
has been weak. Furthermore, partly due to fiscal management problems the Gov-
ernment has had difficulty in promptly meeting its counterpart funding obliga-
tions. Future projects will address these issues by the provision of further
project-related technical assistance and training as well as through a pro-
posed Technical Assistance Project to improve the financial management and
investment planning and budgeting process. On the whole, however, past proj-
ect performance has been generally satisfactory given the environmental,
institutional and managerial constraints within the country.



- 5 -
16.       Upper Volta's disbursement performance has been normal compared to
other countries in the region. Recently however, its performance has begun to
deteriorate mainly due to lack of counterpart funds as a result of current
budgetary difficulties, delays in project effectiveness (Bougouriba II), and
signing (Highways IV). The Bank is helping to tackle these problems by ensur-
ing that Government is aware of forthcoming counterpart obligations and by
offering increased assistance from the Bank's Resident Representative during
the period prior to project effectiveness. We are also discussing a technical
assistance project which would specifically address the investment planning
and budgeting process.
17.       The Bank Group's lending is in line with the Government's priori-
ties as expressed in its Third Development Plan (1977/81), and will continue
to support the Government's efforts to: (a) increase productivity in agricul-
ture, from which most of the population derives its livelihood; (b) improve
the human resource base; (c) strengthen basic infrastructure facilities; and
(d) mobilize resources from co-donors. The Government is currently working on
a Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (1982/86) with UNDP assistance. Priori-
ties are, however, not expected to differ from those of the Third Plan.
18.       In the near-term (FY82-83), Bank Group lending for Upper Volta will
include second phase agricultural development projects for both food and cash
crops for the West Volta Regional Development Organizations (ORDs) of Hauts-
Bassins and Volta Noire and a pilot agricultural development project for the
ORD of Koudougou. A second rail project is envisaged, to be executed with the
Ivory Coast. Further envisaged projects are: a hydro-electric power project
and a technical assistance project to strengthen the Government's development
investment planning and budgetary programming procedures. In the medium-term,
the Bank assistance strategy toward Upper Volta envisages combining our present
commitment to the promotion of food and export crop production with a new
emphasis on agricultural research, development of human resources through
basic education and health, and through the strengthening of aid coordination.
19.       Upper Volta's external public debt at the end of 1980 amounted
to US$508.0 million (including US$185.0 million undisbursed) of which IDA
credits accounted for about 25 percent. The ratio of debt service to exports
of goods and services was 7.6 percent in 1980. Since most loans to Upper
Volta have been made on concessionary terms and a number of donors have
recently converted their outstanding loans into grants, the debt service
ratio is not likely to increase significantly over the next several years.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Sector Background
20.       Efficient telecommunications services are vital for stimulating
Upper Volta's economic development outside the main centers (Ouagadougou, the
capital and Bobo-Dioulasso, the second main economic center) and for reducing



- 6 -
communications-related transport costs. With numerous and remote rural
population centers, large distances between them and poor transport facilities,
access to communications is a basic prerequisite for development and tends to
be the least cost means for maintaining contact. However, present local
networks are saturated and telephone density remains one of the lowest in the
world: 0.16 telephones per 100 inhabitants as compared with other developing
countries: Kenya 1.05, Senegal 0.79, Tunisia 2.65, India 0.38, Pakistan 0.40
and Thailand 0.91. The telephone density of Upper Volta's two main cities
averaged 1.97. About 80 percent of the main telephone lines are installed in
Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. Almost all telephone lines are connected to
automatic exchanges. Subscriber long distance dialing has been introduced in
the domestic network and with France, while in provincial towns with more than
10,000 inhabitants, telephone service is provided through small manual switch-
boards. Telegraph service and public telephones are available at the post
office in those few localities provided with telephone service. In remote
locations without telephone service, transmission of messages is by morse
telegraphy via radio.
21.       A recent survey of telephone directory listings for three provincial
towns with local and long distance subscriber dialing and for six smaller
towns with small manual exchanges shows that a very high proportion of main
telephone lines are used for public service and administration activities and
for business communication.
Organization
22.       The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is the licensing
authority for the telecommunications sector. From its creation in 1968,
the Office des Postes et Telecommunications (OPT), an autonomous govern-
ment entity, has provided all domestic and regional telephone, telegraph and
telex services in addition to the usual postal/financial services, including
postal checking accounts. Since 1977, OPT also provides international over-
seas telecommunications services. Upper Volta does not manufacture telecommu-
nications equipment. OPT's statute gives it an industrial and commercial
character and endows it with legal and financial autonomy. Control and policy
direction are provided by OPT's Board of Directors. Management and opera-
tions are under the responsibility of the Director General who is OPT's Chief
Executive, assisted by a Deputy Director General, both appointed by the
Government. Operations are decentralized on a territorial basis through five
regional directorates. OPT's headquarters organization consists of eight
departments responsible for: (i) Telecommunications; (ii) Postal and Finan-
cial Services; (iii) Administration and Personnel; (iv) Finance and General
Accounting; (v) Buildings and Transports; (vi) Studies and Planning; (vii) the
National Posts and Telecommunications School; and (viii) The National Savings
Bank (Caisse Nationale d'Epargne). The Postal Branch of OPT performs the
usual postal services, operates a Postal Checking Account System (PCAS) and
collects and disburses funds on behalf of the Caisse Nationale d'Epargne.
23.       OPT's present organization, as described above, needs to be further
refined. Too many subordinates (13) report directly to the Director General
and no particular responsibilities have been assigned to the Deputy Director



- 7 -
General. Moreover, the latter position has been vacant since January 1981.
To alleviate the Director General's workload and to ensure efficient coor-
dination and optimum separation of responsibilities between OPT-s headquarters
organizational units and its regional offices. Government and OPT agreed
during negotiations to reorganize OPT-s top management structure in a manner
satisfactory to the Association.
Existing Facilities
24.       Since the commissioning of the new transmission and switching
facilities under the second IDA project (Cr. 431-UV), the quality of the
local, domestic long distance and overseas telephone service in Upper Volta
has been generally above the rather poor quality of service available in
many other western African countries. This applies primarily to those
subscribers who have access to automatic telephone and telex services. Upper
Volta has presently eight automatic local telephone exchanges. The outside
plants in urban areas are saturated, fault prone, and repairs are often slow.
The proposed project is aimed partly at improving the reliability and capacity
of these local networks which are now the weakest link of the present Voltaic
telecommunications system. Unsatisfied expressed demand represents about
20 percent of the total recorded demand (1980) and is expected to keep in-
creasing until the commissioning of the new facilities.
Sectoral Development Objectives and Strategy
25.       The sector objectives during the initial stages of development
in Upper Volta have been to: (a) establish reliable telecommunications
facilities in and between towns with the most important economic activity,
population and demand for services; (b) establish a sound institutional and
management framework for sector development; and (c) develop a sound financial
basis for future operations and investments. Current strategy for future
development in the sector still reflects the same objectives but aims at
higher levels of achievement. Reliable telecommunications services will be
established in six additional provincial towns and further extensions of local
and long distance services will be provided in and between the two main cities
and four provincial towns where these services have been introduced by the
previous projects. Regarding institution building, the framework of a satis-
factory autonomous entity has been established but implementation needs
improvement. Management, operations, maintenance, accounting and training all
need to be improved in order to adequately maintain and operate the expanding
network. The development of a sound financial basis for future investments
also remains a major objective of the sector.
26.       OPT's telecommunications investment program for the period 1982-1986,
designed to support Government s current economic development objectives, aims
at: (a) meeting at least 75 percent of the rapidly growing expressed demand
by the end of 1986 in Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and other main cities; and
(b) expanding reliable telecommunications services in the southwestern and
western provinces where many rural development investments are underway. It
also provides for an increase of the number of telephones in operation from
10,300 to about 22,000 by the end of 1986, or some 0.32 telephones per 100
inhabitants. Over the same period, the number of connected main lines is
expected to increase at 16 percent per annum.



- 8 -
27.       The primary constraint in the sector is a shortage of middle level
administrators and engineers and intermediate and lower level skilled techni-
cal manpower. In recent years, political pressure on OPT's management dis-
rupted a competent and dedicated management team and resulted in overstaffing
(mainly with unskilled manpower). A freeze on the total number of staff and
a substantial technical assistance component included in the proposed third
project, as well as on-the-job training during project execution, are expected
to improve the situation.
Bank Sectoral Experience
28.       The telecommunications sector in Upper Volta has received two IDA
credits. The first, (Cr. 141-UV, US$0.8 million, 1969) helped to establish
an autonomous commercially orientated public utility, and rehabilitated and
expanded the local distribution network in the country's two main cities,
constructed long distance overhead lines in the country's interior and re-
viewed telecommunication tariffs. The June 976 Audit Report concluded that
OPT became an efficient organization, established a satisfactory accounting
system and managed to recruit and train competent executives and reduce its
dependence on expatriate services. The second project (Cr. 431-UV, US$4.5
million, 1973) helped finance automatic telephone exchanges in the two main
cities and in four provincial towns and the expansion of associated transmis-
sion routes and local networks. Both projects were well implemented and
completed on schedule. The second project's Completion Report (an Audit
Report is under preparation) concluded that the number of subscribers added
to the system was 34 percent above appraisal target, that increases of traffic
and operating revenues also largely exceeded original plans, and that a
reasonably satisfactory level of service was achieved in those areas where new
telecommunications facilities were made available. However, during the second
project OPT was less successful in maintaining managerial and financial
improvements achieved under the first project. Political pressures resulted
in excess hiring and investment (beyond the IDA-financed projects), and in
poor financial management.
29.       In recent years, adherence to accounting procedures declined con-
siderably and the external auditor could not certify OPT's accounts for the
years 1975 through 1978. However, in the context of preparation activities
for the proposed project, funds were allocated under the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) for technical assistance to OPT, and as a result the accounts
for 1979 and 1980 were certified. Nonetheless, further improvements are
required and, under the proposed project, additional technical assistance will
be provided for a two-year period to assist and train the accounting staff and
to ensure that adequate accounting and internal control systems will be in
place.
30.       Unauthorized use of funds by OPT from the Postal Checking Account
System (PCAS) resulted in a gradual relaxation of financial discipline.
Despite a covenant under the second project intended to limit borrowing from
the PCAS, OPT has utilized about CFAF 4.6 billion (US$17.1 million equivalent)
from the system: about CFAF 2.4 billion by the Telecommunications branch for



- 9 -
investments in addition to the second IDA project, and CFAF 2.2 billion by the
Postal branch to cover postal deficits. In order to put the PCAS again on a
financially sound basis, the amounts withdrawn by OPT from the PCAS will be
paid back. To avoid future utilization of PCAS funds by OPT, the Government
has already instructed OPT to honor existing legal agreements which bar OPT
from utilizing PCAS funds for investments and operations, and to transfer all
new funds deposited in the PCAS to designated financial intermediaries. OPT
is now only entitled to keep a working balance on hand to accommodate with-
drawals. In addition, during negotiations, OPT agreed that the PCAS funds
used by the Telecommunications branch would be repaid by OPT in equal annual
installments over a ten-year period (1983-1992), while the Government agreed
to repay to the PCAS the funds used by OPT to cover Postal branch deficits
(for which Government is liable) also in equal annual installments over a
period of ten years (Sections 3.04 and 4.03 of Credit and Project Agreements
respectively).
31.       The poor financial performance of the Postal branch is primarily
due to overstaffing and inadequate service. Postal tariffs were increased by
30 percent in 1976 and by another 10 percent in 1981; further tariff increases
at this time would only marginally reduce future postal deficits and likely
result in further decreases in usage of the postal system. The third project
proposes to provide technical assistance to put the postal service on a more
commercial and efficiently run basis and to limit personnel to present levels.
Moreover, during negotiations, Government assured the Association that it
would provide promptly, as required, all funds necessary to cover Postal
branch deficits incurred during the project implementation period (Section
3.05 of Credit Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The proposed project would provide funds for the necessary further
extensions of existing local and long distance services and reliable telecom-
munications services in the southwestern and western provinces where many
rural development projects are being undertaken.
33.       The project was identified in June 1979 following Government's
request for further investment in the telecommunications sector, and was
appraised in February 1981. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from
February 22 to 25, 1982; the Upper Voltan delegation was led by H.E. Charles
H. Bambara, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. A report entitled "Staff
Appraisal Report - Third Telecommunications Project" dated March 25, 1982
is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Supplementary
project data is contained in Annex III.
Description
34.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) about 3,600 lines of local automatic telephone exchange equipment
in Ouagadougou and about 4,000 lines in Bobo-Dioulasso;



- 10 -
(b) provision of six containerized telephone exchanges totaling about
1,200 lines to be installed in the towns of Dedougou, Diebougou,
Gaoua, Koupela, Tenkodogo and Tougan;
(c) extension of the national automatic transit exchange in Ouagadougou
and installation of central automatic message accounting (CAMA)
equipment for both long distance and international traffic;
(d) construction of ducts and installation of subscriber cables and
distribution cabinets in the urban local networks of Ouagadougou
and Bobo-Dioulasso, and construction of local networks in the six
above-mentioned provincial towns;
(e) construction of the following transmission routes:
(i) Ouagadougou-Dedougou long distance cable;
(ii) Dedougou-Bobo-Dioulasso; and
(iii) Bobo-Dioulasso-Diebougou-Gaoua (120 channel microwave links);
(f) engineering consultants to assist OPT in bid evaluation, supervision
of civil works construction and microwave installation, supervision
of the installation of urban cable networks (including on-the-job
training of Voltaic technicians), preparation and implementation
of maintenance procedures and organization of maintenance and repair
services; and
(g) technical assistance and training through a Management Improvement
Program (MIP) for OPT's Postal branch, accounting department, and
data processing services, as well as expert review of staffing
requirements, and tariffs.
Special Features and Project Implementation
35.       OPT will be responsible for project implementation.  Consultants
financed under the PPF have completed the planning and design of local network
extension and transmission routes as well as the preparation of bid documents.
The bids covering these goods were invited at the end of February, 1982 and
the closing date for these bids is June 30, 1982. OPT intends to employ the
same consultants for: (a) bid evaluation, procurement, supervision of micro-
wave links, multiplex and switching equipment installation; (b) local network
design, supervision of civil work construction and cable installation; and
(c) quality and performance testing in the factory and final inspection, and
testing on site. The suppliers would install the main equipment; most of the
civil works for the local networks is expected to be carried out by local
contractors under the supervision of the consultants. Outside plant installa-
tion would be carried out by OPT staff with the consultants assistance and
supervision. The consulting services include a substantial element of formal
and on-the-job training of Voltaic technicians and transfer of know-how to



- 11 -
local contractors in charge of civil works (telephone ducts and manholes).
OPT's management, which would be further strengthened through technical
assistance and training provided under the MIP is capable of carrying out this
project satisfactorily. IDA would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of consultants and experts costing on average US$12,000 per man-month.
These costs are in line with previous experience in Upper Volta and franco-
phone West Africa in general. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
OPT that the MIP will be carried out in accordance with a timetable and under
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (Section 2.08 of Project Agreement).
Project completion is scheduled for September 30, 1986.
Project Costs and Financing
36.       The total cost of the project, including the PPF advance of US$0.5
million, is estimated at US$40.6 million with a foreign exchange component
of US$28.6 million. A detailed breakdown of costs is shown in the table of
the Credit and Project Summary. The proposed IDA credit of SDR14.9 million
(US$17.0 million) would finance 42 percent of project costs. The proceeds of
the IDA credit would be used to finance needed technical assistance, transmis-
sion equipment and materials, civil works and vehicles. Government would
onlend the IDA Credit to OPT at 11.6 percent per annum for 20 years including
a five-year grace period. This rate is expected to be positive over the
project implementation period with respect to recent (about 12 percent in
1981) and projected (about 9 percent by 1986) domestic inflation rates and
is somewhat above current domestic interest rates (about 10.5 percent) on
loans to public enterprises. The project would be cofinanced by the French
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), and Dutch bilateral aid. It
has been agreed that each lending agency would finance their respective
project components on a parallel basis. CCCE would finance foreign and local
costs of part of the switching equipment and local networks in six A'-ovincial
towns. The CCCE loan, totaling US$13.0 million equivalent, would be made to
Government for onlending to OPT at 5 percent per annum for 15 years with
5 years of grace. Foreign costs for the supply and installation of a long
distance cable would be financed by a Dutch bilateral aid grant of US$3.2
million equivalent. All foreign exchange costs and 38 percent of local costs
would be borne by IDA, CCCE and Dutch bilateral aid. OPT would finance out of
its own resources the remaining local costs amounting to US$7.4 million
equivalent (18 percent of total project costs). Since project preparation
is already well-advanced and detailed design of the major components is
completed, no physical contingencies have been included in the cost estimates.
Financial Aspects
37.       Under the second project the financial performance of the Telecom-
munications branch over the period 1974-1979 has been mixed, but in most
years OPT met the requirements of the revenue covenant which called for a
rate of return of 6 percent on the current value of average net fixed assets
in operation during the period 1974-1978 and of 8 percent in 1979 and there-
after. In 1979 a steep decline started in the operating results and the rate



- 12 -
of return decreased to 5.7 percent, principally due to overstaffing combined
with sharp salary increases. The rate of return improved to 7.4 percent in
1980, and is estimated to be 6.9 percent in 1981. Following completion of the
tariff study (end 1982), OPT intends to modify the tariff structure and level
to yield an average increase in telecommunications revenues of 15 percent,
effective January 1, 1983.
38.       In view of Upper Volta's rapid telecommunications development and
the considerable accompanying investment expenditures, a review of the tele-
communications tariff structure is needed. During negotiations, assurances
were given that OPT would carry out a tariff study to be completed by
December 31, 1982, and that it will appoint consultants whose qualifications
and terms of reference would be acceptable to the Association (Section 2.02 of
Project Agreement). Following the tariff study, OPT intends to introduce a
tariff increase of at least 15 percent as o' January 1, 1983 to achieve the
covenanted rates of return (Section 3.09 of Credit Agreement).
39.       Operating income and ratio are expected to show improvement as the
combined effect of measures to curb operating expenses mainly due to a pro-
posed staff freeze, drop increases in number of lines in service and the
proposed tariff increase take hold. The rate of return on the current value
of average net fixed assets in service would increase from 7.3 percent in 1982
to 13.5 in 1983, 17.4 percent in 1984 and about 19 percent thereafter. The
current ratio would be satisfactory, increasing from 1.7 in 1982 to 2.2 in
1987, reflecting an improved cash position. The debt/equity ratio and the
annual debt service coverage ratio would be at 32/68 and 3.4 respectively by
1987; there would be room for future borrowing during most of the implementa-
tion period. Net internal cash generation would show very satisfactory
progress, increasing from 23 percent of total applications in 1982 to 81
percent in 1987, giving an overall contribution of 55 percent. During
negotiations government assurances were obtained that OPT would: (i) achieve
a rate of return of at least 13 percent in 1983 and 15 percent in 1984 and
thereafter on the current value of average net fixed assets in operation;
(ii) seek IDA approval before incurring new debts unless maximum future debt
service requirements are covered at least 1.5 times; and (iii) apply funds
from telecommunications operations to other OPT purposes only after all
Telecommunications branch requirements have been met (Sections 4.05 to 4.07
of Project Agreement).
40.       Accounts receivable from the private sector as of the end of 1981
stood at about four months of billing. In view of the bimonthly billing
cycle, this is acceptable. However, as of December 31, 1981 Government owed
OPT CFAF 797 million for telecommunications services, equivalent to 15 months
of billing, even though it had agreed under the second project to pay its
bills promptly. The Government has assured the Association that it will set-
tle part of the arrears (up to CFAF 150 million) before March 31, 1982, with
the remainder to be paid prior to December 31, 1982. It further agreed during
negotiations that it would promptly pay its bills for telecommunications usage
within four months of receipt at the latest (Section 3.06 of Credit Agree-
ment).



- 13 -
41.       In order to turn around the recent decline in OPT's financial
performance, measures need to be taken to curb the increase in personnel
operating expenses. During negotiations, OPT gave assurances that the total
number of OPT's permanent staff will be frozen, for the duration of the
project implementation period, at the level existing as of the end of 1980,
and that the amount allocated for temporary and occasional staff will be
frozen, in real terms, at the 1981 budget level (Section 3.03 of Project
Agreement).
Investment Program
42.       In addition to the proposed project, OPT plans to undertake during
the period 1982-1986 other investments for a total of US$31.3 million, in-
cluding a foreign exchange component of about US$24.5 million. The total
program cost includes about US$19.4 million of preinvestments and investments
for the next five year program (1986-1990) and also up to US$5.0 million
equivalent for the Liptako-Gourma telecommunications project. This amount
corresponds to one-third of the revised cost of the Upper Volta share of the
regional project, which has been reviewed and significantly scaled down by
the Government. The Government confirmed, during negotiations, that it will
finance two-thirds of the annual investments expenditures incurred for the
Upper Volta part of the Liptako-Gourma telecommunications project with OPT
financing the remaining third; Government will therefore assume, effective
1981, the African Development Bank and Nigerian Trust Funds Credits, pre-
viously charged against OPT. Furthermore, during negotiaLions, assurances
were given by OPT that no additional works outside the agreed program involv-
ing capital expenditures greater than US$1 million equivalent in any one year
would be undertaken during the project period without prior agreement of IDA
(Sections 3.07 of Credit Agreement and 4.04 of Project Agreement). The latter
covenant would supersede Section 4.07 of the second Project Agreement (Cr.
431-UV), which limited such additional investments to US$200,000 equivalent.

Procurement, Disbursement and Audits
43.       The following procurement procedures, similar to those satisfactorily
used for preceding projects, would apply:
US$
Project Element                         Million         Procurement Procedure
(i)  Cables and outside plant                    (i)  International Competitive
material for Ouagadougou and       7.0           Bidding (ICB)
Bobo-Dioulasso
(ii)  Microwave links and multiplex              (ii)  ICB
equipment                          3.9
(iii)  Civil Works                        2.8   (iii)  ICB, with a 7.5 percent
preference margin for
local contractors
(iv)  Vehicles and tools                 0.5    (iv)  ICB or local competitive
bidding if contract less
than US$40,000 equivalent
(v)  Consultants (including PPF)        2.8      (v)  World Bank guidelines
Total       17.0
44.      The IDA credit will be disbursed on the following basis:
US$
Project Element                         Million         Disbursement Percentage
(i)  PPF                                0.5      (i)  100 percent
(ii)  Materials and equipment            8.7    (ii)  100 percent of foreign
expenditures
(iii)  Civil Works                        2.2   (iii)  60 percent
(iv)  Tools and Vehicles                 0.4    (iv)  100 percent of foreign ex-
penditures, and 75 percent
of local expenditures
(v)  Consultants Services               1.8      (v)  100 percent of foreign
expenditures
(vi)  Unallocated                        3.4    (vi)  -
Total       17.0
All disbursements, to be completed by June 30, 1987 from the credit account,
would be fully documented.



- 15 -
45.       The present external auditing arrangements are satisfactory but, in
the past, the auditors' reports were issued with considerable delays due to
the fact that OPT frequently postponed closing of the books far beyond the end
of the fiscal year. However, the Government has asked OPT to close its 1980
books on time and financial statements for that year were ready in May 1981;
the external audit took place immediately afterwards. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government that OPT would continue to use
external auditors acceptable to IDA and submit the annual external auditors'
report within six months after the end of each fiscal year (Section 4.02 of
the Project Agreement).
Economic Analysis, Benefits and Risks
46.       The internal financial rate of return on the 1982-1986 investment
program is 25 percent. Using a conversion factor of 0.83 for local costs, and
assuming that new subscribers are willing to pay the same tariffs in real
terms as existing subscribers, the estimated economic rate of return of OPT's
1982-1986 investment program is 30 percent. This estimate understates total
program benefits, since it does not include the consumer surplus which callers
or subscribers receive, and does not fully account for external benefits
associated with transport substitution, business opportunity, and administra-
tive efficiency.
47.       Beneficiaries of the project would primarily be the business sector
and Government and other administrative services. The investment program
which would extend services to the south-western and western provinces where
many agricultural projects are being implemented is specifically designed to
support Government's current economic development program which includes
balanced regional development and a greater integration of the entire popula-
tion in the development process. Establishment of a reliable telecommunica-
tions system is vital to stimulating commerce, agriculture related activities,
and small-scale industry outside of the major metropolitan areas, furthermore,
good telecommunications encourage decentralization, and reduce transport and
communications related costs for all economic and social sectors.
48.       There are no unusual risks associated with the program.  A possible
risk may arise out of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen cir-
cumstances, such as delays in civil works for local networks and receipt of
material or equipment, or installation of equipment and plant. However, the
previous project was implemented according to schedule. With the assistance
of engineering and management consultants appointed by OPT, implementation of
the proposed project is expected without major delays. Institutional risks
would be minimized through the Management Improvement Program's technical
assistance and training. A sensitivity analysis on the economic rate of
return indicates that a 10 percent increase in capital expenditures and
operating expenses together with a 10 percent decrease in operating revenues
would result in a rate of return of 25 percent.

C..  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION (as of March 1, 1982) 1/
Credit 557:    Livestock Development Project.  US$6.0 Million Credit of
June 18, 1975; Effective Date: November 24, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project is assisting cattle production in the Dedougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso ORDs through group ranch development, improvement of veterinary
services, livestock marketing and meat processing facilities and the provision
of technical assistance. The project, which has been extended one year to the
end of 1982, is entering its last year of operation. It is anticipated that
by the end of the yeas almost all the project's goals would have been achieved.
The cattle market is about to be completed and 30 vaccinations yards will be
completed during the third quarter of 1982; the problem of access to the
holding ground is about to be solved. After a slow start the project's group
ranch component is now progressing well and the three pilot ranches, totalling
about 80,000 ha are fully developed and stocked with 9,000 head of cattle,
owned by 75 families. Two more ranches are about to be created or a BND
credit.
Credit 640:    Rural Development Fund II Project.  US$9.4 Million Credit
of June 21, 1976; Effective Date: January 24, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project provides a line of credit to the Rural Development
Fund for investment in small-scale rural projects, the main purpose of which
is to increase crop production and improve village water supplies. By the
conclusion   of the last construction campaign (September 30, 1981) the
project had realized: erosion control works (15,050 ha); bottomland develop-
ment (1,885 ha); small scale irrigation and improved bottomland development
(315 ha); construction of 569 wells, 160 tube wells and some 340 village
level buildings including inter alia stores, meeting rooms and training
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular, to report any problems which
are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

centers; had provided medium-term credit for agricultural equipment; and,
as part of the unidentified component, financed production of forest tree
seedlings for village woodlots. An appropriate field trial program has been
developed and project results are being closely monitored. The project has
been well managed and the RDF management unit has been used to handle funds
for small scale actions provided by other donors. Not all appraisal targets
were reached, however, because Government priorities and farmers' expectations
have led project management to put more emphasis on erosion control works
(164% of appraisal target) and well construction (109%) and less on bottomland
development (70%) and small-scale irrigation (63%). To allow RDF to maintain
its present rate of activities until the proposed third phase project is
approved, the Government has obtained additional funds from the Netherlands.
Credit 653:    Third Highway Project.  US$20.0 Million Credit of July 15, 1976;

EEC Special    US$3.5 Million Equivalent; Credit of January 11, 1980;
Action:         Effective Date:  July 30, 1980; Closing Date:  June 30, 1982
Credit 38:
The project consists of: (a) reconstruction of the Banfora-Bobo-
Dioulasso-Hounde road (183 km); (b) procurement of vehicle weight control
and traffic counting equipment; (c) road maintenance study; (d) preinvest-
ment study of the Ouagadougou-Kaya-Dori road; (e) technical assistance to
the Department of Transport (DOT); and (f) technical assistance to the domes-
tic contracting industry. The Bobo-Dioulasso-Hounde section was completed
in June 1978, and the Bobo-Dioulasso-Banfora section in May 1979. Equipment
for vehicle weight control and traffic counting arrived in November 1979.
The technical assistance to the DOT has been in place since January 1977.
The Road Maintenance Study has been completed by BCEOM and reviewed, and has
served as the basis for the Fourth Highway Project. Arrangements for provid-
ing technical assistance to domestic contractors are being finalized. In view
of a project cost overrun due to currency realignments and the need to recon-
struct four bridges, initially not included in the project, supplementary
financing of US$3.5 million is being provided through the EEC Special Action
Account. Delays in the execution of civil works due to contractor problems
has resulted in slower than anticipated implementation. These problems are
now largely resolved and the required civil works are underway.

Credit 49:
The project sought to strengthen the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and
Dedougou through provision of technical assistance and equipment; establishing
a Financial and Administrative Unit to assist project accounting and financial
control; financing a ginnery and training facilities for project extension
workers; supporting an annual extension program; developing low cost irriga-
tion schemes; and implementing a pilot settlement component and a pilot
women's component. Cumulative incremental production of cotton over the
five years of the project to date is estimated at 63,000 tons, compared to
56,000 tons at appraisal; and for cereals 29,500 tons compared to 32,000 tons
at appraisal. Most of the physical targets have been met, including construc-
tion of 75 village grain stores, a training center, and a new ginnery.
However, execution of the irrigation and women's components has been slow.
The settlement component has not been executed. Aided by favorable weather,
incremental cotton production in 1979/80 (19,000 tons) was double the appraisal
estimate. Cereal production is difficult to assess with accuracy; means of
improving monitoring of cereal output are being discussed. The extension
service, which is adopting the training and visit approach, is improving in
efficiency.  The Iow cost irfl6aLiorn schemes and women's activities have fared
poorly so far, and no action has been taken on the pilot settlement project.
The Financial and Administrative Unit has established project accounts and
updated cost statements and budgets aimed at keeping future project expendi-
tures in line with available funds.
Credit 744:    Regional Railway Project in the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta
US$5.2 Million Credit of November 14, 1977; Effective Date:
December 20, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project finances priority items of the 1978-1979 portion of
the Regie Abidjan-Niger (RAN) 1977-1982 investment plan. It includes track
alignment and renewal of track material in the Ivory Coast; track improvement
in Upper Volta; procurement of locomotives; freight cars and track maintenance
equipment, provision of training facilities and consulting services for
technical training and management improvement and to carry out feasibility
studies. Procurement of goods and services provided for in the Project
description has been implemented or carried out. Major civil works were
completed by end December 1981. All other physical components are being
implemented but have experienced delays due to administrative problems. Late
contract awards have caused slow execution of sleeper renewal and embankment
construction. Ballast production is also behind schedule. Remaining funds
in the Credit accounts will be sufficient to complete the components of the

Regional Railway Project located in Upper Volta. The railway presently
experiences severe financial constraints detrimental to its ability to main-
tain properly its equipments. A survey of RAN's management procedures will be
undertaken soon by a team of independent experts, under a separate project,
with a view to preparing a plan of action to redress the situation.
Credit 759:    Artisan, Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Project.  US$4.0
Million of January 12, 1978; Effective Date:  April 12, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project provides a line of credit to the National Development
Bank (BND) for small and medium scale enterprises; technical assistance,
project preparation and follow-up and training for the National Center for
the Promotion of Rural Artisans (CNPAR) and the Organization for the Promotion
of Upper Voltan Enterprises (OPEV); technical assistance to the BND; a study
on industrial incentives; and a training program at the Department of External
Debt at the Treasury. The technical assistance financed by the IDA credit
has had little impact on the evolution of BND as a financially sound and
well managed institution and the Association is currently discussing with
Government the best use of the remaining line of credit to BND. OPEV and
CNPAR activities are progressing satisfactorily.
Credit 766:    Urban Development Project US$8.2 Million of March 23, 1978;
Effective Date: February 2, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
The project consists of upgrading of approximately 7,000 plots in
Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso; preparation and servicing of 1,100 lots in
Bobo-Dioulasso; water supply facilities for an additional 2,500 families in
Ouagadougou who are not living in areas to be upgraded; housing construction
and improvement loans; community facilities, social services and technical
assistance to the municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso and the
Department of town planning. Project start-up activities were financed under
two Project Preparation Facility advances and the budget of the Ministry
of Public works. Surveys and detailed engineering proceeded very slowly
due in part to the Ministry of Public Works tendency to shift away from
previously agreed upon design standards. An agreement was reached at end
1979: (a) to proceed on a pilot basis with the upgrading in the Cissin
neighborhood with particular attention being paid to affordable standards,
minimizing demolition and relocation, and community participation; and (b)
to hire a municipal engineer as Deputy Project Director. In Bobo-Dioulasso,
the Municipality is constructing roads with force account and a contract
for drainage has been awarded. In Ouagadougou tender documents are being
finalized. Agreement has been reached for starting the Credit Union for
mobilizing saving in the neighborhoods. Rehabilitation of schools and dis-
pensaries and assistance components to Municipalities of Bobo-Dioulasso and
Ouagadougou have been implemented successfully. The project has been slow to
attain the hoped for momentum and should still receive close supervision.

Credit 956:    Second Education Project.  US$14.0 Million Credit of
November 15, 1979; Effective Date: July 30, 1980
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
An extension of the First Education Project, the project would
expand the rural education system to youths who formerly had no access to
primary education through expansion, repair and equipping of physical facili-
ties, and training and management support. It would also provide training for
three categories of workers presently in short supply in Upper Volta; agricul-
ture project managers, building construction foremen, and road and equipment
maintenance personnel. Project management has improved, but shortage of
counterpart funds may jeopardize further improvements. Construction of the
rural youth training centers is proceeding satisfactorily, and the first
deliveries of educational materials are expected in early 1982. Architectural
designwork for two rural development training centers and an administration
building, which are being financed by the African Development Fund, is behind
schedule and requires better control by the project staff. The technical
assistants for the rural youth training component are in post. The partially
completed study on linkages between formal and rural education indicates poor
achievement in literacy and arithmetic skills for the rural youth training
system. Proposals for the strengthening of the national evaluation capacity
are being developed.
Credit 982:    Forestry Project.  US$14.5 Million Credit of April 7, 1980.
Effective Date: December 31, 1980; Closing Date: December 31,
1984.
The project provides a comprehensive program to strengthen the
operational capacity of the Forestry Administration with staff and equipment
to carry out its assigned functions of protecting, developing and exploiting
the country's forest resources within the framework of the national forestry
plan. The project will also establish 1,600 ha of rainfed tree plantations
and 325 ha of rural woodlots in the Bobo-Dioulasso area, manage on a pilot
basis 1,000 ha of natural forest in the Maro-reserve and maintain previously
established rainfed tree plantations. A Project Preparation Facility advance
financed preliminary works begun in 1979, including a pedological study and
aerial survey of the Maro-reserves and plantation maintenance and protection
works. The Project Management Unit (PMU) in Ouagadougou and the Project
Operation Unit (POU) in Bobo-Dioulasso are almost fully established and are
operating satisfactorily. Although clearing and land preparation were very
late, POU established successfully during the first planting season of 1981,
142 ha of rainfed tree plantation in the Maro reserve, and, in liaison with
the natural forest unit, are carrying out a detailed reconnaissance inventory
of the reserve to select sites to be managed by the project. The project will
commence complementary studies on rural forestry and on a national forestry
fund late in 1982.

Credit 1013:   Niena Dionkele Rice Development Project.  US$6.5 Million
Credit of May 8, 1980; Effective Date: December 4, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project is a pilot phase of a possible three phase program to
convert swampland to more productive use. The main objectives of this phase
would be to test key assumptions regarding future development of swamp areas
and to address price structure, marketing and economic issues of the rice
subsector. The project will also assist Government to promote institution
building in the subsector, define a national rice policy, create a market
structure to ensure farmer confidence in rice production and train future
rice industry managers. The project has had a slow start with respect to
procurement and staffing. There have been significant cost overruns with
the water control structures. In the first cropping year (second project
year) only 150 ha instead of the 300 ha envisaged were developed. The first
season has disclosed serious technical problems, of which the most fundamental
relates to water availability and appropriate rice variety. The second
cropping season will provide more insight into these difficulties, but it is
questionable whether this pilot project will give rise to a full-scale project
based on the original technical assumptions.
Credit 1097:   Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project:
US$16.0 Million Credit of March 6, 1981; Effective Date:
December 4, 1981; Closing Date: September 30, 1986
An extension of the First Bougouriba Agricultural Development
Project (Credit 496-LT), the project aims at further increasing agricultural
and livestock production in the Bougouriba ORD. Attention will be concen-
trated on the technical management of rainfed agriculture by improved orga-
nization of training, extension, input distribution and credit. The project
also provides for the implementation of modest animal husbandry practices and
increased use of animal traction. Emphasis will be on increasing yields of
main food crops (millet and sorghum) together with recommendations for cash
crops (yams, groundnuts and cotton). The project includes small programs to
encourage more fruit and fuelwood tree planting, and erosion control.
Credit 1164:   Fourth Highway Project:  US$46.0 million Credit of
January 28, 1982; Effective Date: April 26, 1982;
Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The main objectives of this project, which has not yet been signed,
are to improve the Ministry of Public Works institutional capacity for main-
tenance operations and to provide better access to rural areas. The project
consists of: (i) the renewal of the maintenance equipment fleet; (ii) the
construction of workshops and office building; (iii) the incremental costs of
fuel, spare parts and materials for routine maintenance; (iv) the costs of
fuel, spare parts and materials for the periodic maintenance of about 450 km
of gravel roads; (v) the rehabilitation of about 280 km of gravel roads;
(vi) the resealing of about 320 km or paved roads; (vii) the construction
and initial maintenance of about 1,640 km of new and existing feeder roads;
and (viii) technical assistance, consultants, training and scholarships to
help overcome personnel constraints.
