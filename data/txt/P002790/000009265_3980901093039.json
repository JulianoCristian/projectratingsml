Some lessons learned included: the\n            traditional project approach may not be appropriate to\n            address certain sector issues when the policy framework is\n            unclear and institutional capacity is weak. An instrument\n            such as a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) will allow the\n            Government to test innovations before implementing them on a\n            large scale. Responsibilities and resources should be\n            decentralized to local agencies and institutions only when\n            clearly defined procedures for the use and management of the\n            funds have been established. These procedures should include\n            incentives for local agencies to adhere to reporting and\n            other accountability guidelines. If a project must be\n            implemented by more than one ministry, normal government\n            institutional arrangements for project implementation should\n            be used. Difficulties in reaching agreement on effective\n            institutional arrangements should be highlighted as serious\n            project risks."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
