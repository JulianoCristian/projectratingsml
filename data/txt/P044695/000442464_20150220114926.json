This effort is\n            supported by a multi-donor national agricultural advisory\n            services project (NAADS) designed to make poor farmers aware\n            of and equipped to adopt, improved technology and management\n            practices. The project is ongoing, but initial surveys\n            suggest that farmers in those counties covered by the\n            project are adopting technologies that lead to real\n            improvements in yields and farm incomes. A major challenge\n            for NAADS in the future will be expanding its reach beyond\n            areas initially participating in the program. Marketing and\n            post-harvest handling will be increasingly important to\n            sustaining and transforming adoption of technologies into\n            increases in household wealth and income."}, "docdt": "2007-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
