Education\n            reforms should be based on long-term goals but have flexible\n            implementation strategies so that different administrations\n            can embrace them as their own. The involvement of\n            non-governmental organizations, agencies, and private\n            institutions in the implementation of education services can\n            generate efficiencies for the sector.  Good quality distance\n            education can greatly contribute to increase access and\n            demand for secondary education. Well-targeted scholarships\n            are an important tool to improve equity in access to\n            education. School-based projects can be a successful\n            stimulant to foster student ownership and participation, as\n            well as student retention in schools."}, "docdt": "2006-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
