Although the water supply\n            target was achieved, the original concept of the Rural\n            Development Fund became untenable under the changed economic\n            conditions. The Bank was initially over-optimistic about the\n            scope of the operation but the project was later streamlined\n            and the major element completed. For most of the\n            implementation period, supervision records are missing. Bank\n            performance is rated as unsatisfactory. Overall the specific\n            objectives of the original project were only partially\n            achieved. The Borrower's performance, like the\n            Bank's, had its strengths and weaknesses. The\n            Government experienced mounting fiscal difficulties as the\n            value of the currency rose steadily from 1985 to 1987.\n            Counterpart funds were not made available and work was not\n            initiated on most of the smaller project components as\n            agencies, facing financial stringency, concentrated on their\n            core functions. The rural water supply component was much\n            delayed. The Bank wished to agree on the principle of cost\n            recovery for rural water supply. It took over a year to\n            establish a National Water Committee and then over three\n            years to elaborate a national beneficiaries'\n            participation policy. Implementation of the well drilling\n            program was also held up by a procurement dispute. By 1988,\n            an agreement was reached to streamline the project. The\n            principal lesson learned is that the value of a project by\n            project approach is modest when the objective is to change a\n            sector wide policy. Other lessons revolved around judging\n            the implementation capacity of the Government, consideration\n            of macro and sectoral/subsectoral factors, project design\n            focuses, and project implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
