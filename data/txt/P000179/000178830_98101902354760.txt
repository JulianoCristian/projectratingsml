BURUNDI                      FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Burundi
Amount:               US$15.0 million
Terms:                Standard IDA terms
Beneficiary and
Relending Terms:   A portion of the proceeds of the credit would be onlent
to the Municipality of Bujumbura: about US$2.0 million
for civil works (to be repaid at 6% interest rate per
annum over 18 years including three years of grace)
and about US$1.2 million for equipment, vehicles and
materials (to be repaid at 8% interest rate per annum
over seven years including two years of grace).
Prolect
Description:  (i)  Purpose:  To assist the Government in improving the
living conditions of the urban poor by (a) correcting
the most urgent deficiencies in existing neighborhoods
of the capital city (Bujumbura) and (b) establishing
the basis for more efficient future urban growth.
(ii) Components: (a) provision of basic infrastructure to
seven neighborhoods benefiting about 16,700 households,
preparation of about 780 sites and services plots, and
loans for house construction and improvement; (b) pro-
motion of artisans through provision of training and
credit; (c) construction of three primary schools
and renovation of eleven existing ones; (d) improvement
of the Bujumbura Municipality's capacity to maintain
streets and buildings, collect solid waste and recover
costs; and (e) project management and technical assist-
ance.
(iii) Benefits: Improved living conditions for 118,000 per-
sons, improved quality of housing, and increased
incomes for artisans. The project would provide
a replicable model for continuation of low-cost
housing programs.   It would also strengthen
institutions in the housing sector.
(iv) Risks: Specific risks concern the implementation of
the proposed institutional arrangements and the field
performance of cost recovery mechanisms. These risks
are acceptable given the attention within the project
to management, institutional reforms, and the afford-
ability of design standards.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR AN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$15.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an Urban Development Project.
A portion of the proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Municipality
of Bujumbura: about US$2.0 million for civil works (to be repaid at 6%
interest rate per annum over 18 years including three years of grace) and
about US$1.2 million for equipment, vehicles and materials (to be repaid at
8% interest rate per annum over seven years including two years of grace).
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The last economic memorandum on Burundi (1838-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on April 25, 1978. An Economic Mission visited
Burundi in November/December 1979 and its report will be distributed in August
1980. Preliminary conclusions of the Mission are provided below and updated
country data in Annex I.
Background
3.        With an average GNP per capita of about US$140, Burundi is one of
the poorest countries in the world and is designated as "least developed"
by the United Nations. Of a population of about four million, only 90,000
are wage earners; the remainder depend mainly on subsistence agriculture.
The Government is facing several critical problems in its efforts to develop
the economy: the capability to prepare and manage programs and projects is
weak; the agricultural labor force is largely untrained; and population
growth keeps straining Burundi's productive resources, particularly in
agriculture. Despite a stated policy of "spaced births", the problems of
population pressure cannot be solved in the immediate future. A major effort
must be made to increase agricultural productivity. Agricultural yields have
been declining, as more and more marginal land has been brought under cultiva-
tion. The search for more arable land has caiused large-scale deforestation,
resulting in a severe lack of ELrewood in the rural areas and forcing the
development of alternative energy sources.
4.        Improvements to the internal transport system will be of limited
effect unless reliable external links can be established. Shipments of
imports and exports through the principal outlets via Tanzania have tradition-
ally encountered frequent delays due to bottlenecks in the port of Dar-es-
Salaam, underinvestment in the railway link between Tabora and Kigoma on Lake
Tanganyika, and losses because of theft. However, some action is being taken
to improve the situation. For example, several donors (Canada, Belgium and
the European Development Fund) are considering financing the rehabilitation
1/   This part is identical to that in the President's Report for the Second
Education Project (Report No. P-2684-BU) considered by the Executive
Directors on January 29, 1980.



- 2 -
of railway and port infrastructure in Tanzania. The link via Rwanda and
Uganda to the former East African Railways and the port of Mombasa (Kenya) is
becoming increasingly attractive with the continuing improvement in national
highways between Bujumbura and Mombasa.
5.        Recent Economic Developments.  Over the period 1973-79, Burundi's
GDP grew at a rate of only 3.6 percent per annum in real terms compared to the
2.2 percent annual growth of its population. Growth was concentrated mainly
in the capital city, particularly in manufacturing and construction activity.
Food crop production grew significantly more slowly than did population, while
the production of export crops (including coffee, the main source of foreign
exchange earnings) tended to decline.
6.        The overall investment rate of the economy rose considerably in
1977-78, when it accounted for 12.7 percent of GDP, but it is still below
the average for low-income countries. The allocation of investment between
production and infrastructure, one-third and two-thirds, respectively, has
not changed noticeably in recent years. The bulk of investment in the rural
areas has been to a large extent financed by official external aid and has
been allocated mostly to export crops. In 1978, the public sector accounted
for about 94 percent of gross fixed capital formation. This has been accom-
plished largely by government investment in social and transport infra-
structure and by the activities of public corporations. Investment by
private enterprises has been relatively weak, reflecting in part the excess
capacity prevailing in certain industries and the limited financial and
managerial capabilities of most private firms.
7.        Owing to high coffee prices in 1976 and 1977, export earnings, in-
come and Government revenue rose sharply in those years. By the end of 1977,
Burundi had accumulated about US$89 million in net foreign reserves, equiva-
lent to 11 months of imports. The improvement in the terms of trade resulted
in income gains equivalent to an increase of about one-fourth of GDP over
1975. These increases accrued primarily to the Government through higher
export taxes; the rest was shared by the small coffee producers through
increases in producer prices. The increase in Government revenues allowed
substantial increases in current and investment expenditures. In spite of
these, overall budgetary transactions, which had showed a small deficit in
1975, registered a surplus in 1976 and 1977 due to the higher growth of tax
revenues.
8.        In the wake of a 50 percent decline in the average price of coffee
exports, rapid import growth stemming from strong consumer demand, rising
public investment, and significant increases in import prices and costs of
insurance and freight, Burundi lost US$9 million of its reserves during 1978
(despite a large increase in grants and net disbursements of external loans).
By August 1979, net international reserves had fallen to US$40 million,
equivalent to about five months of imports. Faced with a significant decline
in revenues from coffee exports, and with rapidly rising expenditures, after
two years of surpluses, the Government was forced to borrow from the banking
system to finance its overall deficit (2 percent of GDP).
9.        Most recently and as a result of the hostilities in Uganda, Burundi
has encountered severe difficulties in transportation which led to acute
shortages of fuel, cement and certain consumer goods in late 1978 and the



-3 -
first half of 1979. Since July/August considerable improvement in the overall
supply situation has taken place. Despite this, during 1979 productive sector
activity is estimated to have stagnated and investment declined in real terms.
The shortages which prevailed over the first half of this year, significant
increases in the domestic price of oil products, rapidly rising import prices,
transportation and freight charges as well as continued pressure from the
fiscal deficit have raised the domestic inflation rate to an unprecedented
25-30 percent.
10.       Government Development Strategy.  Since 1977 the Government has
designed a new strategy to achieve social justice, ethnic reconciliation
and improved living conditions in the rural areas. The poll tax, which
was levied on all males, was replaced by compulsory deposits which can be
withdrawn after three years. In addition, the traditional obligation for
small farmers to provide services to landowners in exchange for the right to
cultivate land has been abolished. Likewise, land which was obtained in an
irregular manner for speculative purposes has been returned to the state or to
the farmers who cultivated it. Other aspects of the new policies, which are
embodied in the Third Five-Year Plan (1978-82), are: (a) to emphasize agri-
cultural production to face the increasing needs for food supplies of the
fast-growing population; (b) to increase the rate of economic growth substan-
tially in order to provide greater employment opportunities and more income to
the poorest segments of the population; (c) to raise the investment rate
significantly; (d) to give the Government a more active role in mobilizing
financial and manpower resources and in participating in mixed enterprises in
the commercial and productive sectors; and (e) to foster decentralization of
economic and social activity away from the capital city and achieve a more
balanced geographic distribution through the creation of development poles,
voluntary settlement of the peasant population in villages, and migration from
densely populated areas. To facilitate the implementation of its strategy,
the Government has strengthened the role of planning by elevating the planning
organization to the rank of ministry and by giving it a key role in the
allocation and monitoring of public investment.
11.       External Assistance and Prospects.  Economic prospects are less
favorable than in recent years as a result of expected declines in coffee
prices. Three major challenges which the Government currently faces are
limiting the loss of reserves, preserving its revenue base, and containing
inflationary pressures. This will require cautious budgetary policies
and a significant reduction of the Government's investment targets for the
remainder of the Third Five-Year Plan. In addition, the producer price for
coffee will have to be reduced in real terms, as the world market price for
this commodity is expected to average in real terms, during 1980-82, only 56
percent of the 1976 level. The Government is currently revising its policies
in all of these areas. Most recently, it has reduced its investment targets
for 1980-84 by 40 percent in real terms. Likewise, for the period October 1,
1979 to September 30, 1980, the Government has prepared, with the IMF's
assistance, an economic and financial program whose major objectives are to
reduce significantly the rate of inflation and to limit the balance of pay-
ments deficit. In conjunction with this program, the IMF authorized last
October drawings of SDR 8.3 million in the form of Trust Fund resources. At
the same time, SDR 9.5 million in compensatory financing for the shortfall in
coffee exports experienced in 1978-79 were authorized by the IMF.



- 4 -
12.       If the Government continues to focus on development and strengthens
its administration, it may achieve a steady, albeit slow, improvement in per
capita income. If mining of Burundi's nickel resources proves feasible, the
prospects over the next ten years would be much better. However, the commer-
cial viability of exploiting these deposits has yet to be established.
Regional development in Central Africa will also be important to Burundi's
economy. In September 1976, Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire signed a convention
establishing the "Economic Community of the Countries of the Great Lakes."
The Community, which has its seat in Gisenyi, Rwanda, aims inter alia at
stimulating and intensifying intra-regional trade and cooperation in a wide
range of activities. A major objective of the Community is the electrifica-
tion of the Great Lakes region. The three countries have also agreed to set
up a joint development bank, to exploit methane deposits around Lake Kivu,
and to develop a fishing industry around Lake Tanganyika. They have also
instructed the Secretariat to investigate ways of improving the transport
system around the lakes in order to ease the transport bottlenecks in Burundi
and Rwanda.
13.       Disbursements of long-term loans and capital grants averaged US$34
million per annum during 1977-78, most of it coming from Belgium, the Federal
Republic of Germany, IDA, the UN agencies and the European Development Fund.
In the 1975-78 period, total long-term capital inflows amounted to about
US$110 million, of which US$64 million was in the form of grants. On December
31, 1978, Burundi's external medium- and long-term debt amounted to about
US$63.6 million (excluding undisbursed amounts), of which IDA held 22 percent.
Debt service averaged 3.5 percent of export earnings during 1978. Due to the
large proportion of grants in external assistance, IDA will probably continue
to hold an important proportion of Burundi's outstanding debt. Notwithstand-
ing the low debt service ratio, Burundi is unable to absorb any borrowing on
commercial terms, because of its poverty and the instability of its export
earnings. External aid should therefore be on grant or very concessional
terms and continue to include a substantial share of local cost financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Since IDA lending started in Burundi in 1966, thirteen credits
have been made totalling US$70.2 million; one credit (US$1.1 million)
helped improve water supply to Bujumbura; four credits (US$17.3 million)
were for agriculture (two for coffee production, one for fishing and one
for forestry); three credits (US$19.4 million, including an engineering
credit of US$400,000) helped start a highway maintenance and improvement
program; a US$10.0 million credit is supporting the improvement of primary
education and a second one of US$15 million, signed on April 23, 1980,
will finance vocational and technical training; two credits (US$4.0 million)
were made for technical assistance and the National Economic Development Bank
received a credit of US$3.4 million. The Second Coffee Project and the
Fisheries Project are being cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.0 million) and
the Abu Dhabi Fund (US$1.2 million) respectively. The Second Highway Project



- 5 -
is cofinanced by the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) in
an amount of US$6.0 million. The Forestry Project is cofinanced with a Credit
of US$1.2 million equivalent made from the EEC Special Action Account. Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA Credits and notes on the execution of
projects and the status of disbursements as of April 30, 1980.
15.       Project performance has been uneven, reflecting the lack of local
management capacity and technical skills which is likely to remain a major
-constraint to development for some time to come.  This situation has parti-
cularly delayed the execution of the Fisheries and the Second Coffee Projects,
although the implementation of the Second Coffee Project has recently
improved. Disbursement of the Credit to the National Economic Development
Bank has been lagging because of the general sluggishness of the industrial
sector. On the other hand, implementation of the First Education, the
Second Highway and the Forestry projects is satisfactory.
16.       Future IDA operations in Burundi will continue to focus on agri-
culture and rural development, transportation and education, and to include
provisions for project management and technical assistance. Documents
regarding an IDA Credit of US$7.7 million for a telecommunications project to
improve the domestic telephone and telex system will be circulated shortly to
the Executive Directors. An agricultural development project, which would
aim at improving the living standards of the rural population in one of the
poorest areas of the country, was appraised in March/April 1980. Further
improvements of the road sector are envisaged under a third highway project,
which is expected to be appraised shortly.
PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR
Background
17.       Burundi's urban economy is and will continue to be a major factor
of growth in domestic demand, output, and employment.  Urban-based domestic
production in the secondary and tertiary sectors doubled between 1970 and
1977.   Residents of cities and towns, presently 200,000 or 5% of the total
population, can be expected to double in number in 15 years.
18.       Due to the moderate size of Burundi's urban areas and the availability
of raw land, urban development is occurring on a manageable scale. Most of
Burundi's urban residents live in the capital city, Bujumbura (140,000) and in
three other towns, Gitega (8,000), Rumonge (5,000) and Ngozi (4,000). Current
urban growth rates are estimated at 5% per year, of which about half is due to
migration. Bujumbura's infrastructure network is in need of rehabilitation
and settlement has begun to spill over onto unserviced land. The time is
right to rationalize the planning of urban growth.

Housing Conditions, Infrastructure and Services in Bulumbura
19.       By 1965 Bujumbura had grown to cover an area of about 1,700 ha
stretching north and south along Lake Tanganyika and east across a narrow
plain to steeply rising hills. Although Bujumbura has grown c a low density
with a good deal of open space between built-up areas, densities up to 340
persons/ha and low quality services characterize several neighborhoods of
self-built unregulated housing constructed on public land. Three of these
neighborhoods (Buyenzi, Bwiza, and Nyakabiga) are located near the downtown
area. A more recent, less dense group of neighborhoods (Cibitoke, Kamenge,
and Kinama) lies farther to the north. Together these neighborhoods house
about 105,000 persons, three quarters of the city's population and nearly all
of its poor. Another 10% live in the middle-income neighborhood of Ngagara,
where services and housing densities fall between the extremes of the richer
and poorer sections of the city. About 55% of Bujumbura families and 65% in
the low-income neighborhoods have incomes below the urban poverty threshold
estimated at about $175 per month for an average household.
20.       Three quarters of the city's housing stock consists of non-permanent
and semi-permanent structures. This type of housing made up 91% of the total
constructed between 1970 and 1978. Roughly a third of the estimated demand
for new housing over the 1980-84 period can be absorbed by densification
of existing neighborhoods but the balance will require servicing and develop-
ment of new sites. The most critical needs are for improvement in environmental
sanitation and in mechanisms to assure adequate maintenance of infrastructure.
Personnel, equipment and organization for garbage collection are inadequate for
a regular pickup system to maintain sanitary conditions. Most drainage
canals are perpetually blocked and water standpipes are frequently out of
service or difficult to use.
21.       Maintenance of secondary roads and drains and garbage collection
are the responsibility of the Municipality of Bujumbura. However, the Munici-
pality's capacity to plan and carry out its maintenance programs has in the
past been inadequate. As a result, municipal revenues, although low in
absolute terms, have been in excess of expenditures. The Government is
taking steps to strengthen the Municipality.
Income and Employment
22.       Bujumbura is the location of 80% of Burundi's urban employ-
ment. Industry (including construction) accounts for about 11% of the total
employment, agriculture for about 13%, commerce and services for about 35%,
and Government for about 25%, with the remaining 16% being in other sectors.
There are a large number of small, unregistered commercial and service enter-
prises usually with less than 10 employees and self-employed artisans in
building trades, carpentry, mechanics, and tailoring. Shortages of skilled
labor and lack of access to credit by smaller firms and artisans are major
constraints to the growth of employment. There is a wide range of incomes



among the city's low-income neighborhoods. In the neighborhoods near the city
center where average incomes are higher, about 30% of heads of household are
civil servants, around 20% work in retail and service trades, and 10 to 15%
are artisans. In the poorer northern neighborhoods, artisans are more
numerous (25-30%) and civil servants and retail and service workers much
less. In these neighborhoods artisan work and agriculture provide the chief
source of income for 50-70% of households.
Government Policies and Programs
23.       Government began focusing attention on housing and urban development
in the mid-1970s. Current housing policies aim primarily at facilitating the
provision of loans to lower-income groups to build affordable housing,
improving existing neighborhoods and supplying serviced land. Results became
visible in the late 1970s when several agencies and programs were launched or
reorganized. The Public Works Ministry, in charge of carrying out house-
building and infrastructure programs, was restructured and its functions
better defined in relation to those of financial intermediaries such as the
National Bank for Savings and Investment (CAMOFI) and the newly-created Public
Housing Corporation (SIP). French advisers initiated an evaluation of growth
alternatives for Bujumbura which led to a revised urban development plan
and reservation of a key site for future urban expansion. Extensions of
water, drainage, sewerage, and electricity networks were begun with financing
from Germany, the African Development Bank, and the Arab Bank for the Economic
Development of Africa. With UNDP financing, the UN Centre for Human Settle-
ments prepared a project to upgrade the spontaneous settlement of Musaga;
funding for the operational phase will be provided largely by the UN Capital
Development Fund.
24.       The Government has also taken steps to deal with issues of immediate
concern, particularly shortages of imported building materials and the rising
cost of construction intensified both by these shortages and by inflation.
Cement has been imported from Zambia to offset the reduction in supplies from
Tanzania, and the Government with the assistance of IDA and UNIDO is preparing
a project to develop the local production and use of low-cost construction
materials and increase the capacity of the domestic construction industry.
Over the medium term, however, the use of imported materials will have to be
further curtailed, rent ceilings lifted or removed, and standards of house
construction reconsidered if substantial progress is to be made in reducing
housing subsidies. The Government has begun to address this problem more
systematically. Financed under an ongoing IDA technical assistance credit
(Credit No. 917-BU), a study of urban housing policies, including rent controls,
housing subsidies and lending terms, would be undertaken. Results of the
study are expected to be available by March 31, 1981 and the Government in
consultation with IDA would prepare an action plan by September 30, 1981.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
25.       The project is the first application of Government policies to
promote low-cost urban housing in Bujumbura. Following identification in
1978, the project was prepared as part of the elaboration of a longer-range
program with the assistance of consultants financed through the Project
Preparation Facility. Appraisal took place in November-December 1979.
Negotiations were held in Washington on May 15 and 16, 1980 with a Government
delegation headed by H.E. Ladislas Barutwanayo, Minister of Public Works,
Equipment and Housing. A detailed description of the project components can
be found in the Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 2854-BU) being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the project are
highlighted in the Credit and Project Summary given at the beginning of this
Report, supplemented by Annex III.
26.       The project's main objective is to help improve the living con-
ditions of the urban poor by (a) correcting the most urgent deficiencies in
existing neighborhoods, and (b) establishing the basis for more efficient
future growth. By demonstrating a low-cost, replicable approach to new
residential development, the project would also lay the foundation for a more
rational urban development. A series of essential improvements predominantly
in the most deprived areas of Bujumbura would be carried out as a first step
toward bringing all neighborhoods up to the same service standard. For the
primary schools to be constructed within the project, the goal is to maintain
rather than improve current enrollment ratios, to avoid drawing resources from
the efforts underway in rural areas. Measures to assist artisans would make
up the first phase of a medium-term program to increase their productivity and
incomes.
Project Description
27.       Neighborhood Upgrading, Serviced Plots and Building Loans:  Essen-
tial services would be upgraded in three poor neighborhoods at the city's
periphery (Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Kinama) and three more centrally located
areas (Buyenzi, Bwiza, and Nyakabiga). Civil works in the middle-income
neighborhood of Ngagara would consist of minor additions to the public light-
ing network. Major streets would be resurfaced with laterite but not paved.
Drainage canals would be built in neighborhoods currently lacking an effective
storm drain network, and extended and renovated elsewhere. Additional water
standpipes would be installed in four neighborhoods to permit service to all
project areas. Public lighting and electricity networks would be improved
along selected main streets and extended to two neighborhoods (Cibitoke and
Kinama) which are presently without service. The same standards of service
would prevail at a 33-ha publicly owned site (Kwijabe) on which 780 serviced
plots would be prepared for owner-built and contractor-built houses. Building
loans averaging $920 at 1980 prices in upgrading areas and ranging from $670
to $2,500 at the Kwijabe site would be available for house improvement or



- 9 -
housebuilding. In upgrading areas, housing loans would be made for as
little as $315 so that families unable to afford an across-the-board change
from non-permanent to semi-permanent housing can still make modest improvements
in their houses. Service standards, tenure conditions, establishment of
household selection and lot allocation criteria, and the terms and conditions
of lot sales and house consolidation at the Kwijabe site were agreed upon
during negotiations (Section 3.07 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
28.       Artisan Promotion:  An artisan promotion component would aim to
provide artisans with (a) advice and training in basic record keeping,
marketing and management skills; (b) credits for acquisition of equipment,
tools, and working capital; (c) technical training to improve product quality;
and (d) training of apprentices by the artisans themselves, together with
installation credits after training. A portion of the training of metalworkers/
tinsmiths, one of the occupations assisted, would involve the introduction of
new techniques of producing charcoal-burning stoves. The project would
support four months of technical assistance and a small amount of equipment
and materials in a program to train metalworkers in building improved stoves,
based on techniques proven effective in other countries.
29.       Community Facilities:  In order to equalize access to basic education
a total of 24 classrooms in three primary schools would be built and equipped
in the most deficient upgrading neighborhoods and at the Kwijabe site. Two of
the three new schools would include a workshop unit for post-primary vocational
training in carpentry, bricklaying, mechanics, and home economics. An addi-
tional 11 primary schools would be renovated. Three of the five existing
markets in the upgrading areas would be graded and provided with drainage by
the Municipality of Bujumbura using road maintenance equipment financed
through the project (paragraph 30). The other two are to be renovated with
Belgian assistance which is also to improve the site of the central downtown
market and provide a new market in Cibitoke. Sites have been reserved for
additional sports fields in five upgrading neighborhoods and at Kwijabe.
30.       Municipal Services:  The project would finance the purchase of
equipment, vehicles, tools, and construction of vehicle repair and maintenance
facilities to improve the Municipality of Bujumbura's capacity to carry
out its responsibilities in (a) maintenance of streets and drains; (b) main-
tenance of public buildings; and (c) solid waste disposal. A Collection
Bureau was recently established within the Municipality to recover investment
and recurrent costs of the project in addition to collecting municipal taxes.
31.       Project Management and Technical Assistance:  Contract supervision
and general coordination of the project would be the responsibility of a
Project Unit to be created within the Public Works Ministry (para. 34). Two
expatriate advisers would be associated with a local staff of 12 people to
provide advice, technical assistance, and training to other implementing
agencies. Training of street maintenance personnel would take place at the
Public Works Ministry training center in Gitega and would be organized
by a group being financed under the second IDA highways project (Credit
No. 773-BU). The mechanics training center of the Public Works Ministry
in Bujumbura would be used for the training of technical and management
staff of the vehicle repair workshop.

Cost Estimates
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$16.7 million,
including US$8.8 million in foreign exchange. Since goods and equipment for
the project would be imported free of customs duties and inte-'al taxes,
base costs are net of tax liabilities. The average cost per staff-year of
consultants' services (including salary and fees, international travel and
subsistence) is estimated at $97,000 or about $8,000 per staff-month. Physical
contingencies of 12% and 10% were allowed for the community facilities and
upgrading and serviced site components respectively, and for all other items
except construction loans, artisan credits and the preparatory studies, a
physical contingency of 10% was used. A total price contingency of 27% was
included for expected price increases on all local and foreign cost items,
including physical contingencies.
Financing Plan
33.       The proposed US$15 million IDA Credit would finance 90% of total
project cost (net of taxes). This proportion of IDA financing, including
the financing of US$6.2 million of local costs, is justified in view of
Burundi's very limited own financial resources (para. 13). The remainder
of the financing would be assured by a Government contribution of US$1.7
million. A subsidiary loan agreement would be concluded between the Govern-
ment and the Municipality of Bujumbura covering (a) civil works and purchase
of equipment, materials, and vehicles by the Municipality and (b) street
improvements and drainage works in upgrading neighborhoods and at Kwijabe.
Terms for civil works funds would be 6% interest for 18 years with three years
of grace, and for equipment purchases 8% for seven years with a two-year grace
period; these terms are in line with those generally applied in Burundi to
similar types of transactions and in addition would permit the Municipality
to build up a small surplus that would help finance other priority investments
after completion of the project. To ensure prompt availability of the Govern-
ment contribution throughout project implementation, counterpart funds totalling
$280,000 from the FY80 budget have been approved and would be deposited in a
project revolving fund (Section 6.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Project Execution
34.       Overall responsibility for implementation of the project would rest
with the Ministry of Public Works, Equipment, and Housing through a Project
Unit which would coordinate and supervise all aspects of project execution.
The Municipality of Bujumbura would manage (a) maintenance operations and
garbage collection through a Technical Services Department; (b) administration
of housing credits through a newly created Housing Bureau; and (c) recovery of
project costs through a newly created Collection Bureau. The artisan assistance
program would be implemented by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor under
the general supervision of the Project Unit.
35.       A number of other ministries and agencies would provide specific
support during implementation. Street improvements in the upgrading neigh-
borhoods would be carried out by the Roads and Bridges Department (Ponts et
Chaussees), Ministry of Public Works. Water, electricity, and public lighting
networks would be installed, operated, and maintainted by the National Water



- 11 -
and Electricity Authority (Regideso). In each case the department work forces
to be deployed have sufficent experience to give assurances of cost-effective
execution of these works. The Land Title Office of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture would be responsible for staking of plots at the Kwijabe serviced site.
Supervised by the Project Unit, the education project unit of the Ministry
of Education would construct and renovate primary schools under the project.
36.       The project would be carried out over the period July 1980 to
December 1984. Beginning with the neighborhoods of Cibitoke, Kamenge, and
Kinama, infrastructure improvements would be completed by the end of 1983.
The first group of 251 plots at Kwijabe would be finished by end 1982 but
would be ready for occupancy approximately six months earlier. School and
workshop construction and equipment procurement have been phased in relation
to civil works at the school sites to ensure that schools would be ready to
open in succeeding autumns of 1982-1984. Trainer/promoters identified from
the ranks of local artisans would carry out the artisan promotion program
operating from local offices of the Housing Bureau. By 1983, the program
would be assisting 170 artisans per year, with a total of 500 to be reached by
the end of the project. Training of metalworkers in building improved
stoves would be coordinated by the Department of Energy, Ministry of Energy
and Mines, which would provide logistical support and an engineer counterpart
of the technical assistant.
37.       All the municipal maintenance and repair units would be housed
in permanent buildings (financed by the project) with a maintenance hangar and
open parking area. Regrading of streets would be done twice a year by a small
motorized work brigade whose capacity would be 300 meters of urban streets per
day. A newly created building maintenance unit would undertake the maintenance
of public buildings in Bujumbura, including primary schools and health centers.
The city's vehicle fleet would be strengthened with the purchase of six
garbage trucks to transport solid waste from upgrading areas and markets; in
addition, about 20 discharge points in the neighborhoods would be improved. A
welding/ soldering and woodworking facility would have the capacity to repair
vehicles as necessary and to ensure regular maintenance of vehicles and heavy
equipment.
Audit
38.       Financial statements and audit reports for each executing agency,
prepared by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, would be submitted to IDA
not later than eight months after the end of each fiscal year (Section
4.01(c) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Civil works and equipment contracts for an aggregate value of
US$3.86 million equivalent would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for
procurement. A number of small contracts totalling US$0.7 million equiv-
alent are not likely to attract foreign suppliers or contractors and would



- 12 -
be awarded after competitive bidding advertised locally but open also to
bidders without local representation. Street improvements, water and
electricity networks, primary school construction, and staking of plots at
Kwijabe would be carried out using force account methods, which are more eco-
nomical and c-peditious in these cases than using private contractors.
40.       Disbursements would be made on the basis of (a) 80% of total ex-
penditures for civil works; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported equipment and materials, and 75% of local expenditures if procured
locally; (c) 100% of foreign and 50% of local expenditures for consultant
services; (d) 100% of foreign and 75% of local expenditures for operating
costs and salaries of project implementing agencies covered under the project;
and (e) 100% of foreign and 80% of local expenditures for housing and artisan
credits. An advance of US$410,000 from the Project Preparation Facility was
made during 1979, and a further advance of US$177,000 has been approved
to complete detailed designs and to cover project-related expenditures for
technical assistance, equipment, and vehicles required during project start-
up. These advances would be fully refunded upon effectiveness of the proposed
Credit.
Cost Recovery
41.       Investments in upgrading neighborhoods and at the Kwijabe  serviced
site, including design and supervision, on-site infrastructure, housing loans,
and municipal services totalling about 56% of total project cost, would be
recovered through plot charges, loan repayments from beneficiaries and a new
urban tax covering municipal maintenance and garbage collection (Section
2.06 of the draft Project Agreement). All allocable costs of the upgrading and
sites and services components would be recovered directly from beneficiaries.
Investments in off-site infrastructure, community facilities, and technical
assistance, which account for the remaining 44% of total project costs, are
viewed as indivisible and would be absorbed in the Government budget.
42.       Monthly plot charges levied on beneficiaries for on-site infra-
structure in upgrading areas and Kwijabe would amortize costs at 12% over
25 years with a six-month grace period before the first payment. Loans for
house construction and improvement and under the artisan promotion program
would be recovered through direct monthly payments. Terms for housing
loans would be 12% for 15 years including 9 months of grace. The proposed
interest rate is non-negative in real terms, as annual domestic inflation is
expected to diminish to 12% beginning in 1982. A number of measures satisfac-
tory to IDA including repossession of the plot would be put in place to
enforce repayment of housing loans. In the case of prolonged non-compliance,
the Housing Bureau would be legally empowered to annul the occupancy permit
and allocate the plot to another family. Artisan credits would be made at 8%
interest, over 9 years including a two-year grace period for equipment loans
and in successive one-year tranches for working capital loans. Interest at 8%
is higher than current rates for similar purposes (which average 6%-7%) and as
such represents a step toward positive real interest rates. The urban tax to
be levied on dwelling rental values in Bujumbura would cover repayment of the
Bujumbura Municipality's subsidiary loan from Government as well as the costs
of maintenance and garbage collection. It would also cover all recurrent costs



- 13 -
of project-related municipal operations not supported within the project as
well as costs associated with equipping and operating the municipal Collection
Bureau.
Affordability, Replicability, and Urban Poverty Impact
43.       About 55% of all households in Bujumbura earn annual incomes below
the urban poverty level of about US$175 per household per month in 1979 prices
for a typical family of 6.4 persons. The site and service options in this
project would be affordable to 82% of the urban poverty group, and the upgrad-
ing option would be affordable to 96% (assuming that up to 17% of family income
could be spent on housing). On this basis, it is estimated the project would
meet about 25% of the anticipated demand for new plots for the urban poor in
Bujumbura over the four-year implementation period. Direct benefits to those
below the poverty level would be generated by activities amounting to 70% of
total project costs.   The table below demonstrates the affordability of the
options offered and the income groups served.

44.       By creating new institutions such as the Housing Bureau and strength-
ening those with current responsibility for urban services, the project would
provide the basis for possible replication of low-cost housing programs in
Bujumbura. Its impact on the financial viability of project entities would be
positive. All project sub-accounts including housing and art4 'an credits and
municipal maintenance show a projected net annual cash surplus which would be
available to support future operations in the urban sector. In addition,
payments by the Municipality to Regideso covering water and electricity
consumption in the project areas would help improve its capacity to upgrade
and service its networks.
Benefits and Risks
45.       By the end of the project implementation period, investments in
infrastucture in the areas to be upgraded would have improved living conditions
for some 118,000 persons or 85% of the city's population. Of these, about
6,000 would also have improved the quality of their housing in varying degrees
ranging from minor improvements to full upgrading from non-permanent to semi-
permanent, with the building materials loans included in the project; these
loans would also permit a number of residents to construct new houses. New
housing stock at the Kwijabe site would accommodate an additional 4,700 persons
on 780 plots. In addition, agencies with major roles in execution of urban
development programs would be strengthened. The project would test and
demonstrate a low cost, replicable approach which could provide a basis for
continuing programs to address the housing needs of the urban poor. An
important indirect benefit would be the improvement in the health conditions
of the upgrading areas, where the majority of health problems treated in
neighborhood health centers arise from poor environmental sanitation. By
including only quantifiable benefits, an overall economic rate of return
of 19% was obtained for upgrading and site and services investments. These
elements include design, supervision, project management, some technical
assistance and physical contingencies, and make up 68% of project cost.
In addition, the improvement and maintenance of environmental conditions
would yield substantial health benefits which are not quantifiable.
46.       The major areas of risk facing the project concern (a) the proposed
institutional arrangements which aim at closer coordination among executive
agencies and a greatly expanded role for the Municipality of Bujumbura, and
(b) the field performance of cost recovery mechanisms. To help ensure effi-
cient project management, the Project Unit would report directly to the
Minister of Public Works and would supervise all civil construction within the
project in addition to artisan promotion, energy assistance, and other
proposed programs. All technical advisers would be recruited through the
Project Unit and seconded to the Housing Bureau and other agencies to be
created or strengthened. In a context where non-payment for public services
is widespread, the introduction of plot charges and taxes is inevitably subject
to risk. Failure to collect the urban tax, for example, would jeopardize
the Bujumbura Municipality's ability to sustain ongoing programs and meet
debt service obligations. However, discussions with project communities



- 15 -
indicate that residents are prepared to pay for basic services if such
payments can be made conveniently and are seen as the cost of the benefits
received. For this reason, the means of collection have been provided for
specifically within the project in the form of equipment, supplies, and
technical assistance for the Collection Bureau. In addition, measures
to enforce repayment of housing loans would be put in place (para. 42).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Municipality of Bujumbura and the Association, and the Recommendation of the

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 467-BU      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974: Effective Date: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The Highway Maintenance Project is the first phase of a long-term
program to establish an efficient highway maintenance organization. The
project which has been substantially completed consists of the purchase of
maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel and construction materials, the
construction of a workshop and consultant services for technical assistance
and training, a study on the development of the road sector and feasibility
studies. The project is cofinanced by the UNDP (US$1.05 million for technical
assistance), Germany (US$1.33 million for the construction of and technical
assistance to the mechanical workshop in Bujumbura) and Belgium (US$400,000
for local cost financing). All equipment has now been procured and mechanical
road maintenance is well under way. Several manual road maintenance crews
and one mechanized maintenance unit have been established resulting in a sub-
stantial improvement in the quality of road maintenance works. Good progress
has been made in training road maintenance personnel. Completion of the
office building for the Directorate of Roads, which is the only project
component still outstanding, is now scheduled for July 1980.
Credit No. 593-BU      Second Coffee Improvement Project:  US$5.2 million
of December 5, 1975; Effective Date: October 31,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Project is a continuation of the first Coffee Improvement
Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147-BU of April 11, 1969). It is being
co-financed by the Kuwait Fund (US$1.2 million) on a parallel basis and by
Belgium (about US$600,000). The Kuwait Fund finances the construction of
ten coffee washing stations, and Belgium assists in the carrying out of a
coffee research component. The project is designed to support the develop-
ment of coffee and food production by strengthening and expanding extension
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

services and distribution of agricultural inputs; it includes a pilot rural
development program to improve livestock and food crop production. Start
up of the project was slow because of frequent changes in foreign and local
project staff. A new team of foreign experts has been appointed and project
management is now improving. Coffee extension work is showing favorable
results. Husbandry methods practiced by coffee growers continue to improve,
and coffee research activities are making satisfactory progress. Construction
of the ten coffee washing stations is expected to be completed by the end of
1980. The pilot foodcrop development programs have been redefined and scaled
down to ensure better control.
Credit No. 613-BU      Technical Assistance Project:  US$1.5 million of
March 19, 1976; Effective date: July 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project provides financing for hiring long term advisers
and short-term consultants to assist in planning, collection of statistics
and project preparation. Several long term advisers (including a senior
economic adviser and a senior statistician in the Ministry of Planning, a
savings bank expert and a metallurgist at the Ministry of Mining) are in post.
Several short-term studies and consultant services relating to the preparation
of projects in the agricultural and industrial sectors have been carried
out.
Credit No. 626-BU      Fisheries Development Project; US$6.0 million of
June 11, 1976; Effective Date: February 22, 1977
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
This project is designed to increase the production of fish through
the provision of training, equipment and materials to fishermen and to improve
the distribution of fish throughout Burundi. The project also includes
financing for the preparation of rural development plans for the coastal
region along Lake Tanganyika and the implementation of pilot development
activities. The project is co-financed by a US$1.2 million loan from the
Abu Dhabi Fund. Project implementation was initially very slow because of
problems encountered in the recruitment of both expatriate technical assis-
tants and their national counterparts and in the procurement of goods. Most
of these constraints have been overcome and the pace of project implementation
has accelerated. Production of fiberglass hulls for fishing boats has begun
and there has been an improvement in the catch rates at some fishing centers.
Problems of shortages of spare parts for the outboard engines are being solved.
Contracts for all the studies have been signed and all of them are underway.
Management performance of the fisheries company has been unsatisfactory and
a new project manager and a new deputy manager have just been appointed.
Financially, the company has working capital problems. These problems were
recently reviewed with the Government and an agreed plan of action for
improving performance was established.

Credit No. 679-BU      Education Project:  US$10.0 million of April 28, 1977;
Effective Date: September 1, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
This project assists the Government in continuing and consolidating
the reform of primary education. It aims at substantially expanding primary
school enrollments and improving the distribution of educational opportunities.
It provides technical and material assistance to the Rural Education Bureau
responsible for the execution of the reform of primary education as well as
for teacher training. As a result of a shortage of cement and fuel caused
by the hostilities in Uganda during the past year project execution has been
delayed by about a year. Recently, however, deliveries of cement and fuel
have resumed. The construction of 12 schools, a teacher training center and
a printshop has been completed. An additional eight schools are nearing
completion and the construction of five new schools started in early 1980.
Credit No. 731-BU      Development Bank Project; US$3.4 million of
September 30, 1977; Effective Date: March 27, 1978
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The project aims at providing funds for investment in medium size
productive entreprises and technical assistance to the National Economic
Development Bank (BNDE). Project execution is slow as a result of limited
activities of Burundi's industrial sector, and about 70% of the Credit amount
remains uncommitted. The newly established Industrial Development Unit of
BNDE which is to promote and appraise industrial projects has now been fully
staffed.
Credit No. 773-BU      Second Highway Project; US$14.0 million of
March 29, 1978; Effective Date: July 27, 1978
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
This project provides for the construction of the Bujumbura-Rugombo
road (65 km), improvement of roads and bridges, technical assistance and
procurement of maintenance equipment. Project implementation, in particular
road construction, was hampered by the lack of cement and fuel supplies during
the first half of 1979. Performance of the supervision consultants for the
road construction and consultants for engineering (road and bridge improvement)
is satisfactory. Two mechanized maintenance units have been set up and have
started the road improvement program. Consultants providing technical assis-
tance to the Ministry of Public Works, Equipment and Housing are in post.

June 1. 1979; Effectiveness Date: September 27, 1979
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This project provides for the further strengthening of the Govern-
ment's planning mechanism and its project preparation and implementation
capacity. It includes continuation of the technical assistance to macro
economic planning at the Ministry of Planning, provision of experts to the
planning divisions of the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry and financing
of feasibility studies. Recruitment of experts is underway and terms of
reference for several feasibility studies are being prepared.
Credit No. 918-BU      Forestry Project; US$4.3 million and US$1.2
million EEC Special Action Credit of June 1,
1979; Effectiveness Date: October 22. 1979;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
This project assists the Government in initiating the first stage
of a long-term program to develop basic forestry services and plantations
supplying fuel wood, building poles and timber to further the Government's
objectives of increasing forest production and establishing long-term wood
production and marketing policies.  The project includes the establishment of
rural nurseries in 30 communes, a 2,000 ha eucalyptus plantation and a 5,000
ha pine plantation, technical assistance (provided by France) and financing
of energy studies. The three expatriate technical assistants (project
manager, two silviculturists) are in post; approval has been given for the
appointment and the terms of reference of the different local and expatriate
staff.
Credit No. 976-BU      Second Education Project; US$15.0 million of
April 23, 1980; Terminal Date for Effectiveness:
July 21, 1980: Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
This project assists the Government in training middle level techni-
cians and skilled workers in industrial trades and secretarial/administrative
skills. It includes the construction, furnishing and equipping of two new
boarding technical schools, a Mechanics Department and a Typist and Bookkeeper
Training Department in two existing schools and staff housing. The Credit is
not yet effective.
