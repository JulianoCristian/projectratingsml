and Marketing\n            Project will costitute the first phase of Morocco's\n            development plan (1979-1985) for off-season vegetables for\n            export. Out of about 18,000 hectares planted in off-season\n            vegetables, the proposed project will cover about 9,000\n            hectares, the production area destined for exports. It will\n            be implemented over four years and will aim at (i) doubling\n            Morocco's exports of off-season vegetables by\n            introducing modern production techniques, including\n            greenhouse technology and high-yielding hybrids, (ii)\n            strengthening subsectoral production planning and\n            monitoring, and (iii) establishing a separate marketing\n            structure for off-season vegetables. It will also seek to\n            diversify vegetable exports. At full development, the\n            project will generate incremental foreign exchange earnings\n            of $85 million annually, equivalent to about 26 percent of\n            Morocco's agricultural exports in 1977. It will benefit\n            about 8,000 farm families and employ the equivalent of an\n            additional 16,000 full-time workers at an average cost of\n            $6,000, considerably below the cost per job in small-scale industry."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
