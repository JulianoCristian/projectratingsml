Four major lessons are drawn\n            from the experience of the project: a) project management,\n            as an intrinsic element of success, requires human\n            resources, and management procedures, adapted to an\n            administration which, de facto, is then, not yet in place.\n            These difficulties could be overcome through the early\n            provision of training for managers, and, adequate tools on\n            performance indicators and monitoring criteria for project\n            implementation; b) effectiveness of institutional support\n            was, and remains a valid objective of the project; yet, and\n            although the project did succeed in creating structures to\n            reach external support, it often omitted the improvement of\n            basic training of agents working within these structures.\n            Such training would translate institutional support into a\n            better application of the forestry law, which is the\n            ultimate aim of institutional support; c) given that the\n            project's activities did not include administrative\n            interventions onto the natural resources, the assessment\n            report concluded an economic analysis of the project was\n            impossible; however, the same assessment suggested tax\n            revenue increases, which consisted on reforming forest\n            taxation. Although the law has not yet materialized, the new\n            investment operation should be subjected to an economic\n            analysis, and fiscal impact study that quantifies the\n            expected economic, and tax benefits; and, d) turning a\n            problem project into a successful project required\n            instilling a sense of urgency to motivate, and accomplish\n            the vision of economic, ecological, and social significance,\n            that materialized in the policy framework that guided\n            forestry planning, and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2002-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
