                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Substantial progress has been made towards achievement of the Project Development Objective. The pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) has decreasing decreased from 81:1 in 2009 to 74:1
                         in 2012. This is the first time since the introduction of free primary education in Malawi in 1994 that PTRS have ever decreased. This is largely due to a new accelerated teacher
                         training program using open and distance learning (ODL). This ODL program has placed over 15,000 student-teachers in rural areas, over and above the teachers coming from the
                         ongoing traditional teacher training program. To ensure the ODL program decreases PTR without quality sacrificing a randomized impact evaluation is ongoing. The 2012 midline
                         evaluation is being analyzed and the end line data collection is expected to be done in January 2014. Results from the baseline study, conducted in early 2011, suggests that the
                         performance of ODL student teachers is relatively similar to qualified teachers from the conventional teacher training program.

                         The rollout of the Primary School Improvement Program is on track. 11,028 members of school management committee from 1,103 primary schools have been trained on Primary
                         School Improvement Planning (PSIP) and financial management. All schools in 24 out of 34 districts have developed school improvement plans (SIPs) that detail activities to improve
                         equitable access and quality of education at the school level. These schools have received substantial grants for the implementation of the plans. The remaining 10 districts are

                         currently undergoing training. By 2013/14 all primary schools in the country will receive school grants.

                         To support disadvantaged children 36,000 secondary school bursaries have been provided to secondary students from 2010- 2013; approximately 12,000 per year. This year a cash
                         transfer program is being piloted to a small group of 1st year secondary students. To ensure a transparent mechanism for identifying students the Ministry, with support from the
                         Bank, has developed an application form that is being used nationwide this year. An impact evaluation to better understand the cost-effectiveness and overall impacts of varying
                         amounts of cash transfers and bursaries on the retention and performance of vulnerable secondary school students in Malawi will be introduced in 2013-14. To better understand the
                         progress of the bursaries and cash transfers this year, a small process evaluation is planned for this June.

                         The program for out of school youth is continuing to reach more children. From August 2012, 600 Centers to Continuous Basic Education (CBE) began operations in 10 districts,
                         targeting 24,000 learners.

                         The 9 million textbooks for STD 3- 8, 31,744,000 exercise books, 260,977 slates, and 45,000 markers have been distributed to primary schools; 20,329 Secondary School Desks &
                         Chairs & 313,210 secondary schools textbooks have been distributed to secondary schools .
