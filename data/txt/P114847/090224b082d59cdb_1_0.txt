 The Project has directly contributed to the PDO of increasing access and equity and enhancing the quality of the teaching and learning environment.
 Regarding contribution to access, the Project has improved education infrastructure by constructing 2,380 classrooms (against end-of-Project target of
 3,000) and 44 boarding facilities (against end-of Project target of 11). The Project has also provided bursary packages to 26,017 students and cash
 transfers to 4,343 students and 99 percent of these students are still in school. To enhance the quality of the teaching and learning environment, a total
 of 16,100 teachers have been trained through the Open and Distance Learning (ODL) Program (against end-of-Project target of 12,000). In addition 9
 million textbooks have been printed and distributed and an additional 17.9 million textbooks have been ordered far exceeding the target of 9.8 million
 textbooks. A human resource management information system is in place, school personnel and school management/parent teacher associations have
 been trained, and all schools have strategic and annual work plans and receive grants.
