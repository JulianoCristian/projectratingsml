 Overall, the project is progressing in the implementation of activities, but in a less than targeted pace. Given the mixed picture of progress in
 PDO indicators the progress in Project Development Objectives and outcome indicators is rated as moderately satisfactory. The targets with
 respect to Net Enrolment Ratio (NER), project beneficiaries and Pupil: Teacher Ratio (PTR) and Pupil: Qualified Teacher Ratio (PQTR) has
 been met or even exceeded the targets. There Pupil: Classroom Ratio (PCR) has improved from 118:1 to 108:1 by 2013, but the target set was
 98:1. At the time of project preparation, it was envisaged that the Primary Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) will be decreasing and NER
 increasing and the gap between the two will be reduced. However, GER has been increasing, indicating that while more children are now
 attending, there is also increase in over-age and under-age students. The primary completion rate targets (defined in the project as survival till
 the last grade of the project) for lower primary (grade 5) for rural is closer to targets, but there is a decline in standard 8 survival rates from
 previous year.
 Improving Access and Equity. The average Pupil: Classroom Ratio (SCR) has improved from 117:1 in 2009 to 108:1 in 2013. The project
 target is to build 3,000 classrooms by June 2015 to improve the PCR to 97:1. However this target did not take into account the increasing
 enrolments on account of increased intake, and repetition rates. So far, 2,380 classrooms have been constructed under the project. Out of this,
 1,746 have been constructed by Local Development Fund (LDF) through an approach that involves local community; and 634 classrooms by
 the Education Infrastructure Management Unit (EIMU). In addition to classrooms, the LDF also constructed 237 teacher houses, 407 ventilated
 improved (VIP) latrines, 147 ablution blocks, 8 administration blocks and are the process of completing 12 girls’ hostels.
 The MoEST has agreed to construct 622 more classrooms through LDF by June 2015 and 234 classrooms through EIMU. The LDF will
 also engage an external firm to conduct technical evaluation and to guide improvements in construction approaches. The Evaluation
 report is expected to be shared by June 2015.
 In FY2013/14, a total of 10,704 secondary students were provided with bursaries (77% of the targeted students) and among them, 4,310 were
 provided with cash transfers. In 2012/-13, 10,811 students were provided with bursaries, meeting 90% of the targets. One of the main issues
 with the implementation of the bursary and cash transfer schemes is related to delays in providing these to the beneficiaries.
 The MoEST has agreed to disburse all the bursaries and cash transfers (for all the three terms for this academic year) to students in
 Form 2-4 (who were already identified in the previous years) in the first term itself. MoEST has also agreed to take actions to ensure
 that bursaries/ cash transfers for all identified eligible Form 1 students be disbursed by the end of the first term. To enable this,
 MoEST has already allocated MK 338,486,632 (around US$800K) for bursaries and MK 199,322,338 (US$500K) for FY 2014/15.
 Improving Teaching Learning Environment. To ensure an enabling teaching learning environment, it is important to have adequate number
 of skilled teachers, teaching learning materials, and learning spaces. The targets set for improving teacher availability is achieved, but the
 provision of teaching learning materials (TLMs), though progressing well, is below the targets set and progressing in a slow pace. Despite the
 distribution of 9 million text books through the first round of procurement under the project in 2013, there are not enough text books in schools.
 While EMIS 2013 shows PTbR of 2:1- 3:1, the reality is far from it. School specific analysis of textbook availability shows that PTbR for English
 and Mathematics in standard 3 is 6:1; while for standard 7, it is 9:1. It is estimated that to meet the 1:1 textbook ratio in Malawi schools, 27.2
 million additional textbooks for standards 1-8 will be required. Of this, 17 million textbooks are for standards 3-8. Currently, MoEST is in the
 process of procuring around 15 million textbooks, while other donors through discrete support have promised to procure 8 million textbooks.
 Still there will be a gap of more than 5 million textbooks.
 The MoEST has agreed (i) to distribute all secondary school textbooks (which are currently with suppliers unit) to secondary schools
 by March 2015; (ii) to complete the procurement and distribution process of textbooks for standard 1-2 by April 2015; (iii) to complete
 the procurement and distribution of 9.7 million textbooks for standards 3-8, by April 2015.
 The Pupil: Teacher Ratio (PTR) has improved from 74:1 in 2012 to 69:1 in 2013 and Pupil: Qualified Teacher Ratio (PqTR) has improved from
 95:1 in 2012 to 76:1 in 2013. The achievement here has exceeded targets. This improvement is mainly attributable to the Open and Distance
 Learning (ODL) program. So far, 14,726 teachers have been graduated through 3 rounds of ODL program while 7,453 teacher students are
 undergoing training through ODL program. With increased absorption of these teachers in the system and reduced internal inefficiencies as
 envisaged in ESIP II, the PTR is expected to improve in the coming years.
 The MoEST has agreed to develop an “Action Plan” for absorption of ODL teachers in the system by June 2015.
 Improving Management Capacity at All Levels. Under this component the project supports key reforms in the education sector,
 including teacher management reforms, school based improvement planning, and strengthening of planning and budgetary management.
 Continuous Professional Development (CPD), the program for imparting in-service training to primary school teachers in Malawi is being
 implemented in all 34 Districts. CPD is implemented at three levels namely i) TTC- it is more specialized and supported by GIZ ii) Primary in-
 services trainings e.g. trainings for Primary Education Advisor, Assistants Teacher Development Center Coordinators and primary school
 teachers, and iii) Secondary in-service e.g. Strengthening of Mathematics and Science in Secondary Schools (SMASSE). For pre-service
 training, a TEMIS is being developed with support from UNICEF. A Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) exists,
 currently centralized and there are plans to decentralize the same to district level. The full potential of HRMIS is not yet explored in MoEST. The
 tool is currently used to check establishments apart from preparations of salaries. Promotions are not linked to HRMIS.
 The Government of Malawi rolled out the Primary School Improvement Program (PSIP) to all the schools in FY2013/14. PSIP program
 provides a reliable modality to address school specific needs at local level. MoEST did an evaluation of PSIP program in 2013/14 and noted
 that moving away from central control towards school based management has clear advantages in addressing logistical issues (e.g., faster
 procurement that is better tailored to school needs), financial needs (e.g., optimally using scarce resources alongside school identified priorities)
 and management challenges (e.g, additional assistant teachers). From this year (2014/15) for PSIP allocation of resources, MoEST has
 introduced a new formula which is considered as “need based”. The details are provided in detailed report in Annex. This year, PSIP funds will

 be provided to all 5356 government and aided schools. Around MK 5.5 billion (US$ 12 million) is allocated for this program in FY 2014/15. Out
 of this, 77% funds are allocated for schools, 8% for Zones and 2% is for district activities. Around 12% funds are earmarked for zonal and
 district level training in PSIP activities.
 The MoEST has agreed (i) to complete distribution of PSIP grants to schools by the end of December 2014; (ii) to review the criteria
 for determining school grants by June 2015.
 The MoEST has advanced in enhancing some aspects of monitoring and evaluation of its programs, for example, the PSIP evaluation. The
 Sector Working Group (SWG) analysis mainly uses EMIS and departmental data for reporting progress under the project. The EMIS 2013
 summary statistics was published by May 2014, but detailed analysis and interpretations are not developed. EMIS produces disaggregated
 information by district, rural-urban, and gender for some school level indicators.
 The MoEST has agreed (i) to prepare EMIS 2015 Summary Statistics by April 2015; (ii) to hold Sector Working Group Meetings and
 Technical Working Groups meetings regularly.

         Comments
         The target value of 97:1 was set when at the beginning of the project, the enrolments were projected to grow to 3.6 million by the end of the
         project. However, the primary enrolments are already 4.4 million in the country. With the introduction of semi-automatic promotion and
         reduction of repetition rates, the MoEST expects the enrolments to reduce to more age-appropriate levels and that is expected to improve
         the pupil:classroom ratio.

         The NER is estimated using Household Surveys (Integrated Household Surveys) for baseline and current years. The household surveys
         (instead of Education Management Information System (EMIS) age wise enrolment data) is used because there are problems in ages of
         students reported in EMIS and there are also issues with the projection of single age wise data for children in the school going age group.

         The Indicator above denotes Pupil: Qualified Teacher Ratio. The overall Pupil Teacher Ratio has improved from 80:1 in 2008 to 69:1 in
         2013. The data for PTR and PQTR is from EMIS. The increase in PTR is due to the increase in teachers (i) trained through Open and
         Distance Learning (ODL) program in the last 4 years, and (ii) temporary teachers appointed by the community. The increase in PQTR is
         due to the increase in teachers qualified through ODL program.

               The beneficiaries here are the number of students enrolled in all government and aided primary schools supported by the project. The end
               target was estimated using a linear projection of enrolments in the years preceding the project. The project beneficiaries increased more
               than the end targets because: (i) the repetition rates remained high and hene more children were held in the system; and (ii) the increase in
               new entrants into the system increased more than anticipated due to increase in child population.

               Comments
               Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) at primary reported here is from EMIS 2013, using school census enrolments and projected 6-13 years
               populations using NSO data. The GER is much higher than the end target for the following reasons: (i) due to increase in actual intake
               which surpassed the targets set at the time of project preparation; and (ii) high repetition rates resulting in children remaining in the system.

               The Results Framework of the Project Apraisal Document (PAD) specifies targets for standard 3 and standard 7 Mathematics and English
               textbooks only. The project target of distributing 9 million textbooks have already been achieved in 2013. However, the 9 million textbooks
               were not sufficient to meet the target of 1:1 student textbook ratio. Hence the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) is
               currently processing the procurement of 7.7 million textbooks for standards 1-2 and 9.7 million textbooks for standards 3-8. The
               procurement of these textbooks were planned in 2013, but due to various reasons, the procurement process commenced only in 2014. In
               the meantime, a proportion of textbooks that were available in schools were old and worn out. Hence there is an increase in Student:
               Textbook ratio in many standards for English and Mathematics.

               A Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) put in place early 2014, currently centralized and there are plans to
               decentralize the same to district level. The full potential of HRMIS is not yet explored in MoEST. The tool is currently used to check
               establishments apart from preparations of salaries. Promotions are not linked to HRMIS.
