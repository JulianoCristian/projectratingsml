In the last year the Government has significantly\n            accelerated program implementation though: (i) addressing\n            capacity constrains in planning and procurement; and (ii)\n            use of more effective implementation mechanisms. This\n            includes adding additional mechanism for school\n            infrastructure, decentralizing the procurement of learning\n            materials, and increased funding directly schools. The\n            Government of Malawi has an action plan to complete the\n            program that is acceptable to International Development\n            Association (IDA).
