                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The PIEQM became effective in 2011. A mid term review was carried out during June 27- July 5, 2013. During the last two and a half years of implementation, the project has
                         managed to initiate some progress towards achieving Project Development Objectives (PDO) - there is increase in overall enrollments in primary schools in Malawi, there is some
                         progress in improving teaching-learning environment in terms of building more classrooms and placing more teachers, and there are some initiatives/measures in place measures
                         towards building capacity to manage education programs at various levels. At the same time, there are areas where further attention is needed to improve implementation processes
                         and outputs/outcomes.

                         Progress: Enrollments at primary level have increased from 3,671,481 in 2009-10 to 4,188,677 in 2011-12 (EMIS). The gender gap has been reduced significantly by 0.3 point
                         between 2008 and 2012 --enrollment of girls was 49.8% of the total in 2008 and has increased to 50.1% in 2012. The project has made substantial progress in increasing the number
                         of teachers in government primary schools through Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mode for training teachers. The number of primary school teachers has increased from
                         46,380 in 2010 to 55,265 in 2012 in government schools and this has resulted in an improvement in PTRâ€”the average PTR improved from 80:1 in 2010 to 74:1 in 2012 (EMIS 2012).

                         1164 classrooms have been built and made available for teaching through the involvement of Local Development Fund (LDF). 13692 secondary school going students - 7,735 male
                         and 5,957 female from disadvantaged backgrounds are provided with bursaries and of them, a total of 2,249 (1,377males and 872 females were provided with additional cash
                         transfer worth USD 6 or USD 12 per month. A process evaluation is underway to make the implementation more efficient and transparent. There are around 600 Complimentary
                         Basic Education (CBE) centers in 10 districts, catering to the education needs of 10,258 males and 11,287 females. Around 9 million text books for standards 3-8 have been
                         distributed as well as various other teaching learning materials, including stationaries. So far 24 districts are benefiting from Primary School Improvement Plan (PSIP) grants and a
                         total of 4,611 schools out of 4,560 have benefited.

                         Areas for improvement: However, there are output/outcome results and areas that need further attention. The enrollment rates vary across regions and districts. An analysis of
                         survival rates up to grade 5 shows that the proportion of students enrolled in standard 1 surviving upto standard 5 without repeating grades and dropping out has declined from 74%
                         in 2010 to 59% in 2012. Similarly, the proportion of students who entered grade 1 eight years ago surviving till grade 8 have declined from 49% in 2012 to 38% (EMIS 2012) . The
                         survival rate of girls was at 35% while that of boys was higher by 6 points at 41%. More than 20% children repeat grades 1-3, and more than 15% in grades 4-8. In addition, the pass
                         rates in the Primary School Leaving Certificate of Education (PSLCE) have been declining each year between 2006 and 2011. Only 68.9% managed to pass the PSLCE
                         examinations in 2011 as well as in 2012, and this reduced to 67% in 2013. While the PTRs improved, the Pupil to Qualified Teacher Ratio (PQTR) has worsened from 90:1 to 95:1
                         during the same period. EMIS data shows an actual decline in classrooms available in schools, and an increase in STudent Classroom Ratio (SCR) from 101:1 to 107:1. Similarly, the
                         Pupil: Textbook ratio has worsened in early grades, and there are wide variations in the availability of textbooks across districts and schools.
