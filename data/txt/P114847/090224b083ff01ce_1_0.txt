1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At appraisal in 2009, Malawi faced extreme challenges. With an estimated gross national
product of US$160 per capita, approximately 65 percent of the population lived below the national
poverty line. Malawi also faced extreme challenges in the development of human capital. The
dropout rate for primary education was very high, leading to only a 35 percent primary completion
rate (PCR). There were significant income and regional disparities in education access and
completion. The completion rate was 25 percent for rural areas and 51 percent for urban areas.
Although there had been improved enrollments for girls at all educational levels, gender disparity
varied from one level to another; there were more girls at lower grades (1.04 in grades 1–4) and
the number of girls declined at higher grades (0.96 in standards 5–8) of primary education.

2.      Malawi was also characterized by a severe lack of pedagogical resources and infrastructure
in primary education, as evidenced by a pupil to teacher ratio (PTR) of 80:1, high pupil to
classroom ratio (100:1), and a pupil to desk ratio of 9:1. The pupil per qualified teacher ratio
(PQTR) was 91.5:1 in 2009. Rural primary schools, which are attended by a majority of the school
children, were particularly disadvantaged with a PTR of 99:1 compared to urban schools, which
had a PTR of 47:1. The PTRs were also skewed within schools with extremely high ratios in lower
grades, making progress in early literacy and numeracy difficult for many children.

Government Strategy

3.      Malawi had joined the Education for All (EFA) Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Partnership
following the successful appraisal and endorsement of the National Education Sector Plan (NESP)
2008–2017 by the Local Education Group. The NESP and the Education Sector Implementation
Plan (ESIP) 2009–2013,1 which had been approved at the highest levels of the government of
Malawi (GoM), translated the government’s prioritization of education into objectives, strategies,
and financing for education. The NESP outlined the strategy for Malawi to achieve equitable
access to education, improve quality, and improve governance and management of the sector.

4.       The reform agenda in the NESP was largely based on the findings of the Country Status
Report (CSR) and a high-level dialogue with stakeholders. The reforms included (a) increasing
accountability by providing grants to schools for the implementation of school improvement plans;
(b) hiring teaching assistants in rural schools to help address the high PTR; (c) reducing the barriers
of entry into teaching for rural teachers; and (d) expanding and improving education infrastructure,
including classrooms, school facilities, and teachers’ housing in difficult areas.

5.      All development partners (DPs) had committed to support the NESP through a sectorwide
approach (SWAp) (so that all future activities were outlined within these plans and on budget)
following education partners’ signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in January 2010.
In addition, a Joint Financing Agreement (JFA) was signed between the GoM and DPs to articulate
joint commitments. The parties to the arrangement included the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry
of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST), and the following DPs: Germany/KfW, U.K.

    To implement the first phase of the NESP.

                                                               1
 
Department for International Development (DFID), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
and the World Bank (under both IDA and FTI). The SWAp MoU and JFA envisaged priority
setting and budgeting as a joint process between the GoM and DPs and embracing civil society
and the private sector. Subsequently, the Project to Improve Education Quality in Malawi
(PIEQM) was designed to support the NESP goals through key interventions that improve access
and equity, quality, and governance. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the PIEQM was
the document to guide investments under the JFA.

Rationale for Bank and FTI Involvement

6.      Malawi had met the prerequisites for support from the FTI. Moreover, the existing aid
flows were not sufficient to create the momentum necessary to accomplish the goal of quality
universal basic education, given the extensive needs in the education sector and the weak but
improving macroeconomic situation. The project was consistent with the Bank Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Malawi (2007–2010) 2 in support of the MGDS 2006–2011. The MGDS
underscored the importance of education for economic growth and social protection. The CAS
specifically proposed that the Bank stays strongly involved in supporting education programs as a
mechanism to address poverty and inequality. Moreover, the NESP was fully consistent with the
Malawi CAS goals of strengthening Malawi’s foundation for supporting economic growth through
human capital accumulation.

7.      Within the framework of a SWAp, through a MoU and JFA, partners will support the
education sector in a more coordinated and harmonized fashion. The Bank’s involvement in this
arrangement will improve the efficiency of its support to the NESP and reduce transaction costs
for the government, in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Bank’s global
experience in the management of SWAps, education reforms in low-income countries, and its
expertise in fiduciary management will provide the needed technical and fiduciary expertise
essential for an effective SWAp. Moreover, the project will contribute to the attainment of two
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): 2 (achieving universal primary education) and 3
(promoting gender equality and empowering women).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.     The PDO was to increase access and equity and enhance quality of the teaching and
learning environment in basic education.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/justification

10.      The PDOs and associated indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The project’s target population included the following: (a) all primary school students in
public schools; (b) disadvantaged children in lower secondary; and (c) about 12,000 rural teachers.
The project was expected to help 3.7 million beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.     The project had three components: (a) improve access and equity; (b) improve the teaching
and learning environment; (c) improve management capacity at all levels.

Component 1: Improve Access and Equity (Original: US$96 million; actual: US$81.9
million)

13.    Subcomponent 1.1: Construct and upgrade education facilities (Original: US$70
million; actual: US$69.9 million). This subcomponent was to finance (a) the update of the 2001
school mapping exercise and (b) construction, rehabilitation, and upgrade of a wide range of
education facilities for pupils and teachers, including teacher training colleges (TTCs), particularly
in areas where inadequate physical infrastructure hinders school attendance of marginalized
children. All the construction was to be implemented by the Education Infrastructure Management
Unit (EIMU) of the MoEST.

14.    Subcomponent 1.2: Provide direct support to disadvantaged children (Original:
US$26 million; actual: US$12 million). This component envisaged to increase the participation
of marginalized students in basic education by financing the following: (a) secondary school
bursary packages (that is, tuition, textbooks, exam fees) and stipends; (b) development and
implementation of communication strategy; (c) a rigorous evaluation to identify incentive
packages that are cost-effective and lead to improvement in school participation and outcomes.

Component 2: Improve the Teaching and Learning Environment (Original: US$59 million;
actual: US$87.3 million)

15.     Subcomponent 2.1: Provide textbooks and learning materials (Original: US$48
million; actual: US$49.6 million). This subcomponent was designed to support printing and
distribution of textbooks and learning materials and provision of pedagogic aids for basic
education.

16.     Subcomponent 2.2: Train teachers through open distance learning (ODL) (Original:
US$11 million; actual: 37.7 million). This subcomponent was designed to improve the number
of qualified teachers in basic education by supporting the implementation of an ODL program.
This subcomponent financed the (a) printing and distribution of ODL materials; (b) supervision of
ODL students through procurement of vehicles; (c) upgrade of teacher development centers
(TDCs) and a TTC so that ODL can be delivered more effectively through them; and (d) evaluation
of the effectiveness of ODL to improve education quality in underserved communities.

Component 3: Improve Management Capacity at All Levels (Original: US$90 million;
actual: US$44.9 million)

17.     Subcomponent 3.1: Support teacher management reform (Original: US$9 million;
actual: US$8.6 million). This subcomponent was designed to address systemwide constraints in
teacher management by financing the following: (a) implementation of a program of activities to
support continuous professional development and teacher management and (b) development of an
integrated Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS).

18.     Subcomponent 3.2: Support school improvement planning (SIP) (Original: US$69
million; actual: US$30.9 million). This subcomponent was designed to improve education
service delivery by increasing the flow of resources to the school level by financing (a) training
for all public school personnel, school management committees (SMCs), and parent-teacher
associations (PTAs) in planning, financial management (FM), and accountability to produce
school improvement plans and budget and (b) provision of school grants to deliver the plans.

19.     Subcomponent 3.3: Strengthen planning and budgetary management (Original:
US$12 million; actual: US$5.4 million). This subcomponent supported activities to strengthen
the capacity of the district and central levels to provide planning, financial, and technical oversight
based on a Capacity Development Strategy for education capacity-building activities, including:
(a) upgrading certification and implementing divisional refresher workshops for staff in FM and
procurement at all levels; (b) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the SWAp; and (c) improving
education planning capacity building at the central and district levels based on the strategies
prepared by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID).

1.6 Revised Components

20.     The components were not formally revised.

21.     Although there was no formal reallocation of funds, resources were reallocated to support
training of a larger number of teachers for rural schools in response to the government’s priority

                                                  4
 
to significantly reduce class sizes in rural schools. This was facilitated by a reallocation of funds
from Subcomponents 1.2 and 3.2. Expenditure under Subcomponent 3.2 (support to SIP) was
almost half of what was planned, even though all districts were covered because of the phasing in
of districts to allow for capacity building at the district and school levels. Actual expenditure under
Subcomponent 1.2 (support to disadvantaged children) was almost half of what was planned due
to the delayed start of the program, as guidelines and communication materials were being
developed to guide the program, and the cautious move by the government to take on a manageable
number of students that they could sustain after project closing.

1.7 Other significant Changes

Restructuring

22.    In December 2011, the Financing Agreement was amended to allow the Local
Development Fund (LDF) as an additional implementation arrangement for primary school
classroom construction.

23.      The closing date of the EFA FTI Catalytic Fund Grant was extended twice by a cumulative
total of two years to enable the government to (a) complete the implementation of ongoing
activities critical for the achievement of the PDO; (b) utilize the remaining unutilized balance of
funds under the grant; and (c) consolidate results and lessons learned by submission of the next
application for funding from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) (former EFA FTI). The
first extension was in June 2013 for a period of one and half years, from June 30, 2013 to December
30, 2014. The second extension was in December 2014 for a period of six months from December
30, 2014 to June 30, 2015 to facilitate alignment of the EFA FTI and IDA closing dates and enable
achievement of the PDOs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

24.     Soundness of background analysis. Project preparation included sound background
analysis in the form of a comprehensive CSR on the education sector which was prepared in close
collaboration with a multi-ministerial national team and local institutions. An institutional capacity
assessment was carried out for the education sector to identify gaps and measures to address them.
In addition, detailed analyses were undertaken to establish the funding gap, fiduciary as well as
social and environmental risks.

25.     Adequacy of government commitment. There was strong government commitment to
the project, since education was a high priority as reflected in Malawi’s Growth and Development
Strategy (2007–2011) and in the CAS at the time. The government had made the education sector
a priority and had committed to addressing the key issues faced by the sector as stated in the NESP.
This plan was approved by the highest levels of the government and represented the government
vision in the education sector. The government commitment was further evidenced through the
JFA in which the government committed to increasing or at least maintaining the real level of its
own budget provision for education.



                                                  5
 
26.     Assessment of design. The project was well designed with a clear PDO and clear causal
chain with outputs and intermediate outcomes which could be plausibly linked to expected
outcomes. The design included interventions to address the critical demand side (through school
grants, bursaries, and transfers to lower secondary students), the supply side (infrastructure where
this was a bottleneck to enrollment and retention of trained teachers to reduce class sizes in rural
areas), and capacity constraints in the education sector. The design focused on specific aspects of
the NESP—increase availability of education infrastructure, decrease the cost of education for
disadvantaged groups, improve availability of learning materials, enhance the quality and quantity
of teachers, and improve management capacity at all levels. This focus was in response to the CSR
findings which pointed to inadequate school infrastructure, financial constraints, and excessive
PTRs as being key factors in increasing access and retention. The design should have been more
explicit on actions for redeployment of teachers to create room for facilitating recruitment of
teachers to rural schools within the existing wage bill3 and on addressing other system factors that
affect completion.

27.    The project represented a programmatic approach to ensuring the provision of quality
education and increasing participation of marginalized children in basic education. It was part of
the support to a coordinated and harmonized SWAp that aimed at reducing transaction costs for
the government, since planning, budgeting, and monitoring for pooled funding activities was
supposed to be coordinated. In addition to the IDA credit, the SWAp was jointly financed by grants
from the GPE (US$90 million), DFID (US$90 million), Germany (US$25 million), and UNICEF
(US$1 million). A Joint Financing Arrangement describing the eligible expenditures, structure,
and institutional mechanisms for the SWAp was signed by all pooled partners. Eligible
expenditures under the pooled fund included the seven subcomponents of the PIEQM. The JFA
included provision for the Bank to be responsible for fiduciary aspects under the pooled fund. The
Bank was also the supervising entity for the GPE grant.

28.      The MoEST was appropriately placed as the implementing agency. The Education Sector
Working Group (SWG), chaired by the permanent secretary, was to monitor and oversee
implementation following the GoM guidelines for institutionalizing the SWGs which provided an
avenue for discussion of technical issues on a regular basis. The design also focused on
strengthening planning and budgetary management rightly aimed at addressing the weak
institutional capacity of the district and central levels to provide planning and technical oversight
in FM, procurement, and M&E of the SWAp. This oversight was intended to ensure that the key
components were being properly implemented and monitored. These mechanisms proved to be
robust as project implementation continued even during the political crisis that led to a change in
political leadership.

29.     A Specific Investment Loan was the appropriate instrument given the capacity constraints
and to help focus on specific activities that will have an impact on the identified objectives. Pooling
resources with other partners helped to achieve efficiency in implementation through a more
coordinated approach to planning, budgeting, and M&E.

30.    The design took into consideration lessons learned from other projects. The Bank team
looked for other experiences in the areas of stakeholder participation in project preparation,
                                                            
3
    There is a high variation in PTR between grades, schools, and location. The PQTR ranges between 30 and 90.

                                                               6
 
education access and quality, community participation, and pooled funding. The previous Direct
Support to Schools Program was carefully reviewed and lessons on the need for capacity building
and flexibility in grant guidelines while allowing for a balance between national- and school-level
priorities were used to design the subcomponent on the SIP. Lessons from health/human
immunodeficiency virus pooled fund informed the design of implementation and fiduciary
arrangements for the project.

31.     The EIMU was assigned the role of sole implementing agency for classroom construction.
This was because at the time of project design, there was significant donor-funded technical
assistance.4 However, continuation of this technical assistance to the government budget did not
materialize, and this led to a slow pace of construction during the first year of project
implementation. The change to include the LDF 5 during the 2011 restructuring significantly
improved the pace of classroom construction. The LDF constructed about 80 percent of the
planned classrooms and at a lower cost than those constructed by the EIMU.

32.      The design proved to be ambitious in two respects. First, the GPE funding was only for
three years and had to be extended for two more years to facilitate completion of ongoing activities
which were critical for the achievement of the PDOs and to utilize the remaining funds. Second,
institutional-strengthening activities were beyond the capacity of the MoEST and this resulted in
many of the activities focusing on teacher management and learning assessment not being
implemented.

33.     Assessment of risks. The overall project risk was assessed as Substantial at entry. In
general, the project’s risks and measures to mitigate them were identified and incorporated in the
project design. One risk was rated High and the others Substantial at entry. All the identified risks
materialized to a moderate extent but were proactively addressed by the Bank team, the pooled
DPs, and the MoEST to facilitate implementation.

34.     The High risk of limited implementation capacity at the central and provincial levels was
mitigated to Substantial by recruitment of technical advisors two years in critical areas and capacity
building. Although technical advisors and capacity-building activities helped the project, they did
not fully address the capacity issues.

    2.2 Implementation

35.      Factors outside government control. There were two factors outside government control.
First, the global economic crisis and its impact on Malawi’s economy and financial situation. The
economic crisis led to devaluation of the kwacha by about 50 percent in 2012 and subsequent
floatation of the currency. This had several implications on project outcomes. For example, the
deployment of ODL teachers was delayed due to wage bill limitations. Second, heavy rains and
floods damaged classrooms and instructional materials and also led to construction delays. The
floods that occurred in early 2015 led to the damage of over 500 classrooms and some instructional
materials, reducing the number of available classrooms and textbooks and thus impacting the
                                                            
4
  At the time of the PIEQM approval, the EIMU was managing two large school construction projects with technical
assistance support from the DFID.
5
  The LDF was established in 1994 to undertake community construction under the Bank Malawi Social Action
Fund (MASAF) Program.

                                                               7
 
outcome indicators relating to pupil to classroom ratio and pupil to textbook ratio. Moreover,
heavy rains made some construction sites inaccessible and brickmaking difficult, leading to delays
in construction activities.

36.      Factors subject to government control. There were three major factors subject to the
government’s control. First, government commitment and policies facilitated implementation. The
GoM decentralization policy and the National Strategy for Community Participation facilitated
capacity building and the devolution of a substantial amount of funds to districts and then to
schools and this facilitated implementation of school construction activities and school
improvement grants. School grants were provided within this broader government strategy which
facilitated a comprehensive approach to supporting schools. The Kalondolondo Report on school
construction reported better quality classrooms where there was strong community participation.
In addition, the SMCs and village chiefs were actively involved in mobilization of parents to enroll
their children in school, and support to student welfare like volunteering to prepare meals for
students. On the other hand, the centralized bulk procurement of instructional materials through
international competitive bidding helped reduce unit costs for textbooks. Moreover, the
government also increased the teacher wage bill (in 2012 and again in 2015) to facilitate
recruitment of ODL graduate teachers to rural schools.

37.     Second, slow progress in decentralizing the HRMIS coupled with lack of proper
coordination among the Department of Teacher Education Development, the Directorate of Basic
Education, and the Directorate of Human Resources Management Division led to slow pace of
implementation of activities related to teacher management reform under Component 3 of the
project.

38.     Third, the 2013 public FM scandal (referred to as ‘cashgate scandal6 in Malawi’) affected
available resources and the pace of implementation. While the scandal did not affect the education
sector, it resulted in withdrawal of funding by the JFA DPs and disbursement delays. Withdrawal
of funding by the DPs reduced the resource envelope by 26.3 percent (US$67.4 million) of eligible
expenditures under the SWAp Program.7 Following the withdrawal by the JFA DPs, the Bank
team proactively worked with the MoEST to analyze the implications of the reduced funds and
agree actions to ensure that the targets were achieved. The government picked up much of the
funding gap created as a result of the withdrawal by the pooled partners. The scandal also led to
disbursement delays as the project team had to resort to manually processing Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs) following the suspension of the IFMIS, as the government tightened financial
controls. This affected the pace of implementation as there were delays of up to six months in
opening letters of credit for textbooks and cost increases for construction under the EIMU as
contractors started charging interest after 45 days of submitting certificates and invoices for
payment (11 out of 88 classrooms were not completed by project closing). The MoEST had to
reach an agreement with the DFID to finance the completion of these unfinished classrooms.

39.     Four factors were subject to the MoEST (the implementing agency) control. First, the
limited coordination between the MoEST with the Local Government Finance Committee led to
                                                            
6
  Civil servants used the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to withdraw large sums of
government funds for personal use.
7
  The Bank’s continued engagement was based on an in-depth review of FM issues in the project and after a Joint
Sector Review (JSR).

                                                               8
 
delays in submission of statement of expenditures by the districts and processing of IFRs, thus
contributing to delays in release of school grants. Second, high staff turnover and lack of a
dedicated focal point person for each of the components or subcomponents led to limited
ownership by the technical departments and slow or lack of implementation of some activities. For
example, most of the planned human resources activities were not implemented. Third, community
contribution to construction was a challenge for some communities because of unavailability or
cost of the materials they were supposed to contribute. The use of soil-stabilized blocks for
classroom construction helped to address this problem and enhanced community participation in
school construction activities. Fourth, the low capacity of the Procurement Unit led to delays in
procurement, particularly of textbooks as it took several iterations between the Bank and the unit
to get the documents right. As a result of these delays, more than 70 percent of the textbooks were
delivered during the last six months of implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

40.     M&E design. Overall, the project M&E was designed with appropriate measurable
outcome and intermediate indicators to measure progress toward the PDOs although with moderate
shortcomings. The PDOs were clearly defined and indicators were aligned with the PDOs and
components. The baseline for all the indicators was included in the PAD. In hindsight, the Results
Framework should have included a PDO indicator to measure the availability of textbooks as a
means of improving the teaching and learning environment, given the substantial investment in
providing textbooks and learning materials, and their importance in improving the learning
environment. In addition, an outcome indicator to measure improved availability of qualified
teachers in rural areas (rather than teachers overall)8 would have been more appropriate. Moreover,
the GER is not a good measure of access given the high repetition rates (above 20 percent) and the
continuing phenomena of out-of-age enrollment 9 in Malawi. In addition, the target for
beneficiaries of bursaries and cash transfers was ambitious.10 Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain
accurate data on the school attendance age group in a system where there is no systematic birth
registration. This made it difficult to determine realistic estimates for the NER and completion
rates using the Education Management Information System (EMIS) data.

41.     The design included appropriate mechanisms for collection, analysis, and dissemination of
data. The EMIS was the main instrument for capturing and analyzing data on inputs, outputs, and
outcomes. In cases where data were not captured from the EMIS, performance reports were
prepared by the respective departments. The design focused on building the sector’s capacity at
the school, district, and central levels to produce reliable education data and to monitor and
evaluate specific education interventions. Mechanisms were put in place for capacity building and
ensuring the quality of performance information by requiring district education managers (DEMs)
to review performance data before they send it to the Ministry of Education for entry into the
EMIS. The design also envisaged Joint Annual Reviews to discuss overall progress and quarterly
joint monitoring meetings based on quarterly monitoring reports that show financial, procurement,
and activity progress. Although the original M&E design used EMIS data as a basis for monitoring
                                                            
8
  The Results Framework indicates the PTR. Although the arrangements for results monitoring indicate Pupil to
Qualified Teacher Ratio (PQTR) this focuses on the national average rather than rural areas.
9
  This is close to 50 percent based on the EMIS.
10
   Per year, 15,000 students will be added. This would result in 75,000 students, but the Results Framework target
was 315,000.

                                                               9
 
project achievements, the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey which was undertaken in 2014
identified some inaccuracies in the EMIS data. The JSR of 2015 agreed on addressing these issues
under the proposed GPE Project. While the Welfare Monitoring Surveys and Household Surveys
would have facilitated a more accurate reporting on the completion rate and the NER, these were
not an annual exercise.

42.     The project design envisaged that the MoEST would collaborate with international and
local research institutions to undertake rigorous impact evaluations to identify cost-effective
models of delivery of ODL, direct support to disadvantaged children, and other areas identified
during the course of implementation. The design also included technical audits for construction
and annual procurement audits. The mechanisms put in place were appropriate given the SWAp
and the progress made by the MoEST in establishing an M&E system as noted by the ministry’s
capacity needs assessment of the M&E system.

43.     M&E implementation and utilization. Overall, M&E was well incorporated into actual
implementation for the most part. The Ministry of Education produced quarterly reports. These
reports were informed by the EMIS and departmental reports, and provided the basis for
monitoring progress on agreed indicators through quarterly SWG meetings. The ministry also used
EMIS data to prepare a yearly comprehensive sector performance report that was discussed at the
annual JSR. The monitoring information shared during the quarterly meetings and annual joint
reviews identified the extremely slow pace of classroom construction by the EIMU and led to
changes to introduce the LDF as an additional agency for classroom construction. Information
from the EMIS was also used for preparation of program of work (PoW) for the subsequent year.

44.     An in-depth technical audit was undertaken to assess the actual quality of construction and
compare the value-for-money provided by the two construction programs. The report showed that
communities’ assessments of the quality of construction was uneven across districts and averaged
above the ‘satisfactory’ score. The results were used by the LDF to revise its guidelines to address
quality issues and community contribution. An evaluation of school grants indicated advantages
of addressing school-level needs, and this resulted in a decision to change the guidelines toward a
‘needs-based’ formula. The new guidelines are being prepared with support from UNICEF.

45.     There were some shortcomings in M&E implementation. The completion rate was not
tracked on a regular basis due to unavailability of age-specific enrollment data to facilitate
calculation of completion rates. The evaluations relating to ODL were not completed during the
project period, although this did not impact the measurement of PDO indicators. While there was
capacity building to improve the EMIS, and the pooled partners actively worked with the MoEST
to improve the quality of the EMIS, concerns remain on the accuracy of data. For example,
reporting of an NER of over 100 percent indicates inaccuracies in reporting on appropriate age or
under reporting on dropout and this also presented challenges in monitoring of the completion rate.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

46.     Social and environmental safeguards. The project triggered two Bank Safeguard
Policies. These are OP 4.01 (Environment Assessment) and OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement).
The project was classified as Category B according to Bank OP 4.01 due to planned construction


                                                10
 
activities. In line with Bank policies, the MoEST updated and disclosed both its Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).

47.     The project complied with the safeguard policies. Environmental and Social Management
Plans (ESMPs) were prepared for all classroom projects implemented under the LDF and a
separate ESMP for classroom projects under the MoEST. A consultant was appointed to undertake
follow-up field visits and provide backup advisory services on safeguards adherence in project
activities. The project also used environmentally friendly construction materials such as cement
blocks and stabilized soil blocks, steel doors, and window frames.

48.     A separate ESMF for construction of the Phalombe Teachers College was prepared in
October 2009. The ESMF provided for procedures for the construction and rehabilitation of
education facilities requiring an environmental impact assessment. The project triggered OP 4.12
for Involuntary Resettlement due to nine households that lived on the land earmarked for the
college. All project-affected people were compensated for loss of land and assets by the GoM and
assisted in relocating to suitable alternative sites in line with the provisions of the Resettlement
Action Plan.

49.     Financial Management. Although the Malawi country FM system was assessed to have
met the requirements of the Bank’s OP/BP 10.02, an FM assessment for the MoEST concluded
that there was substantial FM risk. The assessment identified several strengths and weaknesses
and an action plan to address the weaknesses was agreed upon. FM supervision was carried out on
a regular basis by a field-based staff. Supervision missions confirmed that all financial covenants
were complied with albeit with delay, an adequate FM system and internal controls were in place
within the MoEST, the action plan was being implemented, and counterpart funds were provided
as planned. Audit reports were submitted six to twelve months late for all the years. There were
also delays in the submission of IFRs. Audit reports were qualified mainly due to administrative
actions, for example, delays in payment of suppliers despite availability of pooled funds, and
errors.11 Delays in submission of audit reports were due to delays in procurement of auditors and
use of a government system (IFMIS) which is not activity-based, thus making tracking of
expenditures difficult. Further, the 2013 and 2014 audit reports were qualified with issues related
to undocumented transactions indicating issues related to limited FM capacity within the MoEST.
Both audit reports expressed a clean audit opinion on the use of pool funds for eligible
expenditures. The Bank team undertook an in-depth audit for 2013 and agreed on specific actions
which were implemented by the government. The Bank team plans to undertake an in-depth audit
for 2014.

50.     Procurement. An assessment of the country procurement system and the capacity of the
MoEST to implement the project procurement activities was carried out by the Bank team during
preparation. This assessment found that procurement practices did not fully comply with
international practices. The overall capacity to carry out procurement was moderate and the risk
was Substantial. The covenants relating to procurement (adequately staffed Procurement Unit and
annual procurement audit) were complied with, although the project experienced frequent staff
turnover at the beginning. Procurement guidelines were generally followed and completed in a

                                                            
11
  Although the project used government systems, the Bank required the same reporting procedures as a regular SIL.
The IFMIS was prone to error since it was not activity based.

                                                               11
 
satisfactory manner although in some cases with delay, and one textbook tender had to be cancelled
and repeated due to governance concern. An annual procurement audit was undertaken.
Procurement performance was slightly weak initially, but gradually improved as a result of
capacity-building activities undertaken by the Bank team. 

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.     The transition arrangements for post-project operations have been put in place with regard
to ensuring sustainability of classrooms constructed under the project. Currently, the school grant
includes a portion for school maintenance. The proposed GPE Project, scheduled for approval in
July 2016, will continue supporting the strategies to improve school infrastructure, enhance school
improvement grants to improve promotion and retention, and focus on improvement of learning at
the classroom level.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

52.      Relevance of objectives. The relevance of objectives is considered high. The PDOs are
highly relevant to the objectives of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for FY13–16, which
was designed to help the GoM to implement its development priorities which are articulated in the
MGDS II (2014–2016). In particular, the PDOs are consistent with the Country Partnership
Strategy theme 2: enhancing human capital and reducing vulnerabilities, result area of improved
access to quality education. The MGDS prioritizes building the human capital base through
investment in quality education. The PDOs also remain consistent with the government’s ESIP II,
2015/16–2017/18, which continues to emphasize increase in access, equity, and quality of
education. Furthermore, the project remains consistent with GPE goals: access for all and learning
for all. It is also consistent with the Bank goals of enhancing shared prosperity given its objective
of increasing equity.

53.     Relevance of design. The relevance of project design is modest. The project was well
designed with appropriate and clear PDOs, and a clear link between activities financed by the
project, intermediate outcomes, and expected outcomes. Project components were well placed to
support the achievement of the intermediate outcomes, which were in turn essential for achieving
the PDO and GPE goals.

54.    The first component addressed supply- and demand-side problems of education
provision/access through expansion of education infrastructure for students in areas where
inadequate infrastructure hinders access by marginalized children. An improvement in availability
of infrastructure will also decrease dropouts through increased accessibility of schools and
improved classroom environment. The direct support to marginalized students to address
economic barriers provided motivation for students to complete primary education in anticipation
of support to attend secondary school. Previous rigorously evaluated pilot studies of cash and in-
kind transfer programs found such transfers to be effective in raising school enrollment and
attendance. However, specific actions to address other factors, for example, high repetition rates
(over 20 percent) and appropriate age of entry which affect the completion rate should have been
made more explicit and monitored accordingly.

                                                 12
 
55.     The second component, correctly supported improvement of the teaching and learning
environment by providing textbooks, learning materials, and pedagogic aids for pupils and
teachers to support implementation of the new curriculum, and in line with the MoEST strategy of
allocating one textbook per learner for each subject. Provision of textbooks will help to reduce the
pupil to textbook ratio. Likewise, to provide an immediate solution to the chronic shortage of
qualified teachers, resulting in an extremely high PTR particularly in rural areas, the project
supported an ODL program. Although the project supported local recruitment of student teachers
to schools where they are needed, there should have been specific actions to redistribute teachers
between geographical areas, schools, and grades.12

56.     The third component, improve management capacity at all levels, was relevant as it
supported interventions to strengthen the sector’s institutional capacity. Grants to schools proved
to be a highly successful strategy to quickly respond to school needs, including auxiliary teachers,
instructional materials, minor infrastructure improvements, and support to disadvantaged students
(for example, providing uniforms) and therefore supporting progress toward the three PDOs.
Training of the DEMs, public school personnel, the SMCs, and PTAs was critical for building
capacity to produce school improvement plans and budgets which were the basis for approval of
school grants. The support to an integrated HRMIS correctly aimed at addressing system-wide
constraints in teacher management and deployment. However, teacher management activities were
barely implemented due to human and institutional constraints, including weak coordination.

3.2 Achievement of PDOs
Rating: Substantial

57.    The PDOs of increasing access and equity and enhancing the quality of the teaching and
learning environment were substantially achieved with efficiency.

58.     The project presents challenges in evaluation. First, the quality of education data in Malawi
remains poor as indicated in the M&E section. For this reason, assessment of the access indicator
uses the Welfare Monitoring Survey13 for 2014, and the equity indicator uses Household Survey
data. Second, some of the indicators (for example, completion rate and GER) were influenced by
other factors, including age-specific estimates, repetition rates, and under reporting of dropouts).

59.     Increase access. Overall, the project had a substantial impact on increasing access. The
NER increased from 79 to 88 percent between 2010 and 2014 (exceeding an end-of-project target
of 83 percent). Net intake rate increased from 85.9 percent in 2012 to 97.5 percent in 2014, leading
to an unprecedented increase in school-age population. Overall, the number of children enrolled
in primary schools increased from 3.67 million in 2009 to 4.67 million in 2014 (27 percent
increase). This is an increase of more than 4.1 percent per year, much more than the natural
demographic increase of 2.8 percent per year in 2008. The project directly contributed to this
achievement through construction of 2,936 classrooms in areas where infrastructure limitations
constrained enrollment (achieving 97.8 percent of the end-of-project target of 3,000 classrooms
with accompanying sanitation facilities). It is worth noting that enrollment in schools where
                                                            
12
   There remain high inequalities in teacher allocation between schools and grades with the PTR ranging between
100:1 in lower grades and 50:1 in grades 7 and 8; and between schools with some schools at 70:1 and 2 out of 5
schools at 50:1.
13
   The Welfare Monitoring Survey is conducted every two years.

                                                               13
 
construction took place increased by an average of 30 percent compared to 8 percent in schools
where there was no construction. During the completion mission, stakeholders alluded to increase
in enrollment as being a result of construction of classrooms. They mentioned improved
appearance (‘image’) as making schools less shameful to go to but also the perception that they
offer better quality education than the schools with extremely poor structures.

60.     Increase equity. The project had a modest impact on increasing equity because progress
in equity targets is mixed. The outcomes specified in the PAD for measuring the equity outcomes
are direct project beneficiaries and PCR (both rural and urban). The project directly benefited
4,670,279 students, exceeding the target by 26 percent (of which 50 percent are female).14 Tables
2 and 3 show PCRs for grades 5 and 8 for 2010 and 2013.15 Between 2010 and 2013, PCRs (grade
8) for urban areas improved from 5116 to 53 percent. In rural areas, PCRs declined from 25 to 24
percent during the same period. The completion rates for grade 5 increased for both rural and urban
areas, indicating a high likelihood of translating into higher completion rates for grade 8.

61.    Between 2010 and 2013, the PCRs (grade 8) for boys increased by 2 percentage points,
while that for girls declined by about 2 percentage points.

62.      While other factors may have contributed to the increase in equity, project activities
contributed directly. First, provision of school improvement grants to all schools (achieving the
end-of-project target of 100 percent). School improvement grants were successful in responding
to school needs, including supporting disadvantaged students through provision of personal needs,
for example, school uniforms. A key finding of a recent impact evaluation of the Primary School
Improvement Program is that non-staff inputs acquired by schools under the program played a
critical role in improving the internal efficiency of primary schools by reducing repetition and
dropout rates. This is demonstrated by an increase in completion rates for grade 5 in all categories
(rural, urban, males, and females). Moreover, an analysis using the Quality of Service Delivery

   IDA core indicator.

   Based on the 2013 Household Survey data. More recent data is not available.
16
   Since the age-specific numbers from the EMIS were not reliable, the baseline for PCR was recalculated using the
same methodology as the actual values achieved (based on the Household Survey data for 2013). This resulted in a
baseline of 24.82 and 51.02 percent for rural and urban areas, respectively.

                                                                             14
 
Survey and the EMIS data found availability of classrooms and non-salary recurrent expenditure
to have a significant impact on the promotion rates17 as evidenced by increase in survival rates for
grades 1–5. Second, providing direct support to 70,052 students (achieving 93.4 percent of the
end-of-project target of 75,000), and all these beneficiary students are still enrolled in school.
Third, construction of 14 girls’ hostels,18 exceeding the target by 27 percent. Discussions with
stakeholders19 where girls’ hostels were constructed indicate high appreciation for the hostels and
their importance in keeping girls from remote areas in school. Between 2012 and 2015, dropout
rates for girls and boys reduced by 2.3 and 1.1 points, respectively.

63.     Enhance the teaching and learning environment. The project had a substantial impact
on the teaching and learning environment. The assessment of this outcome uses the following three
indicators: (a) PQTR (including in rural areas) since this is a better measure of improved
availability of qualified teachers, which was the intention of the project; (b) pupil to textbook ratio;
and (c) pupil to classroom ratio.

64.     Between 2010 and 2015, the PTR improved from 91.5:1 to 66:1, exceeding the end-of
project target of 87:1.20 Most importantly, the improvement for rural areas was 27 points (95:1 to
68:1) compared to only a 4-point improvement for urban areas (68:1 to 64:1) during the same
period, and this also contributed to equity. The project contributed to these outcomes through
recruitment of untrained teachers from rural areas and placing them in schools near or in their
home communities as student teachers for a period of two years as they gained their full teaching
qualification. A total of 23,550 teachers were trained21 through the ODL program and certified
based on the teacher training standards for Primary Teacher Education in Malawi (exceeding the
end-of-project target by 96 percent). This led to a rapid improvement in the PTR in rural areas.
The first cohort of ODL graduates were hired in 2012 which is evident in the significant
improvement in the PQTR for rural areas from 95:1 in 2012 to 76:1 in 2013. Parents and head
teachers alluded to improved availability of teachers in rural schools. They also reported improved
teacher attendance in rural schools where teachers’ houses have been constructed. An evaluation
of the school grants program also found an improvement in qualified teacher attendance. Although
intermediate indicators relating to the teacher management system were not achieved, this did not
have an impact on the achievement of the PDO but will affect future activities focusing on
improving teacher management.

65.    There was significant improvement in pupil to textbook ratio for English and mathematics
for Grade 3 and Grade 7 with both these rates improving to 1:1, meeting the end-of-project target.
To achieve this improvement, the project financed the procurement and distribution of 26,937,976
textbooks to schools, exceeding the end-of-project target by 154 percent. Although about 70
percent of the textbooks were delivered during the last six months of project implementation and

   The process involved a short induction course, on-the-job supervision, mentoring, continued training, and
examinations before they were certified.

                                                               15
 
did not contribute to an improved learning environment during project implementation, their
delivery to schools demonstrates the likelihood of an improved learning environment.

66.     Although the pupil to classroom ratio shows a worsening trend from 100 to 127 (against
the end-of-project target of 97), it should be recognized that improvements were eroded by the
higher-than-predicted increase in primary school population during the course of the project. This
population increase was much higher than in the previous years. This demonstrates the school
infrastructure challenge in Malawi. The impact of floods on classrooms, high repetition and intake
rates may also explain slow progress in improvement of the pupil to classroom ratio.

3.3 Efficiency

67.    Efficiency is considered modest. The project activities were completed within the
timeframe, comparative costs were very favorable, and the inputs were cost-effective, but with
moderate shortcomings on account of implementation delays. The implementation delays were
moderate since activities were completed within the project implementation period.

68.      Available information suggests a comparatively lower unit cost of civil works by the EIMU
at US$173 compared to classrooms financed by other agencies like the UNICEF at US$161, JICA
at US$479, and Africa Development Fund at US$ 421. The move to community-based
construction through the LDF led to substantial cost reduction (unit cost of US$107), with over 80
percent of construction undertaken by the LDF. This was achieved through the use of local
artisans, a long-tested community construction modality. However, this high level of efficiency is
moderated by the initial slow pace of construction by the EIMU and concerns about the low quality
of initial classrooms constructed through the LDF approach. Improved supervision from both the
districts and the LDF, and revision of the guidelines for recruitment of local artisans helped to
quickly improve the quality of construction. A DFID-financed report from the ‘Kalondolondo
project’, a consortium of three nongovernmental organizations, indicates that the assessment of
the quality of construction was uneven across districts but averaged above the ‘satisfactory’ score.
While there were inefficiencies resulting from delays in construction due to delays in release of
funds and cost escalation in construction arising from interest charges by contractors as a result of
delayed payments of their invoices, this mainly affected EIMU construction which comprised only
about 20 percent of the construction.

69.     The delivery of textbooks was undertaken with delays, resulting in over 70 percent of the
textbooks being delivered during the last month of project implementation. This was counteracted
by the significant number of textbooks procured (26.9 million) compared to the planned 9.8
million, at 81 percent of the planned budget, indicating a significantly lower unit cost and within
the project implementation period. The unit cost of textbooks for standard 1 and standard 2 was
US$0.60, for standards 3 to 8 it was US$0.36, while it was US$12.23 for secondary education
textbooks. Although the unit cost for secondary education textbooks was high, the overall unit cost
was US$1.12. Compared to other countries, the unit cost of primary education textbooks under the
PIEQM was at the lower end while the unit cost for lower secondary textbooks was much higher.

70.     Without the incremental investments of the project, the key indicators including pupil to
classroom ratio, PTR (particularly for rural areas), and pupil to textbook ratio would have been
significantly worse. The impact of the Primary School Improvement Program found improvement

                                                 16
 
in repetition and dropout rates although this is yet to be reflected in the PCRs. There were also
institutional development results in strengthening planning and budgeting, enabling the sector to
move from incremental to output-based budgeting and capacity for all schools to prepare school
improvement plans against which grants are disbursed to address local needs.

71.    Based on a discount rate of 7.6 percent for the benefits and costs stream, the net present
value (NPV) is MK 57.9 billion. The internal rate of return (IRR) associated with this NPV is 26.9
percent.22

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.      The project is considered to have a Moderately Satisfactory rating. This is based on
substantial efficacy, substantial relevance, and modest efficiency. The evidence shows that the
project has substantially achieved its stated objectives of increasing access and equity and
enhancing the quality of the teaching and learning environment. Both the PDOs and design are
relevant. The comparative costs were favorable and inputs were cost-effective, although
shortcomings in efficiency on account of implementation delays detract from a substantial
efficiency rating. While the project faced delays in its early stages, implementation accelerated in
its final phases and all project activities were completed within the project period.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development 
73.     The project placed emphasis on achieving greater equity both in access and quality of
education. Indeed, this was an important part of the design and implementation. First, there was a
comparatively higher increase in PCR in rural areas. Second, there was increase in availability of
qualified teachers in rural schools. Third, there was support to construct girls’ hostels to promote
their access and retention in school. The girls’ hostels were highly appreciated by communities as
an intervention to help to increase enrollment and retention of girls. The ODL program helped to
provide employment opportunities for rural youth.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
74.     The project made significant contribution to institutional strengthening of the education
sector. In particular, the project:

                       Strengthened the EMIS, including the decentralization of data collection. This has
                        led to an improvement in the timeliness of data, although concerns over accuracy
                        still remain. For example, dropout rates are under reported, and the EMIS reports an
                        NER of over 100 percent.

                       Strengthened capacity of schools for planning, budgeting, procurement, and
                        involving communities in school activities. All schools are now preparing and
                        implementing school improvement plans.

              Improved community awareness of issues leading to low learning outcomes and
               causes of dropouts which has helped to strengthen the focus on these issues at the
               local level.

              Some schools upgraded to full primary schools.

              Strengthened the capacity of the MoEST, divisions, and districts for planning and
               budgeting. The MoEST has moved from incremental to output-based budgeting and
               to link the budget to the PoW as well as a systematic link between the Education
               Strategic Plan, Education Sector Implementation Plan and budget.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

75.     As part of the completion mission, the team carried out focus group discussions in six
schools in the districts of Dedza, Salima, Chipoka, and Dowa. While these may not be
representative, they provide a glimpse of beneficiary perceptions of project interventions. For that
reason, the results are summarized below:

              Teachers, parents, and students reported improvement in school infrastructure and
               availability of teachers in rural areas.

              Head teachers and teachers perceived stronger involvement of parents and
               communities in the schools, contributing to school infrastructure, stronger focus on
               participation of disadvantaged students, and student welfare (including preparing
               school meals for students).

              Funds under the SIPs were used to purchase desks, doors for classrooms, plates and
               cups for school meals, exercise books, pencils, and hardcover books for teachers;
               construct additional pit latrines; and support disadvantaged students.

              There is improvement in enrollment and attendance in schools where classrooms had
               been constructed. They mentioned an improved appearance (‘image’) and therefore
               were less shameful to go to these schools.

              Parents and head teachers perceived improved teacher attendance in rural schools
               where teachers’ houses have been constructed.

              The ODL program helped to improve the availability of qualified teachers in rural
               schools, but also provided employment opportunities for rural youth.

76.     Head teachers and parents were of the view that the following should have been done
better:



                                                  18
 
           Training on school management and leadership should have been provided for head
            teachers.

           The SIP guidelines should be less prescriptive to enable schools to address their
            specific needs.

           Students’ bursary funds should have been provided in a timely manner to reduce
            hardship.

           There is need for better sensitization of parents about the amount of cash transfer.
            Some parents thought that what was being provided was adequate and therefore did
            not provide any supplementation leading to frustration.

           Communities selected girls’ hostel because they realized that many girls were
            walking long distances to get to school and those who rented rooms close to school
            were at risk of getting pregnant.

           The timing of selection of beneficiaries immediately at the start of Grade 1 may
            leave out the most vulnerable who delay reporting to school while searching for
            sponsors. These students are better known at the primary-school level than at the
            secondary-school level.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome Rating

77.     The risk to development outcome is assessed as Moderate. The likelihood of not achieving
the development outcome is Moderate overall for the following reasons. First, several risks
identified at appraisal were Moderate during implementation and there are continuing efforts to
address them. Second, the likelihood of not achieving the development outcome due to financial
risks is Substantial. Malawi continues to be highly dependent on external aid and this makes it
vulnerable to unpredictable aid flows and economic shocks. This situation is made worse by the
recent financial mismanagement and misappropriation of funds through the GoM IFMIS which
has eroded the credibility of the country’s economic systems and resulted in an uncertain economic
outlook. This would affect the continued funding of school grants, employment of adequate
number of teachers, continued construction of classrooms in line with the growth of the school age
population, and provision of bursaries and direct support to vulnerable students. However,
government ownership remains high and policies continue to focus on the identified objectives.
Government budget also prioritizes education. Education received the second-largest sector
allocation, only surpassed by agriculture, in the 2014/15 national budget. Recurrent expenditure
on primary education increased from 24.4 percent in FY2011/12 to 55.6 percent in FY2014/15.
The government has put in place plans for incorporating aspects of the ODL program, for example,
an extended practicum in schools into regular teacher training. There is a moderate social risk of
rural teachers moving to urban areas. Moreover, there will be need for continued training of the
SMCs and PTAs to ensure that the high turnover in these positions does not undermine the progress
made so far.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality Entry
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     Overall, the Bank’s performance at preparation and appraisal was strong but with some
minor shortcomings. The preparation was underpinned by sound technical analysis that also used
a participatory approach involving the government, other DPs, and stakeholders. Clear PDOs,
results chain, and institutional framework enhanced the project’s prospects for achieving the
PDOs. Furthermore, the team reviewed lessons from other projects and applied them to this
project. As a result, the project’s strategies appropriately responded to the needs of the sector, and
ensured that both the objectives and design were relevant to the government, Bank, and FTI
strategies. Potential adverse environmental and social impacts were identified and it was verified
that the ESMF and RPF included adequate arrangements for mitigation and monitoring of the
adverse impacts. Fiduciary aspects were also well prepared based on an assessment of capacities.
An institutional capacity assessment for the sector was undertaken and interventions to ensure
readiness for overall implementation and strategies for institutional strengthening that were
ultimately critical for project success were put in place.

79.     The M&E design was strong, including appropriate indicators with baseline and impact
evaluations for two of the key interventions. However, the GER indicator was not appropriate and
the target for pupil to classroom ratio was ambitious. Moreover, the EMIS could not generate
reliable data for monitoring primary completion and the NERs in absence of reliable age-specific
student data.

80.    Although the risks and mitigation measures were appropriate, including a whole
component dedicated to strengthening capacity, the risks associated with capacity to implement
systemic improvements, in particular student assessment and teacher management reforms, was
overestimated.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
81.    The Bank team provided regular implementation support on technical and fiduciary aspects
from the country office and carried out field visits to schools and met with key stakeholders. Aide
memoirs show that several issues were identified and addressed in a timely manner. The Bank
supervision missions included expertise to monitor and ensure that the measures identified in the
ESMF and RPF were being implemented as agreed. Strong technical support was also provided
on procurement of textbooks. The Bank was flexible and agreed to amend the Financing
Agreement to allow for an additional agency, the LDF, to support school construction activities.

82.     The Bank team was proactive in undertaking an in-depth FM assessment, following the
‘cashgate’, to ensure that funds are used for the purposes for which they were intended and with
due regard to economy and efficiency. The team also worked closely with the government to
identify the funding gap that arose following the withdrawal of funding by the pooled funding
donors. There was close collaboration with other DPs and the team participated in the JSRs within

                                                 20
 
the framework of the JFA. However, the Bank team was not proactive in following up on the
planned evaluations, student assessment, and implementation of the teacher management reforms,
including a teacher management information system. Some of the indicators (for example,
completion rate) were not monitored on a regular basis.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
83.     The overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory on account of Moderately
Satisfactory rating for both Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision. The Moderately
Satisfactory rating is based on the following.

84.    There was thorough project preparation, supported by analytical work and strategic
relevance, involving key stakeholders and DPs, and close collaboration with the government
counterparts and attention to fiduciary, environmental, and social safeguards. There were regular
supervision missions and field visits to schools to meet with stakeholders.

85.     On the downside, the planned impact evaluations were not completed during the course of
the project and therefore did not guide implementation or the design of the follow-up sector
strategy, and some indicators were not monitored on a regular basis.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
86.     The government showed strong commitment to the project. The government provided
additional resources following reduction in donor funding. The government increased the wage
ceiling for the education sector to facilitate the recruitment of teachers to rural schools. Although
this may not be a sustainable solution, it helped to bridge the teacher gap in rural areas. Moreover,
implementation of the agreed priority activities continued even during the political and financial
crisis.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.     The MoEST was the implementing agency since this was a SWAp. The MoEST showed
strong commitment to the project, substantially achieved the PDO, and produced quarterly reports
and a comprehensive annual Education Sector Performance Report, although some of the data used
was not reliable. There was continued commitment to achieving the project objectives since these
were at the core of the ESIP. The ministry developed an ESMF and RPF in compliance with IDA
requirements and implemented the mitigation measures. However, there were delays in complying
with FM covenants, low capacity, and limited coordination between various departments leading
to delays in deployment of teachers in rural areas. There were also procurement delays.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                 21
 
88.     The Moderately Satisfactory rating for the borrower and its implementing agency is
justified on the basis of achieving the PDOs, compliance with safeguards, but with a downside on
FM, procurement, and inter-departmental coordination.

6. Lessons Learned

89.     School grants can be an effective way of addressing problems of access and quality. Non-
staff inputs acquired by schools under the Primary School Improvement Program, and the
provision of personal needs such as school uniforms for disadvantaged students by school grants,
played an important role in improving the internal efficiency of primary schools by reducing
dropout and repetition rates. However, this depends on school-level capacity (the SMC and head
teacher). Measures to ensure timeliness of receipt of funds by schools would enhance the impact
of school grants. 

90.     The ODL can be a quick and efficient way of improving availability of teachers in rural or
remote areas, but the approach should be more comprehensive to achieve this objective. Provision
for wage bill, inter-departmental coordination, and a functioning personnel management system
are necessary to ensure that teachers are recruited and deployed to areas where there are shortages.
The recruitment of ODL graduate teachers following their training was delayed due to a
constrained wage bill while some schools had small class sizes. Once the teacher wage bill was
raised, ODL graduate teachers were recruited to rural schools.

91.     Pooled funding mechanisms are useful for encouraging a more holistic and effective
approach to addressing sector challenges. The pooled fund account should be set up in such a way
that can facilitate auditing. In this case, auditing was made difficult by using a system that was not
activity based, and this made auditing difficult.

92.     Although the NER and PCR are usual measures of project outcomes, they may not work
in situations where the age-specific data for the school-going population is not readily available.
This underscores the importance of careful consideration of data quality and collection modalities
while determining outcome indicators.

93.     The timeframe of three years for the GPE funding is too short to facilitate full
implementation of activities or even make an impact on the outcome indicators. The GPE funding
had to be extended twice to allow for completion of the project activities.

8.     Subcomponent 2.2: Train teachers through ODL (US$11 million). This subcomponent
was designed to improve the number of qualified teachers in basic education by supporting the
implementation of an ODL program with three annual intakes of 4,000 students a year. This
subcomponent financed the (a) printing and distribution of ODL materials; (b) supervision of ODL
students through procurement of vehicles; (c) upgrade of TDCs and a TTC so that the ODL can be
delivered more effectively through them; and (d) evaluation of the effectiveness of the ODL to
improve education quality in underserved communities. This training would reduce disparities in
the PTRs between urban and rural areas through local recruitment of the ODL student teachers to
schools that have acute shortage.

11.    Subcomponent 3.2: Support SIP (US$69 million). This subcomponent was designed to
improve education service delivery by increasing the flow of resources to the school level by
financing (a) training for all public school personnel, the SMCs, and PTAs in planning, FM, and

                                                       26
 
accountability to produce school improvement plans and budget and (b) provision of school grants
to deliver the plans.

12.    All public schools (100 percent) in 34 districts prepare school improvement plans against
which school grants are disbursed.

13.    Capacity-building activities for all key stakeholders, including the DEMs, zonal education
advisors, primary education advisors, head teachers, deputy head teachers, the SMCs, PTAs, and
mother groups were conducted. Capacity building focused on roles and responsibilities, school
improvement plan development, implementation and monitoring, FM, procurement, and
budgeting.

14.     Grants are used to cover school-specific needs, including procurement of teaching and
learning materials (for example, chalk), support to orphans and other vulnerable children, payment
of salaries for teacher assistants for those schools with high pupil to teacher ratios, pens, exercise
books, flip charts, continuous professional development, and construction or maintenance of
sanitation facilities, classrooms, and teachers’ houses.

15.     A recent national evaluation of the PSIP found that the MoEST’s processes under the PSIP
are effective and that schools are effectively using their resources and the quality of school
management has improved considerably. The PSIPs have helped to improve community
participation and management at the school level, particularly in the areas of finance and
procurement, while PTAs and mother groups hold school management teams accountable.

16.     Subcomponent 3.3: Strengthen planning and budgetary management (US$12
million). Within the context of the decentralization process, this subcomponent was designed to
finance activities to strengthen the capacity of the district and central levels to provide planning,
financial, and technical oversight based on a Capacity Development Strategy for education.
Capacity-building activities were to include (a) upgrade of certification and implementation of
divisional refresher workshops for staff in FM and procurement at all levels; (b) M&E of the
SWAp; and (c) improvement of education planning capacity building at the central and district
levels based on the strategies prepared by JICA and USAID.

17.    Education officials at the MoEST and districts were trained in education planning, finance,
and economics.

18.     District and division staff trained on budgeting, policy, and planning. This training has
helped to build capacity to move from incremental to output-based budgeting and to link the budget
to the PoW. There is now a systematic link between the NESP, ESIP, plan of work, and the budget.

19.    Payment of salaries and all payroll processes for primary and secondary school teachers in
six education divisions has been decentralized.

20.    Finance staff in all six divisions received intensive training on the IFMIS, and computers
and servers were provided.

21.      A total of 50 accounts personnel and budget officers from central MoEST, divisions, and
districts attended refresher courses on the management of the IFMIS in FY2012/13 and
FY2013/14.

22.    The MoEST Finance and Procurement Units were supported by a technical advisor for a
period of two years and this helped to build their capacity in preparation of Financial Management
Reports.

23.    Procurement officers in the 34 districts were trained on procurement of instructional
materials and other education-related procurement activities. This training facilitated the
implementation of the PSIP.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      This annex presents the results of the economic and financial analysis of activities
implemented under the PIEQM. The analysis specifically focused on (a) the cost-effectiveness of
activities under the PIEQM; (b) the costs and benefits of activities under the PIEQM; (c) the
efficiency of project implementation; and (d) fiscal sustainability.

2.       Overall, the team found that the PIEQM has been implemented in a cost-effective manner,
particularly for classroom construction and purchasing of primary school textbooks. In addition,
at the secondary level, looking at costs and benefits of the activities which supported disadvantaged
students with bursary/cash transfer programs, the team found that the project yielded significant
economic returns. Furthermore, the team found that given the government’s high priority of
education and the DPs’ support, sustainability risks are reduced. Although the project made
significant progress near the closing date of the project, inefficiency in project implementation was
observed during the project.

I. Cost Effectiveness of Activities under the Project

Unit cost analysis of classroom construction

3.      The PIEQM financed the expansion of physical facilities as a key supply-side intervention
under Component 1 to promote the NESP goal of universal primary completion. The team found
that the construction of schools under the PIEQM was cost-effective in comparison with other
similar projects in Malawi, and school construction in a number of other African countries.

4.      School construction under the PIEQM was managed by the EIMU and the LDF. A total of
2,936 classrooms have been constructed against an end-of-project target of 3,000, representing
97.8 percent achievement. Out of these, 2,614 have been constructed by the LDF and 322 by the
EIMU. The team observed initial delays of implementation and inefficiencies, including concerns
about the quality of classrooms constructed initially through the LDF approach and the initial slow
pace of construction by the EIMU.

5.      While there were inefficiencies resulting from delays in construction due to delays in
release of funds, escalation in the cost of construction arising from interest charges by contractors
as a result of delayed payments of their invoices, this mainly affected EIMU construction which
comprised less than 20 percent of the construction.

6.     The team conducted a robust unit cost analysis of school construction based on the
available data as of March 2015 to measure the cost-effectiveness of the project’s support for
school construction.25 Overall finding is efficiency is substantial in comparison with similar school
construction projects in Malawi and in other Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries.

  This unit cost analysis of classroom construction was conducted based on the information available as of March
2015. After this study, 106 classrooms were constructed before the project closing date. However, the team does not
think this would impact the overall unit cost analysis, considering most of the classroom construction was completed
before this study was conducted (more than 96 percent of total classrooms constructed were completed before March
2015).

                                                               30
 
Comparison with other classroom construction projects in Malawi

7.     The team first conducted a broader classroom cost-effectiveness analysis, by comparing
the cost performances of the PIEQM with three other projects in Malawi: (a) the Fifth African
Development Fund Project; (b) primary classroom construction managed by UNICEF; and (c)
secondary classrooms financed by JICA, using the same methodology to define unit costs.

8.     The comparison between unit costs per classroom of the various projects/DPs’ operation
in Malawi shows that the LDF outperforms other implementers in school construction. While
figure 3.1 compares unit cost per m2, figure 3.2 compares costs of classrooms that are highly
depending of the classroom size. With regard to unit cost per m2 of classrooms under primary
school construction, the LDF is the best performer with US$107 per m2. Unit cost per m2 for
UNICEF and EIMU/PIEQM are 50 and 60 percent more expensive (US$161 per m2 and US$173
per m2, respectively).

Comparison with some SSA countries cases

9.      The team also compared unit cost of classroom construction in two other countries: Uganda
and Madagascar. These two countries were selected among other countries in SSA where detailed
and recent unit cost analysis is available and because they are in the same range of economic
development, facing comparable education challenges, and currently enjoying a peaceful social
situation. The team revealed that communities in Malawi, working within the LDF implementing
arrangement with PIEQM funds, performed equally to better than communities in other countries
when they are empowered to manage school construction and are the best performers compared to
any other implementer.

10.     Uganda has comparable demographic characteristics to Malawi, and similar comparability
also encompasses environmental aspects. It is also a landlocked country with comparable
difficulties in accessing imported construction materials. Uganda is currently achieving universal
primary education and now embarking to address the challenge of universal lower-secondary
education. Figure 3.3 provides a classroom unit cost comparison in 2012 at the end of the Uganda
Post Primary Education and Training (UPPET) Project. In this project, the Ugandan Ministry of
Education and Science delegated the management responsibility to build lower secondary schools
to the schools through their Boards of Governors (BoGs) and School Construction Management
Committees. This community-driven development-type approach was successful with regard to
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In the UPPET Project, school BoGs achieved the construction
of more than 800 classrooms at an average unit cost of US$134 per m2 (in 2012 US$),
corresponding to US$137 per m2 in 2014 (actualization coefficient 2.3 percent). Figure 3.3 also
shows that the range of unit costs in Uganda is wide across projects/DPs. An IDA-financed social
fund (Northern Uganda Social Action Fund) comparable to the Malawian LDF performed lower
than the UPPET with regard to cost; however, its higher unit cost is largely explained by the post-
conflict situation of Northern Uganda where the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund operates
(Theunynck 2015). In conclusion, with US$107 per m2, the Malawian LDF/PIEQM outperformed
the best performer in Uganda (the BoGs with US$137 per m2).

11.      In 2007–2009, Madagascar implemented a large school construction program split between
three implementing approaches: delegation to the contract management agency, to the local
governments, and to school communities. The country has a large territory (eight times that of
Malawi, with a population dispersed in small villages scattered in a mountainous environment with
little road connection, often isolated from the closest road by several rivers). Education has been

                                                                                           33
 
long-supported by the UNICEF and International Labour Organization through contract
management services for the construction of school facilities. In parallel, since 2001, an IDA-
MASAF was supporting either communities or local governments to finance basic local social
infrastructures such as schools. In 2007–2009, with funds from the FTI, the Ministry of Education
implemented a school construction program through three parallel implementation approaches: (a)
delegation to United Nations agencies acting as contract management agencies, (b) delegation to
local government (communes), and (c) delegation to school communities (namely the PTAs). The
program started implementing under Bank administration in 2009, and continued under UNICEF
administration when the political situation stopped the Bank from supporting the country. UNICEF
commissioned a review of all these projects in 2012 (Theunynck 2012). Figure 3.4 shows that the
direct unit cost of classrooms managed by school communities average US$163 per m2 (in 2012
US$). The team found there is a wide range of unit costs depending on the implementing agency,
and communities outperformed all other actors in the country for school construction. Figure 3.4
shows that communities in Malawi perform much better than their pairs in Madagascar (US$107
per m2 vs. US$163 per m2).

Unit cost of textbook procurement

12.     The project also supported the purchase of textbooks under Component 2. The project
provided a total of 27 million textbooks (more accurately, 26,937,976 textbooks) compared to the
planned 9.7 million textbooks at the beginning of the project. This is close to three times the
planned number. There was significant improvement in pupil to textbook ratio from 2.6:1 to 1.1:1
for standard 3 English, from 2.1:1 to 1.1:1 for standard 3 mathematics, and from 1.7:1 to 1.01:1
for standard 7 English and from 1.5:1 to 1.1:1 for standard 7 mathematics. There were long-
standing delays in the procurement of textbooks, with over 70 percent of the textbooks delivered
during the last month of project implementation.

Source: Calculated by the team based on the government Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

13.      Table 3.1 compares unit cost of textbooks by education level (primary and secondary) and
in total. Unit cost for textbooks for standard 1 and standard 2 is US$0.60 and unit cost for standards
3 to 8 is US$0.36 while it is US$12.23 for secondary education textbooks. Although the unit cost
of secondary education textbook is high, overall unit cost is US$1.12. This is because most of the
textbooks the government purchased during the project are for primary education with a lower unit
cost.

14.     To see the cost-effectiveness of purchasing textbooks under the PIEQM, the team
benchmarked with unit costs for textbooks in other countries. For instance, in the case of Guinea,
the Bank-financed project provided textbooks for primary school core subjects at an average unit
cost in the amount of US$1.4. For middle schools, the average unit cost per textbook was US$1.9
(Guinea ICR). Another example is The Gambia. The operation provided a total of 565,058
textbooks and teachers’ guides for grades 5 and 6 and 180,146 for grades 7 through 9 at a unit cost

                                                     34
 
of US$0.60 (The Gambia ICR). Compared to these other countries, unit cost for primary education
textbooks under the PIEQM is at the lower end while unit cost for secondary textbooks is much
higher.

II. Cost Benefit Analysis

15.     During the appraisal stage of the project, cost-benefit analysis was not conducted. The PAD
for the PIEQM indicates that “A rigorous cost-benefit analysis of this program is not feasible.
While it can be straightforward to obtain estimates for private economic returns to education,
credible estimates of the social economic returns, which are necessary for public investment
analysis, are elusive. It is also very difficult to quantify positive non-monetary externalities from
education. Furthermore, the expected outcomes from education projects are long term and are
difficult to attribute to a specific intervention. Nevertheless, based on the international evidence
and the micro empirical evidence for Malawi, the potential benefits of this program can be
expected at both the individual and the social level.” (PAD, page 104). The challenge of the
robustness of the analysis remains the same in this ICR; however, the team tried to estimate costs
and benefits associated to specific activities under the project based on the available data, and with
reasonably acceptable assumption. Also, the estimated results of this analysis could be
conservative because some potential benefits are not included in the analysis such as monetary
benefits accrued from those who would pursue higher education and vocational training after the
completion of secondary education. The analysis does not account for other potential benefits
including the social benefits of education, either.

16.     The project supported three areas: (a) improving access to and equity of education through
a mix of demand- and supply-side interventions; (b) enhancing the teaching and learning
environment by providing the necessary learning materials and increasing the corps of teachers
through ODL; and (c) improving institutional and management capacity through supporting reform
in teacher management and devolving school planning and development to the local level, while
improving capacity at all levels of the GoM. Since it is difficult to quantify or monetize the benefits
of quality enhancement and capacity building, the analysis focused on the first area of intervention,
increasing access by school construction and providing bursaries/cash transfer programs.

17.     The project allocated US$12 million to provide direct support to disadvantaged children.
The project provided bursary packages to a total of 26,017 secondary school students and cash
transfers to a total of 10,325 students, and 99 percent of these students are still in school.26


                                                            
26
  In secondary school, bursary packages were planned to be provided for approximately 1,000 schools with an average
of 15 students per school per year. As in primary school, recipients planned to be chosen in the first year of lower
secondary school (Form 1) and continue to receive the package throughout secondary school. For secondary
applicants, the Primary School Leaving Certificate of Education scores also plan to be taken into consideration. The
scholarship size amount has been adopted following existing Bank and USAID standards for interventions in Malawi.
Stipends for needy students of approximately US$5 per month will also be piloted and rigorously evaluated for scale-
up. The stipends planned to be used will cover basic education costs such as costs of transportation to school, uniforms,
toiletries, and learning material for secondary school student (PAD). Package of secondary school bursary package
(original plan) planned to include textbook fee, tuition fee, general development fund, development fund ID card, and
Malawi School Certificate of Education exam fee. Due to unavailability of data, it was difficult to obtain detailed data
of expenses relevant to these programs.

                                                               35
 
18.    Assumption for the cost-benefit analysis are following:

Assumption

            Costs include direct project costs (bursary and cash transfer programs provided under
             the project) and private costs (private contribution to education and opportunity cost
             of forgone income during schooling).

            Direct costs cover student fees, books, and travel. Direct cost for students was
             calculated based on the third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3) data; however, it
             could be overestimated because such expenses were partially covered by the project,
             and it is assumed that actual direct costs for students are less than what was calculated
             based on IHS3 data.

            Opportunity cost represents a loss of productive capacity measured as a loss of earning
             for the individual that enroll for secondary education. It assumes that a student would
             otherwise not be idle or unemployed.

            The benefits were estimated from IHS3 data. Benefits of the project are estimated by
             increase in the number of graduates from secondary schools and by higher
             productivity and lifetime earnings. The salary of the graduate does not vary during the
             year. The estimated wages were computed based on IHS3, and the wage levels were
             projected to account for inflation for future years.

            Those who benefited from bursary and cash transfer programs through secondary
             education do not drop out from schools.

            The number of beneficiaries of bursary programs is 26,017, and the number of
             beneficiaries of cash transfer programs is 10,325.

            Exchange rate used in this analysis is US$1 = MK 400.

            The assumed inflation rate is 7.6 percent (a rate at the end of FY2011). This is used
             as discount rate for the analysis.

            Wage premium/annual increase of salary is 1.5 percent.

            All graduates from secondary education are employed after graduation. There is no
             unemployment period between graduation and retirement.

19.   Based on the discount rate of 7.6 percent for the benefits and costs stream mentioned above,
the NPV is MK 57.9 billion. The IRR associated with this NPV is 26.9 percent.

20.     Sensitivity analysis. Table 3.2 shows the IRRs based on different scenarios. For instance,
if the employment ratio of a graduate drops to 50 percent from 100 percent of the base scenario,
the IRR decreases to 19.4 percent from 26.9 percent (base scenario). These results suggest that the
project yielded significant economic returns and thus was a sound investment. There are

                                                 36
 
conservative lower-bound estimates, given that they do not account for other potential benefits
including the social benefits of education. The total economic and social impact of the project is
likely to substantially exceed the economic benefits, which are nonetheless considerable.

III. Efficiency of Implementation

21.     During project implementation, there were inefficiencies, including extended delays in
construction and procurement of instructional materials. There were also delays in release of funds
leading to cost escalation in civil works. The delay of implementation was also observed in
procurement of textbooks. Over 70 percent of the textbooks were delivered during the last month
of project implementation. However, the project made major progress at the final stage of the
project.27

IV. Fiscal Sustainability

22.     The GoM has prioritized the education sector. The GoM allocates close to 18 percent of its
total budgetary resources to the education sector. In the 2014/15 national budget, education
received the second-largest sector allocation, surpassed only by agriculture. The share of resources
allocated to education through the national budget has risen from less than 15 percent five years
ago (Figure 3.5).

23.    The DPs continue to remain involved in contributing important investment expenditures
such as the proposed new GPE Program, which would reduce the sustainability risks in the
education sector in Malawi. Regarding the PIEQM specifically, the MoEST has reached an
agreement with the DFID to finance the completion of the classrooms which were not yet
completed in the PIEQM project period.




                                                            
27
  The team noticed that the local currency (Malawi kwacha) has lost substantial value against the U.S. dollar over the
project implementation period (MK 150 per U.S. dollar in June 2010 to MK 450 per U.S. dollar in June 2015). This
might have made the project more efficient because the project could have used less U.S. dollar than planned.
However, the team considered it difficult to actually measure how this affected the project’s overall efficiency because
several factors need to be taken into consideration to measure it, such as timing of expenses, cost of construction
materials, currencies used for purchasing goods, and inflation rate.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

Project Design, Original Project Development Objectives (PDO), and Key Indicators

1.      The modality of support was to be channeled within the framework of a SWAp, which was
agreed through an MoU and a JFA with the ministry and all the partners that support the education
sector so that the support is provided in a more coordinated and harmonized fashion. It was
envisaged that the Bank’s involvement in the SWAp would improve the Bank’s efficiency in
support of the NESP, and would help reduce transaction costs for the government, in line with the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Bank’s global experience in the management of
SWAps, its experience with education reforms in low-income countries, and its expertise in
fiduciary management was envisaged to support the needed technical and fiduciary expertise
essential for an effective SWAp. Furthermore, an analysis of financing requirements for activities
on primary and secondary education had shown that the Bank financing continued to be required
by the country to achieve the objectives of the education quality objectives. The operation was
thought to contribute to the attainment of two MDGs: (a) Goal 2: achieving universal primary
education and (bi) Goal 3: promoting gender equality and empowering women. The operation was
also envisaged to support the government’s MGDS, which underscores the role of education in
economic growth.

2.     The PDO was to increase access and equity and enhance quality of the teaching and
learning environment in basic education. The project was designed with three components that
were to achieve the specified results: (a) improve access and equity, (b) improve the teaching and
learning environment, and (c) improve management capacity at all levels.

3.      The causal effect generated by these interventions would in the long term improve learning
outcomes, retention, and the completion rate and thus move toward the MDGs and government
goals. The following key indicators were established to measure progress toward achievement of
the project objectives as shown in table 7.1.

                         Table 7.1. Activities and Indicators under Each Component

Reasons/justification:

Not applicable.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

4.     The main beneficiaries were the pupils in all primary and secondary schools in the country
through the provision of adequate classrooms, teaching and learning materials, qualified teachers,
and supporting the PSIP. However, teachers were another group of beneficiaries, being trained
through the funded ODL Program, a teacher management reform to motivate teachers and the
upgrade of the TTCs and TDCs. Education managers at different levels were also beneficiaries
through strengthened management capacity.

1.5 Original Project Components

5.      The PIEQM comprised three components as follows:

              Component 1: Improve Access and Equity (original: US$96 million; actual:
               US$81.9 million). The objective of this component was to promote the NESP goal of
               universal primary completion through a mix of demand- and supply-side
               interventions. It had two subcomponents: (a) construct and upgrade education
               facilities and (b) provide direct support to disadvantaged children.

              Component 2: Improve the Teaching and Learning Environment (original:
               US$59 million; actual: US$87.3 million. The primary objective of this component
               was to improve the quality of the teaching and learning environment by financing (a)
               the provision of pedagogic aids for pupils and teachers and (b) the implementation of



                                                     44
 
             an ODL program, which provides a high-impact, time-bound solution to address the
             high PQTR of 91.5:1.

            Component 3: Improve Management Capacity at All Levels (original: US$90
             million; actual: US$44.9 million). The objective of this component was to support
             key reforms in the education sector that will ensure that planned interventions translate
             to improved access, equity, and quality. Through this component, issues of teacher
             management, accountability, planning, quality assurance, and monitoring across the
             system were planned to be addressed within the context of the ongoing
             decentralization process in the country which necessarily entailed redefining the roles
             of the MoEST in education delivery at the central, district, and school levels. There
             were three separate but complementary subcomponents, each with outcome indicators
             that had specified targets, teacher management reform, SIP, and strengthening
             planning and budgetary management.

1.6 Revised Components

Not applicable.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

6.      Amendment of the Financing Agreement was made in December 2011, to allow the LDF
as an additional implementation arrangement for primary school classroom construction.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

7.      The project objectives and key activities, defined under the components listed above,
identified and targeted a number of key development issues and constraints, supported by the CAS,
the MGDS, and the NESP. In line with these strategy documents, the background analysis
identified infrastructure, teaching and learning resources, and governance issues as key factors
limiting achievement of education quality.

8.      The project planning and preparation processes thus benefitted from lessons learned from
past experiences in addition to the learning that occurred during the planning process itself. The
key lessons included: (a) the need for a collaborative process in preparing rigorous analytical data
that identifies bottlenecks in the system and needed key reforms; (b) the importance of high-level
discussion on the reform agenda; (c) the importance of using the preparation and endorsement of
the education sector plan to consider donors' collective policy reform agenda; (d) recognition of
the effectiveness of government structures, rather than stand-alone project implementation units,
to ensure donor harmonization; and (e) the need for the government, with key stakeholders, to
prepare a realistic working plan in the short term, rather than waiting for the production of a perfect
education sector plan to engage stakeholders in education reforms.

9.      The overall project design was sound, addressing relevant needs of the schools, which helps
explain why the project components were not revised with time. However, the lack of specified
targets for some of the outcome indicators, especially on infrastructure such as teacher houses and
                                                  45
 
toilets, was a drawback in assessing the attainment of project outcomes and project completion.
Furthermore, the involvement of the LDF in the construction of infrastructure and the impact it
made shows that a decentralized approach to the project could have yielded greater results,
something that should have been considered at the beginning of the project.

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
10.     The main implementation agency was the Ministry of Education on behalf of the Malawi
government. The Education SWG, chaired by the permanent secretary, was to monitor and oversee
implementation following GoM guidelines for institutionalizing SWGs as well as Technical
Working Groups (TWGs). The design also focused on strengthening planning and budgetary
management rightly aimed at addressing the weak institutional capacity of the district and central
levels to provide planning and technical oversight in FM, procurement, and M&E of the SWAp.
This oversight was intended to ensure that the key components were being properly implemented
and monitored.

11.     During project implementation, there were a number of important success stories and
factors which affected progress toward the achievement of the development objectives. Those
factors which contributed most significantly to successes or gave rise to problems are discussed
below.

12.      Pool funding. The implementation of the project was to benefit from a partnership
agreement involving all the nine DPs providing support to the education sector and the ministry.
For a subset of the partners that intend to pool funds, a JFA was also signed that laid out the
institutional and financial mechanisms for the pooled fund. During project implementation, it was
by choice whether a DP joined the JFA or not. They all signed an MoU on supporting ESIP I
whether through the JFA or discreetly. However, this did not only put the project processes in a
difficult situation, as in some cases there were overlaps, but also caused further delays in
implementation of the project as the ministry had to grapple with responding to funding
mechanisms for different donors instead of sticking to one agreed mechanism. In some cases, there
was lack of transparency on the outside pool funding amounts and yet the outcomes of such
interventions were to be taken as part of project outcomes.

13.  Disbursement of funding. The project was co-financed by the FTI (US$90 million),
UNICEF (US$1 million), DFID (US$ 90 million), and Germany (US$25 million).

14.     Delays in procurement processes. Procurement processes were a challenge due to slow
government Financial Management Information System (FMIS) processes and the so called ‘user
unfriendly’ procurement guidelines of the Bank. This was coupled with capacity challenges at the
EIMU, resulting in delays that led to discrepancies between cost estimates and actual costs,
sometimes resulting in starting the process all over again at least for construction projects. Capacity
challenges at the EIMU led to the involvement of a decentralized LDF structure for construction;
this helped increase efficiency.

15.     Centralization. The centralization of the project, manifested through centralized
procurement, resulted in cheaper prices, at least for textbooks and other TLMs as a result of bulk
purchases. However, the slow and inefficient distribution led to delays by district councils to send
their reports for consolidation at the central level.
                                                  46
 
16.    Management coordination and supervision challenges. The government was committed
in the planning and implementation of the project, which led to the institution of a steering
committee and the creation of a SWAp secretariat.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

17.     The quality at entry identified the design of M&E to provide continuous feedback on the
operation’s progress toward the achievement of the NESP targets. Primary data were to be captured
by the EMIS from the districts (District Education Management Information System [DEMIS] and
in some districts at the Zonal Education Management Information System) and through secondary
data sources including household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey and the
Malawi IHS. Routine monitoring of works was also conducted. In addition, the MoEST and DPs
conducted an annual JSR focusing on agreed indicators that were to be captured by the EMIS.
Furthermore, joint monitoring meetings through the SWGs and TWGs were held between the
MoEST and other stakeholders like the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Development Planning
and Cooperation, and the DPs following the submission of a quarterly report by the MoEST
showing financial, procurement, and activity progress in the previous quarter.

18.     Both the EMIS and the JSR happened as planned. Although EMIS data was collected
annually and the quality of publication had improved with time, there were still some challenges
regarding false information dissemination among different stakeholders. However, decentralizing
the EMIS to district and zonal levels ironed out most of these disparities. Furthermore, the EMIS
feeds into subsequent planning, especially when producing PoWs, and this helped to improve
project implementation. The TWGs feed into the SWGs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

19.     There was a High risk of limited implementation capacity at the central and district levels
and this was mitigated to Substantial by recruitment of skilled staff (with two-year technical
advisors in critical areas) and capacity building. The other substantial risks identified were: (a)
slow initial implementation; (b) poor quality of construction due to rapid expansion of
construction; (c) risk of late disbursement of funds and weak fund management at the decentralized
and school levels due to expansion and increase in the amount of resources provided to schools;
(d) significant FM risk due to capacity gaps in local governments and education institutions; and
(e) substantial overall country procurement risk due to weak mechanisms in place. All the
identified risks materialized to a moderate extent but were proactively addressed, by the Bank
team, pooled DPs, and the MoEST, to facilitate implementation.

20.    FM performance was generally rated as Satisfactory, with the project submitting reports
and audits compliant with fiduciary requirements of the Financing Agreement. Furthermore, Bank
review missions assessed the project’s FM systems and concluded that systems were in place to
ensure project funds are used for the intended purposes, transactions and balances were recorded
accurately, financial reports were accurate although they often came late, project assets were
safeguarded, and appropriate external auditing arrangements were in place.

21.    There were no serious procurement issues under the project, with any deficiencies noted
being corrected as the project’s implementation progressed. The procurement experience mirrored

                                                47
 
that of a number of other projects in Malawi, whereby considerable unfamiliarity was found to
exist among MoEST staff with regard to Bank procurement procedures, thereby describing them
as ‘unfriendly’. Strong and sustained technical support was, therefore, required from the Bank for
the Procurement Unit to become better acquainted right at the start of the project. However, the
project procurement performance improved with experience.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance Rating: High

22.    The project objectives remained highly relevant to the country’s development agenda and
the Bank’s CAS. The GoM articulated its development priorities and objectives in MGDS II 2011–
2016), which identified education as key to sustainable socioeconomic development. The
provision of infrastructure services and bursaries to increase access and provision of resources for
improving education quality had direct implications on educational development, thereby
responding to a real and significant development challenge of promoting quality education to all
children in the country. With regard to design, the project targeted children in all schools and
reached out to the neediest. Project implementation was well aligned to the project objectives.

3.2 Achievement of PDOs

23.     Increase access. The NER increased from 79 to 88 percent between 2010 and 2015
(Welfare Monitoring Survey, 2014). This has exceeded the project target of 83 percent. Besides,
the GER rose from 119 to 133 percent, exceeding the end-of-project target of 114 percent. This is
because of the out-of-age enrollment and high repetition rates which are at about 20 percent. The
enrollment increased from 3.67 million in 2009 to 4.67 million in 2014 in primary schools. The
construction of 2,936 classrooms out of the project target of 3,000 classrooms in areas where there
were not enough classrooms, representing a 97.8 percent achievement, has contributed to the
increase in enrollment. In addition to that, the classrooms were accompanied by desks and
sanitation facilities. Overall, the project had a substantial impact on increasing access.

24.      Increase equity. The impact on increasing equity was high because 4,670,279 students,
exceeding the target by 26 percent. The rural completion rate has significantly increased from 28
percent to 50 percent, exceeding the target by 56 percent. The major possible reason for this
improvement is the provision of school improvement grants to all schools and the involvement of
the community in implementing the school projects, including chiefs who in some cases charge a
fine to parents who do not send their children to school. School improvement grants supported
disadvantaged students through provision of personal needs, for example, school uniforms. One
of the key findings of the 2014 impact evaluation of the Primary School Improvement Program is
that non-staff inputs acquired by schools under the program play a critical role in improving the
internal efficiency of primary schools by reducing repetition and dropout rates. The other finding
was that direct support was provided to 70,052 students (achieving 93.4 percent against a target of
75,000) and all these beneficiary students are still enrolled in school. Construction of boarding
facilities was achieved beyond the targeted 11 with 14 constructed, 12 of which were girls’ hostels
exceeding the target by 27 percent.



                                                48
 
25.     Enhance the teaching and learning environment. The project managed to recruit student
teachers to rural schools and train 23,550 teachers (exceeding the end-of-project target by 96
percent) through the ODL program. This improved the PQTR in rural areas from 91.5:1 to in 2010
to 66:1 in 2015, exceeding the end-of-project target of 87:1.

26.     Procurement and distribution of 26,937,976 textbooks to schools exceeded the end-of-
project target by 154 percent. This improved the pupil to textbook ratio from 2.6:1/2.1:1 to
1.1:1/1:1:1 for English and mathematics for standard 3 and from 1.7:1/1.5:1 to 1.01:1 and 1.1:1.1:1
for standard 7, respectively, meeting the target set at appraisal. However, pupil to classroom
ratio shows a worsening trend from 100 to 127 because of population increase and also the floods
that occurred in 2014 destroyed a lot of classrooms. Hence, school infrastructure is still a challenge
in Malawi. However, pupil to classroom ratio did not get worse because of the additional schools
that were constructed through the project.

27.      Improve management capacity at all levels. The project performed well on the PSIP with
100 percent of the schools receiving the grant, according to target, as well as SMC training, despite
the slow pace in the development of comprehensive school improvement plans that happened at
the beginning of the project but later improved greatly. Capacity building on FM and procurement
was conducted and finance staff in all six divisions received intensive training on the IFMIS, and
computers and servers were provided. Besides, a total of 50 accounts personnel and budget officers
from central MoEST, divisions, and districts attended refresher courses in the management of the
IFMIS in FY2012/13 and FY2013/14. MoEST finance officers were also attached to a technical
advisor for a period of two years and this helped to build their capacity in preparation of Financial
Management Reports. This function was taken over by MoEST finance officers following this
two-year period. A similar arrangement was followed by the Procurement Unit which trained
officers at the central level, who later trained other officers in 34 districts to undertake procurement
of instructional materials and other education-related procurement activities. This training
facilitated the implementation of the PSIP. The MoEST SWAp Secretariat and human resource
officers were also attached to technical advisors for a period of two years and this helped to build
their capacity in their respective departments.

28.     However, performance was poor on teacher reform since despite Continuous Professional
Development (CPD) gradually being introduced in all districts with a draft CPD framework in
place, a coherent CPD program including a career framework for teachers is not yet operational.
Similarly, although an HRMIS started operating at the central level, this has not yet been rolled
out to the districts, thereby posing challenges in ensuring the anticipated improved teacher
management and deployment.

29.     In conclusion, the overall efficacy rating for the project is substantial with project
performance exceeding target for purchase of textbooks and training of teachers through ODL;
100 percent of the target was reached for primary schools as they now have a budget and receive
the PSIPs; and over 97.8 percent of the target was reached on classroom construction and provision
of direct support to students through bursaries. Although some of the project outcomes were well
achieved, others did not sufficiently achieve the outcomes such as teacher management reform. 

3.3 Efficiency
Efficiency Rating: High

                                                  49
 
30.     Across the seven subcomponents, two subcomponents (construction of classrooms and
improving teaching and learning) had substantial efficiency and three subcomponents (direct
support to disadvantaged learners, support SIP, and training of teachers through ODL) had high
efficiency. These high efficiency subcomponents and substantial efficiency subcomponents
together had been allocated 91 percent of the total funding. Therefore, overall efficiency is High.

31.   Construction through the LDF was much more efficient than the EIMU because it produced
more for much less funding, although quality of the products was low initially. However, this
improved with adherence to the guidelines.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Overall Rating: Highly Satisfactory

32.     The overall outcome rating for the project is Highly Satisfactory. This rating reflects high
efficiency achievement of highly relevant outcomes with substantial efficacy.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
33.    Overall, the project had positive impacts on gender by constructing girls’ hostels where
girls were vulnerable and providing bursaries to both male and female disadvantaged learners.
Positive impact on social development was achieved through increased access to schools, and on
poverty through the provision of bursaries.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
34.     There were benefits for government departments and schools with regard to capacity
building. An HRMIS was set up, school management and PTAs were trained, and all schools
received grants to prepare strategic and annual work plans. Furthermore, there was an opportunity
for further institutional development with regard to coordination between different government
departments but this was not fully exploited.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
35.     Job creation and local skill development for local artisans was achieved through the LDF,
the rollout of the EMIS to the district councils, and the implementation of the PSIP.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

36.    The overall risk to development outcomes has been rated as Moderate. This is because the
classrooms and any other infrastructure constructed within the project, the textbooks purchased,
and the skills gained during capacity building are sustainable. However, these may need constant
review in subsequent years. Sustaining the bursaries, cash transfers, and the PSIP may need further
exploration in the light of reductions in government budget for 2015/16.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

37.     The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry has been rated as Satisfactory because
there was adequate preparation for the project including careful planning of measures that would
work against the project, such as low capacity of stakeholders from the highest level of
implementation to the grassroots and learning from experiences of previous projects both in
Malawi and elsewhere. However, the financing process could have been planned better for more
efficient implementation. Disbursing funding on a reimbursement basis led to challenges as
sometimes the government did not have funds to spend in advance.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

38.     The EMIS and JSR with the associated SWGs and TWGs were the key elements for
monitoring the project activities from both the Bank and the MoEST perspectives. While both of
these were operationalized, the Bank’s input in improving the quality could have been improved
by operationalizing quarterly meetings with the MoEST and the Ministry of Finance to address
some of the challenges being experienced in the implementation of the project, especially with
regard to funding and procurement.

(d) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Bank’s Overall Performance Rating: Satisfactory

39.    Despite adequate preparation, there were some shortcomings during implementation,
including: (a) not all funding was granted in a timely manner as initially proposed; (b) procurement
procedure was found to be ‘unfriendly’ to the MoEST at first due to limitations in capacity to
understand and use Bank procedures and caused delays; and (c) no transition arrangements.
However, with training, the MoEST was able to follow the procedures.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Ministry of Finance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

40.    The Ministry of Finance received and disbursed funding from the Bank as expected.
However, there were delays in funding disbursement due to the government’s slow integrated
financial management information system procedures, government procedures on ceilings, and
intermittent government cash flows.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                51
 
41.    The MoEST was the implementing agency. There were successes and moderate
shortcomings with respect to the MoEST’s role in ensuring quality at preparation and
implementation toward the achievement of development outcomes.

42.     The identified MoEST strengths include: (a) capacity building of all key stakeholders, (b)
involvement of district councils and local communities which led to ownership of the project at
these levels, and (c) overall monitoring of project through annual JSR meetings and EMIS which
later decentralized to the district level (DEMIS). The data collected through the EMIS was on
agreed indicators and later, an EMIS analysis was produced by the M&E Department that gave a
clear picture of what is happening at the school level.

43.    JSR meetings were conducted annually as planned and information from the SWGs
informed much of what was discussed in such meetings. The problem, however, was that few
TWGs did not meet regularly and this limited the robustness of the discussions on issues
concerning those TWGs during the JSR.

44.    Other identified weaknesses of the MoEST include delays by district councils in
submission of reports which resulted in delays in further disbursement of funds; and limitations in
capacity to understand and use Bank procedures.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

45.     The overall performance of the government (borrower and implementing agency) has been
rated as Satisfactory because although there was substantial achievement of development
objectives, implementation had shortcomings as discussed above. Most of the shortcoming could
have been prevented had the overall monitoring system been used effectively, and the
decentralized DEMIS was set up earlier and used effectively.

6. Lessons Learned

46.      ODL. ODL is an efficient way of training teachers. While the results of the evaluation for
its effectiveness are yet to be released by the Bank, there is potential that ODL could enhance the
linkage between theory and practice if planned properly, which is not sufficiently done in the Initial
Primary Teacher Education Programme. There is need to continue such an approach even if it
means during certified in-service teacher education.

47.      Stakeholder sensitization and involvement. There is evidence that where stakeholders
were actively involved in project implementation, for example, communities in the PSIP and
district councils in the LDF construction, project outcomes were achieved sufficiently. There is a
need for adequate sensitization of all stakeholders including at the central ministry, and
involvement in project implementation for project development outcomes to be achieved
adequately.
