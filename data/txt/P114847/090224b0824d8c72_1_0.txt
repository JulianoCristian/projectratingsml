                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR records the findings of a detailed analysis of the project based on a supervision mission and series of in depth reviews of component specific analysis and discussions with
                         MoEST held during November 2013-February 2014. Overall, the project is progressing in the implementation of the interventions proposed under the project, albeit in a less than
                         targeted pace. During the last three years of project implementation, the project has managed to increase enrollments in primary grades, especially that of girls; new classrooms are
                         constructed, additional teaching learning materials are provided and new teachers are trained through open and distance learning (ODL) mode. In addition, the schools are provided
                         with some grants to improve school based management, and districts and divisions are strengthened to handle more decentralization of education services.

                         In terms of access and equity, the analysis of progress from previous ISR is limited due to paucity of data and with the availability of Education Management Information System
                         (EMIS) data by July 2014, it is expected that the trends in enrollment as well as completion, retention and dropout rates will be available to assess the progress. In early grades,
                         gender parity is already achieved, but the increasing gender gap in higher grades is a concern. Similarly, the high repetition rates and dropout rates among boys and girls raise
                         concerns about internal (in)efficiencies. To improve access, so far around 1150 classrooms were newly constructed, around 8000+ students in secondary schools from vulnerable

                         backgrounds is provided with bursaries and around 2000+ is provided with cash transfers; and as many as 20,000 out of school youth are reached out through complimentary basic
                         education (CBE) programs. However, there is a need to speed up the construction of classrooms and complete 1850 remaining classrooms to meet the target of 3000 classrooms by
                         the end of the project and to achieve the Student Classroom Ratio target of 90:1. Similarly, the process of distribution of bursaries in a timely manner and covering the rest 6000
                         students needs to be carried out in the next couple of months to meet the yearly target. A process evaluation by the World Bank is looking at ways of improving targeting and
                         implications of bursary/ cash transfer programs at secondary level.

                         On the quality issues, the first batch of textbook procurement and distribution, initiated in 2012 and concluded by late 2013 has improved the availability of textbooks in classrooms,
                         though there are still gaps, especially in rural schools in many core subjects. The second batch of textbook procurement which got delayed by more than a year, is expected to
                         complete by mid-2014 and improve the textbook situation in the classrooms further in the next academic year beginning in July 2014. Currently there is a shortage of teachers to
                         meet the Pupil: Qualified Teacher Ratio (PQTR), but with the appointment of the first cohort of teachers trained through ODL program has slightly improved the situation and with the
                         next three cohorts of ODL teachersâ€™ coming into the sector, the PQTR is expected to improve further. The shortage of TLMs and teachers may have adverse impact on teaching and
                         learning and on learning outcomes. The last Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ) in 2009 showed poor show by Malawi, and in 2013,
                         SACMEQ conducted its next round of learning assessments in Malawi. The analysis and results are expected in 2014 and is expected to provide further insights into areas where the
                         interventions need to focus.

                         On governance and management, the project has established a primary school improvement program (PSIP) which encourages and facilitates school based management, and it is
                         now spread to all districts and nearly 86% of the 5000+ schools. There is further thrust towards decentralization of the education services under the project. There is also continuous
                         professional development program for teachers, with varied effects. While its timeliness, verification, analysis and use could be improved, the Education Management Information
                         System (EMIS) is still providing school level data for further analysis.

                         The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) has been developing new strategies to address the diverse issues emerging from the analysis and these are expected
                         to improve the intermediate outcomes of the project. To improve overall outcome results, the activities /interventions need to be complimented with policy reforms. With the
                         finalization of Education Sector Implementation Plan II, expected in the next couple of months, the MoEST is expected to address the policy issues around education as well.

                         The Global Partnership for Education (GPE /EFA-FTI) support will end in December 2014 while IDA support will be till June 2015. So far, the project has disbursed cumulatively US$
                         82 million from GPE (91% of the total US$ 90 million) and US$ 39.4 million from IDA support (79% out of US$ 50 million) till September 2013 period.
