 MALAWI – PROJECT TO IMPROVE EDUCATION QUALITY IN MALAWI (PIEQM)
                             P114847
                            TF097559

                                  Restructuring Paper

1. PIEQM is a project financed jointly by an IDA loan and Grant from the Global
   Partnership of Education (GPE). The closing date for the IDA Loan is June 2015. The
   Grant, TF097559, will be extended from June 30, 2013 until December 30, 2014.
   The project objectives (funded through this grant) of improving access and enhancing
   quality of the teaching and learning environment in basic education will be achievable
   with the extension. Implementation progress is currently rated as Satisfactory.

2. PIEQM is on course to meet its Program Development Objective (PDO). The project
   supports an accelerated teacher training program through open and distance learning
   (ODL). The ODL program has greatly contributed to the first ever reduction in pupil
   teacher ratios (81:1 in 2009 to 76:1 in 2011) since the introduction of free primary
   education in 1994. The primary school improvement program is providing significant
   resources to the school level for critical school inputs and increasing transparency and
   efficiency by involving communities in planning and monitoring the use of school
   grants. Over 40,000 vulnerable children have benefited through either the secondary
   school bursary program which includes a pilot cash transfer program and the
   expansion of complementary basic education programs for out of school youth.

3. Resources from IDA and GPE are pooled with resources from four other
   Development Agencies to support the Government’s National Education Sector Plan
   (NESP). This new program uses Government staff, rather than program
   implementation units, and country systems to implement the program. To prepare for
   this modality the MoEST had put in place new staff. However, the project suffered
   from unrealistic procurement planning that was not fully institutionalized within the
   government implementation process, unexpected barriers in converting infrastructure
   personal from consultants to civil servants positions, and weak financial management.
   This, compounded by the 2011/12 financial and political crisis, led to delays in some
   key interventions, particularly the construction of classrooms and purchasing of
   teaching and learning materials.

4. In the last year the Government has significantly accelerated program implementation
   though (i) addressing capacity constrains in planning and procurement and (ii) use of
   more effective implementation mechanisms. This includes adding additional
   mechanism for school infrastructure, decentralizing the procurement of learning
   materials, and increased funding directly schools.

5. The Government of Malawi has an action plan to complete the program that is
   acceptable to IDA.

6. This will be the 1st extension of the project.
