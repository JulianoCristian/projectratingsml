                         PNPM-Mandiri is the GOI’s flagship poverty alleviation program established in 2006 as the umbrella program for all projects using a community driven development (CDD) approach,
                         under the cluster 2 of the overall government poverty alleviation programs. In 2009 GoI formally included PNPM in the Medium Term Plan which confirmed its continuation of this
                         program until 2014. After the success of its first full national scale up in 2009, GoI requested the Bank to continue its support for funding and technical assistance through PNPM
                         Rural III, which financing the implementation of the program during the period of 2010 - 2011. At this third phase, the GOI and local governments finance about 35% of PNPM-Rural.

                         PNPM-Rural remained as the largest project under the cluster 2 of GoI’s poverty program, with number of kecamatan coverage increased form 4334 to 4736 kecamatans in 2010.
                         The program also continued to include a number of sub-program/ pilot projects focused on specific issues or goals and utilizing same CDD approaches; i.e. PNPM Generasi, PNPM
                         Post Disaster and PNPM Post Crisis.

                         PNPM-Rural III has made good progress and the IBRD portion of the program has fully disbursed. The fourth project in the program series, PNPM-Rural IV, is already disbursing,
                         and a separate implementation status overview is available to the public. PNPM-Rural benefits about 39 million people in 57,000 villages throughout Indonesia. The project’s model of
                         giving communities direct control of decision making and resources is continuing to help improve socio-economic conditions and strengthen governance and accountability at the
                         local level.

                         PNPM is the world’s largest community driven development program with huge scale and scope. The Government, World Bank and other development partners continue to utilize
                         PNPM’s multi sector platform to test innovative pilots and channel resources in emergency situations to further poverty reduction in Indonesia. Three PNPM Support Facility (PSF)
                         grant financed projects linked to PNPM-Rural are:

                         (a)      PNPM Generasi. This pilot project is an incentivized grant program targeting three Millennium Development Goals, which are lagging in Indonesia: achievement of universal
                         basic education, reduction in child mortality, and improvement in maternal health. Through the existing PNPM-Rural platform and community driven developmenmt approach, PNPM
                         Generasi uses community planning and incentivized block grants to reach twelve priority health and education indicators. Communities, with assistance from PNPM-Rural facilitators,
                         work with health and education service providers to identify locally appropriate ways to improve access to and uptake of health and education services. Kecamatan grants are used to
                         address either small-scale supply or demand constraints, depending on where the need is the greatest. The Government piloted PNPM Generasi in 164 kecamatan in five provinces
                         beginning in 2007. The accompanying impact evaluation, which incorporated randomization in the selection of treatment and control locations, showed that over the period 2007 to
                         2010 the Project was successful in achieving its target outcomes for immunization coverage, prenatal care visits and assisted deliveries with increases reaching from 10-11 percent.
                         PNPM Generasi had a statistically significant positive impact on the twelve target health and education indicators, with greatest impacts observed in areas with low baseline health
                         and education indicators.

                         (b)        Disaster Management Support. In addition to the core PNPM-Rural project, which allows for the redistribution of available project funds to be used for disaster response, the
                         Government requested US$14.1 million in additional grant financing to respond to two natural disasters which struck Indonesia at the end of 2010. The volcanic eruption of Mount
                         Merapi and a tsunami off West Sumatra, which took place within days of one another, resulted in hundreds of deaths, displaced thousands from their homes, and caused severe loss
                         of productive capital and incomes. Grant funding for post-disaster work for Central Java and Yogyakarta, which impact by the Mt. Merapi eruption, was distributed to 18 sub-districts
                         in 5 districts. US$ 3.3 million has been fully utilized for cash-for-work programs in 14 sub-districts and approximately 196 villages. About US$3 million was utilized for disaster related
                         sub-projects and generated about 750,000 work days. Implementation of disaster response activities in Mentawai (West Sumatra) have been hampered by construction site issues,
                         including environmental safeguards issues and difficulties in transporting construction materials because Mentawai remote location. Discussions are ongoing to use materials for
                         reconstruction from the state-owned forestry firm, Perhutani.

                         (c)       Additional Financing. The Global Financial Crisis Supplement (GFCS) grant was just approved in June 2011 with funding from USAID and therefore still in the phase of
                         implementation. These funds were allocated as on tops to the regular PNPM Rural blockgrant to 433 sub-districts in 7 targeted provinces, which were selected based o n Bappenas
                         mapping on global crisis affected districts; to assist vulnerable populations who were potentially affected by the Global Financial Crisis. In 2010, GoI also provided post crisis grants to
                         several Kabupatens with funding from its own resource. The Government received US$32.7 million in additional grant financing through PNPM-Rural. The funds are being used
                         through PNPM block grants for investment activities in social and economic infrastructure identified through community development planning. This is expected to increase the impact
                         of the program in these areas. The seven provinces are: Bengkulu, Gorontalo, Jawa Tengah, Jawa Timur, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara Timur, and Sulawesi Tengah. Over US$12 million
                         have already been disbursed to community accounts in 354 sub-districts in the 7 target provinces. The remainder of the allocation for kecamatan grants will be fully disbursed in
                         2012. Allocations for each province vary based on needs, with block grants ranging from Rp 500 to 800 million (US$56,000 to US$89,000). Data on funded sub-projects is currently
                         available for 4 provinces out of the 7 targeted. In these 4 provinces alone, 2,854 sub-projects have been selected by communities to receive financing under this Project - the vast
