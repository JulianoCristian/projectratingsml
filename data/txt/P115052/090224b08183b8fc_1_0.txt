                         The project has reached its development objective as evidenced by achievements of the outcome indicators for PNPM-Rural: poor households in PNPM-Rural locations increased
                         their consumption rate by 9.1% (target 2%); the economic return for major rural infrastructure types is between 35-50% (target 30%), and 89% of sub-projects are functional and

                         adequately utilized by communities (target >80% satisfaction levels). The outcome indicators for PNPM-Generasi, a community-driven platform which improves access to basic
                         services for the poor, show that the project has reached its targets: the immunization coverage for 12-23 months old is 75%, prenatal care visits are 82%, and assisted deliveries
                         have reached 77%. PNPM-Rural has also succeeded in including women and the poorest community members in project activities (50% participation rate, target 48%) and has
                         significantly exceeded expectations for the quality of infrastructure with 82% rated to be of good quality (>70% target).

                         The project also includes grant funding for post-disaster reconstruction (Mount Merapi and Mentawai Island) which generated more than 700,000 paid work-days for 160,000 workers
                         from local communities. In addition, 1.8 million people in seven provinces benefited from crisis support to mitigate impacts of the global financial crisis through the construction of
                         2,794 community-level infrastructure projects.
