{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third National Program\n            for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project for\n            Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: capacity\n            building of an implementing agency responsible for a\n            nationwide Community-Driven Development (CDD) program\n            requires substantial time and effort. Capacity building of\n            communities is a long-term and iterative process which over\n            time may lead to inclusive and transparent decision making.\n            Project guidelines (procurement, financial management,\n            implementation cycle, etc) have to evolve to take into\n            account changing community competencies. Project managers\n            must avoid to overload such guidelines and to make them too\n            bureaucratic. A robust Management Information System (MIS)\n            is essential for a nationwide CDD program. Although the\n            project was able to monitor progress against its Key\n            Performance Indicator (KPIs) by surveys and studies\n            (augmented by processed MIS data), a publicly accessible\n            system that presents reliable and regularly updated\n            information is needed to instill a culture of accountability\n            and transparency at all levels of project implementation.\n            Pre-financing of block grants by Government of Indonesia\n            (GoI) is effective. This approach was pioneered by the\n            project and resulted in a significant reduction in delays in\n            disbursement of block grants compared to Program Nasional\n            Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) rural first and second. The\n            quality of facilitators is the main driver of\n            community-based project implementation quality."}, "docdt": "2013-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
