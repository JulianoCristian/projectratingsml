The grants\n            will help finance the costs associated with the Government\n            of Indonesia's (GoI) disaster management efforts at the\n            community level, including facilitating recovery from the\n            recent natural disasters that struck the country in October\n            2010. Additional financing being provided to each project\n            would continue to finance the same types of activities\n            currently financed under those projects, but in\n            disaster-affected areas. The closing date for the additional\n            financing for the three projects will be December 31, 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
