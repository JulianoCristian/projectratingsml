                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         PNPM#s overall objective is to reduce poverty and improve local-level governance in Indonesia through the provision of investment resources to support
                         productive proposals developed by communities, using a participatory planning process. PNPM-Rural#s project development objective is for villagers in PNPM-
                         Rural locations to benefit from improved socio-economic and local governance conditions.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         With the scaling up of PNPM to National Level under the third phase of Bank support, project implementation has been progressing at village level and the program continues to
                         produce good results within Kecamatans, where the model of providing direct control of decision-making and resources to communities is leading to improved socioeconomic

                         conditions at the local level. As of the end of 2010, the Government's planned expansion is strong on track, with more than 75,000 sub-projects implemented in 4,168 of Indonesia's
                         Kecamatans out of budgeted 4,791 (versus 4,258 in 2009, and 2,600 in 2008), covering 57,000 rural villages. Direct beneficiaries are estimated at 34 million people.

                         However, the scaling up of the program over such a rapid time-line has exacerbated a number of critical operational and management challenges which remain a priority to be
                         addressed going forward and for which the Bank team is continuing to provide guidance and technical support.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
Public Disclosure Copy




                         In October 2010, preparation of the next phase of Bank financial support to the Program was placed on hold until corrective actions agreed with GoI to address some key
                         management and operational challenges had been taken. With recent progress on these actions, a decision has been made by Bank management to resume preparation of the
                         follow-on project, while closely monitoring quality of implementation and oversight.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
