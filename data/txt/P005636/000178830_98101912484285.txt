I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
1.01      Tunisia's overall development strategy aims to strengthen and
diversify the economy, primarily through growth in agricultural production and
greater emphasis on regional development.  This strategy is reflected in the
Fifth Development Plan (1977-81) which emphasizes: (i) employment creation;
(ii) the efficient use of agricultural resources; (iii) economic decentraliza-
tion through rural and regional development; and (iv) income distribution and
poverty alleviation. Although considerable progress has been made in imple-
menting these policies, further improvements need to be made, especially by
strengthening and coordinating support facilities such as transport and
agricultural infrastructure, and by providing more incentives for increased
and more efficient production.
1.02      At independence in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well-
developed transport system which was adequate to support economic development
during the 1960s. However, rapid growth in output and increases in traffic
during the last decade required improvements in transport in order to accom-
modate increasing traffic levels, with higher investments than in previous
years being allocated to the sector. During the Fourth Development Plan
(1973-76), a start was made in increasing transport capacity through invest-
ments in both infrastructure and in means of transport. However, in recent
years, the emphasis has been on completing certain costly projects, which have
absorbed more resources than anticipated, to the detriment of maintenance and
modest improvements of the existing infrastructure. As a result, the Govern-
ment must now concentrate efforts primarily on meeting the backlog in modern-
ization, rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing network and on ensuring
increased efficiency in the operation of the transport system.
B. The Transport System
1.03      The transport system (Map IBRD 14731) comprises some 17,000 km of
classified roads, of which half are paved, serving about 100,000 vehicles;
1,700 km of standard- and narrow-gauge railways; five major commercial ports
and one national shipping company; four airports which handle international
traffic; and two airlines, of which Tunis Air is the national carrier. The
distribution of the network closely reflects that of population and economic
activity. It is most developed in the northeastern coastal provinces of
Tunis, Nabeul, Sousse, Sfax, and Bizerte which account for over half the
total population, with only a few roads in the south where population den-
sities are less than 15 inhabitants per km2.
1.04      Road transport is the principal mode used for both domestic freight
and passenger transport and its share of total demand has been increasing
steadily over the years. Roads now carry about 90% of passenger traffic
and 85% of freight traffic, excluding minerals. In recent years, the average



- 2 -
annual growth of road traffic was about 10% per year for passenger and
freight traffic while for rail traffic it was less than 1% for freight and
about 5% for passengers (para. 1.06).
Highways
1.05      The highway subsector is discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.06      The railway system is operated by the Société National des Chemins
de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT), a semi-autonomous government agency responsible to
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). Despite a modernization
program during the Fourth Development Plan (1973-77), the system continues
to suffer from intrinsic problems related to poor network characteristics,
particularly severe geometry and the existence of two gauges, and the virtual
absence of long-distance commodity flows. Minerals traffic constitutes the
only major commodity flow handled by rail and is concentrated on about 300 km
of lines in the southern part of the country. The density of freight traffic
on the remainder of the network is very light, amounting to only 250,000
ton-km per route km.

1.07      The financial situation of SNCFT has deteriorated since 1972 into an
increasing deficit as a result of stagnant freight traffic and tariff levels
which are generally below average costs. Despite these problems, SNCFT is



- 3 -
considering a program of major investments to be implemented under the Sixth
Development Plan (1982-86), including the construction of certain new routes
and the double-tracking of the main line between Tunis and Sousse. The
economic viability of these investments remains to be established given the
limited scope for future traffic increases. SNCFT should concentrate on
improving overall efficiency, on rationalizing services in favor of long-haul
bulk traffic for which the railway has clear advantages, as well as on obtain-
ing reasonable tariffs.
Ports and Shipping
1.08      Port facilities are owned and operated by the Office des Ports
Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT), with the exception of Gabes which is still being
developed by MTC but is being managed by OPNT. OPNT's financial performance
is satisfactory and rates for most services are related to costs. New tariffs
came into force in July 1979, which will increase revenues by about 30%.
Cargo handling is the responsibility of several companies of which the Société
Tunisienne d'Aconage et de Manutention (STAM) is by far the largest.
1.09      In 1978, Tunisian ports handled 11 million tons of cargo of which
9.4 million tons, or 85% was international traffic. Coastal traffic amounting
to 1.6 million tons consisted mainly of movement of petroleum products from
Bizerte to Sfax and La Goulette. Tunis/La Goulette handles over half of
general cargo traffic and Sfax handled about 60% of all dry bulk, mainly
exports of mineral ores.
1.10      The productivity of Tunisian ports is low, particularly for general
cargo traffic at La Goulette and Sfax. The principal reasons are: (i) inade-
quate berth and storage facilities; (ii) poor coordination of port activities
by OPNT; and (iii) low productivity within STAM which enjoys a virtual monopoly
on cargo handling at La Goulette. Present congestion for general cargo at La
Goulette and Sfax will be alleviated with the implementation of the Bank's
Third Port Project.
1.11      The national shipping line, Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation
(CTN), is a semi-independent company with 18 ships and is undergoing rapid
expansion.  Total tonnage transported by CTN has increased fourfold since 1972
and the objective is to obtain a 30% share of the country's international
traffic by 1981. During the Sixth Development Plan (1982-86), investments by
CTN are expected to be more modest as the company will require a period of
consolidation following several years of rapid growth.
Civil Aviation
1.12      The air transport network consists of four airports, serving mainly
international traffic, and two airlines, Tunis Air and Tunisavia. Following
the rapid growth of tourism, important investments have been made in recent
years on improvements at the Tunis, Monastir, and Jerba airports and on the
construction of a new facility at Tozeur in the south. Since the existing
facilities are now generally adequate, future investments in airport improve-
ments are likely to be modest.



-4 -
1.13      Tunis Air, the national airline, currently operates a fleet of
nine Boeing 727s and one Boeing 737 on international flights and on domestic
routes between Tunis, Monastir, Jerba, and Tozeur.  In recent years, Tunis
Air's financial performance has been rather poor due to major investments in
new aircraft and operating costs increasing faster than revenue. The airline
now has excess capacity and no further expansion is planned in the medium
term. Tunisavia operates a small fleet of charter aircraft and a limited
schedule of regular domestic flights.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.14      The main objectives of the Fifth Development Plan (1977-81) for
the transport sector are: (i) to improve the existing infrastructure, espe-
cially by modernization and rehabilitation works; (ii) to promote rural
development by improving rural roads; (iii) to increase Tunisia's share of
international traffic; and (iv) to reorganize the regional transport companies
(para. 2.09). While these objectives are sound, the heavy emphasis given to
the development of maritime and air transport has resulted in high foreign
exchange expenditures and limited short-term benefits. In the road sector,
major works on the Tunis-Turki Freeway and the Bizerte Bridge have absorbed
more resources than anticipated, leading to a delay in the implementation of
an urgent program of modernization and rehabilitation of existing roads.
1.15      A key issue in the transport sector is that decisions on the alloca-
tion of funds among the transport modes have been taken without the benefit of
thorough sector and sub-sector analyses. Weaknesses in sub-sectoral planning,
project preparation, and insufficient overall coordination follow from a
shortage of qualified staff and are responsible for: (i) an absence of sound
guidelines and well-defined priorities and programs for future investment;
(ii) continued emphasis on maritime transport and on planned development
of the railways, resulting in high foreign exchange expenditures; (iii)
inefficient operation of the railways, ports and regional transport companies;
and (iv) insufficient funds for the proper maintenance and modernization of
the existing road network. The Government is aware of the need for a clearer
transport policy and has engaged consultants to prepare both sub-sectoral
development plans as well as an overall transport coordination study. These
studies are now being completed and will be taken into account in the prepara-
tion of the Sixth Development Plan (1982-86).
1.16      MTC is responsible for the organization of the sector including the
planning of rail, sea, and air transport, the coordination and regulation of
land transport, and establishing transport rates. For road services, MTC acts
through the Société Nationale de Transport (SNT), the Société Nationale de
Transport de Marchandises (STM), and several Societes Regionales de Transport
(SRT); for the railways, it relies on SNCFT. The planning, preparation, and
execution of infrastructure works in roads, ports, and airports are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). Its Highway Department
(Direction des Ponts et Chaussees, DPC) is directly responsible for the



- 5 -
planning, administration, and maintenance of the road network. Overall
transport development is the responsibility of the Ministry of Planning, along
with all other sectors.
1.17      Coordination in transport development is the responsibility of the
Conseil Superieur des Transports (CST), a consultative body consisting of
representatives of transport agencies and users. However, CST has no power to
enforce policies among the various agencies and, in general, has not been
effective in ensuring adequate coordination. For example, in recent years,
CST has been ineffective in implementing recommendations for route deregula-
tion in the trucking industry, and for simplification of road user charges
(para 2.09). MTC is currently considering the issues of sectoral planning and
coordination and is reviewing the recommendations of the transport coordination
study (para. 1.15).
D. Previous Projects
1.18      To assist the Government in achieving its objectives, the Bank has
participated in eight transport projects since 1964. The First and Second
Highway Projects (Loan 746-TUN, 1971, US$24 million and Loan 1188-TUN, 1976,
US$28 million), and the First Railway Project (Loan 606/Credit 150-TUN, 1964,
US$17 million) focussed on modernization and rehabilitation of primary and
secondary roads, and renewal of track and purchase of railway equipment.
Although execution of the First Highway Project was satisfactory, only about
half the roads were rehabilitated due to cost increases (PPAR No. 2772,
December 26, 1979). The First Railway Project was completed successfully
(PPAR No. 2109, June 23, 1978). Two small loans in the port sub-sector (Loan
380-TUN, 1964, US$7 million, and Loan 573-TUN, 1969, US$8.5 million) provided
support facilities for port operation, mainly dredging, maintenance operations
and cargo handling equipment. Both these projects were implemented success-
fully and had an important institution building impact (PPAR No. 1049,
February 26, 1979). Another small loan provided financing for a gas pipeline
project (Loan 724-TUN, 1971, US$7.5 million) which was satisfactorily completed
within one year. A Third Highway Project (Loan 1601-TUN, 1978, US$32 million)
initiated an integrated program for improving about 1,000 km of rural roads.
A Third Port Project  (Loan 1797-TUN,  1980, US$42.5 million) will
assist the Government in modernizing berth facilities at the main ports of La
Goulette and Sfax and in providing support facilities for improved port
operations.  Implementation of the Second Highway Project is behind schedule
due to problems of property acquisition and local financing, but the Government
has recently developed a satisfactory financing and execution plan for the
balance of the project. The Third Highway Project is proceeding on schedule.
Details of transport projects are in Annex I.

Il. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Road Network
2.01      Tunisia's road network comprises about 17,000 km of classified roads
and roughly 14,000 km of unclassified tracks. The classified roads, for which
the DPC is responsible, are divided into three groups:
(a) primary highways (routes de grand parcours, GP) defined as
highways linking major centers in Tunisia with neighboring
countries;
(b) secondary highways (routes de moyenne communication, MC)
for inter-regional service; and
(c) tertiary or local roads (routes vicinales d'etat, RVE),
generally within a province.
2.02      Road standards are based on traffic volumes.  Thus, in the more
densely trafficked northeast of the country, many secondary and tertiary roads
have a bituminous surface, whereas lightly trafficked primary roads, located
mainly in the southwest, have gravel or earth surfaces. The table below shows
the distribution of types of surfacing by road classification.

/1   Includes 293 km of major roads on new alignments which are not yet
officially classified, but which the DPC constructs and maintains.
Source: DPC, October 1979.
2.03      At independence in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well-
developed road network, which was adequate for early development. However,
most roads were constructed many years before to standards for alignment,
width and pavement strength which are now inadequate for the rapidly increas-
ing traffic load. Other roads were mere tracks. The road system was evaluated
in the 1969 Transport Survey, prepared by Italconsult under UNDP funding, with
the Bank as Executing Agency. This survey was followed by the 1971 Highway
Maintenance Study by SCET-BCEOM, under an Engineering Loan (S2-TUN), which
formed the basis for the First Highway Project (Loan 746-TUN).



2.04      The First Highway Project covered modernization works and an exten-
sive program (1900 km) of rehabilitation including pavement resurfacing,
strengthening, and widening. Unfortunately, because of rapid inflation during
the execution of the project, the program had to be reduced in scope and only
about 1000 km were rehabilitated. At the time, the Government considered
financing the balance through the national budget. However, these funds were
not made available and the momentum gained under the First Highway Project has
been lost.
2.05      The normal process of gradual betterment has fallen behind traffic
growth and a major portion of the network now has substandard characteristics
for present volumes of traffic, as shown in the table below. The narrow
pavement widths result in high transport and road maintenance costs and
contribute to the poor safety record of many roads. The proposed project
would provide a start with the rehabilitation of some of these roads and would
continue the rehabilitation program begun under the First Highway Project
(para. 3.09).

2.06      As practically no funds for strengthening and widening have been
available since the First Highway Project, the only alternative for DPC was
to build up its force account capability for surface dressing as a temporary
and minimal measure to preserve the road network. It is now capable of
treating about 500 km a year. However, this amount provides for an average
frequency of surface dressing only once every 16 years. This is about twice
as long as is desirable on technical grounds and, together with the lack of
heavier works, means that roads are deteriorating to an unacceptable level.
The present project is proposed to remedy this situation (para. 3.06).

estimated the veh;cle fleet as follows:

2.08      The level of motorization is about one vehicle per 60 inhabitants,
which is average for countries with a similar per capita income. Although
liberalized since the sixties, imports of cars are still subject to heavy
duties in an effort to limit foreign exchange expenditure and loans for
private car purchase are not generally available.
2.09      Public road transport is provided by two national transport com-
panies: the SNT for passenger traffic and the STM for freight traffic. In
addition, 12 regional transport companies (SRT) handle both passengers and
freight. Several large commercial and industrial enterprises and many small
private firms also operate own-account fleets which have developed rapidly in
recent years. Furthermore, although for-hire transport is limited to pick-ups
and station wagons for passenger transport and to vehicles of less than 5.5
tons for freight, there is a significant number of private owner-operators. The
road transport market is about equally divided between public and private car-
riers. However, inter-urban freigh-t traffic is dominated by private and own-
account operators, because the services offered by the Government-owned companies
are less satisfactory. More than half of the inter-urban passenger traffic is
also carried by private small operators, while Government-owned transport is
limited mainly to urban and local traffic. To improve road transport opera-
tions, the Government is now considering a reduction in the number of regional
companies, these being allowed to operate nationwide in competition with STM.
These changes would be accompanied by a simplification of the road user tax
system, which discriminates in favor of own-account transport, and the
withdrawal of non-competitive preferential tariffs charged by the Government-
owned companies (para. 2.21).

2.10      The heaviest traffic volumes are concentrated along the coast
between Tunis and Sfax and roads in this area have experienced rapid increases
in traffic. Classified roads carry an average of 1,000 vpd with traffic
volumes increasing to over 20,000 vpd near Tunis. Based on recent trends and
in line with expected economic growth, road traffic is forecast to increase at
10% per year through 1986 and 8% thereafter.
2.11      Legal restrictions on vehicle weights and dimensions are based on
French standards and are satisfactory. Overloaded axles in excess of the
13-ton legal maximum are not a significant problem. During negotiations, an
assurance was obtained that the Government will continue to ensure that
the dimensions and axle loads of vehicles shall not exceed legal limits.
C. Administration
2.12      The recommendations of the studies carried out in 1970 (SCET-BCEOM)
included a major reorganization of the two large regional maintenance organiza-
tions. The proposals were accepted by the Government and were rapidly imple-
mented during the period 1972-73 with technical assistance provided under
the First Highway Project. Since then, the Government has continued to improve
4        the organization of DPC, particularly concerning maintenance, in the light of
experience and emerging needs. The revised organization was formalized in a
1975 presidential decree, which established the present organization for the
MPW, including the DPC, as shown on World Bank Chart 18504. DPC headquarters
in Tunis now consists of six divisions (programming and organization, main-
tenance and operations, major road works, studies, applied research and
laboratory, and equipment maintenance and operation) plus a central admin-
istrative and accounting service. DPC has about 3,360 employees (January 1,
1979) including 55 engineers and 358 technicians. The authorized strength for
engineers is 70, but recruitment is slow as civil service conditions are not
attractive. The vacancies are filled by engineering assistants.
2.13      The reorganized maintenance and operations division became fully
operational in January 1976. Since then, it has worked vigorously to overcome



- 10 -
operational problems, including: (i) understaffed crews and insufficient
recruitment; (ii) aging workforce; (iii) old equipment and poor maintenance
facilities; and (iv) poor organization of crews, lack of methods and control.
The central division operates in the regions through 18 road subdivisions,
one for each province, although those established recently do not yet have
a full complement of personnel or equipment. Light periodic maintenance is
carried out by national brigades controlled from headquarters. Each sub-
division controls both specialized brigades for heavy routine, traffic
signs and markings, and structures maintenance, and several multipurpose
brigades each of which is responsible for all light routine maintenance in a
district. Ninety-five district brigades already exist (although not all are
as yet at full strength) and 18 more are planned to be established by 1981.
The proposed project would support the efforts of DPC to intensify the mainte-
nance effort on the entire network, to further improve efficiency, and to
raise maintenance operations to a more satisfactory level. Annex V provides
details of manpower needs to be met during implementation of an improved
maintenance program.
D. Planning and Engineering
2.14      The first comprehensive plans for highway improvement and maintenance
were prepared in 1969-70, and have provided guidelines for investment during
the last decade. The general role of the highway sector is now being reviewed
by consultants (para. 1.15), and the DPC intends to follow up shortly with a
highway master plan and the preparation of an investment program which would
cover the next Development Plan (1982-86). Consultant services for these
studies will be financed under the project within overall guidelines which were
discussed and confirmed with the Government at loan negotiations and are shown
in Annex Il.
2.15      The statistics section in DPC has a continuing program of data
collection, but processing and analysis could be improved. Assurances were
obtained from the Government during negotiations that it will continue the
collection of traffic, technical and other data as a means to monitor project
results and as a basis for proper planning. The planning, design, preparation
of contract documents, and tender calls are the responsibility of the Studies
Division of DPC. The division has a design group, capable of handling small
projects. Major planning studies and the preparation of large projects are
carried out by consultants, and competent domestic consulting services have
developed over recent years. Greater efforts are required within DPC to
institutionalize the major administrative functions of analysis and planning.
The design group should be strengthened such that it can handle annual rehabili-
tation and pavement strengthening operations. The proposed project will
provide the necessary institutional support through technical assistance and
appropriate counterpart training, as well as equipment for the DPC laboratory
to improve geotechnical studies and counters to expand the annual traffic
count program (paras. 3.13 and 3.14).



- il -
2.16      The design standards used by DPC are satisfactory.  The basic
criterion is the base speed of the road, similar in concept to the design
speed. The base speed is chosen considering traffic, terrain, function, etc.
Examples of design standards for base speeds of 100 kph and 80 kph are shown
in the following table.
Geometric Design Standards

E. Investments and Financing
2.17      Civil works on the road network are financed through a capital
investment budget, part of the five-year development plans, controlled by
the Ministry of Planning. Since 1977, capital expenditures under the current
Fifth Development Plan (1977-81) have averaged about DT 14 million (US$35
million) annually, a slight decrease in real terms over the average level
during the previous plan period. The current plan includes main road construc-
tion (including the Second Highway Project), the purchase of highway mainte-
nance equipment, rehabilitation on the main road network and rural road
construction. However, during its implementation, about 40% of the invest-
ments have been absorbed by major works on the Bizerte Bridge and the Tunis-
Turki Freeway. As a result, some priority improvements under the Second
Highway Project have been delayed, although construction will start on these
*        items during 1980.  In addition, the rehabilitation program started under the
First Highway Project has lost momentum (para. 2.04). The proposed project
will provide assistance in financing an urgent program of rehabilitation
during the last year of the current Plan (1981) and the first two years of the
Sixth Plan (1982-83). Together with the on-going Third Highway Project (rural
roads), the proposed project would account for about 40% of planned investments
in road infrastructure.

2.18      As recommended in the 1970 Highway Maintenance Study, and as a com-
mitment under the First Highway Project, the recurrent budget, controlled by
the Ministry of Finance, was increased substantially from 1971 through 1974 in
current prices. However, because of rapid inflation, the physical maintenance
program fell short of that recommended in the study. Furthermore, since 1974,
increases in the budget have been mainly for labor, while funds for operation
and supplies have declined in real terms. When full allowance is made for



- 13-
depreciation of equipment, which is purchased under the capital budget,
average maintenance expenditures on paved roads in 1979 amounted to about
US$1300 per km. These allocations are inadequate considering the increasing
traffic load.
2.19      During the next few years, DPC expects to receive a real annual
increase of about 10% for supplies and operations under the recurrent budget.
Such an increase would permit satisfactory improvements in maintenance opera-
tions. In order to ensure sufficient allocations for this item in current
prices, DPC proposes to apply the following price variation formula based on
recent cost accounting information:
P = a B  + b G   + c       + d M
B      G        CM
o      o        o       o
where B, G, C, and M represent the prices of bitumen, fuel, aggregates, and
equipment; and a = 20%, b = 50%, c = 15% and d = 15%.  Official base year and
current values of B, G, C, and M are published in the official journal of the
Union Tunisienne de l'Industrie, du Commerce, et de l'Artisanat (UTICA).
2.20      Salary items in the recurrent budget are automatically adjusted
for inflation each year. However, it is planned that the budget items for
labor will increase at about 10% per year in real terms through 1981 in order
to adequately staff the existing and additional maintenance brigades to be
introduced during the next two years (para. 2.13). Moderate increases, about
5% per year in real terms through 1982, are also planned for administrative
costs in order to provide more attractive employment conditions (para. 2.12).
2.21      Road users contribute to Government revenues through annual vehicle
registration fees, taxes on fuel, lubricants and tires, and import duties on
vehicles and spare parts. In 1977, total revenue from these sources was
estimated at DT 83 million. Although road users as a whole pay adequately for
the use and development of road infrastructure, there is some evidence that
heavy vehicles are under-taxed. The Government is currently considering a
revision of the present complex road user tax structure which, in part, has
been responsible for distortions in the development of the road transport
industry (para. 2.09).
F. Construction
2.22      Construction works are normally carried out under unit price contracts
awarded after competitive bidding. Marty contractors, both foreign and local,
operate in Tunisia and provide efficient competition. Small contracts (of the
order of $1 million) are usually won by Tunisian contractors, while larger
contracts (over $5 million) are frequently won by joint ventures of foreign
and local contractors.



- 14-
2.23      Construction supervision is carried out by DPC engineers with the
assistance of the Laboratory, except for very large special projects, for
which the Government relies on consulting firms. Minor improvements are
supervised by the sub-divisions with some assistance from headquarters and
large improvements by the major road works division in Tunis. Supervision is
satisfactory.
G. Maintenance
2.24      Long-term goals for improving the quality and quantity of road
maintenance have been established by headquarters divisions of DPC. The end
of the next five-year development plan (1982-1986) was chosen as a convenient
planning horizon, which, together with the last year of the current plan
(1981), led to the definition of a six-year program (1981-1986). The long-
term goals for individual items are covered in the relevant paragraphs of this
chapter and detailed in several project file reports; key items are summarized
in the last column of the Action Plan (Annex V).
2.25      The maintenance division has established standard equipment and
crew composition, costs and production rates for each maintenance operation
(Project File Report B13). Based on these operations, DPC has developed an
improved program (Report B7) for organization and personnel needs at sub-
division and brigade levels (para. 2.13),for the quantity and operation of
equipment, for control and inspection, and for training and continuing educa-
tion (paras. 2.29-2.32).
2.26      The inventory of road maintenance equipment is summarized by location
in Report B8. The distribution of the equipment which was financed by suppliers
credits, and delivered in 1979, is set out in Report B9. Based on these two
reports and the needs of the improved program, DPC developed a list of equipment
requirements for the six-year program, covering both extension of the fleet
and replacement (Report B14). Procurement is proposed in two tranches, in
1981 and 1984. The list of equipment proposed is included in the Action Plan
(Annex V). Tools to complete the equipping of workshops for the maintenance
of the equipment are also included in the program (Report B14).
2.27      Quality and quantity targets have been established for routine
maintenance tasks (Report B17, summarized in Annex V of this SAR), together
with a corresponding budget. DPC also proposes to progressively increase its
capability to carry out surface dressing from the current 500 km a year to at
least 800 km a year. An analysis has demonstrated that surface dressing could
be done more cost-effectively by force account. Therefore, DPC has increased
its force account capacity for surface dressing and these operations will be
expanded within an existing organization for which a recurrent operating
budget is available on a continuous basis.



- 15-
2.28      Based on an inventory of the highway system (Report B2) updated in
1979 (Report Bll), a tentative six-year program of rehabilitation was developed
by the studies division of DPC (Report B16). The list of roads to be improved
during the first year of the program is included in the Action Plan (Annex V,
page 3).
H. Training
2.29      DPC has a policy of refresher courses and continuing education
for officials and skilled workers. Training is organized separately for three
groups of personnel: (i) equipment operators and mechanics; (ii) technicians;
and (iii) engineers. Only the training of the first group is currently fully
operational, but the DPC plans to set up a school for technicians early in
1980, and the proposed project will assist with the continuing education
program for the engineers.
Operators and Mechanics
2.30      The training school for operators and mechanics is established as a
separate service in the Equipment Maintenance Division of DPC. It is headed
by a Principal Mechanical Engineer. School facilities include classrooms and
living quarters with 40 beds. The school began training recruits about four
years ago, and in 1979 the first refresher courses were started for existing
employees who would be taking over the newly delivered equipment purchased
under the Fifth Development Plan. Training is carried out under master
operators and master mechanics. After initial classroom sessions, practical
training is given for operators with a special brigade working in the Tunis
area, and for mechanics in the main equipment workshops in Tunis. The current
program is designed to cover all operators of the one thousand pieces of
equipment in DPC's fleet over a three-year period (1979-1981).
Technicians
2.31      The center for the continuing education of technicians will be
established at the Laboratory site in Tunis. The program will cover all 350
technicians in DPC, but priority will be given to the 100 brigade chiefs.
Accommodation will be provided at the Equipment Division. Instructors will be
the senior engineers of DPC. Each course cycle is planned to last three
weeks, and the objective is to give each technician one course a year.
Engineers
2.32      Continuing education for technicians and engineers would be planned
and coordinated by a training officer expected to be hired early in 1980. A
second officer will be recruited as the program develops. The program for
engineers will include: (i) the publication of technical notes and circula-
tion of articles from technical journals; (ii) seminars on topics related to
maintenance management, accounting and administration conducted by senior DPC
engineers and expatriate experts; and (iii) short courses overseas in French-
speaking areas to obtain practical experience in functioning maintenance



- 16-
organizations. The short courses are planned at a frequency of about one
three-week course every three years for the 55-70 DPC engineers. DPC is
already financing the training of operators and mechanics, with some assis-
tance from the Ministry of Social Affairs, and can also finance the proposed
program for technicians. The proposed project will help with the continuing
education of engineers by financing the foreign costs of the short courses at
maintenance division overseas and the visits of expatriate guest lecturers to
Tunisia (para. 3.12).
I. Traffic Safety
2.33      The DPC currently has a detailed data collection program on traffic
accidents. The data suggest that the fatality rate is typical of developing
countries with the same level of motorization and is not decreasing towards
industrialized country levels as motorization increases. DPC plans to upgrade
its traffic management and safety program by: (i) an expansion of its
program of pavement marking and installation and replacement of regulatory
warning and guide signs; (ii) improving accident data handling and analysis;
and (iii) conducting training seminars for subdivision engineers who are
responsible for correcting deficiencies at high-accident locations. To assist
DPC in achieving these objectives, the project will provide for the procure-
ment of traffic signs and technical assistance in accident data treatment and
geometric design improvements (paras. 3.13 and 3.14).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      Road maintenance and rehabilitation lost momentum after completion
of the First Highway Project (para. 2.04). As a result, an increasing portion
of the road network has deteriorated or has fallen below the standard required
by current traffic volumes. The need to regain this lost momentum is of high
priority for the balanced development of the road network. The proposed
project is designed to achieve this objective. It was identified in November
1978 and has been prepared by the DPC, with the assistance of Bank preparation
missions in March and June 1979, and the appraisal mission in October 1979.
B. Objectives
3.02      The overall objectives of the project are to improve the management
of the Tunisian highway network and to achieve balanced development of the
highway infrastructure. Specifically, the project is designed to:
(i) meet the urgent backlog of road rehabilitation;



- 17-
(ii)  expand road maintenance activities and improve the
efficiency of the maintenance organization;
(iii) strengthen the institutional framework through the intro-
duction of improved planning techniques, information
systems, and staff training;
(iv)  progressively raise the recurrent budget for maintenance
to an adequate level; and
(v) support a program of traffic management and road safety.
C. Project Description
3.03      The project would consist of:
(i) a three-year slice (1981-83) of a six-year program for
improving highway maintenance, including the purchase
of highway maintenance equipment;
(ii)  a three-year slice of a six-year program of road
rehabilitation;
(iii) training for highway department staff, including
refresher courses in Tunisia and overseas;
(iv)  the provision of laboratory test equipment, traffic
counters and traffic signs; and
(v)  technical assistance for project monitoring and evaluation,for
overall highway investment planning, and for preparation of annual
work programs and a future rural roads project.
Improved Road Maintenance Program
3.04      The DPC has prepared an improved road maintenance program (paras.
2.24-2.28) which would begin in 1981, with implementation continuing through
the Sixth Development Plan (1982-86). The program is necessarily long-term
due to physical and financial constraints, especially the level of the recur-
re-nt maintenance budget which must be raised progressively in order to support
improved maintenance operations. The Government has requested the Bank to
participate in a three-year slice (1981-83) of the improved program.
3.05      The proposed project aims to improve the efficiency of maintenance
operations and to raise the levels of maintenance. Achieving these objec-
tives will require further improvements in organization for and methods of
carrying out maintenance operations, renewal of maintenance equipment, procure-
ment of additional equipment, and will require higher budgetary allocations.
The project will provide for the acq.uisition of new maintenance equipment,



- 18 -
including equipment and tools for the repair shops. The equipment require-
ments (para. 2.26 and Annex V) have been derived from a detailed examination
of the existing equipment fleet and the proposed expansion of maintenance
brigades (para. 2.13). This list has been discussed and confirmed with
the Government during negotiations. As DPC is committed to raise productivity,
the project also includes technical assistance to ensure adequate monitoring
and evaluation through the creation of an organization and methods unit.
Raising the maintenance effort to a more satisfactory level will also require
an expansion of the labor force (brigades) and greater supplies of materials
and other operational inputs (fuel, lubricants, etc.).
3.06      Annual programs of routine maintenance will continue to be updated
and refined by the maintenance division, taking account of improvements in
quality and quantity to be achieved under the project. As explained in para.
2.27, the force account capacity to undertake light periodic maintenance, or
surface dressing, will be progressively increased from the present frequency
of once every 16 years to once every 10 years. While this is still a rela-
tively long period, it represents reasonable physical and financial objectives.
On the unpaved network, mainly unimproved tracks with limited drainage struc-
tures, normal maintenance operations cannot provide satisfactory all-weather
level of service. However, more frequent grading under the proposed project
will improve the serviceability of these roads.
3.07      During project preparation, the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM) was installed in Tunisia. The model was used to analyze
the rehabilitation works proposed for the first year of the project (para.
3.09), and to evaluate the economic benefits of the whole maintenance program.
During project execution, the input data for the model will be improved and
expanded with a view to refining and optimizing the maintenance program (Annex
II).
3.08      During  loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained f rom the
Government that it will, through DPC, carry out the maintenance program in
accordance with a three-year actioD plan agreed between the Government and
the Bank.  Updated annual plans of operations, consistent with the three-year
plan, will be submitted to the Bank by September 30 each year for review and
comment, prior to implementation during the following year.
Road Rehabilitation Program
3.09      These works consist of pavement strengthening, with or without road
widening, and also road widening alone where pavement strength is adequate and
where justified by high traffic volumes. At present, about 1700 km of roads
have been identified as requiring rehabilitation, of which 800 km are proposed
to be undertaken during the three years of the project. The provisional list
of roads is available in the Project File (Report B16). This list was dis-
cussed with the Government and confirmed during negotiations. Detailed
engineering/economic studies have been carried out for the sections to be
improved during the first year of the Program (listed on page 3 of Annex V),
which have a total length of 215 km, and draft contract documents are available
(Map IBRD 14732R).   Pavement design is based on deflection measurements, the



- 19 -
existing pavement structure, and the Tunisian "catalogue" of pavement
strengthening design. The methodology is satisfactory. The sections to be
improved during subsequent years will be prepared on a continuous basis in
time for approval by the Bank to meet the planned work program. To prepare
the designs, contract documents, and economic evaluation of the sections to be
implemented, the DPC will require the assistance of consultants, to be financed
under the proposed project.
3.10      The list of road sections proposed for works after the first year is
based on current data; future deterioration and other developments may require
that the list be modified.
3.11      The criteria for Bank approval of subprojects would be that:
(i) the quality of the preparation and analysis must be
acceptable to the Bank;
(ii) the ER of the investment is at least equal to the
opportunity cost of capital in Tunisia; and
(iii) the implementation would not be started before the
optimal year.
During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that
DPC will submit the technical and economic evaluation of rehabilitating
individual road sections for the Bank's approval, according to the agreed
methodology (Annex III), criteria, and procedures, before calling for tenders.
Training
3.12      During loan negotiations, the Government confirmed that DPC will
appoint a permanent training officer who will be responsible for planning and
coordinating training (para. 2.32). The training needs for operators and
mechanics are being met by DPC from their own resources (paras. 2.29 and
2.30). DPC can also meet the expected needs for technicians. However, the
cost of overseas fellowships for engineers at maintenance units in French-
speaking countries (France, Belgium or perhaps Canada) will be financed under
the proposed project. Three-week courses for about 20 engineers a year are
proposed.
Technical Assistance
3.13      The project would provide for about 120 man-months of consulting
services to assist the DPC in: (i) establishing an organization and methods
unit for project monitoring and evaluation, including traffic, road inventory
and accident data processing; (ii) preparing studies necessary for the planning
of road maintenance, including a highway master plan and investment program;
(iii) preparing economic studies and detailed engineering for the second and
third years' rehabilitation programs; (iv) carrying out a training program for
DPC staff in Tunisia and abroad; and (v) preparing detailed engineering
about 1000 km rural roads for a possible rural roads project. Cons'ulting



- 20 -
services will serve to strengthen DPC's capability in the above areas through
counterpart training (para. 2.15). At loan negotiations, the number and
positions of counterparts to be trained were discussed and confirmed with the
Government as well as the overall guidelines (Annex II) within which consulting
services will be provided.
Workshop and Laboratory Equipment, Traffic Counters and Road Signs
3.14      Equipment maintenance will be improved by the completion of tooling
in the maintenance workshops. A detailed list of proposed equipment is
included in the Project File and was discussed and confirmed with the Govern-
ment during negotiations. The laboratory operation in Tunisia will be made
more efficient by decentralizing some of the standard testing. It is proposed
to finance under the project the testing equipment and light vans for transport
to complete five regional laboratories at Sousse, Sfax, Bizerte, Le Kef and
Gabes, and to equip two new laboratories at Gafsa and Kairouan. The equipment
covers requirements for carrying out geotechnical, bitumen, concrete and soils
testing. The scope and quality of the work of the main laboratory in Tunis
will be increased by the provision of several pieces of equipment for testing
the strength and service characteristics of roads, and for foundation investi-
gation together with associated transport vehicles. The detailed list of
proposed equipment is available in the Project File.
3.15      The Government's capability for the analysis, design and control of
projects as well as the updating and refinement of the maintenance program,
would be enhanced by the provision under the project of equipment for the
materials laboratories, as well as 25 traffic counters for the statistics
section (para. 2.15). The highway safety program would be assisted through
the provision of about 6,000 replacement road signs (para. 2.33). The list
of equipment was discussed and confirmed during negotiations.
D. Cost Estimates
3.16      Tables 3.1 and 3.2 show the capital and recurrent cost estimates of
the proposed project. The total capital cost is estimated at US$92.1 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component equivalent to US$45.5
million, and a local cost component of US$46.6 million equivalent, including
US$20 million equivalent in taxes and duties. The recurrent costs of the
three-year maintenance program are estimated at US$88.7 million equivalent.
The overall cost of the three-year program, therefore, is estimated at
US$180.8 million. The cost estimates were discussed and confirmed with the
Government during negotiations.

/1   Base cost estimates in January 1980 prices.
75   Price increases for recurrent costs are based on an annual rate of 7%.
3.17      Estimates for civil works are based on unit prices for recent
contracts in Tunisia, adjusted to January 1980 levels, and on substantially
completed engineering studies for the first-year program of works. The
estimated three-year slice total for civil works is based on these unit prices
and preliminary estimates of the quantity of each class of works required on
the roads in the Program. Cost estimates for road maintenance equipment are
based on recent purchase prices for each type of equipment, updated to January
1980 levels. Cost estimates of equipment for the materials laboratory and for
traffic counters were prepared by the responsible services on the basis of
prices quoted by suppliers.
3.18      The technical assistance cost estimates are based on recent rates
for consulting services in Tunisia. Technical assistance under the project,
about 120 man-months of professional services, is estimated at about US$1.1
million. The average man-month cost, including salary costs, fees, interna-
tional travel and subsistance, is expected to be about US$10,000 for the
short-term high-level expertise (organization and methods, laboratory, seminars),
with little additional local cost; and about US$7,500 for the more conventional
consulting services, plus usual local costs of travel, office space, secretarial
help, printing, etc. The cost estimates for the overseas fellowships are
estimated at $225,000, including $45,000 for overseas travel.
3.19      Recurrent costs are provided from the general budget allocations to
DPC for road maintenance and administration. These costs for the three-year
slice are based on current budget allocations and on increased supplies,
operating costs, and labor, necessary to support expanded maintenance opera-
tions (paras. 2.19 and 2.20).
3.20      Physical contingencies of 10% of base costs have been allowed on all
capital items. Contingency allowances for price escalation were calculated



- 23-
for each year of the planned implementation schedule (Annex IV), and overall
represent 23% of base line costs plus physical contingencies.
3.21      Foreign exchange components have been calculated for each project
component. For civil works, the breakdown between foreign and local components
(the local including taxes) was calculated for each major item in the bill of
quantities and assumes that two-thirds of all contracts would be awarded to
Tunisian and one-third to foreign contractors. This latter assumption was
based on recent contract awards and prequalifications.
E. Financing
3.22      The Bank will finance urgently needed equipment for surface dressing
andperiodic maintenance, amounting to about 20% of total maintenance equipment
needs under the project. The Government will finance the balance of the road
maintenance equipment through export credits. The Bank will finance all of
the foreign component of the remaining project items as shown in Table 3.3.
The Government will finance all the local costs of the capital items, as well
as all of the annual recurrent budget costs in line with the criteria in
paras. 2.19 and 2.20, and the proposed annual programs (para. 3.06). As all
project elements are closely integrated an assurance was obtained from the
Government that contracts for the supply of the road maintenance equipment
will be signed by September 30, 1981.

F. Implementation
Executing Agency
3.23      Implementation will be the responsibility of DPC, and all of the
headquarters divisions of DPC will be involved. Supervision will be carried
out by the regional subdivisions, some with the assistance of headquarters
staff.
Schedule and Monitoring
3.24      The implementation schedule is shown in Annex IV and was discussed
and confirmed with the Government during negotiations. Progress on the
project will be communicated to the Bank by means of quarterly progress
reports, the first one within three months of the date of the loan becomes
effective. The Government will also prepare a project completion report
within six months of the Loan Closing Date. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from the Government that it will prepare and submit the quarterly
reports and completion report.
Procurement
3.25      Civil works will be carried out by unit price contract after interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Both
foreign and Tunisian contractors operate in Tunisia and both are expected to
bid for the works. Contractors will be prequalified. In order to attract the
maximum number of bids, the annual programs of works will be grouped on a
geographical basis. The grouping will permit lots to be generally in the
range of DT 750,000 to 2,500,000 (US$1.9 to 6.3 million) and contractors would
be allowed to bid for one or more lots in combination. This range will be of
interest both to smaller-slzed Tunisian contractors and to the larger Tunisian
and foreign firms. Based on experience with the previous three highway
projects, it is estimated that two-thirds of the contracts would be awarded to
Tunisian contractors and one-third to foreign companies.
3.26      The Bank-financed part of the road maintenance equipment, as well as
workshop equipment, laboratory equipment (except for four items covered
below), traffic signs and traffic counters will be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank guidelines. Bidders
will compete against minimum specifications on the basis of cost, delivery
time and quality of after-sales service. Four highly specialized pieces of
road evaluation equipment, suitable for Tunisia (deflection testing, profile
evaluation, bump integrator and scrim skid testing machine) for a total cost
of about US$200,000 are obtainable from only one source and would be procured
by negotiated contract for purposes of standardization.



- 25-
3.27      The technical assistance will be provided by qualified and experi-
enced specialists and consulting firms on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank.
G. Disbursements

During loan negotiations the disbursement schedule was discussed and confirmed
with the Government.
H. Environmental Impact
3.30      The civil works consist of improvements on the existing alignments
and will not, therefore, significantly affect the environment. Improved
maintenance and road widening, including better shoulders, traffic signs and
markings, will contribute to highway safety.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      With the present level of road maintenance in Tunisia, the condition
of the road network would continue to deteriorate such that, during the next



- 27-
decade, many parts of the country would become accessible only at very high
cost. Potential bottlenecks and high transport costs on the network would
impede economic growth and compromise the policy for economic decentralization
through rural and regional development. Through the implementation of improved
road maintenance operations and a balanced program of rehabilitation, the
proposed ptoject is designed to stop further deterioration of the network.
The direct benefits of the improved maintenance effort and the rehabilitation
program will be in transport cost savings which follow from reduced road
deterioration. At the same time, the project should make maintenance opera-
tions more cost-effective and avoid costly reconstruction works which would
otherwise be necessary with inadequate maintenance and pavement strengthening.
The proposed project would also strengthen the organization and administra-
tion of the road network through proposed training and technical assistance
components.
4.02      As the project covers the entire classified highway network, the
associated economic benefits will be widespread and affect a large portion of
total population. The direct beneficiaries would be the private owners of
cars, vans and small trucks as well as the public trucking enterprises.
Although trucking rates are controlled by the Government,competition in road
transport is keen and benefits accruing to both private and public trucking
enterprises will be largely passed on to users through slower increases in
rates than would otherwise occur. Substantial savings in avoided reconstruc-
tion, which would be ultimately necessary with a continuation of the existing
level of maintenance, will accrue directly to the Government. These savings
in Government expenditures will ultimately benefit the general population by
increasing the financial resources available for other purposes.
B. Economic Analysis
General
4.03      The economic analysis has been undertaken for the improved mainte-
nance program as a whole, including a long-term scheme of rehabilitation.
The latter forms an integral part of the improved maintenance effort because
of the important trade-offs between rehabilitation and periodic maintenance:
rehabilitation of deficient sections of the road network reduces the need for
periodic resealing of roads. A separate evaluation has also been made for
specific sections included in a first-year slice of improvements under the
rehabilitation program. The evaluation has been carried out using the Bank's
Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM) which was adapted to
Tunisian conditions. Estimates of economic benefits from reduced road
deterioration and improved running surfaces have been limited to vehicle
operating cost savings. Benefits from reduced passenger time and accident
costs have not been estimated in the analysis. The quantified economic
benefits of the project have, therefore, been understated.



- 28-
Improved Road Maintenance Program
4.04      The economic analysis of the improved road maintenance program has
been carried out by assessing the influence of improved maintenance practices
on the condition of the road network over a ten-year period (1981-90). The
analysis has been undertaken for an improved maintenance alternative which
was dictated largely by the existing and short-term physical and financial
constraints. The scope of the proposed program is appropriate given these
constraints and the need for progressive implementation of improved maintenance
procedures. In order to evaluate the program as a whole, a rehabilitation
scheme, equivalent to about 250 km annually, was simulated over the ten-year
evaluation period.
4.05      Existing traffic volumes for the network were derived from nationwide
counts undertaken in 1977 and the annual count programs of 1978 and 1979.
Network characteristics, maintenance cost and vehicle operating cost data were
provided by DPC. Overall, traffic was assumed to increase at 10% per year
through 1986 followed by 8% thereafter, in line with planned economic develop-
ment. The adoption of average traffic growth rates for the network is not
critical to the economic evaluation.
4.06      For given maintenance policies, use of the HDM Model has facilitated
the analysis of road deterioration over the network covering a wide range of
traffic volumes and initial surface and geotechnical conditions. The model
also provided estimates of vehicle operating costs over the road network as
a function of surface type and condition, design geometry, and vehicle char-
acteristics and costs.
4.07      Details of the preparation of data inputs for the analysis and
economic evaluation are available in the Project File (Working Papers Cl and C2).
Road Rehabilitation Program
4.08      The Government has identified a first-year slice of improvements
under a long-term program of rehabilitation for key sections of the road
network. The first-year program includes sections totalling 215 km which will
be improved by pavement strengthening, with or without widening, by road
widening alone, or by asphaltic concrete overlays. Current traffic volumes on
the various sections analyzed range from 420 to 6,500 vpd with an average of
2,000 vpd, including 16% heavy vehicles.  Traffic growth on these roads is
expected to be near the national average, consistent with economic development.
Benefits from the program follow from the reduction in vehicle operating costs
through improved running surfaces as well as the avoidance of excess vehicle
operating costs and maintenance expenditures which are incurred with sub-
standard narrow pavements. An analysis of all road sections proposed for
widening and strengthening showed that the incremental benefits of widening
exceeded the associated incremental costs over and above the alternative of
strengthening alone. Detailed estimates of benefits are available in the
Project File (Working Papers C3 and C4).

Results
4.09      The overall program, comprising improved maintenance and rehabili-
tation, is well justified with an ER of 80% and a Benefit/Cost
ratio (B/C) of 15 at a discount rate of 10%. Even with a 50% increase in
costs combined with a 50% decrease in benefits, the ER for the improved pro-
gram as a whole is 25%.
4.10      The specific road sections analyzed as part of the first year
rehabilitation program show an average ER in excess of 100%, the lowest
individual ER being 17%. The B/C ratios for these sections range from 1.3
to over 10 at a discount rate of 10%. A 20% increase in costs and a 20%
decrease in benefits showed that the roads under the rehabilitation program
are not sensitive to substantial variations in the basic parameters of the
analysis. Under these assumptions, all road sections showed acceptable ERs.
C. Project Risk
4.11      Shortcomings in providing funds in a timely manner could result
in delays in implementing improved maintenance operations and the rehabilita-
tion program. However, the improved maintenance program has been tailored to
moderate increases in the recurrent budget and improved maintenance procedures
would be achieved progressively in line with absorptive capacity. Delays to
the rehabilitation program would not reduce the economic return on these
works, but the economy would suffer from the loss in substantial benefits
during the period of delay.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on various issues
referred to in the report, including the following matters of particular
significance. DPC will:
(i)  implement the maintenance program in accordance with the
three-year action plan agreed between the Government and the
Bank (para. 3.08);
(ii)  by September 30 each year, submit to the Bank for its review
and comment, updated annual plans of operations, consistent
with the three-year action plan, to be carried out in the
following year (para. 3.08);
(iii)  submit the technical and economic evaluation of rehabili-
tating individual road sections for the Bank's approval,
according to the agreed methodology, criteria, and proce-
dures, before calling for tenders (para. 3.11); and



- 30-
(iv) provide for the effectiveness of the export credit agreements for
the road maintenance equipment by September 30, 1981 (para. 3.22).
5.02      Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in the report,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$36.5 million to the Government
of Tunisia for a 17-year term including a 4-year grace period.

A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Transport Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
1.        Loan 380-TUN (1964, US$7.0 million, Republic of Tunisia, First Port
Project) was for a project, the major components of which were dredging and
refilling at La Goulette, the construction of berths, transit sheds and other
infrastructure and consulting services. The project was satisfactorily
completed.
2.        Loan 573-TUN (1969, US$8.5 million, Offices des Ports Nationaux
Tunisiens, Second Port Project) also included a major component for dredging,
as well as the provision of dredges and cargo handling equipment, provision
of a grain berth, training and consulting services. The project was satis-
factorily completed (PPAR No. 1049, February 26, 1979).
3.        Loan 606/Credit 150-TUN (1969, US$17.0 million, SNCFT, Railway
Project) was for a project, the major components of which were the renewal of
352 km of track, purchase of rolling stock, improvement of workshops and
disastrous floods of 1969 and 1971 and shortages of funds resulting from slow
payments by the railway's principal customer (Sfax/Gafsa Phosphate Co.) prior
to 1973, when the Government assumed the debts of the phosphate company). The
project was satisfactorily completed (PPAR No. 2109, June 23, 1978)
4.        Loan S2-TUN (1969, US$0.8 million) was for engineering studies
for highways included in the First Highway Project. It was satisfactorily
completed.
5.        Loan 724-TUN (1971, US$7.5 million, Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite
et du Gaz, Gas Pipeline Project) was for a project which included procurement
and installation of pipelines, compressors, and ancillary services.  The
project was satisfactorily completed in 1972.
6.        Loan 746-TUN (1971, US$24.0 million, First Highway Project) was
for partial financing of construction and improvement of 274 km of highways,
resurfacing and rehabilitation of 1,920 km of roads, reconstruction of 51
bridges and consulting services. The project encountered difficulties with
the rise in costs at the time of the oil crisis. In addition, further studies
showed that the Tunis-Turki section should be constructed as a four-lane free-
way rather than as the three-lane road included in the project. The Board,
therefore, approved exclusion of the Tunis-Turki road from the project; this
road was later financed by the Kuwait Fund. The disbursement rate was reduced
on the remaining items. All other construction items and consulting services
have now been satisfactorily completed (PPAR No. 2772, December 26, 1979).

7.   Loan 1188-TUN, (1976, US$28.0 million, Second Highway Project) was for
the improvement of about 225 km of primary and secondary roads, and consulting
services to assist in a transport coordination study and to assist with the
preparation of a Rural Roads Program. Construction has been completed on one
lot of GP 8, Tunis-Bizerte, and is well advanced on the other lot on the same
route. Construction is in progress on MC 28/27, but has been delayed on the
other three routes in the project because of lack of local funds. The Govern-
ment has now assured the Bank that the remaining items (with the exception of
the Sfax bypass section, for which they will request deletion from the project)
will be undertaken in 1980/81. The rural roads study was successfully completed.
The transport study is behind schedule, but the final report has now been
submitted.
8.        Loan 1601-TUN (1978, US$32.0 million, Rural Roads Project) was for
the improvement of about 1,000 km of rural roads; the procurement of road
maintenance equipment, and agricultural facilities and equipment; the provi-
sion of investment and short-term credit; the improvement of extension
services; and technical assistance to the Ministries of Public Works and
Agriculture. Construction is in progress on four lots in three provinces, and
contracts are being awarded for two lots in a fourth province. Implementation
of the complementary agricultural investments and extension services suffered
an initial lag, but is now proceeding satisfactorily. Technical assistance
for the preparation of a second tranche is progressing satisfactorily.
9.        Loan 1797-TUN (1980, US$42.5 million, Third Port Project) provides
for the modernization of port facilities at La Goulette and Sfax. The major
components of the project include specialized facilities for roll-on/roll-off
vessels, storage areas, transit sheds and warehouses, as well as additional
cargo handling equipment and repair and maintenance facilities.

A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Guidelines for Highway Sector Planning
I. Objectives
1.        The objective is to provide a broad conceptual framework for the
overall development of the highway sector. The approach suggested in these
guidelines forms an integral part of the preparation and planning for the
Sixth Development Plan (1982-86). The proposed project includes financing of
consultant's services for planning and project preparation within this general
framework.
2.        The necessary steps in the preparation of a sound highway investment
and maintenance program are as follows:
(i) a highway master plan, including an inventory of the road network
and long-term policy guidelines for its development, traffic
analyses, new construction programs, rehabilitation and strengthen-
ing works, road maintenance requirements and cost estimates;
(ii) a detailed investment program for the road network, including the
ranking of projects according to economic priorities;
(iii) a periodic updating and refinement of the highway maintenance
program based on improved standards and appropriate maintenance
strategies taking due account of current physical and financial
limitations; and
(iv) a monitoring and evaluation system to ensure efficient preparation
and execution of the programs, including annual updating and the
preparation of subsequent programs.
3.        Preparation of the highway master plan, the formulation of the road
improvements program, the highway maintenance program, and the monitoring and
evaluating system shall be the responsibility of the Government, assisted
where necessary by consultants engaged for specific purposes to be determined
within the framework of this general approach.

Il. Preparation of the Program
A.   Highway Master Plan
4.        The highway master plan shall cover all types of roads, including
unclassified rural roads.
5.        The updating of the highway master plan shall include:
(i) an examination of all available data on the existing road network
and, as appropriate, reconnaissance surveys and detailed inspection
of the road system so as to produce an updated descriptive inventory
of the network;
(ii) an analysis of existing highway traffic data and, if necessary,
traffic counts and origin-destination studies to determine the
nature of the traffic and the present and future volume of freight
and passenger movements;
(iii) a review of the development needs of the highway sector in the
context of the development of other sectors of the economy as a
whole and of other transport modes in particular;
(iv) an evaluation of the highway master plan in the light of the needs
of the economy, including transport costs and benefits and a con-
sideration of possible alternatives; in particular, a study of the
balance of investments as between national, regional and local
roads;
(v) an outline program for the construction, rehabilitation and
strengthening work required, as well as road maintenance needs,
including the relevant cost estimates (with a 30% margin of error);
cost estimates will include appropriate price and quantity con-
tingency provisions.
6.        The preparation of the master plan will take into account the recom-
mendation of the transport coordination study prepared by consultants for MTC
under the Second Highway Project.
B.   Road Improvements Program
7.        The detailed road investment program shall be drawn up in the light
of the master plan, on-going projects and recent levels of investment in the
road sector. The program shall be justified economically and technically and
be consistent with execution and financing capabilities. For the economic and
technical justification, feasibility and final design studies shall be made
following a procedure acceptable to the Bank.



- 35 -                           ANNEX II
Page 3
8.        The formulation of the program shall be an iterative operation
taking into consideration the results of the feasibility and detailed engineer-
ing studies and the financial and execution constraints. To assist with the
ranking of the investments, highway sections will be classified according to
their economic priority as defined by the feasibility studies.
9.        The road improvement program shall include the following subprograms:
(i) a construction program, including new construction, doubling,
or reconstruction of existing roads, etc.; and
(ii) a pavement rehabilitation and strengthening program, including
realignments, widening, and other minor local rehabilitation
works.
10.       The roads improvement program shall provide preliminary estimates of
annual project costs and the corresponding sources of finance.
C.   Highway Maintenance Program
1i.       The updating and refinement of the highway maintenance program shall
be based on comprehensive technical and economic data as follows:
(i) a register of all classified roads in Tunisia describing
the type and volume of traffic they serve, giving salient
details of road link locations, roadside developments,
type and condition of the existing road and structures and
route length;
(ii) a continuous inventory of the above roads recording their
horizontal and vertical alignments, curvatures, cross sec-
tions, pavement thicknesses, types and qualities, side and
cross drainage and horizontal and vertical road signs;
(iii) recommendations on the design and use of a computerized
storage system of this road inventory data suitable for
use together with traffic data in periodic economic and
technical analyses for road maintenance and development;
(iv) the definition of different methods that may be used to
carry out maintenance operations, stating the manpower,
materials and equipment amounts needed together with the
relevant unit rates, extended to give unit costs for work
elements; and
(v) the collection and synthesis of data on unit maintenance
costs for typical roads under various traffic conditions.
12.       Alternative levels of maintenance will be analyzed on typical road
sections derived from road inventory and traffic data. These data should be
sufficiently comprehensive to enable classification of the network according



-36 -                            ANNEX II
Page 4
to traffic and axle loading range and surface type and condition. The analysis
should result in the definition of typical road sections, each one a represen-
tative combination of geography, geometric characteristics, pavement structure
and traffic typically found in Tunisia. The total number of road sections
should be representative of the entire network and be fully described with the
maintenance operations required. The economic analysis will consider the vary-
ing patterns of road deterioration under different levels of maintenance and
optimal maintenance operations will be defined for the whole network. The
optimal program will take account of physical and financial absorptive capacity
and the need for progressive implementation of improved maintenance practices.
13.       The maintenance program will include annual  maintenance-budget
estimates for routine and periodic maintenance activities, broken down into
equipment, spare parts, tools and machinery, fuels and lubricants, supplies,
salaries, training, etc. and local and foreign exchange costs. Requirements
for pavement overlays, rehabilitation and modernization will be considered
under the investment budget (Section B). Specific recommendations will be
made on the road maintenance organization necessary to effectively carry out
an improved program
D.   Monitoring and Evaluation System
14.       A monitoring and evaluation system will be established to ensure
efficient administration of program preparation and execution. This system
shall, among other things, cover all arrangements (staff, equipment, and other
facilities, financing) to:
(i) update the master plan;
(ii) prepare a continuous inventory of network condition and
traffic;
(iii) establish program accounting and monitoring of its execution
(costs and benefits);
(iv) collect information on the cost of the various operations
required to put the programs into effect; and
(v) update the programs annually in the light of the results
achieved, execution capabilities and financial resources.
III. Economic Justification
15.       For each project included in the roads improvement programs, the
economic feasibility shall be determined individually; for new construction
a suitable method of economic analysis shall be used; for rehabilitation
and strengthening programs, the method proposed for the rehabilitation



~ 37 -                       ANNEX II
Page 5
program shall be used (Annex III); and for road maintenance programs, different
maintenance strategies shall be analyzed to establish the optimal strategy in
the light of administrative and technical constraints. The Highway Design and
Maintenance Standards (HDM) Model may be used for the purpose of economic
analysis and for refining the road maintenance program.
16.       The feasibility studies shall comprise:
(i) field investigations and preparation of preliminary engineering
to estimate costs and benefits with an accuracy of 20%;
(ii)  an analysis of transport costs and an evaluation of the savings
and other economic benefits accruing from implementation of the
project;
(iii) an economic appraisal comparing benefits with the capital and
recurrent costs of the project; and
(iv)  tests of the sensitivity of the results to changes in costs
and benefits.
17.       Road maintenance studies shall include:
(i) definition of reasonable alternative maintenance strategies;
(ii)  the field investigations required to determine present road
conditions and the maintenance works required, including
cost estimates with an accuracy of 20%;
(iii) evaluation of the impact of these different strategies on
road network deterioration;
(iv)  evaluation of the impact of these different strategies on
road network investments and maintenance;
(v) evaluation of the impact of these strategies on transport
costs; and
(vi)  determination of cost/benefit ratios for the different
strategies, the net discounted benefit and the internal
rate of return, if possible.
18.       The detailed engineering shall include:
(i) all necessary field work and preparation of final design
to estimate costs with an accuracy of 10%;
(ii)  preparation of bidding documents and detailed design of
structures;

A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Rehabilitation Program
Justification of Individual Road Sections
A. Introduction
1.        Technical and economic studies will be prepared to establish the
technical-economic viability of each road section proposed for pavement
rehabilitation. The Government will submit to the Bank a technical and
economic study in support of its request for financing under the program. The
basic requirements for such a study and the methodology for making the economic
evaluation are outlined in the present Annex.
B. Basic Requirements for Feasibility Studies
2.        The studies shall include sufficient basic data for the Bank to
make a meaningful review, and a duplication of the calculations. This should
include:
(i) a description of the road section: location, length, present
condition, pavement structure, geometric characteristics,
deflection measurements, soil tests, age, and number of years
since latest overlay or rehabilitation;
(ii) a description of the proposed pavement strengthening and
rehabilitation works: overlay or new pavement structure,
shoulder reconstruction; drainage, realignment, widening,
and other rehabilitation works;
(iii) traffic data by vehicle type: present traffic, expected
traffic growth, axle load data and trend;
(iv) unit costs and total costs of any improvement elements, with
and without taxes, and breakdown in local and foreign exchange
costs;
(v) data on basic user costs: basis on which they were developed,
and operating costs for typical vehicles; and



- 40 -                           ANNEX III
Page 2
(vi) current and estimated future road maintenance cost of the
road section.
3.        In addition to the technical and economic documentation, the study
shall comprise in annex: all information needed to make the analysis meaning-
ful; details about the pavement thickness calculations, technical surveys on
which the proposed rehabilitation works are based, and if available, bidding
documents, description of proposed bidding procedures, proposed advertising,
etc.
C. Economic Evaluation
4.        The determination of the economic viability of an investment requires
basically two steps: first, the analysis of possible alternative improve-
ments; second, the economic justification of the selected alternative.
(a) Alternatives
5.        The Bank requires the analysis of possible alternative improvements
to evaluate proposed road rehabilitation projects. For pavement strengthen-
ing, with or without other rehabilitation works, the following alternatives
could be considered:
(i) continuing current maintenance at present levels, i.e. the
"doing nothing" alternative;
(ii) increasing routine maintenance (patching, etc.);
(iii) increasing the frequency of surface dressing;
(iv) constructing an overlay;
(v) widening sections of the road; and
(vi) reconstruction of a substantial part of the road.
6.        All reasonable possible solutions should be considered unless cer-
tain simplifying assumptions are warranted. Not all need to be evaluated in
detail. Some can be eliminated, even after a cursory examination if, for
instance, they would involve the utilization of significantly greater amounts
of economic resources than would an overlay without any proportionate increase
in benefits. The readily identifiable "do nothing" alternative shall always
be considered, while other alternatives sometimes can be omitted; for instance,
if pavement strengthening is a physical requirement, if the roadway is to
remain serviceable, increasing routine maintenance or the frequency of surface
dressing would not normally be reasonable project alternatives.



- 41 -                           ANNEX III
Page 3
(b) Economie Costs
7.        After possible alternatives have been defined, their economic costs
have to be compared to arrive at the least cost alternative. These costs fall
into three categories. The first is the direct investment (design, construc-
tion, supervision, etc.) the second is the maintenance cost and the third,
user costs.
8.        Maintenance cost will vary substantially from one alternative to
another. In a "do nothing" alternative for pavement strengthening projects,
it can be assumed that in order to maintain the road in an acceptable level
of serviceability, maintenance costs will increase rapidly over the period
of the analysis through stepped-up routine and periodic maintenance. This
is to avoid that user costs increase to a threshold beyond which traffic
diversion might occur.
(c) Economic Benefits
9.        The next step is to evaluate the benefits which can be expected
to accrue from the selected alternative improvements. Benefits for this
type of improvement are generally measured as savings in vehicle operating
costs, particularly wear and tear on vehicles and stepped-up maintenance
costs, which would be necessary to maintain an acceptable serviceability
level.
(d) Analysis
10.       All reasonable alternatives shall be subject to a separate incre-
mental analysis in which incremental benefits are compared with the additional
costs over and above the other alternatives considered. Significant improve-
ments such as widening, realignment or even construction of some road sections
must also be subject to the test of economic justification, incrementally over
and above the selected least cost alternative. Once the optimum solution has
been defined, the Economic Return (ER) should be developed as well as the
Benefit/Cost Ratio (B/C) and First Year Benefit/Cost Ratio (FYB).
