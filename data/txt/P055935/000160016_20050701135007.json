sustainability is unlikely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            1) An important factor in project success was the tested\n            organizational structure of a central emergency coordinating\n            unit (UCPFE-SUCCE) with a solid base in local emergency\n            coordination (SUPCEs), independent from the local\n            government's requirements and adequately staffed. 2)\n            Any project requiring provincial debt laws has to factor in\n            the fact that provincial governments may take a long time to\n            sign subsidiary loan agreements 3) reallocation of funds\n            within provinces and components was made easy due to the\n            fact that the provinces had entered into subsidiary\n            agreements that were larger than their initial expected\n            expenditures. 4) Competition for funds among provinces\n            speeded up the process, without sacrificing quality. 5) In\n            order for an emergency loan to be implemented quickly,\n            overall Bank financing of an emergency operation should be a\n            minimum of 60 to70 percent. This minimizes the amount of\n            counterpart funding requirements and unforeseen fiscal\n            adjustments required by the federal and local government.\n            Community Participation: the participation of beneficiaries\n            and affected parties  in planning, designing, implementing\n            and managing the project is essential to ensure a\n            satisfactory outcome of an emergency project. 7) This\n            project benefited from several supervision missions that\n            included field visits and on-site inspections. Emergency\n            loans need to be designed with a flexible implementation framework."}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
