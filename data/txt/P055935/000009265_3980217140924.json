provinces and three Cuyo provinces;\n            and ii) seven littoral provinces through additional works\n            above and beyond the Flood Protection Project.  The project\n            has been designed with two geographical components: one for\n            the six northwestern provinces and the three Cuyo provinces,\n            and another for the seven participating littoral provinces.\n            A third component is designed to strengthen the\n            administrative and technical capacity to coordinate the\n            implementation of the project.  The operation will be\n            implemented in two phases: 1) a protection phase of 12\n            months for the northwestern provinces, which includes\n            acquiring of goods and execution of works for emergency\n            river flood control; and b) a rehabilitation phase for both\n            geographic regions, which includes transport infrastructure,\n            drainage systems, education and health facilities.  In\n            addition, there is a capacity-building subcomponent for the\n            northwestern provinces to manage flood emergencies and a\n            small scale housing subcomponent for housing reconstruction."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
