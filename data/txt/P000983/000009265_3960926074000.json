while current and future reform\n            measures are implemented. The adjustment program focuses on\n            economic liberalization measures and reform of public\n            administration and public enterprises. The policy package\n            includes exchange rate devaluation, monetary and fiscal\n            policies including restructuring of the public investment\n            program, decontrol of agricultural prices, simplification of\n            tariff and customs procedures, liberalization of commercial\n            practices, and an overhaul of the banking sector. The size\n            of the public administration is to be reduced by some 15\n            percent over the next 2 years. Technical assistance will be\n            provided to strengthen economic management to permit\n            implementation of the program and improve fiscal and\n            monetary policy, public investment programming, external\n            debt management and economic data collection and use."}, "docdt": "1987-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
