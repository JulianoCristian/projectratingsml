institution,\n            the Rural Development Fund responsible for organizing,\n            managing, and supervising small-scale irrigation\n            investments. The project would be executed in a four-year\n            period and contain funds for the following subprojects: (i)\n            land development, comprising anti-erosion bottomlands, and\n            small-scale irrigation works; (ii) support to the Regional\n            Development Organizations for training, credit and input\n            supply administration and trials; (iii) credit to farmers\n            and farmers' groups; (iv) storage sheds; (v) water\n            supply; (vi) tree plantations; (vii) project management\n            offices; and (viii) funds to finance small-scale rural\n            projects to be identified during project execution."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
