RANPUR URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.     The project was the seventh urban development operation in India.  The
IDA Credit of SDR 22 million was approved on October 27, 1981 and closed on
June 30, 1987, a year behind schedule. Compared with the first such operation
in the state, the Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project (1978-82),
Bank involvement was narrowed geographically but broadened in terms of
subsectors, and was focused more sharply on improvement of housing environment
for the poor. The project approach proved effective, and was expanded to
involve more cities under the Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Project
(loan/credit equivalent of US$ 150 million) approved in 1987.
Obiectives
2.     The objectives -f the project were tot increase the supply of
serviced land to the poor; relieve the worst enviaonmental conditions, mainly
in the city center; and strengthen key urban management institutions - the
municipal government, the development authority, and the water and sewerage
board.
=mplementation and Experience
3.     Difficulties in land acquisition and in obtaining timely connection of
electricity caused delays iD. sites-and-services and slum upgrading components
(see Part 1, paras 13-15 ane 20). FinancLally, the delays and domestic
inflation, much higher than projected at appraisal, resulted in a Rupee cost
overrun of Rs. 138 million, 332 of the original cost estimate. However, due
to an even faster devaluation of the Rupee, SDR 2.96 million out of the
original Credit was cancelled.
Results
4.     The main thrusts of the project proved effective and the physical
targets were generally met or exceeded. For example, 14,892 new serviced
plots and 20,055 sewer connections were provided iis against the targets of
14,770 plots and 10,000 connections. Although land acquisition problems
limited the slum upgrading benefits to about 10,400 households compared with
the original target of 20,000 households, significant follow-up improvements
were made by the benefitting households in the improved (see Part I, paras 17
and 20-23). The institutional development component resulted in the
establishment of modern accounting systems, improved organizations in the



- titi -
three project agencies, and effective coordination among thcm (see Part I,
paras 18, 19). However, the water and sewerage board fell short of its
targets to increase water tariff and water metering (see Part 1, pars 25 and
Part II1, Table 8).
Sustainability
5.     The project's design and pricing strategies in shelter provision and
improvement emphasized appropriate standards, beneficiary initiatives, and
cost recovery to maximize and sustain the benefits. The institutional
development programs were also aimed at ensuring proper maintenance and
operation of municipal services. The project's successful demonstration of
these benefits prompted the state government to adopt the strategies for wider
application in the state (see Part I, paras 7 and 8). The failure to increase
water metering and tariffs sufficiently, however, could lead to lack of proper
maintenance and expansion of water supply and sewerage systems (see Part I,
paras 24 and 25).
Findings and Lessons
6.     The project demonstrated the effectiveness of the sectorally and
institutionally complex but integrated approach in tackling urban shelter and
service problems. Success of this project, compared with other comprehensive
urban projects elsewhere which proved difficult to manage, can be attributed
to clear focus an shelter provision and Uiprovemeat au4 ciear daiinition of
roles and responsibilities of the involved agencies. By the same token,
relative weaknesses of the project were seen in the issue of the water supply
tariff and metering, whose link with the central investment component was
tenuous, and in the delay in electricity connections, for which the necessary
institutional coordination (with the power authority) was not established
beforehand (see Part I, paras 11 and 15).
7.     The major implementation obstacle of the project turned out to be land
acquisition. As virtually all urban projects require land as the major input,
solution should be found both through careful preparation and design of
projects, including adequate compensation, and through modification of legal
procedures involved (see Part I, paras 13 and 20).

1.        This project was well conceived and executed--its principal emphasis
was on providing shelter, but there were infrastructural components as well.
Even though the project started slowly, lessons were quickly learned and
appliad, and most of its physical targets and institutional development
objectives were achieved. The Beneficiary was willing to discuss problems
with IDA and was responsive to suggestions for improvements. The project was
a useful precursor to the much larger Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Project
now in progress.
B. BACKGROUND
2.        Prior to this project, the Bank Group had assisted with six urban
projects in India and, in the specific context of UPDUP, a water supply and
sewerage project for five towns, including Kanpur and the rural sub-projects,
as shown in the following table:

3.        The Bank Group's strategy in the urban sector, as reflected in the
design of these projects, has been to support CoI's and State government's
recognition of the nead for: (a) the rapid expansion of service programs
focusing mainly on improved efficiency of the urban economy and on the needs
of urban low-income groups; and (b) the continued re-orientation of these
programs toward low-cost replicable service systems. The strategy also
focuses on strengthening local institutions by supporting their efforts to
sustain and expand their programs. The urban poor were especially targeted
under the shelter and infrastructure components.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Pro3ect Objectives
4.        The main objective was to increase the supply of serviced land to
the poor through the provision of low-cost, serviced residential and small
business plots, and to address the worst environmental conditions prevailing
in the privately-owned aehatas' and other slum areas in the central core of
Kanpur. Transfer of land ownership to beneficiaries and the phased construction
of dwellings were to be the cornerstone of this approach. The reduction and
elimination of direct subsidies inherent in the on-going minimum needs, and
other, shelter programs was to be pursued. Full cost-recovery of allocatable
costs in the sites, services, and slum upgrading components was aimed at in order
to enable replication of project features.



- 7i -
5.          The second objective was to strengthen the key institutions of
Kanpur involved in the management and financing of service delivery.
6.          The third objective was to develop a strategy for state-wide urban
development and management.

D. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
7.        The deaign of the project, and the priorities on which it was based,
reveal a well conceived approach by KDA, KNM, XJS and the Bank Group toward
addressing the problems in ganpur. Although not expressly stated in the SAR,
there is a strong indicatiov that the pr#nject was looked upon as a pilot for a
more ambitious project. This is evidenced by the development of the UPDUP
with objectives that are similar to the original project, but with a widened
scope that embraces eleven towns (including Kanpur).
8.        The great emphasis of the project was on Shelter, but
infrastructural components were not neglected and were developed on a
sufficient scale so as to ensure easy replication elsewhere, paying due heed
to lessons learned on this project.
9.        Project preparation was very thorough giving all parties concerned a
clear idea of the objectives and how they would be realized, i.e., the
planning of the shelter components was advanced to the point where detailed
drawings of the three sites had been completed.
10.       Whether or not the timing of the project was appropriate is
debatable. The project was certainly not started too early because, had it
begun earlier, some of the excellence of preparation would have been
sacrificed. Therefore, on balance the timing was appropriate.
11.       Roles and responsibilities were established prior to appraisal and
were -eIl enough understood by the principals XDA, ME and RJS, but what
really ensured th&t all worked in concert was the formation of the Project
-Monitoring Cell (PMC) and steering committee by GOUP.  This group was staffed
with experienced senior officers with strong motivation, a-nd should be
credited with successfully maintaining balance and progress during project
execution.
12.       This has been a successful project.  It has had its difficulties but
they have been minimized by the careful design of the project and by the
combined influence of PMC and visiting supervisory teams from the Bank Group.
Only one problem (of which more later) was not resolved and that was a legal
complication concerning the transfer of land ownership.
Prolect Implementation
13.       Implementation began on April 1, 1981, but took some time to develop
momentum. By June 30, 1983, disbursements amounted to US$2.3 million compared
to an appraisal target of US$ 8.2 million for that date. There were a number
of reasons for the delay, but the foremost reason was the problem of not
having enough staff to ensure that contracts were awarded expeditiously. KJS,
at that time, should have had six divisions of engineers, but had only three.
(There are now eight divisions; each headed by an executive engineer.) There
were also difficulties over land acquisition. The project had three sites in
the site-and-service components Barra, Pokharpur and Gujaini. Land lost at
Pokharpur due to litigation was finally substituted by acquiring additional
land at Barra but the process inevitably caused delay. Similar difficulties



- 5 -
&rose in acquiring land In the asatas for alum upgrading where the process of
acquisition was brought to a halt in a xmber of cases by court injunctions.
14.       The SAR correctly identified those risks and identified land
acquisitions in the ahatas as representing the main risk. The second set of
identified risks related to the capacity of the various agencies to implement
the project within the project period. The SAR pointed out that for KDA the
project vould almost double annual expenditure from (the then) current levels.
15.       Arrangements for two of the sites selected for the shelter program
included a provision for sewage pumping stations for their sewerage
discharges. The pumping stations are designed to discharge into oxidation
ponds where the sewa,e is treated. The pumping stations are, therefore,
critical links in the sewerage systems aad dependant on the supply of
electricity. In both cases, there was a long delay before the Kanpur
Electricity Supply Administration (RESA) installed t' -connection. This delay
also affected putting the tube wells into service, thec,c - delaying the
provision of water supply. Hence, an important factor in planning the
execution of constructing a sewerage system is seeing that all elements needed
to make the system function are taken into account.
16.       Toward the end of the project there was some confusion about the
term "final date for withdrawal applications". KDA was under the impression
that the date was December 31, 1987; they were informed by the Department of
Economic affairs, but not until March 17, 1988, that it was March 31, 1988;
too late to take any advantage of the respite. The lesson has been learned in
JPDUP, and should be borne in mind for projects elsewhere, that when the
closing date approaches the Beneficiary should be reminded about the situation
regarding acceptance of tenders and applications for credit withdrawals.
17.       In terms of physical targets the project has been substantially
completed. Serviced sites amount to 14,892 and have exceeded slightly the
appraisal target of 14,777. Concerning slum up-grading in the ahatas an
appraisal target of 20,000 benefitting households in 89 ahatas, reduced to
12,000 during the project as a consequence of acquisition difficulties. Work
has been completed in 41 ahatas, to the great satisfaction of all concerned.
The slums have been transformed by the provision of paved roads and paths,
small public squares, lighting, drainage, and water supply. The ahata
dwellers have responded by steadily improving their properties by adding upper
floors to increase accommodation, and by painting and decorat.ing their homes.
The improved ahatas are attractive enclaves for the people who live there and
have created a great demand elsewhere in Kanpur for the improvement process to
be extended. In a number of the ahatas work has not been completed so that
the total number of benefitting households is currently only iO,419. All the
physical targets for the other components have been achieved.
18.       Bearing in mind that institutional strengthening is a continuing
process, it can be said that the project has produced improvements in the
organizational and financial arrangements of gNM and KJS.



19.       Regarding KNK, marked improvements have been realized in the solid
waste management sector. Senior staffing has been reinforced, though very
slowly, and reorganization of solid waste collection and disposal arrangements
has begun and is continuing to proceed. Even more satisfactory is the
reduction in the number of households relying on night soil collection; where
the system of night soil collection coutinues, the methods of collection (to
collection depots) and disposal (to sewers and the sewage farm instead of
dumping in watercourses) have improved.
20.       The only major variation in planned and actual results is, as
already mndicated, in the number of benefitcing households under the slum
upgrading component. The reaso for this is that IDA was frustrated, in a
number of cases, in its attempts to acquire the land within the ahatas'
boundaries. The owners of the land on which the ahatas have developed would,
if it could be managed, evict the people who live there and redevelop these
valuable central Kanpur sites. The owners have little hope in this situation,
and many remain unwilling to sell to KDA and obtaineu stay orders and court
injunctions to prevent or delay acquisition. The above problems arose mainly
from the weaknesses of the provisions of the Slum Improvement Act, which
provided very low compensation for land acquisition   Later, in June 1986, the
Act was ameuded to speed up the litigation process. However, on the bright
side, KDA has completed improvement of 41 ahatas and, additionally, an ahata
owner has proposed an arrangement to the ahata occupants that part of the site
be redeveloped coamercially and the remainder rearranged in order to
accommodate the population of the ahata.
21.       After a slow start, the sewer connection program developjed very
successfully. It is an important program, not only because it brings the
benefits of a water flushed toilet to the connected household, but because it
also gets rid of an equal number of bucket latrines and the ensuing, very
unhygienic, operation of collection and disposal.
22.       The provision of community toilets and washing facilities in 16
locations around Kanpur has proved to be very popular and successful. Their
popularity can be directly attributed to the fact that they are divided into
male and female sections providing privacy, in clean surroundings, for a
modest payment. The facilities are managed by a single private operator
(Sulabh) who has had an operation and maintenance concession for 30 years, and
since it is also res-ansible for cost recovery, the only cost to KNM is for
water and electricity. KM4 proposes to extend this service further. The
UNICEF-supported Community Development Project was invaluable in its
assistance in the planning of public facilities and public health education.
23.       The traffic management component has also been very successful
despite the tremendous difficulties in catering to the variety of road users
encountered in Kanpur: pedestrians, handcarts, bicycles, rickshaws,
motorcycles, tempos, taxis, buses, and trucks--not to mention the large number
of wandering cattle.

E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
24.       Only in two components is there a risk that the project may not
maintain an acceptable level of benefits throughout its economic life. One
arises from weaknesses in the old sewerage system into which new sewers and
house connections discharge. These weaknesses were identified at appraisal
and relate mainly to blockages as a result of siltation from low levels of
flow. However, the new discharges will help by increasing flows and thereby
reducing the amount of sedimentation. In addition, new sewer cleaning
equipment has been purchased and an ongoing program of sewer cleaning has been
implemented. The risk mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph has been
reduced to an acceptable level.
25.       The second area of risk concerns the willingness of KJS to increase
its tariffs consistent with costs and to collect on its bills. The tariff
structure has been unchanged since 1985. Vhile general collection performance
has improved greatly over the project period, KJS has not been able to collect
arrears forcefully from nationalized industries; and in turn JS was
withholding payment of Rs 615 to the power authority on account of a pending
litigation. This lack of enforcement among public sector bodies suggests the
need for GOUP to evaluate and clarify the inter-agency accountability. It
will be a good use of the modern accounting and auditing systems established
in MNM, KDA, and UJS during the project.
F. BANK PERFOKMANCE
26.       The efforts of Bank Staff made in Kanpur and GOUP were appreciated
and the implementing agencies have recorded the value attached to the
constructive criticism they provided. In particular, Bank staff helped by
suggesting ways of streamlining the process of allocating sites in the shelter
program. The Bank Group supervision missions visited Kanpur on nine occasions
during the period from 1981-1987. These visits were evenly spaced, but the
weight of effort was applied in 1983 (June/July) and 1984 (April) when about
552 of the staff time devoted to supervision was allocated, compared with
about 372 for the first two years of project execution. This reflects the
Bank's recognition of the slow progress made in the early phase of the project
and the strength brought to bear to effect a successful correction.
Additionally, project officers were frequently in India on other missions
during the project period. It has been suggested that if IDA had been made
aware of the project officers movements, arrangements could have been made to
meet in Delhi or Bombay to discuss the current project problems. This may
have been a guarded ind. ation that supervision missions should have been more
frequent. However, had the3e meetings been possible, the short discussions
could have provided a "second best' alternative.
27.       The history of events suggests that the main supervision effort
should have been made in the first two years rather than in the middle of the
project. But this reflects the tendency to economize on supervision rather
than on the staff involved.



28.       Overall, the appraisal was well done, the project was carefully
designed, and the risks were identified correctly.
G. BENEFICIARY PERFORMANCE
29.       The Beneficiary showed a willingness tot  (a) discuss problems
affecting all aspects of the project; and (b) identify solutions and act on
them. There was an initial period of slow progress owing to land acquisition
problems (shelter) and lack of staff (XJS) that caused the construction
program to slip.
30.       Reallocation of the workload brought improved performance: for
example, in the first two years of the project, only 35 sewer connections had
been made. RDA took over responsibility from the heavily commaitted KJS for
this executive function, and in the following 18 months, 6,000 connections
were made. By project completion, about 20,000 connections had been made
against a target of 10,000. It took two years for KDA to reach the required
operational pitch, but once momentum had been developed satisfactory progress
followed.
31.       A feature of providing serviced sites (and one not confined to
Kanpur) is the practice of providing all the services for all sites before any
buildings are started. Capital is thus tied up long before it is necessary to
do so. In contrast, a phased development program would allow cost recovery on
housing (and commercial property) to offset servicing costs progressively
throughout the development of the whole site.
32.       The main lessons to be learned from the Benefic':ary's experience
ares (a) the need for accurate assessment of the staffing levels needed to
complete detailed designs and to supervise execution of physical works; (b)
the importance of streamlining the recruitment process so that staff
vacancies, in particular those at senior level and newly created positions,
may be filled expeditiously; (c) to try to determine at an early stage, that
is not later than appraisal, the need for legislative action; and (d) to
coordinate the activities of all the concerned agencies (for example, with the
electricity authority so that power is available for new installations such as
tube wells and sewage pumping stations).
33.       Maintenance of the capital works provided under the project is
variable. The highly visible traffic management works are generally in good
repair. On the other hand, maintenance of the sewage pumping stations and the
sewage treatment plants (where embankments to the tanks are suffering from
settlement and erosion) is unsatisfactory.
H. PROJECT RELATIONSHIPS
34.       The relationship between the Bank, the executing agencies (KDA, KNM
and RJS), the State and National governments were good throughout the project.
There was a concerted effort by all concerned to make the project successful.

I. CONSULTING SERVICES
35.       Consultants were employed for the principal tasks of conducting
studies for Resource Mobilization and for Institutional and Financial
Strengthening. These studies were completed satisfactorily by 1982 and their
recommendations had been substantially adopted and introduced by 1984/5. The
few recomuendations that were not adopted were of lesser importance. As a
result of these studies, there was a simplification of Octroi Tax procedures
and amendmnents to property tax administration. In addition, accounting and
management infonmation systems, project cost accounting, collection systems,
and internal control for management were all put in place.
J. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION ADD 'DATA
36.       Thi legal documents were based on similar sectoral projects and
posed no problems during project execution. The SAR is a well prepared and
comprehensive document and has provided a useful framework for every component
of the project. Data was readily available for the compilation of the PCR.
It was, however, prepared on the basis of the previous PCR Guidelines and so a
sifting process has been needed.

PART II
BENEFICIARY'S COCKETmS
1.        Part I of the PCR has been reviewed by the Beneficiary; the comments
were incorporated in the text and also attached as an Annex at the end of this
PCR.
2.        The Beneficiary reviewed Part III of the PCR and returned it;
modifications were incorporated.
A. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
3.        The successful implementation of KUDP has been possible because of
the coordinated efforts, financial support, technical guidance and
encouragement the implementing agencies have been receiving all along from the
Bank's mission members who have visited Kanpur during implementation. During
these helpful visits, important discussions and decisions were made as
recorded in the various Aide-Lemoires.
4.        Under the guidance of World Bank missions, site allocation
procedures were improved. People were called once for signing legal
agreements for title of land/house. Possession was given at the same time
along with Bank Pass Books for payment of installments.
5.        A request was made for the Bank to grant two one-year extensions,
but only one was granted. Due to complexity in acquiring slum ahatas, the
component was moving slowly. We believe that the target of 12,000 households
(BHHs) could have been achieved by granting another year's extension.
6.        It was felt that the project was tightly framed and any major change
could affect the project agreements. All the lengths, widths and numbers were
recorded in the legal agreement and it was not possible to modify it according
to actual requirement in the project. In the future, it is therefore
suggested that a more flexible approach be adopted by making use of a program
of works rather then closely defined items. This approach was adopted in the
follow-up project of UPUDP IDA Credit 1780-IN.
B. BENEFICIARY'S OWN PERFORMANCE
Government of tUttar Pradesh
7.        GOUP has extended full support to this project both in terms of
providing financial support and by removing whatever difficulties were
experienced during execution. Technical support was accorded whenever needed



- 11 -
by the Town & Country Planning Department of GOUP; a project monitoring cell
was created at Kanpur and was responsible for monitoring and evaluating the
project. A senior officer from Town & Country Planning Department was
available for guidance and for monitoring progress of the project.
8.        Project status reports were prepared and submitted monthly and
quarterly, and state-level monitoring was done quarterly.
Kanpur Development Authority
9.        RDA was the main agency for this project and was responsible for
execution of the following:
(a)     sites and services;
(b)     slum upgrading; and
(c)     sewerage.
10.       XDA's performance was quite satisfactory as is clear from the
expenditure and achievement results. KDA was also responsible for
coordinating, monitoring and extending guidance, where necessary, to other
institutions implementing this project. For this, it created a project
monitoring cell (with full-time project monitoring officers) to prepare
reports, issue guidance to all concerned, and arrange meetings when necessary.
11.       IDA substantially completed the project within the project period.
It has carefully monitored and coordinated the activities of other
implementing agencies and acted throughout as the directing agency.
12.       KDA implemented the shelter component successfully.  However,
problems were faced in acquiring ahatas for slum upgrading components. For
this reason, the size of the component was reduced from upgradation of 20,000
to 12,000 households. Even during the improvement of the ahatas, the stay
orders from different courts were received which affected the progress of the
component. In some ahatas, a stay order was received after the upgrade of the
slum, thus adversely affecting cost recovery.
13.       On the basis of 'pay and use,' the public toilets and bathing
facilities were constructed with the help of Sulabh International by RDA and
were finally handed over to KNM. This has improved the environment and was
appreciated by the public.
14.       IDA also executed work on the sewerage and sewer connection program
on behalf of 1JS, and the drainage work on behalf of KNN.
15.       IDA was also the intermediary for transferring funds and loans
between the State Government and the executing agenciess Kanpur Nagar
Mahapalika and Kanpur Jal Sansthan.

lemur Jal Sanethan
16.       RJS was entrusted with the task of providing water supply to
upgraded slum areas. RJS also carried out a leak detection survey in the eity
with the help of Indian Institute of Technology; the project also provided
some sever cleaning equipment.
Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika
17.       MNM was responsible for implementing the following components of
IUDPt
(a)     Solid Waste Management;
(b)    Maintenance;
(c)     Traffic Management Measures; and
(d)    Drainage.
18.       The following paragraphs describe the institutional role with
respect to each of the above:
(a)    Solid Waste Managementt City cleansing is one of the most
difficult operations that a municipal corporation has to
perform. The Solid Waste Management component helped the
Institution systematize its operations considerably. On
the recoamendations of the consultants, and at the instance
of the World Bank, the City Cleansing Department was
created to improve the collection and disposal of garbage
and night soil with the help of an additional fleet of
trucks, tippers and loaders, construction of pail depots,
and conunity latrines.  Painstaking efforts were made to
introduce new techniques in primary collection system, such
as the use of the tricycle rickshaws with bins etc.
(b)     Maintenances Maintenance of civic infrastructure is one of
the primary responsibilities of XNM. Maintenance standards
were improved immensely by switching from the traditional
methods to the use of mehinized equipment such as the hot
mix plant and paver finisher unit for road maintenance,
hydraulic ladders for maintenance of street lights, and
sewer jetting machines for cleaning the sewage system.
This has resulted in operational ease and safety in
maintenance works. It has made a visible impact on the
civic life of the city and has helped KNM handle the
oceanic task of maintenance. Institutional efficiency has
stepped up considerably.
(c)      Traffic Management Measures:  About 12 percent of the
developed area has been allocated to roads in Kanpur.
Insufficient road spaces and the tremendous growth in urban
population have resulted in various types of traffic and
transportation problems in the city, necessitating the need
for a traffic engineering department. The timely



- 13 -
introduction of the Traffic Engineering and Management Cell
(TTMC) was created to address these problems exclusively.
This department played a key role in identifying and
redressing some of the most critical traffic problems by
liaising with the various concerned departments to effect
better inter-departmental coordination and create a new
environment in traffic management and transportation
planning in the city.  Based on the success of TEMC in
Kanpur, the World Bank strongly recommended it be made a
permanent feature of MNE and also be replicated in the
other million-plus cities of Uttar Pradesh. As of now,
UPUDP has five TEMCs created in all the KAVAL towns and
start-up funding has been done in UPUDP to begin traffic
management work in each of them.
(d)     Drainages  The city is crisscrossed with a number of major
drains (Nalas) that carry surface run-off, domestic and
industrial waste, and also sewage in some cases. This
component dealt in desilting the Nalas, their remodelling,
and laying of underground pipes to improve overall drainage
facilities in the city. As a purely civil engineering
work, it was supervised by the regular engineering staff of
KNK and no separate division was created. However, the
implementing agency was guided by the consultants' report
on drainage in the planning and design of its works.
Improved drainage facilities are reflected by the reduction
of water-logged areas, flooding, and overflowing in Nalas.
Conclusion
19.          The experiment of an IDA-financed project in Kanpur may be said
to be a successful venture on the part of all concerned. It has provided
shelter to 25,000 families, benefitted more than 500,000 people in one way or
the other, and has created employment equal to about 8 million man-days. This
has paved the way for improving the quality of civic life in Kanpur and has,
in fact, made a marked dent on the problems of cleanliness, traffic
congestion, housing, and sewerage and drainage systems in the city on the
whole and, in particular, in the areas where the project was designed to be of
help.

SUsJECT:      INDIA - Kanpur Urban Development Project
(IDA CR Noll85-IN)
We have received the following conmments from our authorities on draft
Project Completion Report on Kanpur Urban Development Project for incorporation in
the final PCRs-
*(A) PCR refers to legal complication concerning transfer of land
ownership under the Slum Upgradation program (para 12), related issue concerning
weakiesses in the provisions of Slum Upgradation Act (para 20) and proceeds to
recommend determination of the need for legislative action by appraisal (para 20).
While some problems were faced in the enforcement of the Slum Upgradation Act,
amendments were carried out to make redressal through litigation less time
consuming (amendment in section 17(1) of Act date June 11, 1986 refers) w.th a view
to more effective implementation of the slum upgradation program.
(B) Para 25 of the PCR relates to the cost recovery concept increase
in water tariff by RJS and reported non-compliance. A reference has also been made
to outstanding dues from nationalized industries to KJS as also outstanding dues to
v3S to the Power Authority which has been commented upon as "as lack of
accountability among public sector* and has led to the suggestion for evaluation
and clarificatioi of 'hidden and de facto subsidy system' by Government of U.P
Implementation of tariff restructuring was delayed due to litigation. The tariff
was revised from October 1, 1985 and recovery improved considerably thereafter KSJ
had generated revenue to cover 100? maintenance and debt service by 1983-84. This
has also been brought out in the SAR of UPUDP. As regards recovery from
nationalized industries by UJS, there was no delay in the issue of recovery
certificates by KJS to collect dues from the industries. However, since the actual
implementation was delayed due to litigations this led to non-payment of dues by
KJS to the UESA. Thus there was no question of any hidden subsidy of any sort.
(C) Para 13 of PCR refers to inadequate staffing as responsible for
delay in implementation Government of UPUDP reports that the six Divisions in RJS
were always headed by Executive Engineers, three in the three different zones of
the city and remaining three in charge of Plant, Civil Works and Establishment.
Thus there was no problem of staff in KJS during any point of time.*
