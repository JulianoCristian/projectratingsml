The provisions for dam safety are believed to be\n            the most detailed ever undertaken for a major dam.  A wide\n            range of safety features are provided: 1) access to road\n            systems from either bank; 2) a comprehensive communication\n            system; 3) emergency power supplies; 4) an integrated\n            reservoir flood regulation plan; 5) emergency response\n            planning; and 6) a flood emergency response system.  In\n            addition, stability testing in the event of earthquakes was\n            undertaken.  Resettlement planning and management takes into\n            account not only the population directly affected by the\n            project, but also the population in the areas receiving\n            resettlers.  Studies of resettlement include: economic\n            effects; preferential policies; housing, amenities, and\n            public services; social and cultural aspects; grievance and\n            complaint procedures; safety net; and transport capacity for\n            relocation.  The cultural heritage is being preserved by a\n            detailed comprehensive archaeological exploration,\n            classification and salvage program that will locate, recover\n            and protect important underground and surface relics and\n            cultural treasures in the inundated area.  To ensure public\n            health, programs have been set in place to prevent\n            communicable diseases common in the study area such as:\n            malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis,\n            paragonimiasis, and sanitation-related enteric diseases\n            including dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid."}, "docdt": "1993-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
