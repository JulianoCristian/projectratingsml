Xiaolangdi is the\n            first large-scale multipurpose dam project in China to use\n            only international contracting and construction management\n            procedures. Many of the difficulties experienced in\n            implementing the new system were caused by the relative\n            newness of economic and enterprise reform in China. The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) In implementing a project of the\n            magnitude and complexity of Xiaolangdi, implementation will\n            be greatly assisted if there is an implementing organization\n            in place at the outset of the project that is commercially\n            independent and has full decision-making authority and\n            responsibility for its performance. 2) Prior to the start of\n            construction, construction management personnel should be\n            trained in contract administration and modern project\n            management techniques. 3) Improved communication among\n            various parties should be actively pursued from the outset,\n            to avoid misunderstandings that could cause delays and/or\n            losses to the project. This is also an issue of\n            communicating ideas and concepts across international\n            boundaries of training and culture. 4) Development of\n            project management systems should also commence before\n            construction in order to manage construction more efficiently."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
