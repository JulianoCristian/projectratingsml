XIAOLANCDI MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
(SUMMARY OF EIA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1            The Xiaolangdi Project is a uajor multipurpose dam and
reservoir project which has been the subject of environmental assessment
extending over six years by a team from the Yellow River Conservancy
Commission (YRCC) supported by 88 Chinese experts and also by an International
Panel of Experts appointed to make inputs on dam design and safety factors.
The results of this work are reported in 22 specialist reports and an EA
Report of considerable length and complexity. The EA Executive Swumzary
(attached), in itself is a substantial document.
1.2            This covering note has been prepared to provide a. focus on the
key findings of the EA and to point to those sections of the EA Executive
Summary where further relevant information can be found.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Objectives and Background
2.1            The primary objectives of the project are: (a) flood control
in the Yellow River; (b) sediment control; (c) power production; and, (d)
water supply for irrigation, urban and industrial development. Supplementary
objectives include eco-restoration in the reservoir area and promotion of
aquaculture.
2.2            The Yellow River bas the highest sediment concentration of all
major rivers of the world because of the higb and continuing massive erosion
of the Loess Plateau upstream of the Project area. Downstream silt deposition
has progressively raised the river bed and greatly increased the hazard of
flooding in the highly developed downstream region, which has been a very
serious problem for over 2,000 years.
2.3            A system of dikes and training works along both banks has been
developed for flood protection; however the dike system is very precarious
because the river bed is raised 3-10 meters above the surrounding urban and
agricultural areas. It is increasingly difficult, dangerous and costly to
continua raising the dikes because of foundation and structural safety
problems. Prior to the 1950s, there were several breaches in the dykes and in
the 1938 breach 890,000 people were killed and 12.5 million were made
homeless.
2.4            The project will significantly reduce this problem and provide
safety, economic and social benefits to an estimated 100 aillion people,
mostly farmers living in the lower Yellow River basin. It will achieve this
by increasing the level of flood protection for the 97 million people living
outside the dykes from 1-in-60 years, at present, to 1-in-1,000 years after
completion. However, there are at present three million people living within
the dykes and downstream flood detention basins for whou the present level of
protection is only against 1-in-2 year floods. The dam will increase their



-2-
protection to between l-in-7 years and 1-in-50 years. People have been living
inside the dykes for 500 years and have limited options to migrate elsewhere
since the population density is 800/km2 in most areas within a 1,500 km
radius.
Project Description
2.5            Design and Construction.  The damsite is located on the Yellow
River. approximately 40 km upstream of the city of Luoyang, Henan Province.
The site is 130 km downstream from the Sanmenxia Dam, and 115 km upstream from
the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Bridge at Zhengzhou.
2.6            The project consists of the dam. flood release and silt
discharge structures, and water diversion and electricity-generating
structures. The dam is a 154 m high rock-filled structure with irner blanket
and inclined loam core. Total reservoir capacity is approximately 12.65
billion en. Fifteen tunnels will be developed: six for flood release; three
for silt discharge; and, six diversions for electricity generation. All 15
tunnels are located in the rock mass of the river banks. The tunnel intakes
are combined in a single intake tower. A normal spillway and an emergency
spillway are also located on the left bank.
2.7.           The maximum discharge capacity of the reservoir is 17.000 3/~s.
The hydroelectric plant is subterranean and bas an installed capacity of
1,800 M1 with a long-term average energy output of 5.4 billion kWh. Total
investment required from all sources for the project is in the vicinity of
Y 11 billion.
2.8            The construction period is eight years with river closure
occurring at the end of the flood season in the fourth construction year. The
flood control objective will be achieved in the seventh year. Two turbine
units will operate during the seventh year, and four additional units will
enter operation in the following year.
QRerat£ions
2.9            The reservoir is designed to be operated in a unique way to
manage the special silt problem mentioned above. The reservoir will be
operated on an annual cycle designed for Ostoring clear and discharging suddy'
water. Beginning in early July, the reservoir water level will be drawn down
and regulated to discharge silt-laden floodwaters until late September. From
October to June, the water entering the reservoir, containing a relatively low
sediment load, will be stored and regulated for irrigation, water supply,
electricity generation and control of river ice-jamming which is another
serious hazard closely related to flood control.
2.10           To optimize sediment deposition in the reservoir, the water
level will be regulated initially at the minimum head for effective power
production and then increased at a rate of 3 m per year. This will trap most
of the coarse sand, while most of the fine silt will be discharged. After
about 20 years of operation, the design sediment dead storage capacity will be
filled. The water level will then be dropped during the course of each year



-3-
to flush out accumulated sediments, and thereby maintain the reservoir live
storage of 5.1 billion m3. The high flushing flow volumes of 20 to 24 billion
m3 per year will *limit downstream sedimetitation so most of the silt will be
discharged to the sea.
2.11           The 5.1 billion m' effective storage of the reservoir will be
used primarily for flood control and regulating water and silt. The reservoir
can control floods with a return frequency of 1,000 years magnitude, and limit
the flow in the lower reaches of the river to within the control capacity of
the existing dikes. By using reservoir storage effectively, the large runoff
now being lost to the sea during the flood se&son may be used for irrigation
and other beneficial uses, especially to meet urban and industrial growth
needs. Over the first 50 years of operation, it is estimated that the
Xiaolangdi Reservoir vill reduce downstream siltation by approximately 7.8
billion tons and eliminate tne need for further raising of the dikes.
2.12           Section 2.B of the Executive Summary provides further
information on design and operation of the dam.
3. PROJECT BENEFITS
3.1            Flood and Ice Control.  The major benefit is that the project
will achieve effective control of frequent serious and dangerous flooding of
the entire lower basin occupied by some 100 million people. This critical
need has existed for centuries, and has progressively become more and more
critical as population, urbanization, agriculture and industry bave all
markedly increased in recent decades and as the lower basin's levee protection
system has been made increasingly vulnerable by river siltation. The total
net discounted benefits of flood control and ice flood control are
conservatively estimated to amount to about Y 3.83 billion (Us$ 733 million)
over a period of 50 years, not counting the value of human lives protected.
3.2            Silt Reduction.  The net effect of the project will be to
stabilize the downstream river bed for at least 20 years and after 20 years,
the dam will be operated to more effectively flush silt to the sea. This will
defer the cost of raising the dikes and the economic benefit has been
estimated at Y 1.06 billion (US$ 203 million).
3.3            Irrigation. Urban and Industrial Water Sunplies.  The total
area which may be supplied by irrigation water is over 33 million mu (2.2
million ha), a substantial increase over the 5-10 million mu which can
presently be irrigated with supplies available from the Yellow River. In
addition, it is expected that the downstream urban and industrial demand of 4
billion m3/year by the year 2000 will be fully satisfied by the reservoir.
The net discounted benefits are Y 3.92 billion (US$ 750 million).
3.4            Surface and Groundwater Balance. The improved surface water
supply will permit reductions in groundwater withdrawals to be progressively
applied, hence reducing current over-exploitation. This benefit is not
quantified.



-4-
3.5            Electricity Generation.  The total installed capacity of the
hydroelectric plant is 1.800 KW with an average annual energy output of 5.4
billion kWh. This power will enhance economic development in the region. It
will also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The net discounted
benefits are Y 3.7 billion (US$ 710 uillion).
3.6            The total discounted economic benefits amount to Y 12.52
billion (USS 2.4 billion). The total discounted cost is Y 8.67 billion (US$
1.66 billion) including the cost of construction of the dam, resettlement and
re-establishment of livelihoods of 181,000 people, upgrading host communities
of about 86,000 people, environmental management activities and operations and
maintenance costs for the project. The economic rate of return is 17%.
4. PROJECT ALTERNATIE
4.1            The main alternatives which have been considered in the past,
and the reasons for their rejection are :
(a)   Raising the dikes to control a 1,000-year flood - this option is
very costly and would involve considerable uncertainty due to
structural weaknesses of the dikes. it would not reduce sediment
deposition in the lower reaches of the River;
(b)   Constructing reservoirs for flood control and sediment management at
potentially suitable sites far upstream including Qikou and Longmen
- this will regulate downstream flooding and sediment deposition and
reduce some long-term river channel buildup of sediment but would
not provide flood protection or lower reach sediment regulation and
stabilization;
(c)   Implementing large-scale conservation and rehabilitation measures in
the huge and barren Loess Plateau to reduce sediment generation at
source - this cannot solve the massive erosion problem in the
foreseeable future. In some regions, the Plateau is eroding at a
rate of 8-13 mc a year, and the dry climate there is not conducive
for growing vegetative cover. The cost of these measures will be
twice the cost of the Xiaolangdi Dam and will not give any flood
protection;
(d)   Constructing an emergency flood channel parallel to the existing
river course - would require relocation of 700,000 to 930,000
people, disrupt irrigation, communication and transportation
facilities, and present many difficult technical problems;
(e)   Modifying the existing river channel configuration, or creating a
new channel, abandoning part or all of the existing channel - this
would have the same effects as option (d). It would require
resettlement of up to 500,000 people and give no sediment control in
the lower reaches;
(f)   Undertaking large-scale warping (i.e., diversion and settling of
sediment outside the river channel) at various locations - this



-5-
would reduce sediment transport and deposition but would not provide
direct flood control, would not be effective until large reservoirs
are constructed upstream and would require resettlement of about
900,000 people;
4.2            On the basis of flood control, sediment management and costs,
the Xiaolangdi Project is the only project which will furnish excellent flood
protection and sediment control with a minimum amount of resettlement of
people.
5. BASELINE DATA
5.1            The Environmental Stud hrea (ESA) extends for approxi-ately
1,000 Im along the Yellow River, from the Sanmenxia Dam upstream to the
estuary and delta at Bohai Bay. This was divided into three areas for EIA
study purposes: (i) the reservoir area and surrounding region upstream to
Sanmenxia Dam, (ii) the lower river reaches, and (iii) the estuary and delta
regions.
5.2            The baseline data for all three areas is discussed extensively
in Sections 3.A-D of the Executive Summary. The following relates
specifically to the reservoir area and surrounding region.
5.3            The reservoir area extends along 130 km of the Yellow River
valley. The main stream of the River through this stretch is deeply incised
with little floodplain development. Eleven tributaries enter this section of
the river.
General Characteristics of ESA (Reservoir and Downstream Region)
5.4            Climate. The climate is warm temperate with cold dry vinters
and wars wet summers. Average annual temperature is 10-15-C and annual
precipitation is 600 mm. Droughts are common. Air quality in the reservoir
and surrounding area is generally good although suspended particulates due to
dust blown in from the Loess Plateau are high.
5.5            Geograpft. The area is bounded by mountains to the north,
vest and south, which change gradually to hills towards the broad floodplain
of the lower Yellow River to the east. Almost half of the area has a gradient
over 25-. The east-west axis of the Kuangkou anticline passes through the dam
site. Seismic zones have been Identified for the area and earthquakes of
magnitude 5 on the Richter scale have occurred in the reservoir area.
5.6            Mineral Resources. The mineral resources of the region are
significant including valuable reserves of coal. bauxite, copper, iron and
building materials. The reserves most affected by the reservoir will be coal,
bauxite and iron pyrites.
5.7            Sails.  Loess makes up the majority of the soils found below
1,000 m elevation. These very important agricultural soils are comonly
slightly alkaline with only 0.5-1 percent organic matter.



-6-
5.8            Water Oualitv.  Surface water quality is generally good, even
though the River has an exceptionally high silt load. There is some localized
pollution, due mainly to mining enterprises, with minor contributions from
agricultural runoff and domestic sewage. The shallow and artesian groundwater
in the area is recharged by rainfall, and is generally suitable for drinking.
5.9            Flora and Fauna. The location of the region near the northern
edge of the warm temperate zone plus the variable geography results in
terrestrial plant communities which can be relatively complex and diverse.
Locally however, there has been a long history of settlement and cultivation,
and the natural vegetation and diversity have been greatly diminished. The
diversity and abundance of wild animals are very low throug)hout the region.
Waterfowl are diverse, but populations are low.
5.10           Aquatic Resources. Riverine aquatic habitats are generally
poor, and aquatic communities are marginal because of the very high silt
content in the river. Significant fishery habitat is mainly located in the
tributaries. Fisb is not a significant part of the local diet, and fish
production, including aquaculture, represents only 0.2 percent of agricultural
income in the lower basin.
5.11           P2p_lat1on.  The population of the reservoir and surrounding
area is about 2.4 million people, approximately 181.000 of whom live in the
reservoir backwater area and will be relocated under the development plan.
Agricultural families comprise 90 percent of the population of the ESA and
over 92 percent in the area to be flooded. The main agricultural crops are
cereals and cotton. Overall agricultural productivity is low. Azmual per
capita agricultural income in the region is about Y 346.
5.12           Public Health. The main public health problems identified
include malaria. diseases related to agricultural practices (such as
Brucellosis), encephalitis-B, diseases carried by rats. sanitation related
diseases, waterborne intestinal diseases, and endemic fluorosis caused by
cooking with the high-fluoride groundwater.
5.13           Archaeological Values.  A detailed archaeological survey
identified over 100 cultural relics and historic sites in the area to be
submerged. While none of these are classified as protected by either the
State or the province, some of the items are regarded as precious resources
for research on architectural and art history. There are also many important
cultural resources in the area surrounding the reservoir.
6. EPIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
6.1            Although the EA covered all environmental aspects, four issues
were identified as being of critical importance: (a) dam stability and
safety, (b)  resettlement, (c)  cultural heritage; and, (d)  public health.
The findings on these are summarized in the following sections.



- 8 -
that both resettlers and host communities affected: (a) will not be
disadvantaged by the Project; and, (b) vill share in the project benefits.
6.8            To achieve objective (a) for resettler families: (i) the
resettled families will be re-established in a new location where the house,
yard and amenities will be at least as good as the family's previous
situation; (ii) the family's new earning potential will be at least as good
as previously; and, (iii) the family's expenses and loss in income in making
the transition will be duly recognized and accounted and compensated for.
6.9            Section 4.C of the attached Executive Sumary assesses the
potential for these objectives to be achieved by reviewing provisions and
proposals in contiection with; economic effects. housing, amenities and public
services, and social and cultural effects. The conclusions of that review are
summarized as follows.
6.10           For Resettler Families
(a)   Economic Effects. Adequate compensation provisions have been made
beginning with generous cash compensation for all matsrial assets.
Since the continuation of an agricultural lifestyle is likely to
only maintain current incomes (rather than increase them).
additional non-farm jobs would be made available to ensure that
Incomes are at least maintained and probably increased. The
successful relocation of rural people from the three most affected
counties will be completed early to accommodate them. Care bas been
taken not to overestimate potential crop yields in resettlement
areas, since this would have tended to reduce the areas of land
allocated to resettlers. Early action bas also been taken to
complete agreements between resettlers and host villages;
(b)   Preferential Policies.  Consideration is now being given to
introducing preferential policies for rural resettlers and hosts
including special status for scarce farm inputs, direct free market
sales of farm products, training, exemption or reduction of grain
quotas. priority for jobs in rural enterprises, subsidies and tax
exemptions.
(c)   Housing. Amenities and Public Services.  The availability of these
services will be better than prior to moving (60 percent of the
floor space of existing housing of the 181,000 resettlers. is in
caves which are characteristically damp and commonly a cause of
rheumatism);
(d)   Social and Cultural AsRects. Almost all resettlers and host
families are Han Chinese and no ethnic problems are likely. Host
resettler families surveyed were aware that they will have to move,
and although contracts have been signed between townships few had a
firm concept of the specifics programs involved except those who
would be resettled within the next few years. In order to minimize
the social dislocation impact villages will be moved as a whole
group so as to avoid separation from village neighbors. The main

Dam Stability and Safety
6.2            Dam Safety.  This issue was the subject of extensive analysis
by the YRCC and an International Panel of Experts (see Section 4.B of the EA
Executive Summary). The assessments of and provisions for dam nafety are
believed to be the most detailed ever undertaken for a major dam. A wide
range of safety features are provided in the project design including: (a)
access road systems are located so that, if access to one bank is interrupted,
access to the other bank will be maintained; (b) a comprehensive
communications system will be provided, including microwave and radio; (c)
emergency power supplies are available; (d) an integrated reservoir flood
regulation plan has been prepared, to utilize all reservoir capacities to
minimize flood hazards under extreme flow conditions; (e) emergency response
planning has been completed to account for possible failure of the coffer dam
during construction; (f) a Flood Emergency Response System has been
established and is operational in the lower basin and elsewhere.
6.3            Stability During Earthquakes.  The mass of the dam may
increase the risk of induced earthquakes in or near the reservoir area.
Because the damsite is in a region prone to serious earthquakes, dam safety
has been given particular attention.
6.4            Extensive studies were undertaken by the YRCC inrluding
geological mapping of the area, a thorough review of reservoir-induced
earthquakes within China and abroad, and detailed earthquake probability
assessments. These studies led YRCC to conclude that the potential maximum
magnitude of induced earthquakes subsequent to flooding of the Xiaolangdi
Reservoir is between 5.5 and 5.6 on the Richter scale.
6.5            Based on a consensus between YRCC and the International Panel
of Experts the dam, embankments and intake tower have been tested by modelling
for stability during a postulated earthquake of magnitude 6.25 on the Richter
Scale with a hypocentral distance of 10 km and a corresponding horizontal peak
acceleration of 0.5 g. The results indicate that the dam, erbankment and the
intake towers would not be endangered under these conditions.- The seismic
design of the dam is considered to be fully consistent with the best state of
the scientific knowledge on these aspects.
Resettlement and Re-astablishment of Livelihoods
6.6            Resettlement planning and management represented a major
effort in planning and management that outweighed the rest of the
environmental studies program by an order of magnitude. Section 4.C of the
attached Summary provides a full account.
6.7            A total of 181,000 people will require resettlement from the
reservoir area and a detailed plan has been prepared to be carried out in
progressive stages. Account has been taken not only of the populatici
directly affected by the project (i.e. the people displaced by inundation),
but also the population in the -areas receiving resettlers, which w11 be
indirectly affected. The two main objectives of the resettlement plan are



D                                             -9g -
concern is that the move should result in an improved standard of
living, especially given the opportunity to switch from agricultural
to non-agricultural livelihoods.
6.11           For Host Families
(a)   Economic Aspects.  Although there will be some loss of agricultural
land there will be improved irrigation and access to non-farm j3bs.
This will result in increase of incomes for host families;
(b)   Infrastructure and Public Services.  The analysis showed that the
resettlement program will supplement the existing infrastructure and
services to accommodate the increased loadings without loss in level
of service. In most cases the new infrastructure will improve
living standards for the hosts;
(c)   Social and Cultural AsDects. Surveys indicated that about
70 percent of the host population were aware of the proposed
resettlement plan. The majority of these indicated that the program
will have significant effects on their livelihoods, and about two
thirds seemed willing to accowficJate the resettler families. The
indication is that the socio-cultural impacts will be acceptable
provided that the host villagers are not made worse off
economically.
6.12           Other aspects provided for in the resettlement program
include:
(a) Grievance and Complaint Procedures. A mechanism based on the
Village Committees. which represent the villagers independently of
the regular government structure, is provided. If a matter cannot
be resolved at the Village Committee level. procedures are nrovided
for referring the mntter to the local government and, subsequently,
to higher government levels as needed up to the provincial level;
(b)   Safety Nets.  If resettlers or hosts are unsuccessful in achieving
satisfactory income levels, they will have recourse to a special
Reservoir Area Support Fund, which guarantees minimum incomes if
farm or non-farm livelihoods fail to meet their minimum needs.
Applicants to the Fund will be referred through the village leader
to the County Resettlement Office. This Fund will remain in place
until Ministry of Water Resources (MUR) deems that the Xiaolangdi
resettlers and affected hosts are no longer at any particular risk;
(c)   Transport Caoacitv for Relocation. This has been a problem on other
resettlement programs and special provision has been made to ensure
that there will be adequate transport capacity for moving resettler
families from existing to new sites.
6.13            Implementation of the plan is already under way for resettler
families in the construction area; of the 10,500 people (2,330 families) in
this area, some 1,730 (384 families) representing 16.7 percent of the total



- 10 -
have been moved to host villages in the construction camp vicinity. By the
end of the year 1992, it was planned that 30 percent or 3,150 people will have
been moved. An inspection of the 384 family situatior made by.a World Bank
mission in October, 1992, including discussions with the resettlers, indicated
that the resettlers were quite satisfied with 'YRCC's management of them thus
far.
6.14           The resettlement plan also makes provision for monitoring and
reporting. Special reporting forms will be completed by resettlement
personnel at township or village level, and submitted to provincial and
municipal resettlement bureaus. These will be submitted to the YRCC
Resettlement Offtce and enclosed in the construction progress reports
submitted by supervising engineers.
6.15           YRCC will engage qualified social scientists to conduct
individual evaluations of resettlers' socioeconomic progress. This service
aims at evaluating, and reporting on, the level of living conditions and
social services of the affected population, both before and after
resettlement. The evaluation will be done annually.
6.16           In summary, the project resettlement and re-establishment of
livelihood plan is judged to be the most detailed and competent yet developed
for a major dam project in the developing world, and it is believed that, with
continuous periodic monitoring the plan will be successful as is already seen
in the 384 families resettled so far. Based on the plan, none of the
resettlers or hosts will be disadvantaged.
Cultural Heritaq&.
6.17             The Yellow River runs through the 'Cradle of Chinese
civilization, and archaeological relies are plentiful throughout the river
basin, especially in the main population and farming areas of the middle and
lower River reaches but less so near the daosite.
6.18           A detailed comprehensive archaeological exploration,
classification and salvage program has been undertaken to locate, recover and
protect important underground and surface relics and cultural treasures In the
inundated area. To date, work has focused in the area of known and important
sites, and priority has been given to those areas which will be flooded first.
There will be more tim available to complete the required work in the host
areas and the inundated areas at higher elevations.
6.19           The most important underground relics and sites include the
Yangshao and Longshan relics of the New Stone Age plus other city sites. tombs
and kilns of the Shang Dynasty. Important surface relics include carvings,
statues, temples, grottos and buildings from various dynasties, including the
Tangdi Temple in Henan Province.
6.20           The EIA team, together with their government counterparts with
expartise in the subject area, will aonitor the salvage and curation of these
archaeologic relics. The overall budget for the archeological detection and



salvage program makes provision for exploratory borings, excavation and
relocation and reconstruction.  The archeological relics protection program is
on schedule, and all critical tasks will be completed within budget and
according to plan.
Zmblic Health
6.21           The pre-:.lent communicable diseases common in the study area
include malaria, encephalitis. hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis, paragonimiasis,
and sanitation-related enteric diseases including dysentery, hepatitis and
typhoid.
6.22           The project will markedly change the hydrology of the Yellow
River through the creation of a reservoir, and providing an opportunity for
increased irrigation of the surrounding and downstream agricultural areas.
These changes will modify the ecological conditions for vector-borne diseases
such as malaria and encephalitis, and for communicable diseases such as
dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid. Inundation of the reservoir area will aiso
force the mass out-migration of disease-bearing rats, possibly resulting in an
increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever in the surrounding area and
population. The influx of construction workers will increase the risk of both
insect-borne and sanitation-related enteric diseases in the vicinity of the
construction and host areas.
6.23           The public health vector control and sanitation progrms to be
implemented are summarized as follows:
(a)   Halaria.  During the construction nhase, medical screening of
construction workers for caz-^.s of malaria (as well as other
contagious diseases), and routine spraying of construction site
buildings and breeding areas to control mosquitoes will be
mndertaken. The EA report recommended that mosquito control be
carried out using Bacillus thuringiensIs serovar lsralensis (Bti),
which is a biological alternative to chemical insecticides.  During
the operation chase disease prevention to be undertaken in both the
reservoir and irrigation areas comprises periodic medical checks of
the affected population to determine malaria incidence, and periodic
monitoring of potential mosquito breeding sites for anopheline
larvae to determine the need for special control measures. Special
control will include spraying to control anopheline larvae, habitat
modification wbere cost-effective. and medical prevention and
treatment programs.
(b)   ElstobitiJis. The encephalitis control program is similar to that
for malaria, except that different mosquito species are involved.
(c)   Heuorrha-ic Fever. Rats are the principal vectors of hemorrhagic
fever. The prevention and control program to be implemented during
the construction and operation stages consists of: (i) destruction
of rodents in the area inundated prior to inundation;
(ii) monitoring rodent density and the incidence of hemorrhagic
fever in the control area ln the year prior to inundation; and,



- 12 -
(iii) monitoring after inundation, and applying rodent control and
medical treatment as required.
(d)   Sanitation-Related Enteric Diseases.  Enteric diseases will be
controlled by hygiene, provision of clean water and adequate
sanitation facilities at the construction site. Contract documents
will require construction contractors to comply with relevant
provisions and the Environmental Management Office will monitor
compliance. In resettlement areas, clean wv&ter and adequate
sanitation facilities will be provided in the host areas and
villages for controlling enteric diseases.
Other Forms of Impact Analyzed
6.24           Other forms of impact analyzed included: fisheries (in-stream,
aquaculture, estuarine and coastal); water quality; land accretion in coastal
areas;  inundation of physical resources;  landslides in the reservoir;
reservoir seepage; reservoir area clearing; rare species and special
habitats; wetlands; and, global environmental issues. The analyses showed
that the adverse impacts on these aspects of the environment will generally be
small and/or controllable. Some forms of impact (e.g. on greenhouse gas
emissions) were assessed as being positive.
7. EiIRONMENTAL MANAGEKENT PA
7.1             A salient feature of the recommended environment protection
program is implementation of an Environmental Management Plan, fully funded
through the project. The Plan includes provision for an Environmental
aunagement Office (EKO) which will have lead and coordinating responsibility
for implementing all needed environmental protection measures including:
(a)   Management of continuing periodic monitoring for assessing the
actual effects of the project;
(b)   Planning and implementation of needed correction measures identified
through the monitoring program; and,
(c)   Preparation of routine periodic reports (and special reports. when
needed) for distribution to concerned Cove_ment Agencies and to the
Bank.
7.2             The present Xiaolangdi EIA team will form the core staff of
the EMO and will assist in the transition period to get the Office fully
functional as expeditiously as possible.  The EHO will make appropriate use of
the resources of all concerned Covexnment Agencies including participation in
monitoring and needed correction measures.

8. OVERALL ASSESSMENT
8.1            The Xiaolangdi Hulripurpose Project, as planned, represents a
sound economic-cum-environmental development project for the Lower Yellow
River Basin. It furnishes critically needed flood protection for the highly
developed lower basin vith its 100 million people who have been plagued by
floods for centuries. The flood hazard has been progressively increasing to
now very serious levels due to continuous siltation.
8.2            The project will also control and arrest silt deposition in
the lower reach for a period of 20 years during which many river control
structures can be developed to protect the dykes.
8.3            The project provides many subsidiary economic benefits which
should markedly enhance socio-econouic conditions in the lower basin region.
The proposed environmental management plan, when implemented, should offset
any significant adverse environmental effects.
8.4            Especially significant in overall assessment of the project is
the detailed comprehensive attention given to the issue of resettlement,
representing a pioneering approach for major dams in China and in Asia by
which it is proposed that all possible effort is being made so that no
resettlers or hosts will be disadvantaged and that most resettlers will
significantly benefit from the project.

INTRODUCTION
A. PURPOSE OF TllE PRojECT AN M    1S CRMCAL NEED
1.1       While the Xiaolangdi Project (XP) is a major multipurpose dam and reservoir project. it is
unlike many such prnjects in that. in addition ito coimbining flxd control. power production. water supply
for irri"atihn and urbarlindustrial develtopment. it addresses the very serious problem of silt deposition
in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The River has the highest sediment concentration of all major
rivers of the world. and lack of contrul of heavy sedimentation in the lower river basin has seriously
impeded beneficial river use and cump ounded flood hazards for hundreds of years. Hence. the Project
will provide both river water and sediment control t o furnish safety. ecoinomic and socioeconomic benefits
tto some 70 million pei)ple. nkmstly farmers living in the ltower basin (Table 1.1: Maps 1.1 and 9). The
XP is designed to protect downstream populations. settlements. farms. and infrastueture from the hazards
of disastrous floods that have plagued this region for centurirs, to achieve a major expansion in
downstream irrigation, to generate sufficient electric power toi make a major contribution to meeting the
energy needs of the lower basin. to furnish additional water supply for suppxrting urbanization and. -
industrialization and for enhancing estuarine ecology. to contribute significandy to expanding downstream
-aquaculturc. and tu. furnish selected enviromnental enhancement measures. In spite of the proZblem of
...>.         resettling approximately 1 8t .050 people. the XP will not result in any significant adverse environmental
effecs or unmitigated losses. pnrvided the Envirnnmental Management Plan (EMP) is implemented as
delineated in Chapter 5. The primary heneficiaries of these improvements will be ordinary. mostly rural.
peniple.
1.2       The Project is b6th unique and critically neeed btcause of the special circumstances of thet
Yellow River basin. As already noted. the River is the muddiest major river in the world because of the
high and continuing massive erosion of the Loess Plateau upstream of the Project area. While the Yellow
River has only one twentieth of the flow volume of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River. it carries about three
times as much silt on an annual basis. about 37.000 grams per cubic meter. This heavy silt ltad results
in significant deposition in the lower reaihes of the river, which progressively raises the river bed and
greatly increases the threat of fltxding in these reaches.

F                                       B. ALTERNATIVE TO PR()JELT
1.5        Over the years. many serious alternative pnripsals have been put foirward tla reduce the
hazards of flotoding and to reduce sediment deposiition alotng the lotwer reaches oif the Yellow River.
Seven feasible alternatives were consilered. prsiented in Table 1.2. as fillows:
(a)    Raising the dikes to L'Ofllr il a 1.000-year Ihod.
(h)    Constnas inti reservoirs tivr t.- .:nn cnrul and seliment management at la t leneflvl suitahle
'C  rsites including Xiaolanjdi and Longmnen.
(c)    Implementing larg=es;cale conservation and rehlabilitation meax'ures in the Loess Plateau tol
reduce sediment loss and transport tn the miiddle reaches of the Yellow River.
(d)    Constructing an emer"ency llnod channel parallel ito the existin; river course to .;hninate
majoir tinolding utf law-ling are.LL
(e)    Moldifving the existing river channel configuratiln. *r creating a new channel. abandoning
part torall of the existing chimnel.
If)    Undertaking large-scale warpin" (i.e.. diversion and settlins of seliment outside the river
channel) ftir managing sediment at Small North Main Stream froim Lnngmen toi ToIngguan.

= . C. 
*                  i 1g) .........g   Importing water fro m the Yan;tze River. and using the clear water to scour the channel.
1.6        Each pnrje;t alternative po sesses significant shtmrtocmings due to tect.hnical dir speratdimnal
difficulties:
(a)    Raising the dikaes to contnrl lloolding (Alternative A) is not a satisfiaorv long-term solutiin
since it would be very costly. would involve considerable uncertainty due tos structural
weaknesses of the dikes. and would not reduce sediment deptosition in the lower reaches of
- the River.
(b)    The operation of reservoirs fo;r flood contr;l and sediment management (Alternative B) will
regulate downstream loo%xding and seediment depisition. but maagement of water tlow alone
will not reduce long-tern river channel buildup of sediment and related flooding.

(d)    Construction of an emergency filood channel (Alternative D). or nmolifying the existing
channel configuration (Alternative E) would necessitate Lhe relocation of millions of people.
disrupt irrigsion. communicatiun and traportation facilities, and present many diflicult
technical problems, including intensive maintenance of the new and existing dikes. It would
probably also prove to be unacceptable for social. environmental and political reasons.
(e)    Large-scale warping (Alternative F) wiuld reduce sediment transprt and deposition in the
lower reaches of the river. However, it would not pnrvide direct floxxl :ontrol. and wobuld
nmi me eflective until large reservoirs are constructed upstream. Warping can he indluced
only by furnishing a high head with water and sediment under conrol. Large-scale warping
at Wenmengn Floodplain and Small North Main Stream can only he carried out effectively
after completion of Xiaolangdi and Longmen Dams.
(t)   Importing water to the Yellow River (Alternative G) will help solve water shortage problems.
but not the flxxling problems. Such importation may eventually take place but. win'i
competing demands for water for municipal. industrial and agricultural uses. it is unlikelv
that water can be allocated fir sediment flushing.
1.7-      While none otf the Projet alternatives on their o wn can soilve the flooding problem over the
long term. a combination of some of them. when implemented in a logical sequence. can resolve the flod
L     an sediment deposition problems over the long period,.say 100 years r so. The approch to reducing
flooding and dqepsition in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. which is considered most feasible 2nd
effective; involves the csrution of one o!r more resevirs with sufficient storage cApacity such as
Xiaolangdi and Longmen.
., ...-  -.:.
4i k  1.8       These alternatives with their advantages and disadvantages aresummarized in Table 1.2. On
the basis of flxol control, sediment managemen and ansts. the Xiaolangdi Pnrject is dearly the p'eferred
r .-'***  . altenative because it conirols 92.5 percet of the drainage area and almist 100 percent of the inflow
sediment load. It is the only pnrject which will furnish both excellent flood protection and sediment
contnrl.
C. HL%rORY OF EIA STUDIE;
1.9       The first Environmentl Impact Assessment (EIA) Report on the Xiaoilangdi Project. including
22 supporting special repotns. were prpared in 19$6.(EIA S1) in order to qneet.the requirements of
China's National Environmental Pnrtetion Agency (NEPA). The work was carried out by a Yellow
River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) team supported by 88 Chinese expers from various research
ins titues and universities. In Mari 1986. the results of the initial assessment were approved by NEPA.

1.10             In October 1989 when China requested project financing with the objective of
appraising the Project. the World Bank (WB) provided an outline of its retquirements lir specific
environmenial work necessary prior to prnject appraisal and loan approval.i/ Add itional requested
environmental work was carried out the fiollowing year. and the initial environmental assessment with
supporting special reports was prepared in English-
I . I I          In OLtober 1990. revisions t) these documents were undeenaken by the YRCC EIA
Tcam in order to prepare for the World Bank rwiject appraisal. This woirk was carriel out with the
advice and assistance of the consulting rirm. CIPM Yellow River Joint Venture (CYJV). which had been
selected by the Chinese government andE WB to assist YRCC in preparing the feasibility study. lThis     >
eflfit was further assisted by an Inernational Panel or Experts established by the Yellow River Water  N. j
and Hydroelectric Power Develtpment Corpo ration (YRWHDC). and also by guidelines provided by WB    . - -
missions in 1990 and 1991. Successive draft EIA documents were produced by the EIA Team and
reviewed by WB micsions in April. June and October 1992 (EIA 12. 13 and .14. respectively). The
present document (EIA f5. November 1992) incorporates the suggestionsc of the lasct Bank m.ssion and
is intend f tar the appraisal stage of the WB project cycle. This iterative process. in addition to
prdxlucing the EIA document. has resulted in valuable training and transfer of technology to the YRCC
EIA team-
1.12             The EIA studies have been carried  out in parallel with other aspccts of the Xiatlanadi
Project planning process. The present EIA dacument corresponds to) the current stague of feasibility
assessment and the World Bank's appraisal phase (of the project cycle.

addititnal 320 man-menths of professional input. This audit wa. invaluable to the EIA Team for
assessing ihe etectLs ot Xiae'Iangdi.
1.16             Because ot the importance of the involuntary resettlement issue in the overall
Xiaolangdi Project. a spe'cial team  was ovfganized foir working exclusively in preparing the rel cation and
resettlement plan. This involved inputs of approximately 9.952 man-mtnths hv Chinese professionals.
who workede closely with the EIA team. This resettlement plan represents a pioneering effnrt. since it
is the first time a major dam and reserv.ir pnrject in China has had a resettlement plan prepared as an
integral part ot' itS feasihility study.
1.17             Because the Xiatilangdi Project is of great imptortance for the continuing development
of the lower Yellow River basin. including consideration of earthquake stahility. sedimentation.
involuntary resettlement and enviroinmental effacts. YRCC appointed a panel of distinguished international
-     experts to review, evaluate and advise on the work being conducted in these areas. The International
I.    Panel of Experts. in addititon to specialists in the fields of dam construction. hydraulics. sedimentation,
- economics and resettlement. included an Envirunmental Specialist whio contributed approximately 2 man-

I. 19             The Xiatilangdi EIA  Team  undendxlk an inventory and description of the
environmental c nmponents potentially alfeeted by the project. including:. (i) natural physical environment:
(iil natural biological environment: (iii) economic development resourcesm. and (iv) quality of life values
such as public health. cultural reso)urces. and archeological and hisiorical sites and mLonuments. It
screened the Project against these envininmental cimponents in order to identify pkitentially critical and
sihnificant issues. using a broad matrix of project a.tivities aOainst environmental ctmpoinents. Onee the
critical issues had been identiried, specialists in relevant fields prepared detailed matrices otf cause-elfect
relationships producing impacts potentialiv critical to the Project. The Project's impact on each
si-nificant environmental issue was assessed in terms of its magnitude and importance. Where possible
and aplprpriate, the EIA has taken full advantage of experience from the Sanmenxia Prnject located
130 km upstream. which has been in operation ft;r some 30 years. especially as a primary source of
informatiton tin the magnitude and imptrtance of prtbahle environmental impacts ftrom the Xiaolang-di
Pro,ject.
1.20              Where required. prliven and feasible environmental provection measures tEPMs) have
been proposed for mitigating adverse impacts. and fuir offisetting unavoidable adverse impacts. Each of
the measures proipoised has been deceribed, and an estimate oif iLs cotm and scheduling prnvided fior
inclusion in the srpecifications and tender documents and in the overall Project loan.
1.21              Stome otf these protection measures will be implemented during the ProJect's design
and construction stages. and others as parL of the Pnrject oiperatioin. An example of the foirmer is
environmental. socioieconomic. and resettlement haseline monitoring. Measures to be implemented in
the con%LruCti0n and operation stages include monitoring to ensure compliance with constraints specified
in the EIA and to prnvide data necessary fior implementing needed additional environmental protetion
measures.
1.22              An important result of the EIA process has been the development of an overall
Environm-mntid Mana-ement Plian (EIMP). In addition to defining the scotpe. detail. hu --et and scheduling
t;r miti-ation and ofttting menasures. the plan calls for the estahlishment of a Xiaolangdi Project
Environmental N'anagement Ofhice (EMO) with responsibility ftir monitoring the implementation of all
essential envirt3nmental protection measures. and ftor planning addititonal measures needed fir mnonitoring
purposes.
1.23              The EIA of the Xiaolangdi Project is intended to contribute to the planning and
implementation tof the overdll Project. and to assist in attaining its multipurpose objectives in an
environmentally acceptable manner.  In sto doing, it will contribute significantly to the sustainable
development o f the Yellow River basin in its lower reaches.

XIAOLANGDI PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-  -                                           A. OVERVIEW
2.1       The Yellow River is the second largest river in China. It is very flood-prone in isL lower
reaches because of heavy silt deposition. which has required scontinuing raising of the dikes untif they are
now 3-5 meters ab.ve adjacent land levels and. moreover. further raising of the dikes is nn longer
feasible because of structural foundation problems. Dike breaches occur 1:5 years. and about 1.6 tinns
of silt enters the estuary annually.                                  J
2.2       The overall Xiaolangdi Project comprises components for achieving its main objectives o f
flood control. irrigation. and power generatiod; and a group of supplementary measures for mitigating
! I    or offsetting the Project's potentials for gererating adverse envirtnmental effecss. The system of
strultural works includes the dam. a reservoir. the power plant. the irfigation system and a water supply
system.
2.3       Annex A includes a satellite view of the dam site/reservoir area. together with a drAwing oif
a typical dam section and some photos taken at the dam site. Maps 1. 1.1. and 1.2 show the project
location.
B. MAZIN PROJECr COMPONENTS
Deswription and Constructiom Schedule
2.4       The proposed site of the XP dam is on the Yellow River, approximately 40 km upstream of
. .    the city of Luoyang. Henan province. The site is 130 km downstream from the Samnenxia Dam. and
115 km upstream from tie Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Bridge at Zhengzhou. The Dam cat.hment area
is 694.155 kmn7, or 92.3 percent of the Yellow River basin. The Xiaolangdi Reservoir is situated between
the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River. in an ideal location to control 5ilt and water flow from
the major portion of the draze basin. The dam site selected is the only one possible downstream-of
Sanmenxia to offer a large reservoir and flood control capacity.

2.11              In order tu optimize sediment deposition in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. the water level
will he regulaied initially at 205 m. This is the minimum head tor elTective generation of electricity.
The reservoir water level will he increased gradually to 254 m at a rate of 3 m per vear. In this wav.
the reservoir will trap most of the cxoarse sand. while most of the fine silt will he discharged and flushed
into the sea. After about 30 years of operation, the designed sediment storage capacity will be filled: and
the reservoir water level will then be dropped to 220 m in order to scour and flush out accumulated
sediments, and thereby regain the reservoir storlge and regulation capacity. In the flkxoi season. the
reservoir level will he controlled at 230-254 m to regulate the runoff and sediment in the downstream
river course. The reservoir waler level will he 230-254 m. This method of operation will make the .-
Xiaolangdi Reservoir much more effective for reducing silt than the Sanmenxia Reservoir. When
Sanmenxia was built. the water level was raised to an excessively high level soon afier completio-n.
resulting in the trapping of both coarse and fine sediments. in the rapid filling of the reservoir with
sediment, and in the loss of its water storage capacity. Consequently, the Sanmenxia Dam and its
olperation had to he redesigned: and a major reconstruction effort wras required to install special tunnels
to flush out the accumulated sediments.
2.12              The 5.1 billion in effective storage of Xiaolangdi Reservoir will be used primarily
b{wr fltxo cLintrl and regulating water and silt. The reservoir can control floods of up to 1:1.000 vears
magnitude. and limit the flow in the lower reaches of the river to not more than 22.500 mels. which the
existing dikes can effeLtively control. By using reservoir storage eflectively. the large runoff now being
ltost to the sea during the floMK, season may be used f.or irrigation and other heneficial uses. Over the first
50 vears of tperation. the Xiaolangdi Reservoir will reduce downstream siltation by approximatelv 7.8
billion to ns. corresponding to no siltation in the lower reaches fior 20 years. and thus eliminate the need
for further raising of the dikes. It will also promote scouring of downstream sections.

A .><;   2.15             Because of the potentially serious consequences of dam failure subsequent to an
earthquake, the Xiaolangdi Dam has been designed to resist the maximum quake predicted fwr the arma.
1t is important, however. to be ab)le to predlit these events before they occur. and the Prnjeat thereforc
calls for the establishment o#an extensive mocnitoring network for this purpxose. together with careful
plnning for prompt response actions in the event of any emergency situations. These prnvicions are
reviewed in some detail in Chapter 4B.

2.16             Because the XP will relocate involuntarily 181.050 people, the Project includes s
special resettlement and rehabilitation component planned to meet 17 specific resettlement criteria, *f -
which three are of fundamental importance. The first criterion is that the population involuntarily
resetted should not only maintain its current standard of living. but should also share in project benefits.

issue tlo prijeLt feasibility. and to planning, Iair the elcteive reestahlishment tof the livelihoi.s and housing
of' those affected. has ILed t1o the initiation of resettlement studies over 20 years ago. Resettlement
planning involves 13 counties (or county-level cities) in Henan and Shanxi Prnvinces. with 8 located in
the reservoir area. and 5 hnst counties located adjacent tto the Yelliow River. downstream of the dam site.
The planning now involves the aetive participation nf YRCC. and the leaders and a-encies at the
provincial, municipal and county levels.
-.19           'Severai surveys otf the pipuption. land anid structures tt he inundated were
undertaken in 1959. 1970. 1980. 1982. 1985 and 1989; and dhe latest revisins were carried lout in
September 1991. Preliminary resettlement plans were prepared in 1985 and 1989: and the mtist recent
resettlement plan foir September 1991 was- submitted toi the State Plannin- Commission (SPC) and the
Ministry tf Water Remsurces .MWR) tir- fI;rmal review and approval.
2.20              The 1991 population survey estimates indicate that the total poppulatior to he affected
hv the XP is 159.971. composed 9.799 at the dam site construction area and 150.172 in the area tui he
inundaLted (El. 275 m). Of this. 144.759 people have an agricultural registration and 15.212 have a

2.23              The reservoir area inundated is essentially rurAl and agricultural. and is composed
of small groupings of rural residences. housing 100400 peoiple each. Severil *f these residential clusters

elsewhere in China. 17 resettlement criteria were develiped by YRCC in conjunction with local
governments for the Xiaolangdi Project:
(a)    The population subject to resettlement should nut only maintain its Lurrent standard of living.
but should also directly share in pmrje  benefits.
(b)    The resettlement transition period should be minimized. and adequate support of hoth a social
and econon.ic rnaure provideJ during the transition period.
(c)    Resettlement should achieve complete social and economic reestablishment of those
dislocated, on a viable productive basis, through the creatiomn -of project-funded new
industries. service-sector and agricultural employment and activities.
(d)    Insofar as changes in occupation are necessary. occupational replacement opportunities should
properly rewognize the social. communal, cultural. educational and vocational profile of those
affected: and any such changes in economic Activity should he introdueed on a voluntary
basis.
(e)    Resettleent of the agricultural population should be land-hased wherever possible.
i          (f)    Land-sharing with host villages should be based on the principle of mutual acceptance. w1
should be planned so as to provide higher incomes (from all sources) for resettlers and hosts. 
> (g,) Resettlement plans should have broad-based popular acceptance. and the affected population
should be consulted.
(h)    Relocation distances should be minimal, and opportunities for resettling people in groups and
> :; -0communities should be provided.
(i)    House plot and dwelling size allocation at new town and village sites should ensure improved
standards and conditions.
-) 0  Resettlement plans for towns. villages and enterprises should minimize the loss of existing
agricultural lands.
(k)    Resettlement plims should have adequate institutional arrangements to ensure effective and
timely implemeniation, and adequate monitoring ind evaluation arrangementF

administrative villages. The new sites include NOth housing and adjacent agricultural land.
2.27               (a)  BaEic Ag ricullural Pridutticon Scenario.  There are two hasic prodluction
models proposed fur agricultural resettlemem: dnland (i.e.. rainfed) farming scen:rio. and partially
irrigale.d fatrming scenariu. The minimum per-capita requirement ftr household consumption is 225 k-
grain per vear. and these are maintained in lbth scenarios. The gtial ftr bIoh resettlers 'ind hossts to be
selt-sutticient in grains is thus achieved. sti that they may go 4on t o grow multiple cash crops *r set up
other small-scale husiness activities.
2.28               The amount u  f land requisitioned for agricultural resettlers differs according to
conditions in each host village. For example. to allow fitr population increase before resettlement takes
place. a minimum area t'f 1.0 mulresettler is recommended flir rainfed agriculturAl situations where small
husiness activities (referre  w as "sideline" income) can supplement land-based farm income. Where
sideline income possibilities are limited. more land is required to provide the necsmsary per capita incoime.
For irrigated areas. 0.5 mulresettler is the minimum prnvided.



-21-
: 2.29           'The hasic objective of agricultural resettlement planning is to increase per capita
income of both the resettler and host communities by 5-10 percent. in real terms. compared with that
hetire resettlement. Considerahle amnounts of money and land must he prtwided. and diversificatimn
developed. so that the previous individual income levels are maintained and increased.
2.30              The overall agricultural planning for the reservoir area shows that the requisitiined
cultivated land toitals 183.281 mu: the agricultural people to he resettled total 153.906; the agricultural
joles total 63.601: and the c.>.npensation Mur agricultural livelihixwos is estimated to he Y 670.0 million.
On average. tile cultivatefd land -allocation will he 1.2 mu per resettlers and Y 10.534 per agricultural joh.
respectively.
2.31              (bI Noinagricullural Production Plaining. With the large number of resenlers
created by the XP. it is not possible ftor all agricultural resettlers toi continue their livelihoiods in'
agriculture. Tow provide enough jobs fi;r resettlers and increase their inctme.%. 8.973 reseulers will woirk
in eight enterprises. Their planned investment ittals Y 107.0 million. representing Y 12.224 per worker.
One in 15 reseatlers will thus he engaged in nonagricultural enterprises.
2.32              In addition. the agricultural status of 17.210 hamily members of government
employees relocated will he transferred to the nonagricultural status. These, family members will he
employed by the Sotvernment unit where their family member wvorks, by the local labor department. n r
by private businesses. Investment ftor this will total Y 72.74 million. A funher two in 15 resetlers will
thus be engaged in nonagricultural enterprises. resulting in one member of every agricultural family
resettled heing engaged in nonagricultural income.
.;;          2 .33            . @) Residential Planning r ar Villages. Currently. the rurAl village housing ai*:upies
;X!    14.912 mu. or 0.12 mu per capita. The residences and cave dwellings have adequate tlxor space. of
26.7 m: per capita. but the construction quality is older and the sanitary conditions are pooir. Caves
acxtunt for ahout 30 percent of the floxr space of residences.
2.34              The new residential areas f r resetlers were selected jointly hv the Reconnaissance
Planning and Design Institute of YRCC. and the counties. xi:--s and affected villages. A total of 276
host sites were selected. A total oif 53.787 people from 12.205 families will he moved downstream to
68 host sites on the Wenmengtan plain and- further downstream: 55.386 people will move to new xiangs
within the same ouLnty at 117 host sites: and -29,886 people will mxve-back  away from the reservoir
perimeter within the same xiang to 91 host sites. Most of the selected areas are located along the
houndiries between two or more administrative villages. so that the land-sharing ratio between resetters
and hosts is minimized. The new sites will prxovide suitable agricultural land and adequate drinking water
fotr both people and livestock. rnad access. power and communications. and stable geological cindlitions.

2.35              Based nn present water ctnsumption tir human and live,ctock use. the water use
standard will be 60 liters per day. Water supply sources will include -roundwater and surface water from
small reservoirs.
2.36              (d) Planning r4ir Towns. The largest alieLted population centers are referred to as
lowns. which serve as government senrice centers ftor xiangs and large administrative villages. Most of
the II towns inundated are situated in vallevs or plains where the natural soil conditions are favorable
li;r agriculture. and where transport facilities are available.  They furm the administrative, economic and
cultural centers in the local regions. and play an important role in the local economy.
2.37              Of the II towns. 10 towns have average populations of 1.000-2,000 people and
I ttown contains apprniximately 5.000 peopile. The tatal ttown population inundated is 24,865 peoiple; and
include 17.413 havin- an agricultural status and 7.452 having a nonagricultural status.
2.38              One tovwn will cease toV exist and i;s population will be dispersed among the other
Itns.nc A seoind town will becoime a xiang seat. The remaining nine towns will be relocated but will
retain their present administrative function.
r
2.39              The average hasic town population size will remain the same, and the flooir space per
capita for buildings at the new site will he the same as that of the old site. Infrastructure will he
somewh. improved for such itemLs as streets. power supply. water supply and sewers. etc.
2.40              (e) Infruriructure Planning. Infr4tstructure inundated by the reservoir includes
roaads. transmission lines, communication line,-. bradcasting facilities. factories. mines. No. 4 Prison of
Henan Province, water supply woirks, hydrology stations and other special itemns.
2.41              Factories and mines and special facilities will he compensated and rebuilt according
to their oriinal standards. Amkng the 93 fa.tories and mines inundated(1991). 65 will tranrsfer to other
products. 26 will he rebuilt in newv places. and 2 will cease lto exist.
2.42              The arterial highwavs will be rebuilt to the same grade&with the same quality of
mateials as before. New residential areas will bI> srviced with simple roads. Wharves and ferries
around the reservoir will he rebuilt, enlarged or renowv-' as each location warrantS. Every village will
be serviced by electrical distribution lines. Telephone lines and broadcasting facilities will be guaranteed
to every village. Water supply and drainage facilities will be provided fior every village.
2.43              (f) Dam Site Construction Zone Resettlemen. 'The land to be requisitioned for
the dam site construction area includes land occupied by the main works of the dam Project. borrow

areas, disposal areas, wirk areas. and camp areas tbr housing construction personnel. Investigations
carried out in 1990 show that the construction sites cover a total area of 33,500 mu, of which 20,083 mu
is farmland. A total population of 9.769 people will be affected as a result of the construction of the
Project.
2.44                The resettlement planning shows that 7.330 of the total 9.769 resettlers (1991) from
the dam  site construction zone will remain in agriculture (75 percent) and 3.146 people will gio to
nonagricultural ct.il;lovmenw (25 percent). Roughly one of every two labourecs will earn a nonag-ricultural
incume.
2.45                (g) Resettlement Schedule and Cost Estimate. Construction zone resettlement is
being carriedt out during 1992 - 1994. Resettlem#t wile carried out during project construction in three
stages. Resettlement will precede inundation. and is scheduled to proceed pro"ressively as impoundment
causes the reservoir level to rise. The first resettlement stage is in Ehe zone below El. 180 m. fnrm 1994
to 1997: the second fnrm El. 18,0 to 265 m. from  1998 to 2001: and the final from El. 265 to 275 m.
fronm 2001 to 2012 (Table 2.3).
2.46                The total cost of implementing the resettlement program will he Y 2.150 billion. and
has been approved by MWR. The cost for rural resettlement is Y L .A05 billion (61 percent of the total)
29r Y 5.060 per.eita on the avecoje  Theust for newk housing is Y 505.9 million, an .average of

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY AREA
A. OVERALL ENVIRoNmNTAL STUDY AREA
.3.1      The overall Envirunmental Study Area (ESA) subject to significant impacts frnm the
Xiaolangdi Project is shown in Map 2. It extends for approximately 1.000 km along the Yellow River,
from the Sanmenxia Dam t) the estuary and delta at Bohai Bay. This overall area is divided into three
areas for EIA study purposes: (i) the reser0oir area and surrounding region above the Xiaolangdi Dam
up to.Sanmenxia Darr.. 1ii) the lbwer river reaches. and (iii) the estuary and delta regions.
1B. REIERVOIR AND SURROUNDING ARtEA
3.2       The reservoir and surrounding area ex.ends along 130 km of the River valley and adjacent
hills'and mountains, from the Sanmenxia Dam tO the Xiaolangdi dam site (Map 2. 1). The main stream
OTf the River through this stretch follows a narrow. deeply incised valley, with little floodplain
development. Some floodplainc are located at the mouths of several of the II tributaries that enter this
section of the river. The main stream current isast. and silt content is high. Hydrogeology of the
reservoir vicinity is shown in Map 3.
3.3       The climate in this region is that of a warm temperate zone and continental location. with
cold and dry winters and warm and wet summers. Avenge annual temperature is 10-15C. depending
ot the lcal geography. More than half of the 600 mm annual precipitation falls in mid- and late
-summer, and severe storms are common. The highest recorded rainfall was 600 mm on July 16. 1958.
Flooding from run'L in the rainy season. is a major concern. lTe measured annual evaporation rate is
twice the average annual rainfall. so that the area is also very susceptible to droughts. In one reservoir
area Jiyuan City. there have been droughts in 21 years over a recert 22-year period-
3.*       Air quality in the reservoir and surrounding area is oDmmonly within the applicable Chinese
standardi. Suspended particulates can be somewhat high due largely to dust blown in from the Loess
Plateau, and to dustgenerated localli from agricultural operations. This is particularly evident in the drn
season.

3.5       Given the importance of flow dynamics in the Yellow River to De economy and hun
security in the lower Yellow River basin, extensive monitoring and analysis of surface water hydrology
in the main stream and tributaries has been conducted, resulting in observed and synthetic data covering
a complete time series for over 70 years. With a total catchment of over 750,000 kinW, the Yellow River
discharge is approximately 43.2 billion m', with 1.6 billion tons of silt in an average year (1919-60
series). Over 60 percent of runoff and 80 percent of sediment occur in the rainy season (Table 3.1). lile
runoff entering into the lower reaches is 45.59 billion ml/year and silt is 1.5 billion tons/year. lhe
- -      runoff and siMl at Lijin hydrology station are 38.78 billion m'/year and 0.987 billion tons/year,
respectively.

3.6       The catchment of the: River above the upstream end of the proposed reservoir is
approximately 688,000 km'-,-orf.5 Ip.rcet of the total Ydlow River watershed. At this point, the River
still has over 1.O000ki 6touavelto the sea: The River and tributaries in the reservoir area contribute
some 5,800 m' of catchment with a mean annual rumff of 0.56 billion m'. The ratio of peak to
minimum river flow over the year is approximatey 3.2. Extended periods have occurred when die
annual river flow has been approximately 20-25 percem  higher or lower than the norm.
3.7       Flooding is related primarily to rainstorms. Detailed flood data are available. Sediment Icad
is highest in flood season and has been increasing. with average highs of 45 kgIn'. The maximum
sediment content recorded was -941 kg/rn' (flood peak amount 9,870 mls, at Xiaolangdi Hydrology
Station, on Augtust 7, 1977). Tbe dynamics of erosion and sedimentation in the entire Yellow River
watrshd have been studied carefully. and are sumnarized in Section 3.2.4 of the main EA.rporL
3.8       The reservoir and its surrounding area are bounded by mountaius regions to the north, west
and So, which change gradually to bills to die broad floodplain of the lower Yellow River to the esst .
he east-west axis of the Kuaqgkou anticline passes through the dam site. Tne nothen dam abutment
and hydralic structures will be located on the northern flank of the antidine, while the southern abutment
will be on the anticlines south flank.   - .    -   ; ;

3.9       In the Cenozoic era a number of major and mino r faults owcurred in the project area.
Seismic zones have been identified for the area and earthquakes of magnitude 5 (in the Richter scale have
occurred in the reservoir area. The dam site area has a seismic intensity level of class 7. and a maximum
horizontal acceleration of 0.215 g.
3.10             Less than 5 percent of the reservoir and surrounding area is relatively flat. and only
14 percent has a gradient between 3 and 15. Almost half of the area has a gradient over 25' (Table

3.11             Study o f surface geology has enabled potential hank collapse and landslide areas to
be identified. The most seriosn of these are lucated between Hedi Wnd Lingshang villages near the
Banjian river (Map 15). Loes with a relatively high day content makes up the majority of the soils
found below 1.OO m elevation. These very importani agricultural soils are commonly slightly alkaline
with only 0.5-1 percent organic matter.
3.12             The shallow and artesian groundwater in the reservoir area and surrounding area is
recharged by rainfall. and is genallv suitable few drinking. The grundwater resources are illustrated
on Map 3.
3.13             Surface mineral water quality of the Yellow River andjznbutaries is generaly very
good, even though it has an exceptionally high silt load, and it generally meets the first grade of Chinaes
water use standard at mast locations in the area. Local pollution is mainly from mining enteprises with
minaor contriutions from agricultural rumnff and domestic sewage. These result in some localized areas
of high BOD, COD, phenols and zinc, mostly near the tributaries.

3.14             The Xiaolangdi area is nar the southern edge oif the warm temperate zone. This.
in combination with the area's variable getgraphy. resultc, in terrmestrial plant communities which can be
relatively complex and diverse. In the reservoir area itself. however, there has heen a long history of
settlement and cultivation. and the natural vegetation and diversity have been greatly diminished.
Similarly. the diversity and abundance of wild animals. represented in the reservoir area by mostly
northern species. are very low throughout the region. Waterfowl are diverse. but populatinnc are low.
Vegetation and fauna have been studied tur the EIA. with particular attentuin to rare and commercial
species. Critical and protecte&i habitats are indicated on Map 13
3.15             Due to the high tlow rate and exceptional silt content, riverine aquatic habitats are
generally pxor, and aquatic communities are relatively marginal.  Significant fishery habitat is
predominantly located in the tributaries. wit somn fcorrespo)nding contamination' of fish from the
industrial pollution soiurces located there. Fish is not a significant part otf the loical diet. and fish
prxluctivity represents only 0.2 percent of agricultural income in the lower hasin.
3.16             The population of the reservoir and surroudding area is about 2.4 million peoiple.
approximately 181.050 of which live in the-area toi he floxded. Agricultural registered people oomprise

3.20             Because of the need to relocate a significant number of people aflected by inundation,
a careful study was done of the public health dynamics within the reservoir and study areas. The main
public health problems identified include malaria, diseases related to agricultural practices (such as
Brucellosis), encephalitis B. diseases carried by rats. waterborne diseases, and endemic fluorosis causes
by cootking with the high-fluoride local coal.
3.21             In view of the importance otf the Yellow River hasin in the development of Chinese
civilization. a detailed archtological survey has been completed. It identified o ver 100 cultural relics and
historic sites in the area to he submerged. While none of these are classified as protected by either the
State or the province, some of the items are regarded as precious resources for research on architectural
and art history. Ther. are also may imptrtant *ultural resources in the area surrounding the reservoir.
C. DOWNSFREAM RIVERINE AREA
3.22             The area downsream of Xiaolangdi (Map 22) includes irrigated areas within and
adjacent to the Yellow River, stretching approximately 870 km from the proxosed dam to the estuary.
Between Xiaulangdi and the start of the dikes, over soAme 70 km. the river is broad and flows past
Mangshen muntain to the south. At this point. there are approximately 330 kme .of floxodplain to the
north. For the remaining 800 km to the estuary, the river is 'suspended' in a raiud hed aboua 3 m
above Sround level. with dikes on bhth sides 'except for about 100 km at and downstream of the msoth
of the tributary Dawen River. where there is no dike on the ssouthern bank Iroughly 390-290 km from
the estuary).
3.23             In the reach 128 km fnrm Xiaolangdi downstream to the Huayuankhw monitoring
station. the Yellow River receives two major tnrbutary systems, the Yiluo and the Qinhe. which together
contribute approximately 36.000 km: o f catchment. The quality of the water in these systems is relatively
polluted as indicated by the presence of significant levels of COD and phenols. Watter quality in the main
river is thus degraded to the second- grade o f the Chinese standard. until natural purification restores a
first-grade quality by the Gaoicun station. 579 km fnrm the estuary. Water quality renains good for the
rest of due main stream. Downstream of Huayuankou there is relatively little further addition of
catchment area until the final 20.000 km2 is contributed by the. Dawen River and the Beijindi Detention
Basin. about 395 km from the estuary. Outside the catehment areas related to tributaries. there is very
litde runoff. and essentially no urban waste dischges enter the Yellow River donwntream of Zhengzbou
due to the dikes.
3.24            lTe downtream area has a similar genera climate to tha of the reservoir area.
except that it becomes both warmer (average temperature ranging from 12 to 291C) and wetter



-39 -
(precipitation up to 700 mm/year from west to east). Precipitation is seasonal. and hence there is the
same seasonalitj in flow patterns in the downstream tributaries.
3.25             Gmundwater throughout the downstream area is generally abundant and of good
quality.
3.26             Over millennia, the huge quantities of sediment carried and deposited by the Yellow
Ri-er have crcdteu thc C rc  Northern China Plains, also knowr as the Hung-huai-Hai P;ains. The
course of the river has charged some 26 times in r.ecorded history (2,'00 years). sometimes quite
drastically. The present course downstream of Jiahetan was established in 1855. following a major
breaching of a dike. The valley area is broad and relatively flat, though it is constrained to the south in
the area of the Tai Mountains. the source of the Dawen River.
3.27             Sedimentation and scouring in the Yellow River have recently undergone some major
changes. Prior to 1950. breaches in the dikes were common, resulting in frequent sedimentation outside
the dikes. Since 1950, such events have become less common. and the silt load is now maintained
between the dikes. The Samnenxia Darn. which began to fill in 1960. has altered sedimentation dynamics
considerably; it has enabled .some cntrol to be exerted over deposition and scouring, bath in the reservoir.
and in the downstream reaches. The effeas of different operating regimes of the Sanm&nxia Dam have
been studied,.its basic operating principles have been evaluated. and several successful alterations made
to the dam enable better sediment control.
3.28            . he downstream area has been heavily populated and cultivated for many centuries.
and the natural environment has therefore ben.replaced by intensive agriculture throughout. There are
v  U  a few remaining natural forested areas, especially in the hilly and mountainous Dawn and Taishan areas
*-'4  t~ to the south. Wildlife animal communities are.wimewhat mo re complex than in the Xiaolangdi area.
:.   -*  though northern species still dominate. In the cultivated areas, agricultural pesatpcies such as mice.
rats. and pigeons are prolific.
3.29             Many wedands exist in the flood areas between the dikes and are importarn  br
aquatic animals and waterfowl. The wetland in the old course of the river, 100 km to the north in Heajan
Province has been made into a nature preserve. Such areas support large and diverse bird populations
and are important for migration.   .  . -                   -      -
3.30             Because of the river's high silt content. there is no significant fishery in the
downsueam river reaches.

3.31             'Me overall flosd protiectitn region downstream of Xiaolangdi supiorts approximately
70 million p"ple. Agriculture is intensive. and the area is the main cotton and wheal production region
in China. Gross agricultural output is valued at Y 29 billion annually. Industry has heen developing
rapidly in the area. Whereas agriculture fnrmerly represented 70 percent of the region's co ntribution to
the national economy. industry notw contributes 60 percent. The abundant coal. oil and naturAl gas
reserves in this regioin are significant f.r ecanomic development and urban gronwth. A different sorn of

3.32             The estuarv and delta comprise appnrximately 6.000 km2 of llat. low-lying land
(Map 2.3). Tbey have increased by some 2.200 kmi since the Yellow River began discharging here in
1855.  Over 700 ki: were added hetween 1954 and 1984: and over the last 40 years. some
25-30 W-:year have been added..
3.33             Average annual o utflow at Lijin hydrology station is approximately 38.78 hillitin
m`/year and average disharge of silt is 987 million tonslyea.r. representing 87 percem and 75.4 percent
oif the inflow  reseiveJy. Siltaitin oif the river channel in the lower reaches is gisverned mainly by
upstream runo ff and sediment load. Influence on siltation in the river exerted by the extension t*f the
delta has not been significant in the ;L-st 40 vears. Water level ftor equivalent runoff (3.000 mels) at-he
Lijin station (at the head of the estuarv) ha% risen 1.55 m between 1950 and 1989. which is less than
farther upstream.
3.34             The climate *f the delta is partly modxerated by the sea with a 12'C average
temperature. WinuLs are high am storms serious. The area experiences the same cvclic precipitatkin and
runoff patterns as upstream are&s. The low liow periid is more frequentlv ex;ecrhated 1hv increasing
water use. with periodis of zeno low heing recorded. Such periods adversely affect the estuary fishery
and water use in the delta. ftor example. fiur dtomestic consumption. aquaculture. irrigation and industrial
uses such as the pxower plant and ailfield in the delta.
3.35             Except for the silt content. the water quality is fairly good1 due to) the relatively small
amounts o f contamination. and the long run of the loawer reaches that enables effeetive natural purifi:cation
to  occur.
3.36             Vegetation is typical of the deltaic areas with meadows. marsh ?lants andlhydrnphytes
predo minating. including halophytic. salt-tolerant species in coastal and low-lying locaions. There are



-41 -
some small wooded areas and cultivated lands along the coast. Even with the relatively small tidal range
(1-2 m). there are extensive salt nmrshes and intertidal areas.
3.37             The aquatic production at the estuary and in adjacent sea area is relatively high
icompared to the river. Both plankton and btos are more diverse and abundant in these areas. The
estuary is an important spawning and nursery area fbr both river and oceanic species of fish. crustaceans
and shellfish, which are a valuable and renewable economic resource.'
3.38             Man: wedands situated in the coastal depressions beyond the Yellivw River. at.d
having abundanu natural precipitation a'nd groundwater, are noted for the presence tif aquatic .nigrar..c
and waterfowl: and have been made into Nature Reserves such as Wuli. Shouguang and Weifang Natural
Reserves. Such areas are important for, migrating birds. and a number of species including herons.
-egrets. swans. geese and ducks. which winter there in large numbers.
3.39             The major economic activity in the delta is provided by the Victory Oilfield. whi h
is the second largest in China. and is undergoing continuing development-

4.5        Studies by 'RCC. YRCC has carried o*ut an extensive program of studies on dam safety.
Between 1978 and 1983. geological mapping and a systematic survey oif the reservoir area produced the
-irst estimates of the distribution, length and atlitude of active faults in the area. A thorough review of
;-       $      reservoir-induced earthquakes within China and ahbrad was carried out in 1984 and 1985. Based on this
initial work. a detailedl study of the prohbahilitv tf reservoir-indluced earthquakes subsequent to the
construction otf Xiaoilang"di was carried out fnrm 1986 tt. 1987. This included extensive and detailed field
--   studies required to asses the active Quaternarv faults in the reservoir area. Techniques included stripping

magnitude of 5.6 w-aLs recommended lOr .design purpoes in the document entitled -Special Reptirt oin
Reservoir-Induced Earthquake Studyv of Xiaolangdi Projec-t' (FeLbruary 1988,:
4.6 -      Evatualtioni by the litLrnatlihntal Panel Or xPertLs (May and June 1991). In its initial
i2. : e-:    report the Internatioinal Expert Panel recommended that 'the dam and its wssociated structures he tested



- 44-e
for poslulated earthquakes at three different distances.' The Panel reviewed this recommendation in the
light of YRCC's letter of Fehruary 19. 1991. which indicated that the reservoir-induced eatnhquake
assumed by the Panel 'is a hit on the conservative side.' The Panel agreed that 'the hyvothetiL:al
earthquakes are conservative. but whether or ncw the reservoir-triggered event would he conservative is
a matter of judgment, because quantitative supporting data are very limited.' The Panel recognized that
'YRCC has gone to considerahle ettiort to call together knowledgeahle Chinese geologists and
seismologists to debate this question. and respects their opinions. Although these experts estimate that
the probability of a large induced even at the Xiaolangdi site is somewhat smaller than that estimated by
the Panel we agree nevertheless that the probability is nmt so low that it can he disregarded..' The debate
centers on whether the hypothetical reservoir-induced event at 10 km should he uif magnitude 6.25. as
recommended by the Panel. or of magnitude 6.0 a;s suggested by the Project proponent.
4.7       After careful c&nsideration. the Panel remairs mnoire comftirtahle with a magnitude 6.25
resenroir-induced earthquake than with a smaller even fir several reasons recog.. zing: (I) the woirldwide
occurrences of several induced events larger than the magnitude 6.0. including nne in China: (2) the
presence of a 43-km-long Quaternary fault with a wide crushed zone directly beneath the deepest pan 01f
the reservoir (and the dam): (3) the fact that some large reservoir-induced earthquake. have occurred at
distances Lof even less than 10 kIm: and (4) the almnst unprecedented aonsequences of majolr failure of this
particular structure.'
4.8        Both the International Panel of Experts and YRCC attach great importance to the possibility
of reservoir-inducd eatnhquakes. The Panel suggested that the 'dam and appurtenant structures be tL%.%ti
for M =6.25 earthquakle at a hypecentral distance of 10 km' and that 'it is appropriate to use a magnitude
less than 6.25 in testing structures such as the intake towers." Based tn the Panel's recommendations.
!he seismic stabilitv of the dam. embankments and the intake towers have been tested at a simulated
magnitude of 6.25 at corresponding horiztontal peak acceleration of 0.5 g. The results indicate that the

C. REsuErilEIEFT
Background
4.9       In most majir dam and reservoir projects in China and other developing eountries. the issue
oif involuntarv resettlement oif displaced people is iinc of the mnst difiecult and sensitive environmental
issues. This is due kV the inherent complexities involved. and to inadequate planning and implementation
efforts tradititonally applied to addressing resettlement issues in the past. There are numerous examples



-45 -
of involuntary resettlement with inadequate planning. funding and follow-up. producing unacceptable
impacts on the quality of life of both the resetled and 'host' populations.
4.10             Increasingly effective communications and growing national and international
concerns for environmental and social issues s making all major projects ensure the equitable distribution
of benefits, so that no segment of society benefits at the expensc of others. In the Xiaolangdi Project,
the resettled population and 'host" families currently established in areas of generally higher fertility are
unlikel) so he disadvantaged. while tthers living downstream benefit significantly from improived flood
plotection. water supply, irrigation and power.
4.11             The first criterion in the Xiaolangdi resettlement program is t*at the resettled
populatitn should not only maintain its current standard of living but should also share in project benefits.
YRCC. in cooperation with the provincial and central governmeni agencies concerned. is comenittedJ to
achieving this result. 'The population directly aflected by the project includes the "resettlers" displaced
by inundation. The population in the areas receiving resettlers, the "host" population. is indirectly
affected by the ProjeLt. Both resettlers and hosts should thus share in project benefits.
4.12             Because of its significance and sensitivity, the resetdement issue is the Project's most
complex, dfficult and costly environmental problem to resolve. A separate YRCC Resealement Team
was established therefore to plan the resetdement program. Thbe progran is being planned to meet the
criteria noted above, and to meet the policy and legal framework developed in China for resettlement
related to water conservancy projects. Since 1950. over 10 million people have been resetled in water
conservancy projects. Tbe two most relevant sautes for involuntary resettlement are (a) the national land
: ...*      use law, entitled 'The Law of Land Management. iRC, 1987," and (b) the related "Regulations for Land
Requisition, Compensation and Resettlement Provision for Lare and Medium-Sized Water Conservancy
and Hydropower Projects" issued by the State Council Decree Number 74, PRC, May 1. 1991. Article
32 of the land use law deals with resettlement issues related to acquiring nonagricultural registration and
increased limits for resetlement subsidies (up to 20 times the aveage an"nual output value of the
requisitioned kind). These isue.s are especially relev%nt r dhe Xiaolangdi Project (Table 2.2).
4.13             The detailed Resettlement Program is presented in Volume IX of the XLD Project
Brief. A brief description of the RS plan is given in Chapter 2C, which was prepared for purposes of
environmental review. . . '
Environmental Criteria ror Resettlement
4.14             The purpo e of the environmental review of the RS plan is to ensure that the plan
-:+       is environmentally sound, that is, that the resettler and host communities affected (a) will not be



- 46 -
disadvantaged by the Priject. and (hi will share in the prtject benefits together with tither populatioins
in the lower hasin region alfcted bh the Priject. These conditions are essential reqluirements fair the
oiverall XP plan to he ecunonmically and environmentally sound. The object of the RS plan is limited ti
the twin criteria noted in (a) and (h) above. 11 must he recognized. in this co ntext. that the RS plan cannot
be responsible tor solving all the sociieconomic 'ills' of the affected potpulation: this is the joh of the
government. non tof the XP. The responsibilitv at XP is limited to the two criteria. (a) and (h). and
within these limits the RS plan will do all it can to alleviate the sufTerings of the rural poor in the lower
basin area.
4.15              In terms oif specific details for criterion (a) tfir resettler fimilies. this means that
(i) the resettler family will he reestahlished in a new location where the house. yard and amenities will
he at least as goodl as the ramily's previoius situation: (ii) the familv's new earning potential will he at
least as good as previoiuslv: and (iii) the family's expenses and loss in incoime in making the transition
will he duly recognized and accounted and compensated fair.

compensation principles used by the RS prmgram for the various types of resettler families. namely
agricultural, nonagricultural and others. These principles cover both (i) compensation fiir lost pnrperties.
and (ii) rehabilitation costs inciuding compenscation for lost income during the transition period (before
the resenler family gets established in its new location) and timr any nettled training tim new kinds of
employvment. These principles are fne 1w bis fo;r the numerous detailed tabhls in tie RS repo.rt on this

agricultural .evelopment costs tof Y 5.500 per capita or Y 24.200 per hoiusehold. Alternative
nonagricultural emplosyment opportunities could be exploredl at this level oif investment per
capita.
(c)    The successful relocatioin of rural people from the three most affected counties-Xin an.
Jiyuan and Yuanqu-is dependent on timely coimpletion of the Wenmengian aid Houhe
sdiemes. Early constructio n of these projeces is important.
td)    Counties should he carefl no,t it; atrrex'imare pmtneilal crop vields. since this will tend it
reduce the areas of land allocated tIo resettlers. Similariv. variations in the quality *ol land
should al.s be taken into acctcunt.
(e)    Early action is required tos tomp)te /t agrerments bet -ern rese1tlers and hos; iillages. Moire
stafT and resoiurces are rLquired at the county level to undenake this and oiher planning tasks
at the village level.
(t)    Senos consideration must he given to iirroducitng prferetmial policies for rural resettlers and
ho.sts. This matter i already under consideration and includes. among others. special status
tir scarce farm inputs. direct sales of farm products. trainiq,,. exemption or reduction of
grain quotas. priority for jobs in rural enterprises. subsidies and tax exemptions.
4.19               lousing, Amenities and Public Servitcs. Table 4.4 summarizes the beftire and after
situation on housini!. amenities and public services for the various types of resettler populations. As seen.
the resettler families will generally he better off than before moving. Figure 4.1 illustrates the typical
behiire and after situation on housing.  -
4.20              It is of interest to note that 60 percent of the floor space of existing housing of the
181.050 resettlers is in caves. Such caves are c;haracteristically damp and commonly cause rheumatism.
4.21 ISocial avnd Cultural Parameter. Bec;ause almost all rescder autt rndost host flmilies
are Hans, there should be no ethnic prohlems. The soi ial and cultural summary made by the RS Team
indicated that must resettler families are aware that they will have to move. but few have any firm
- concept of thespecifics to he involved. As wou!ld he expeiedt. the minoirity do not much like the idea
of moving but, if required toi move. they *ould prefer not to) be separated fnrm their village neighbors.
However. their main concern is thae imt)ive should hopel ylly result in an improved standird of living.
especially if given the opportunity to switch from agaictultura to nonagricultural livelihotols.

simple in technology and implementation. this scheme will isc lerss impat tin

Ic)    Risles. The fiullowing resettlement risks have been identified and should he considered
during RS planning and implementation decisions:
Ii)              Timing ol land d eveltipment of Wenmengtan should he further considered alter
the Dam  pnrject is completed.  Cetain cost sources and schedule fir
downstream works have to be fuhrter determined: and lhcal governments n  led
toi demarcate boundaries between shared land. It is critically significant ton make
sure whether this site is adeqduate to supptrt resettlement frnm El. 180 tn 265 m.
(ii)             Lical government funding may not he available in time tir investin,, in
industrial enterprises. Whether these enterprises can' be rebuilt or relocated in

are posltpned. the economic burden wtouhld fall 'disproportionately on the-
resettlers.

improvement technique has been established in other situatioins. the social
acceptability of relocating up to 200 km distance away'from the Resenrvir area
*should bhe examined.
(iv)              At ptcsent. 50 percent or mnore ovf household income of resettlers may come

(v)         -    If the resettlement Cost estimates are too lo w during RS implementaiton in terms
otf quantitv. unit value oir the RS compensation funds' purchasing power. these
ctost estimates will have to he readjusted quickly. If the goivernment cannot

guarantet resettlement financing. project activities will have to be suspended.
thereby placing an economic burden on resetlers.
(vi)             Offsetting the many negativ$ risks is * positive one. A high prortion (in
excess of 50 percent) of resettlemnit tasks can be carried out by local
manpower. This manpower is available, and is priced low.

an effective RS plan for a nrjor dam and reservoir project in China and is a truly pioneering effort
involving a multitude of details and complexities. lhe RS planning and preparations seem wdl under
way and in hand. Assuming support from YRCC and the other participating government agencies will
continue to be supplied as planned, it may be concluded that the overall RS program is reasonably well
in hand. Nothing of this complexity will ever be perfect; but it tnay be concluded that the RS planning
progress and future expectations will meet both government and WB needs.
4.50             This includes anention to specific enviromnental issues involved in the overall RS
plan. The situation on these environmer.tal issues is summarized in Table 4.14. It indicates that all issues
appear to be reasonably in hand.
D. ARCHIEOLGICAL RELlCS
4.51 i             eause ;he Yellow River runs through the region that is called the 'Cradle of
Chinese civilization, archeological relics are plentiful throughout the river basin. especially in the main
population and farming areas of the middle and lower River reaches (Map 7). Although the density of
cultural relics is much lower in the gorge Area where the Dam and Reservoir will be located, a detailed
archeological explortion, classification and salvage program has been undertaken to locate, recover and
protect inporant underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the inundated area. To date,
work has focused in the area of known and importan: sites, and priority has been given to those areas
below 180 m, which will be flooded first. Tnere will be more time available to complete ihe required
work in the host areas and the inundated areas at higher elevations.

4b62             Rats are the principal vwetors of hemorrhagic fever. The prevention and control
programn  to be implemented at boith the construction and operation stages consists of:
(a)    delineation of the zone around the reservoir (the control area) where the rodent density is
expected to increase after inundation:
(b)    destruction of rdems in the area inundated prior to inurdation;                        :   - ;
(c)    monitoring rodent desity and the incidence of hemorrtagic fever in the control area in the

Water Quai-ty
a 75             The results of the water quality study show that the only significant changes in wae
quality pameter due to imp dwme  will be (i) reduction in downstream silt conmt (turbidiy) in the
dry season disccg  zid (i) decrease-in dounstam water tempeature dae to storage of water during
the winter period (Table 4.17). Tbe first of these will be very beneficial in controlling riverbed siltation
in the Iower reaches. Mhe predicted decrase in water tempeature of approximately 4.1 C is not
expected to have ny adverse effec  on crops duringthe irrigation season. This is because crop irrigation
experience in the area with groundwater. which has a tempaure about 4C lower than the surface
water, has shown a significant change in crop yield.

4.76              Taking account of the findings on water quality. the necessary monitoring program
(Table 4.18) will include: periodic monitoring for temperature changes (once per month). and periodic
complete mineral analysis of the downstream river water at several established downstream staions.
Monitoring of these wiU be done three times per year. once during each of the periods of minimum,
average and maximum river flow. Analysis will include all najor caions (Ca. Mg. Na. K), all major
anions (HCO,. SO.,. a. NO) as weil as pH. temerte,. and silt content and turbt  In addition,

this process will be slowed to some extent. Tbe International Panel of Experts has evaluated this impact
as follows:
- Tbe rate of land. ceition at the river mouth area depends mnainly on the
sediment volumes pssWing through Ljin. Before construction of the Xiaolangdi
Project, the annual sediment lbad would be about 0.S x 10s tons at Lijin in the

and sorage capacit. The study must recommend and filly justify whether the reservoir area should be
totally cleared as now planned, or if it would be acceptable and worthwhile to modify the plan to reduce
costs.
Rare Species and Special Habitats
4.. -a . -. .- There are a number of- rae and protected species in the resvoir and surrounding
area. Tese includethe gimt swan. mandarin duck, giant salamander, otter. musk deer as well as golden
vulture and other birds of prey. Waterfowl will be the only species of birds affected direcdy by the
reevoir and, depending upon resevoir regulation, it is conceivale that suitable habitas wil. become
available around the reservoir as they presely exist along the river banks. A minor increase in
watefowl populaton may be possible. provided pres-e from hunting or habitat desuion does not
also increase. Gant salamander. otter and musk deer are found in relaively remote habitats in the

aih is cspe.ially im,nornant in view of Cbix-s pos;tion SC the leading coal-burning country in thc world.
The generation of hydroelectricity by Xiaolan.adi will be equivalent tO the use of 1.9 million too of cd&

of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warmin,, of 33.000 tons of sulfur dioxide which contribute.
to a:id precipitation on a regional scale; and of 18.700 tons nitrogen oxide w.hich contrbutes to-
photochemical smog in the region. It will eliminate the maaement of 534.000 tons of waste residues
per year. China presently produces 1.90 million tons of carbon dioxide per annum (10 percerst of the
global emiSSions). The XP hydropower generation will amount to about 0.4 percent of total national
elecricity needs. and will reduce use of coal fur generating power on a national basis by about 0.6
G. CONSTRUTON-STAGE UIPATS
4.89             As with most- major construction projects. there are a host of activities posing some
degree of risk to the environment. Construction activity will produce some impacts on air quality; noise
levels. water quality. vegetation erosion. siltation. public health and landscape. None of the activities
associated with the construction of Xiaolangdi are likely to be particularly threatening. however. and the
- --*  detailed and comprehensive environnental management plan described in Section 5 of the rrA Report
w-il ensure that the effecs of the nrutine construction aciivities are effectively minimized. The impacts
associated with the influx of the wilorkjbrce will lilkewise be managed and monitored as part of both the
Envronmental Managemenr and Resenlemenr plans. Tle role to be played by each of the contracts
in protecting the environment is to he spelled out in the individual contrc as specifications on how their
work is to be carried out in an envirnnmentally.acceptable mranner. The provision for environmenta!

4.96             (a) Flood Forecasting. The YRCC blood Forecasting System (FFS) is believed to
be among the most advanced for major rivers in the world. Such forecsting is especially inporant for
the Yellow River because the confluence time of flows which create floods in the lower basin. lbe
Hydrological Bureau of YRCC is responsible for managing the hydrometric station network in the Yellow
River basin, including hydrometry, flood condition reporting, and flood forecasting. The overall basin
is divided into five survey area offices operated by die Hvdrological Bureau, which, supported by
prefectural and provincial agencies, furnish the salient information for computer processing by the
Hydrological Bureau. At the present tiMItfiese communications are carried out by use of (i) the national
teleconununications system, (ii) shortwave radio transmitters and receivers at the key hydrological
stations, and (iii) a three-evel radio network for the survey area along the middle reaches, for supporing
the above-mentioned communications.
: 4.97             The flood forecasting procedure comprises two components. onely (i) hydrological
forecasting and (ii) meteorological forecasting (including long-, medium-, and short-term forecasting.
The medium-erm forecasdng predicts rainfall for the coming 10 days, and the short-term forecastig for
the coming 3 days. - The flood forecasting, based on the-meteorological forecasting, is focused on-the
lower basin region belo* Sanmenxia and also on floods in the north section of the main stem and- the
tnbutry Weihe River. The predictions are for peak flows. time of their occurrence, flood hydrograph,
volume, and -water level. The forecasting procedures for the lower basin include warning forecasting,
rainfl runoff forecasting,,and flood forecasting. All of these make optimal use of computer technology.
4.98             (b) Flood Emergency Response Systen. Figure 4.8 shows the organization of
YRCC's Flood Emergency Response System (F)ERS). This FIERS, which has been developed over the
past 40 years. is the result of much experience over the past several hundred years in protecting against
flows in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. This has focused on the salient problem of
the population at risk i.-.o shock brigades' to combat flood emergencies. The saying along the channel
of the Yellow River is that 'dikes are valueless without people to:affect to them' (Referncez FIood
'Prevention on Lower Reaches of Yellow River,' YRCC, 1980). The achievement made in past decades
in combating many flood emergencies not only owes much to the engineering contribution in dikes and
control gats, but equally to the people-based forces for flood protecton, which have developed the
capability for organizing swifly and knowing what to do. YRCC ecords indicatethat a complete setup
has been formed for organizations at all tevels to carry out the emergency work, including a systen of
command posts and specialized units needed for coordinating the inputs of all combat mechanisms.
- 4.99           Figure 4.9 furnishes additional details, including infordiation on flood forecasting and
public warning activities related to emergency flood combat opera~ . At preseL as part of the
planning for the Xiaolangdi Project. YRCC. is working on further strengthening the FIERS by reorieming
the entire system to be oomputer-based. This computerization is of grea importance because of the.need

4.104            In addition. the munical and indutWial demand for water in the lower reaches is
expected to reach about 3 billion mo by the year 2000. Ths can be fully satisfied by the Xiaolangdi
Reservoir - The econonic benefit is estimated at Y 3.86 billion (at 1991 prices) (see Table 4.22.
-Surfiace and Groundwater Balance
4.105            At present industry and agriclture in some of the downstre  areas ded on
groundwater. Excessive groundwater pumping- is resulting in serious reduction of groundwater levels.    --
Widtout Xiaolangdi, the situation can be expected to get worse as the river flow continues to dedline with
increasing demand in the irrigation season. The XP presents the opportunity to reduce the pressure on
the groundwater resources. Additional funding for a study to optimize water allotment will be required
to achieve this result.
Electricity Gnration
4.106            The total installed cqpacity of the Xiuoangdi hydroelectric plant is 1.800 MW. with
an annual average energy output of 5.4 billion kIWh The plant location is central among the cities that
would be served, including Zhengzhou. Luoyang, Xinxiang. and Sanmenxia. This will be a new power
source for Henan Province and will enhance economic and socioeconomic development in the region.
4.107            Hydroxpwer is a renewahle energy resource and the plant will not pollute the
environment. An equivalent thernul plant would us I.9 million tons of coal annually and rease 33.000

and its components is the Environment Monitoring  rogram (EMP). for periodic checking on project
construci6n and operations stages to ensure that these are being carried out as proposed in the projea
design. Many of the project components include their own built-in monitoring actvty. for example, the
civil engineering's dam safetry monitoring. the RS program's internal monitoring program. and monitoring
by Health Departmen as part of their disease control programs The purpose of the EMP. to he carried
out by the EMO. is to make periodic checkups on the varios Project component  eaions related to

4-111           Environmental monitoring is a new lind of activiy in development project planning
implementatin (tn both ICs and DCs). hence, even though theEIA may include an apprved EMP, there
us a common tedency in DCs for the funding for this to be deleted during project implementaion becae
many fnncial reviewers do not recognize their need or becuse of fiscal problens Moreover, over the
past two decades imuch of the environmenal mondioring done in DCs has not been effectively utilized so
that funancial reviewers tend to regard such costs as an unnecessary increase in project overhead coss.

It is therefiire n&xssary for the EMP to include its own Benefit and Cost evaluation. to show dearly that
'the prnposed rknitoring will 'make mo ney and not lose moncy.' Estimating the benefits of die
monitoring is nkst an established methodology. but estimates can be made by pnt jecring the likely fute
situation for both 'with monitaring" and 'with, ut mnonitoring" cases.
4.112           Using the abiove approach, a Benefit and Cost evluation for the proposed EMP has

(a)    Final design for the project. including contract documents. plans and specifications must
include the EPMs specified by the EIA.
(b)    Provisions for the construction stage must include environmenm  monitoring and surveillance,
as well as the usual construction supervision for engineering activities.
(c)    On completion of construction. a trial run or other appropriate testing will be conducted to
be sure that EPMs have been effectively implemented or prepared for.
(d)    Operational-phase monitoring and reporting will be done to ens-ure that the project is being
operated in compliance with the measures intended to protect the environment and w providet  -
the feedback necessary to identify and currect residual problems or to take advanage of
enhancement oppormnities.

provsions to carry out each of these steps. These provisions involve institutional development, funding
nmehanisms. technical planning and programs. further studies. into effeca  and opprtunities for
enhancement of benefits. and trining and technology transfer in support of the activities required in the
Plan.
5.7  -    The Plan that has been developed is considered to be compatible with both -Chinese and
World Bank requirements. Table 4.23 identifies the important laws and regulations that were considered
in doing the EIA and preparing the EMP. and indicates where and how they have been mrated in the EIA . ; 
document. The EMP itself fully addresses all requirements of Annex C to World Bank.Operational
Directive 4.01 (1991) concerninz environmental management planning.

S.15              Theuura investmh fCr eblisiing the EMOC-and implting envkomental
proteion meures, shown in Table 5.3. is estimated at Y 268.8 million for a period of 18 years. or a
tond of S51.71 million. or S2.9 million each year. Because most DCs have been allocating very litde
(if anything) for such purposes, at first glance the sum of S2.9 million per year may appea to be
excessivc.



-112-
5.16             To justify this investment. it is useful to refer to experience in thie USA, where a
great deal of exprience has been gained on appropriate asts for postconstruction environmental follow-
up activities including monitoring. This experience has developed a 'rule of thumb' that the appopriate.
an-u-al investment for eron_mental follow-up shopld be about I percent of projet capial costs up to
Sl1-1O mllion. witb the percntage reducng to around 0.5 percent for projects with capital cost of about
SI billion. Applying this crierion to the XP. it is calculated hat an annual cost appropriate for the EMO.
wruld he abt $6.5 million. Reconizing that USA monitoring and follow-up action represents a higher
level than needed in DCs. the recommended level of S2.9 million per year for the EMO seems
appropriate

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
6.1       The overall concl-si3n of the study i thai, except for resettlement. the XiaolanzPro Fmject
will not have any significant adverse environment effects beca  all SEls have been duly considered and
managed. The EtA has kidfied and recmmended the needed environmental management and
protection mesures to he implemented during the design. construction and operation phases to ensre
dth adverse impacts will be preveted. minimied or offseL In some cases. enhancement of existing
conditions should be possible.
6.2       With respect to thc RS issue. the RS planning program is still under way but it is sufficiently
completed to show convincingly dht the RS program me:hanics are well planned and sufficiendy
established and opea     to cnsure diat the entire RS programn will be satisfactrily carried out on
schedule.
6.3       Rqprding dan safety, the attention given to this ssue. including a Dam Safety and
EeGncy Response Program, is believed to be unsurpassed for any major dam and rservoir in the
wodd.
6.4       Regring control of flooding hazards to some 100 million peole downstream, the XP is the
only feasible project among the many alternatives that were considered which will positively furnish this
prtection, including the related issue of silt control and ie -un control.  hibus. for the fust time in
bistory, adequate flood protecton will be furnished for the lmwer river basin, the cracle of the Han
-Chinese civilation.
6.5    .  The project,is. above all else. a floxod control project. but nevertheless. it will achieve very
sizable irrigation, power ana other water supply beefits.
6.6       The XP, region is in a densely populated area with few remaining land resources. The XP
will not degrade any of these but. instead, by making additional river water available in the lower
reaches, including a steady dry-season inflow into the estuary, should markedly improve the estuarne'
.           natural fishery..

6.7       In addition. the XPIEMP prmeram tn carry out a group of special studies for extending the
adfiievemens of XP by mans of selected envirionental enhancemet measures tn include: (a) greatly
increacod aquaculture in the downstream region; (b) an economically viable reservoir rereation tourist
operation: (c) balanced use of surface and groundwater in the lower basin. to optimize water resources
use and to prevent salinity intrusion into groundwater: (d) optimal use of reservoir for navigation;
(e) optima use of XP construction camp faciliies for municipal use: and (f) EIA for planned downstrm
irrigaion projects.
