The\n            project involves considerable impacts on local populations,\n            primarily through structural and land losses and economic\n            adjustment associated with reduced available cultivated land\n            following re-allocation of village lands. Key principles of\n            resettlement compensation designed according to the national\n            Chinese legal framework as well as World Bank operational\n            directives aim to restore resettlers to their original\n            standard of living at least. While many villages will be\n            affected, in most instances this affects only a small\n            portion of each-overall an average of 9 percent of the total\n            population. Land acquisition impacts on production for\n            enterprises will be minor with few of the affected\n            establishments requiring complete relocation. Estimated\n            post-resettlement land areas will be about 5 percent below\n            existing levels. Agricultural households will receive\n            equivalent land nearby or cash compensation to offset land\n            loss. Those temporarily losing land will also be compensated\n            and their land returned to them after use. Persons affected\n            by loss of settlements (including housing, buildings, and\n            scattered trees) will be compensated for housing, receive\n            replacement land, temporary accommodations, and\n            transportation/relocation allowances. Compensation for crop\n            loss will be paid."}, "docdt": "2000-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
