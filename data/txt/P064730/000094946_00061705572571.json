This environmental impact assessment report\n            identifies the significant environmental issues, evaluates\n            the potential hazards for creating adverse impacts, and\n            delineates the environmental measures needed to prevent and\n            mitigate such adverse effects. Most of the construction\n            areas in this project are in serious schistosomiasis hazard\n            areas. Measures taken to protect construction workers\n            include medical examination, snail killing, provision of\n            safe drinking water, medicine, and protection clothes. The\n            use of the borrow pit at Basaigedi will be eliminated in\n            order not to disturb the Saicheng Lake migratory birds.\n            Construction workers will be prohibited from entering the\n            Lake area. Wastewater produced by earth borrowing, sand, and\n            aggregate processing system usually contains pollutants and\n            treatment facilities must be set up. To reduce air\n            pollution, oil burning machines must be kept in good\n            condition and equipped with dust- or tail-gas removal device\n            if necessary. Spraying of water will reduce dust. To reduce\n            noise pollution, using of althorns are not permitted, and\n            construction operation must be properly scheduled to avoid\n            disturbance to local residents. The report also shows that\n            the project impact on global warming and biodiversity is negligible."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
