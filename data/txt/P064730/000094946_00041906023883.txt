YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJEC'T BACKGROUND
1. Project Introduction and Background
S
1.1 Introduction
1.1.1   Project Objective
The purpose of the Yangtze Dike Strengthening Project (YDSP) is to upgrade and
strengthen the dike system which protects the peoples and properties, in the provinces
of Hubei and Hunan, so the system will be- able to manage river flood flows of the
magnitude of the 1954 flood. This project will require a significant component for
resettlement of a considerable number of people. The purpose of the present report is
to describe the proposed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) which will accomplish the
needed resettlement and at the same time provide opportunities for improvement of
resettler livelihood conditions, in a cost effective and efficient marner which meets
the resettlement requirement of both the Government and the World B3ank (WB).
1.1.2 RAP Task
The RAP described here represents the integration of two separate RAPs, one for each
participating province, prepared by the relevant provincial planning institutes (PPIs)
in each province [Ref 1,2]. The integration of the two plans into a comprehensive
project resettlement plan has been carried out by the Hunan Water Conservancy and
Hydropower Survey and Design Institute (HnPPI), with the assistance of the Hubei
Water Conservancy and Hydropower Survey and Design Institute (HbPPI), and a
team of consultants furnished by the World Bank.
1.1.3   Report Components
The overall report composes two parts:
Part A: This comprehensive YDSP RAP
Part B: Photos and Maps: containing photos and drawings which support Part A
1.2 Project Area Description
1.2.1 Natural Conditions in the Project Area
The Yangtze River, 6,300 km in length, with its basin covering 1.80 million, is the
biggest river in China (see Part B Figure 1), annually discharging 960 billion m3 of
water into the East China Sea. The Yangtze basin covers the East, Central and
Southwest China, with the project area located in the plain areas of the middle and
lower reaches, characterized by a subtropical monsoon wet climate. Temperature in
the project area is moderate with abundant sunshine and rainfall. Annual mean
temperatures range from 16.5-17.5°C with a minimum of-18.9°C, and maximum of
40.3°C. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,300-1,600 mm, unevenly distributed
within a year, with 40-50% of rainfall is concentrated in a few months.
1.2.2   Population
Of the 13.29 million total population of the project area, approxirnately 55% live in
rural areas, drawing their primary income from agriculture (Table 1-2). The per
capita annual income in the projects' rural areas is approximately 2,156 yuan,
1 -1



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
compared with 5,531 in urban areas. Average household size varies marginally from
4.2 to 4.3. Further discussion of the demographic and economic status of the project
area is given in Section 1.7.5.
1.2.3   Economic Status
The plain area along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze are the "life blood"
of the Yangtze valley. The project area is part of the main national commodity grain,
cotton and oil production base, and also a significant national industrial centre,
including the Wuhan Steel Works, which occupies a very important position in the
national economy. The total industrial and agricultural production value in the Project
Area in 1997 is 176.084 billion yuan (respectively Hunan 16.984 billion and Hubei
159.1 billion). This gross output value of industry and agriculture accounts for
approximately 40% of the nation's total, making the basin one of the most
economically developed and important regions of China.
Wuhan City it is one of the four largest economic centers of the Yangtze Valley, while
Yueyang is one of the key cites in Hunan Province.
1.2.4 Flooding in the Project Area
Flooding is frequent in the Yangtze River Basin. Flood disasters are usually widely
distributed in the basin, especially the 126,000 km2 of plains in the middle and lower
basins which frequently suffer from serious flood and waterlogging damages as the
ground elevations there are commonly several to more than 10 meters lower than the
flood water levels. These flood disasters occur with the frequency of once in every ten
years.
The characteristics of the Yangtze flooding phenomena are rather complicated. The
maximum flood peak discharge is not only related to the scope, intensity, moving
direction of the rainstorm, but also the timing and distribution of local floods in
various parts of the river systems. The regional composition of floods is quite
different in different years because of the variation of rainstorm distribution. There are
mainly two types of floods that usually cause damages in the basin. Flood of the first
type occurred in 1860, 1870 and 1935. These are caused by extra-high rainstorns in
some reaches of the mainstream and some tributaries. This type of flood is usually
huge in discharge and high in peak level. The second, such as occurred in 1931, 1954
and 1998, is caused by basin-wide rainstorm where floods in the tributaries are similar
to that of the mainstream.
These historical deluges have caused huge losses to people's property and lives,
serious damages to the local ecology and environment, which seriously restricts the
development of economy.
1.3 The Project
1.3.1 Flood Control Strategy in the Yangtze River
In order to solve the flood problem in the Yangtze middle and lower reaches,
Changjiang (Yangtze) Water Resources Commission (CWRC) of the Ministry of
Water Resources of PRC compiled a report, "Summary Report on Comprehensive
Utilization Planning for the Yangtze Basin" [Ref.3], in 1990, which was subsequently
approved by the State Council. The report points out that flood control in the middle-
and-lower reaches of the Yangtze should follow the principles of considering flood
1-2



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
release and storage at the same time. Releasing ranks first because this is beneficial to
flood control both in the rivers and the lakes, both the banks, and both the upstream
and the downstream. These measures include:
(a) properly raising and rehabilitating the bodies of the dikes;
(b) harnessing the river channel;
(c) planning and constructing diversion areas;
(d) construction of reservoirs on the Yangtze mainstream and its tributaries; and
(e) enlarging the diversion and storage capabilities of the Yangtze floodplain lakes
Implementation of these flood control plans will involve significant resettlement in
the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
In the past, flood events have lead to the frequent collapse of polders within the
floodplains, causing economic loss and temporary and permanent displacement of
resident populations. The prograrn for enlarging the diversion capabilities of the
flood storage lakes, such as Dongting Lake and for alleviating flooding damages
involves flattening of the polder areas and resettlement of resident populations.
Begun in late 1998, this resettlement program will continue over a five year planning
horizon, involving resettlement of an estimated 1.2 million people in Hunan alone,
900,000 in 1998/1999 in Hubei. Where possible, resettlement only of housing will be
undertaken allowing residents to continue cultivation of their existing lands,
alternatively resettlement planning includes provision for relocation to township
areas.
Development of the Three Gorges Project is ongoing, involving the resettlement of
1,105,630 people (154,278 in Hubei, and 951,335 in Chongqing City) [Ref. 4].
Resettlement began in 1993, and over 40 percent of the total resettlement is expected
in the next 4 years, with completion anticipated in 2009.
After these measures are taken, flood control for the middle and lower reaches can be
maximized, with the Yangtze Three Gorges reservoir playing the role of the backbone,
adding the reservoirs, diversion works, river channel improvement and non-
engineering flood control measures. In the overall system, dike strengthening is one of
the most important measures to tackle the flood problem in the Yangtze middle and
lower reaches.
As shown in Part B Figure 1, Hubei and Hunan provinces are located in the middle
Yangtze. The Yangtze main-stem dikes in the two provinces have existed for
thousands of years. For example, the Jingnan main dike of the sub-project of Hubei
was originally constructed about 300 AD. However, these provisions for flood
prevention have not been adequate, although raising and rehabilitation of levees has
been implemented several times. Although flood emergency measures were
implemented during the 1998 deluge, heavy costs have also been paid. The 1998
deluge revealed that there are many obvious and hidden defects in the bodies and
bases of dikes, which need urgent treatment.
1.3.2   Main Construction Items
The State Commission of Planning has put the current Yangtze 'Dike Strengthening
Project into its executive plan, including an application to the World Bank for a loan
to support construction of the project.
1-3



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
The project will consist of reinforcement of approx 559.3 km of main dikes of the
Yangtze in Hunan and Hubei provinces (Hunan: 142.1 km, Hubei: 417.2 km).
Construction will include heightening and widening dike body, slope protection, bank
protection, dike body and dike foundation treatment, building of platforms,
improvement in dike operating facilities and equipment, and land- compensation and
resettlement (see Table 1-1).
In Hunan, it is planned to reinforce 117 km of dike, build 1.4 km new flood-
prevention wall, build 4.21 km of new earth dike, improve 65 dike cross-over
buildings, acquire 18,577 mu of land, and relocate 4,464 households and 19,213
people.
In Hubei, it is planned to reinforce 442 km of dike, acquire 15,172 mu of land,
relocate 6,494 households and 28,779 people.
Locations of main works are illustrated in Part B Figure 2.
1.3.3 Implementation Status
In both project provinces, work is underway, beginning soon after the floods of 1998,
with resettlement representing the initial task before construction commencement.
Based on the findings of the World Bank Missions from October 1999 to March 2000,
the current status of resettlement implementation is presented in Section 10.3.
1.3.4 Project Investment and Construction Term
The un-escalated investment cost for the project is 4.45 billion yuan (Hunan: 1.862
billion and Hubei: 2.58 billion).
Construction term of the project is from 1998 to 2003.
1.3.5 Project Affected Area
The primary objective of the YDSP is the protection of the population and land areas
by reducing flood hazards. Flood protection provided by the YDSP, as illustrated in
Table 1-1, will benefit a land area of 20,057 km2. (Hunan: 2,096 km2 and Hubei:
17,961 km2), including cultivated land of 12.58 million mu (Hunan: 1.35 million mu
and Hubei: 11.23 million mu), and.apopulation of 16.77-million (Hunan: 1.59 million
and Hubei: 14.18 million).
Main dikes of the Yangtze in the project area directly protect big cities such as Wuhan
and Yueyang which are located along the dikes, and some burgeoning industrial cities
such as Ezhou and Huanggang. It also protects the Beijing - Guangzhou, Beijing -
Jiulong important railway lines, Tianhe international airport, National Highway
No.107, as well as a number of large-sized state key industrial enterprises and some
important polders.
The project area not only includes the economically developed districts of the two
provinces but also supports the national commodity grain and cotton production.
Along with the rapid development of the national economy, various kinds of
infrastructure are being built which more and more rely on dike protection. However,
the poor structural quality of many existing dikes has lowered their effectiveness and
every year these areas suffer a lot from flooding, including the heavy losses from the
flood in 1998. In Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi it is estimated that some 79.6 million
people were affected by the 1998 floods, 10.2 million were evacuated, and 1,384 lost
1-4



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
their lives [Ref.5].
The project not only has significant regional economic benefit, but will also support
national economic development, and also has important social benefits. Increase of
the dike's flood-prevention standard will greatly decrease the frequency of flooding
and avoid losses of property and life and relieve people's physiological and mental
pressure resulting from flooding.
Project implementation does however create significant negative social impacts due to
the land acquisition requirements. In total approximately 47,992 people from 10,958
households will require resettlement and 33,749 mu of occupied land will be acquired.
The affected populations represent 16.5 percent of the total population in the project
area, and thus extensive planning and management is required to minimize and
compensate for these impacts.
1.4 Measures for Minimizing Resettlement
The proposed project dike reinforcement scheme is the result of many studies with
continuing improvements in the project plan. The goal has been to avoid/minimize
resettlement as much as possible by considering all feasible altematives, in order to
select the optimal scheme. The present scheme is planned to reduce project cost and
facilitate project execution, including reduction of resettlement problems and costs.
To achieve the goal of preparing the most appropriate RAP, the design institutes
conducted many site investigations and considered numerous alternatives before
preparing the final plan.
It has been decided to build protection walls in the populous city zones so as to reduce
the need for heightening and widening dikes which would otherwise require more
land requisition and resettlement. Construction of 3 km of flood wa:L in Huanggang
reduced required resettlement by 150 households and 20 units (1,000 people in total).
In Wuhan, similar minimization has been achieved by opting for flood wall
construction for a combined length of 19.57 km through heavily, populated and
industrialized urban areas. According to the specific dike foundation geological
conditions, seepage-proof measures will be taken to reduce impervious blanket, which
would otherwise require greater resettlement.
While regulations require a clearance of SOm from the dike, standards have been
adopted for 30 m in Hubei, and 50-1O0m in Hunan. These standards have been
determined by each province, based on evaluated risks for piping hazards.
Intemational experience suggests that clearance of less than 30m can be acceptable, as
commonly residence and cultivation immediately adjacent to dikes occurs.
1.5 Technical and Economic Feasibility
The project plan is in accordance with the state's "Ninth-Five Plan and Development
Outline of 2010-Year Plan" [Ref.6]. Preparatory work has been conducted including
project surveys ready for preliminary design.
Benefit cost analysis for the project shows good results with a ratio cf 2.7 for Hunan
and as high as 5.0 for Hubei. It is estimated that the annual benefit ifrom the project
will be 1.166 billion yuan (Hunan 356 million and Hubei 810 million). The internal
economic return rate has been calculated at 25 and 45 percent for Hubei and Hunan
respectively. The project also includes appropriate repayment capability.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.6 Project Management Institutions
1.6.1   Provincial Management
Hunan and Hubei provinces will set up their project leading group (PLG) and project
management office (PMO) separately. PLG and PMO will be organized by local
government and set up at provincial level in the project areas, and will be responsible
for the project implementation and project management. The organization of the PMO
and subsidiary resettlement organizations are described in detail in Chapter 6.
1.6.2   Overall Project Coordination
To facilitate Government/World Bank cooperation, an Overall Resettlement
Coordinator will be retained in the Central Project Coordination Office (CPCO), who
will work with the two provincial PMOs for the purpose of assisting them to facilitate
involvement in the project by World Bank missions and by the proposed international
panel of experts on resettlement. The role and operation of the Overall Resettlement
Coordinator is described in Chapter 6.
1.7 Resettlement Family Investigation
1.7.1  Studies in March and July 1999
During the period between March and July 1999, with the cooperation of local
governments within the project area, the water resource and power planning
institutions of the two provinces conducted an investigation regarding the basic socio-
economic information and preferences of resettlement families.
1.7.2  Purpose
(a) Inform the resettlers of the importance of the YDSP
(b) Investigate project impact on the resettlers
(c) Solicit their advice and suggestions, and make due considerations of their
intentions when formulating production and livelihood resettlement plan
(d) Analyze the income and expenditure level of the resettlers and determine the
economic development target value of the project area to form a solid basis for
resettlement planning
(e) Formulate family income model of the resettlers to analyze the changes of their
income level before and after resettlement.
1.7.3  Investigation Scope
The investigation is divided into two types: basic information and resettler
preferences/intention.
The basic information investigation mainly consists of data on family information,
property, economic income and expenditure, and contract land, as follows:
(a) Basic information of the family includes family members, ages, sexes, educational
level, workforce, accommodation area and structure, quality of drinking water,
means of getting water, power usage, and transportation etc.
(b) Family property: (i) production facilities such as contracted farmland, pond, side
1-6



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
occupations, and production vehicles (truck and boat etc.), and (ii) ownership of
appliances such as furniture, TV, refrigerator, washing machine, video player, fan,
air conditioner, motorcycle, bike and telephones etc..
(c) Family income and expenditure: family income: (i) operation income from
planting crops, forestry, animal farming, aquaculture, employmnent etc. (ii) non-
operation income from shares, gifts, subsidies and others.
(d) Family expenditure: (i) production expenditure such as seeds, fertilizer, pesticide,
saplings and animal feeds. (ii) various levies such as agricultural tax, rent for
agricultural equipment, irrigation cost, and social obligations. (iii) fivelihood
expenditure such as foods, clothes, daily necessities, books, magazines, tuition,
power, water, fuel, and medicines.
The resettler intention investigation includes understanding of the project, attitude
toward the project, acceptable means of production and livelihood resettlement,
interested occupations, and preferences for relocation sites.
Data are contained within each provincial RAP and summarized below.
1.7.4  Investigation Methods and Procedure
In Hunan province, comprehensive data collection regarding family basic socio-
economic information has been made and complemented by sampled analysis. The
forms are filled out and signed by the resettlers. Query forms were distributed to all
4,464 resettlement households, and 4,019 of them made effective answers, a response
rate of 90%. 281 answers (sampling rate of 5%) have been sampled from the affected
villages for analysis, and the actual sampling rate was 6.3%. In Hubei, sampling
investigation was conducted regarding family basic socio-economic information, with
a samnpling rate of 5%. With regard to resettlement intentions, both provinces adopted
the sampling investigation method, with a sampling rate of 5%. The query forms were
designed by the provincial water resource planning institute, distribute by local
resettlement organizations, and filled out and signed by the resettlement families.
1.7.5   Results of Sample Analysis
As the family investigation forms differ between the two provinces, and the focus of
investigation varies, the results are explained separately. -A summary of pertinent

responsibilities. A family income model (as shown in Table 14) reflects the average
living standards in the projects rural areas.
1.8 World Bank Resettlement Policy Guidelines
The present overall YDSP RAP report has been prepared to incorporate due attention
to WB policy guidelines applicable to resettlement projects and /or components of
projects which include significant resettlement components, assuming the
Government and World Bank will formally agree on World Bank involvement as
expressed in the Government/World Bank Loan Agreement. Following such
agreement the mechanisms proposed in the present report relating to ensuring proper
management of the resettlement aspects of YDSP are to be promptly implemented.
1.9 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 1, "Introduction and Background", (i) briefly describes the purpose and
background for the proposed YDSP, (ii) gives a brief description of the contents of the
present RAP report, and (iii) explains that the report has been prepared and based on

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
Yangtze River, the largest river in China, stretches over a length of 6,300 km with a
M2
basin coverage of 1.80 million km . The basin is home to some 19 million people,
approximately 58% of which live in the rural areas with agriculture being their main
source of income. The annual per capita income in rural areas is approx. 2,156 yuan
compared to 5,531 yuan in urban areas. In addition to being the rice basket of China
the project area is also a major center for industry and commerce.
Flooding is frequent in the Yangtze basin with floods occurring in the middle and
lower basins resulting in huge losses to people's property and lives and serious
damage to the local ecology and environment. The Government is undertaking several
initiatives in flood management, and the present Yangzte Dike Strengthening Project
(YDSP) is a major step in that direction. The project aims to upgrade and strengthen
the dike system in the provinces of Hunan and Hubei. The project will result in a
significant number of people being resettled and hence a detailed Resettlement Action
Plan has been prepared to implement the resettlement component of the project.
The project will consist of reinforcement of 559 km of main dikes of the Yangtze in
Hunan and Hubei provinces (Hunan: 117 km and Hubei: 442 Iam). Construction will
include heightening and widening dike body, slope protection, bank protection, dike
body and dike foundation treatment, building of platforms, improvement in dike
operating facilities and equipment, and land compensation and resettlement.
In both provinces work is underway, beginning soon after the floods of 1998, with
resettlement representing the initial task before construction commencement. Flood
protection provided by the YDSP will benefit a land area 20,057 km2 including
cultivated land of 12.58 million mu and a population of 16.77 million will gain from
this. The project on completion will also provide protection to key urban and rural
areas as well as vital infrastructure such as airports, ports, rail routes (Beijing -
Guangzhou, Beijing - Jiulong) and important national highway No.107. Benefit cost
analyses for the project indicate demonstrate strong overall advantage with ratios of
2.7 for Hunan and 5.0 for Hubei.
Whereas the project brings substantial economic benefits to the people of the Yangtze
basin, it also displaces a total of 47,992 people from 10,958 households that will
require resettlement, including acquisition of over 33,749 mu of land. The affected
population represents 16.5 percent of the total population in the project area, and thus
a comprehensive Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared to minimize all the
related impacts. The project feasibility study has taken into account the impacts from
resettlement and the design has been prepared to avoid/minimize resettlement as
much as possible. This has been a result of numerous site investigations and
alternative site before preparing the final plan.
Project management will involve Hunan and Hubei provinces setting up their
respective project leading group (PLG) and project management office (PMO)
separately. PLG and PMO will be organized by local government and set up at
provincial level in the project areas, and will be responsible for the project
implementation and project management. The organization of the PMO and
subsidiary resettlement organizations are described in detail in Chapter 6. To facilitate
Government/World Bank cooperation, an Overall Resettlement Coordinator (ORC)
will be retained in the Central Project Coordination Office (CPCO) at Beijing or
Wuhan. The Overall Resettlement Coordinator will report to the Ministry of Water
Resources and the World Bank on matters pertaining to resettlement of YDSP. The
1-10



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP               CHAPTER 1: PROJECT BACKGROUND
ORC will work with the two provincial PMOs for the purpose of assisting them to
facilitate involvement in the project by World Bank missions and by the proposed
Panel of Experts (POE) on resettlement.
Resettlement planning has involved detailed site investigation -and socio-economic
surveys to establish the basic principles of resettlement planning for various
compensation modes and to gauge preferences of the people and their concerns. These
investigations have led to design of appropriate rural and urban livelihood models in
addition to the appropriate level of compensation, which safeguards the resettler from
any significant impacts.
The present overall YDSP RAP report has been prepared in accordance with World
Bank guidelines including the World Bank Operational Directive 41.30 (Involuntary
Resettlement) and the relevant national and provincial regulations, so as to
incorporate due attention to WB policy guidelines applicable to resettlement projects
and /or components of projects which include significant resettlement components. It
has been recommended that following YDSP project agreement, the mechanisms
proposed in the present Resettlement Action Plan relating to proper management of
the resettlement aspects of YDSP will be promptly implemented thereby achieving the
overall socio-economic benefit of the YDSP.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP          CHAPTER 2: INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT
2. Influence of the Project
2.1 Introduction
Chapter 2 identifies the various social impacts of YDSP implementation on
populations of the project area. While Chapter 1 identifies the social and economic
benefits to be generated as a result of the improved flood control (see Table 1-1),
Chapter 2 quantifies losses and potential negative effects due to project construction,
which form the focus of the YDSP RAP.
In the period between September 1998 and May 1999 (and December 1999 to March
2000 for some areas of Wuhan City), a team composed of the two Provincial Planning
Institutes (PPIs) from Hunan and Hubei Provinces, together with local project
administrations made a joint inventory of resettlement problems involved in the
YDSP. The inventory identified the occupied land and the establishments needed to
be resettled from the project area. The team made a complete investigation and
registration, village by village for the population, land type and area, and
establishments, taking the county, township, and village as a unit. The structure, area
and fixtures of the house and the amount of the private trees were calculated
household by household.
Tlhe inventory and analysis showed that resettlement and land acquisition for the
YDSP will affect a total of 47,992 people from 22 counties, 44 townships and 180
villages, within the two provinces of Hunan and Hubei (see Part B Figures 3 and 4-
1-4-4). Resettlement will be required in both rural and urban areas as illustrated in the
table below.

The project is not expected to have significant impacts on the local socio-economics
given it's linear and elongate profile, resulting in the majority of resettlement to
neighboring locations of existing sites. Nevertheless the project will involve
relocation of a considerable number of people undergoing housing and livelihood
impacts and other economic adjustment associated with reduced available cultivated
land following re-allocation of village lands. These have been discussed in detail in
various sections of this Chapter.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP             CHAPTER 2: INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT
2.2 Affected Land and Assets
Details of affected land and assets resulting from implementation of the YDSP are
listed in Table 2-1, with the main components discussed below.

2.2.1 Occupied Land
Project construction will require the acquisition of a total 33,750 mu of productive
land (as summarized in the table below, and detailed in Table 2-1). Of this required
land area, 65 percent (21,906 mu) is arable land, almost one third of which is dryland.
Fishponds/water ponds and trees/orchards represent the next largest component of the
acquired land at 12.5 percent (4,220 mu), and 12 percent (3,913 mu) respectively.
Other areas include household gardens 466 mu, house plots 1,577 mu and
miscellaneous 1666 mu.

Of the total occupied land, 18,577.68 mu is in Hunan Province, which is almost 55
percent of the total land, and 15,172 mu (45 percent) in Hubei Province. In Hunan
province, all resettled households are rural, and thus land areas are proportionately
higher for Hunan than Hubei, where urban resettlers represent over 33 percent of the
affected population.
In addition, temporary land acquisition during construction will utilize 12,954 mu of
land in the two provinces (Hunan 8,788 mu and Hubei 4,166 mu). Such lands will be
affected for one season of production, and compensated according to lost production

and land restoration. In Hunan, almost half of this area will be on hilly uncultivated
lands to avoid impacting adjacent cultivated lands.
2.2.2 Affected Buildings
Some 1,763,014 m2 of houses and buildings are planned for resettlement within the
project area, including 14 percent enterprise buildings of 243,923 m2, and private
houses of 1,519,091 m2.
The following table summarizes the various types and areas of various category of
private housing and public enterprise building for each province, that will be affected
by the project:
Province  Private Housing Affected             Enterprises and Public Buildings
Affected
Hubei     *  Total rural area housing = 544,266mn  *  Total enterprises (180 to be
*  Total urban area housing =195,085m2  affected, 33 wholly and 147
partially) = 144,237m2
Hunan     *  Total private housing area = 779,74 lm2   *  Total enterprise and public
building area (67 units)
99,686m2
Houses to be resettled included 14,822 m2 frame-structure houses, 646,729 m2 brick-
concrete-structure houses, 867,638 m2 wood-brick-structure houses, 9,697 m2 wood-
structure houses, and 224,128 m2 miscellaneous. In Hubei, informal structures (such
as fenced areas, storage structures etc) make up approximately 4 percent of
compensated buildings, while in Hunan, due to the rural nature of the project area,
such informal structures represent approximately 22 percent.
A total of 247 enterprises and public buildings (including some schools and clinics)
will be affected by land acquisition. In many cases, acquisition will not require
complete relocation, as extension or reconstruction of the affected section nearby, or
alternatively direct compensation for the lost area without requiring reconstruction
may be adequate.
2.2.3 Infrastructure
Losses in infrastructure due to the project are minor due to the small amount of each
village affected. The project will require rebuilding or restoration -of some 38 km of
concrete roads, 176 km of simple and tractor roads, 254 km of broadcasting and TV
cable lines, 476 km of telephone lines, 105 km of water mains, 143 kmn of 10 kV
transmitting line, 20 km of 35 kV transmitting line, and 350 km of low voltage
transmission lines.
2.2.4 Cultural Property
Inventories have revealed 6,861 graves which will require relocation. No other
cultural property or heritage items have been found to be affected.
2.3 Affected Population
Construction of flood protection works for the YDSP will negatively impact on
populations in the project area as a result of loss of land, buildings and consequent
viability of existing income generating activities. The following section quantifies the
impacted populations to the degree possible, and gives a brief indication of the
significance of these impacts in view of the resettlement planning described in
Chapter 4.

(persons)
2.3.1 Resettlers
As a result of the occupation of the land, 47,992 people from 10,958 households
(including resettlers from enterprise housing) will require resettlement.
As the project is a linear/corridor type development, while many villages are affected,
in most instances this affects only a small portion each village. Resettlement will
affect less than 16.5 percent of the total population of approximately 291,474 in the
180 affected villages, and acquisition of approximately 4.8 percent of productive
lands (see Table 2-2). The proportion of affected people resettled in project affected
areas is greatest in Hunan (22 percent on average).
As is discussed in Chapter 4, in more than 74 percent of cases, resettlement will occur
within the village. In these instances, new housing plots will be within 2 kim, and thus
disruption to social and productive systems may be minimized by resettlement
occurring intemal to the affected village. In urban areas, where such approximately
28 percent of resettlers will relocate to safety platforms, presenting a more densely
settled residential environment, with resettlers from adjacent villages. Thus the
effectiveness of land improvement and altemative income restoration measures for
these populations will be of prime importance in sustaining resettlers livelihoods and
avoiding resource conflicts at the sites.
Approximately one third of resettlement will be in urban areas in Hubei province,
mostly of existing urban residents. As these populations are not clependent on the
land from which they will be resettled, and will be resettled collectively with other
members of their community, the psychological impacts on these communities are
expected to be minimal. As discussed in Chapter 4, these resettlement sites in
districts and townships will be designed to include public space and facilities
amenable to active social interaction, and are mostly located within 5 km of existing
sites.
Detailed surveys of affected people have not identified any ethnic minority
populations. In Hunan and Hubei provinces ethnic minorities can be found in the
mountainous western regions of the province, having left the Yangtze Valley with the
immigration of the Han over 400 years ago. No remaining communities of ethnic
minorities are to be found in the project area, and though individuals have likely
married and integrated into the dominant Han culture, they would not be expected to
be considered vulnerable due to their ethnicity, nor are they indigenous to the area,
and thus OD4.20 Indigenous Peoples is not applicable to the current project.
2.3.2 Economically Impacted
As a result of the occupation of 33,749 mu of crop land, an estimated 13,859 workers
will be required to readjust their means of income generation, comprising 6,208
affected people in Hunan and 7,651 in Hubei. (See Chapter 4, Section 4.4.2 for details
of estimate calculations)
2-4



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP          CHAPTER 2: INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT
On average for the project, this amounts to economic displacement of 25 workers per
kilometer. Land based income restoration accounts for over 75 percent of income
restoration planning measures developed for the YDSP RAP. Average contracted
land areas per household are estimated to decline by less than 5 percent, and thus
application of improved technology, conversion of areas to paddy and development of
high value tree and orchard plantations are proposed to maintain the rural livelihood
of the affected resettlers. In all but two counties/districts (E'zhou and Caidian District
of Wuhan City in Hubei), lost arable land in affected villages will be at or less than 12
percent. Thus the changes to resettler production systems will be based on upgrading
of existing skills, and given the adequate equipment and facilities, adjustment is
expected to meet without adverse disruption. The remaining adjustment programs
will focus on training in tertiary and secondary industry skills, and animal husbandry.
Compensation for lost production and support for lost employment is included in the
Resettlement Program outlined in Chapter 4 where production losses will result from
land acquisition from enterprises.
2.3.3 Host Population
Host populations in rural resettlement villages will be impacted economically as will
the resettlers. In urban situations, facilities are either existing or incorporated in the
development of urban and township collective resettlement sites, and resettlers are
urban dwellers, hence host impacts are not considerable. In most rural situations,
resettlement will be internal to the village, thus the affected village is also the host
village, and measures to be adopted for land development following any required
reallocation of village lands will benefit the entire comnunuity. In only eleven
instances in Hunan, have conditions within affected villages been found to be unable
to support intemal resettlement. Ln these places, plans have been made to acquire land
from eleven adjacent villages with land surpluses which were willing to sell these to
the affected villages. However dis-aggregated data is not available on the populations
or land holdings of these villages, and thus quantification of the host populations is
not possible beyond identifying them as eleven villages.
Funds provided to these host villages for purchase of the additional lands should then
be used to fund the enhancement of remaining lands, or development of alternative
income generating facilities. These eleven villages will be included in the YDSP
monitoring program, to see that these are undertaken successfully.
Relocation of resettlers to new residential areas of townships will also involve the
acquisition of land from host populations, and is particularly relevant where this
involves development of residential sites on the rural/residential fringe of townships.
Consultation with hosts involved in the planning of such resettlement in described in
Chapter 7. Hosts will be compensated for lost lands according to the YDSP RAP
standards, and monitoring of their livelihood and resettler/host relations post
resettlement will also be a component of the resettlement monitoring program.
2.4 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 2 identifies the land and asset acquisition requirements for the YDSP and the
populations who will be affected by these losses. A total of 47,992 people from 22
counties, 44 townships and 180 villages, within the provinces of Hunan and Hubei
will be affected.
2-5



YDSP- REVISED FINAl, RAP             CHAPTER 2: INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT
Due to the linear and elongate nature of the project affected area, impacts on regional
social and economic systems will be minor. The project will however involve
considerable impacts on local population, primarily through structural and land losses
and economic adjustment associated with reduced available cultivated land following
re-allocation of village lands. These impacts have been quantified as follows:
(a) Land Acquisition - a total 33,750 mu of which 65 percent (21,906 mu) is
arable land, about one third of which is dry land. Fishpond/water ponds and
trees/orchards represent the next largest component of the acquired land at
12.5 percent (4,220 mu), and 12 percent (3,913 mu) respectlively. Of the total
occupied land, 18,577 mu is in Hunan Province (55 percent) and 15,172 mu in
Hubei Province. A total of 12,954 mu of land will be required for temporary
lease.
(b) Building Acquisition - 1,763,014 m2 of houses and buildings are planned for
resettlement within the project area, including 14 percent enterprise buildings
22
of 243,923 m , and private houses of 1,519,091 m2. Of the 247 enterprises
affected enterprises many will be able relocate partial operations, extend on
current sites or absorb land losses with no production loss. Affected enterprise
structures includes housing for staff who will relocate locally. Affects of lost
private buildings and staff housing is considered under resettlement.
Province  Private Housing Affected            Enterprises andPublic Buildings
Affected
Hubei    a  Total rural area housing = 544,266m7    *  Total enterprises (180 to be
*  Total urban area housing =195,085m2  affected, 33 wholly and 147
partially) = 144,237m2
Hunan    *  Total private housing area = 779,741mg  *  Total enterprise and public
building area (67 units) =
99,686m2
(c) Infrastructure Losses - The project will require rebuilding or restoration of
some 38 km of concrete roads, 176 km of simple and tractor roads, 254 km of
broadcasting and TV cable lines, 476 km of telephone lines, 105 km of water
mains, 143 km of 10 kV transmitting line, 20 km of 35 kV transmitting line,
and 350 km of low voltage transmission lines
(d) Resettlement - As a result of land acquisition, 47,992 people from 10,958
households (including resettlers from enterprise housing) will require
resettlement. As the project is a linear/corridor type development, while many
villages are affected, in most instances this affects only a small portion each
village, overall an average of 16.5 percent of the total population of
approximately 291,474 in the 180 affected villages.
(e) Economic Effects - An estimated 13,859 people will be required to readjust
their means of income generation as a result of agricultural land loss.
Estimated post-resettlement land areas are approximately 5 percent below
existing levels. Some 80 percent of the income and production restoration
programs are land based, providing for recovery and improvement of the
affected workers, primarily within existing or related agricultural practices.
(f) Hosts - Re-allocation of lands within resettlement villages, and in eleven cases
in adjacent villages which will sell their land to the affected villages, will
result in land area reductions for all agricultural households in the village. In

both scenarios, land compensation (or purchase costs) should be utilized for
the development of all remaining village lands. Project monitoring will
review the designation of funds for such purposes.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
3. Legal Framework and Resettlement Strategy
3.1 Introduction
Chapter 3 outlines the principal PRC legislative and regulatory instruments governing
resettlement and compensation in the project area.  Both national laws and
regulations, and provincial regulations are identified and applicable aspects described.
Because the project will involve World Bank funding, this chapter also describes
relevant World Bank policies. Compensation standards based on the legal framework
described are also presented for each province in the project area.
3.2 Guidelines and Regulation
3.2.1 World Bank Guidelines
OD 4.30 - WORLD BANK OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE (OD) ON 'INVOLUNTARY
RESETTLEMENT' [REF 71
The World Bank's operational policy guidelines on involuntary resettlement issued
June 1990 (OD 4.30)
Policy Objectives
(a) Requires that no resettling family can be disadvantaged by the project and
moreover, because the resettling families are among the "Project stakeholders",
they should share in the project benefits. Attachment 3-1 is a matrix, which lists
the salient issues included in OD 4.30, and shows how these have been given due
attention in the present report by citing the chapter sections which apply to each
issue.
(b) Resettlement shall be an integral part of the project engineering and is to be
included in all project steps from initial stages of planning to completion of the
program.
(c) The resettlement planning must pay due attention to the following constraints:
i. Avoid the occurrence of, or reduce the number of non-voluntary resettlers to
the extent feasible, with consideration being given to all possible alternatives.
ii. Prepare competent and detailed resettlement plans so that the resettling
villages and associated villages and provision for family income will be ready
to be operative when the resettlers are to be moved. All the non-voluntary
resettlement measures shall be conceptualized and realized as development
programs. Resettlers shall be provided with sufficient financial support and
beneficial opportunities from the project.
iii. Before actual resettlement, resettlers shall obtain the whole compensation
fees for their losses;
iv. Resettlers shall obtain assistance in the course of their resettlement and
during the transition period at their resettlement areas as needed to meet the
requirements stated in (a) above;
v. Resettlers shall obtain the support as regards improving or at least restoring
3-1



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
their previous living standards, their income-generating abilities and their
production levels. Particular attention shall be paid to the needs from the
poorest and most vulnerable among the resettlers.
(a) Arrangement will be made so the resettlers will take part in resettlement planning
and implementation. Appropriate social organizations shall be established. The
existing cultural and social organizations among resettler communities and
existing residents in the resettlement areas shall be supported and actuated as
much as possible.
(b) Resettlers shall be integrated into the existing residents in the host resettlement
areas both socially and economically. This will help minimize the adverse impacts
upon the said residents. The best way to realize such an integration shall be to
relocate the resettlers in the areas enjoying the project benefits. Advanced
negotiations with the said residents shall be necessary.
(c) Land, housing, infrastructure and other compensation should be provided to the
adversely affected population, indigenous groups, ethnic minorities, and
pastoralists who may have usufruct or customary rights to the land or other
resources taken for the project. The absence of legal title to land by such groups
should not be a bar to compensation.
Resettlement Planning
(g) Where large-scale population displacement is unavoidable, a detailed resettlement
plan, timetable, and budget are required. Resettlement plans should be built
around a development strategy and package aimed at improving or at least
restoring the economic base for those relocated. Experience indicates that cash
compensation alone is normally inadequate. Voluntary settlement may form part
of a resettlement plan, provided measures to address the special circumstances of
involuntary resettlers are included. Preference should be given to land-based
resettlement strategies for people dislocated from agricultural settings. If suitable
land is unavailable, non land-based strategies built around opportunities for
employment or self-employment may be used.
(h) The content and level of detail of resettlement plans, which will vary, with
circumstances, especially the magnitude of resettlement, should normally include
a statement of objectives and policies, an executive summary, and provision for:
(i) organizational responsibilities; (ii) community participation and integration
with host populations; (iii) socioeconomic survey; (iv) legal framework; (v)
altemative sites and selection; (vi) valuation of and compensation for lost assets;
(vii) land tenure, acquisition, and transfer; (viii) access to training, employment,
and credit; (ix) shelter, infrastructure, and social services ; (x) environmental
protection and management; and (xi) implementation schedule, monitoring, and
evaluation Cost estimates should be prepared for these activities, and they should
be budgeted and scheduled in coordination with the physical works of the main
investment project.
Attachment 3-1 is a matrix, which lists the salient issues included in OD 4.30, and

* No such indigenous people have been identified in the project area, and thus this
Directive has not been applied for the current project. Detailed surveys of affected
households identified few people of ethnic minority, in each case inter-married
with and practicing the lifestyle of the resident Han society. In Hunan province
ethnic minorities can be found in the mountainous western regions of the
province, having left the Yangtze Valley with the immigration of the Han over
400 years ago. Project affected people of ethnic minority are not considered to be
indigenous to the project area, or vulnerable due to their ethnicity, and thus
0D4.20 Indigenous Peoples is not applicable to the current project.

* No known sites of significant archaeological, paleontological, historical, religious
or unique natural value are to be impacted by the proposed project and associated
resettlement.
3.2.2 Governmental Acts and Regulations
A summary of the key PRC laws and regulations relevant for the YDSP resettlement,
is presented in Table 3-1.
(a) Land Management Act of the People's Republic of China 1998 [Ref.10]
This Act is the most authoritative in land utilization and planning in the PRC. Chapter
5 of the Act places much emphasis on the relocation of resettlers. According to Article
47, if the State-specified normal land compensation and resettlement subsidies fail to
enable resettled farmers to restore their previous living standards, it shall be
permissible for provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to increase their
resettlement subsidies. However, the aggregate sum of land compensation and
resettlement subsidies shall not exceed 30 times the annual average production value
of the land purchased.
According to Article 42, when project construction or geological surveys need to use
State-owned land or land of collective ownership (village lands) temporarily, the land
user should, according to the land ownership, signs land leasing contracts with
relevant land management authorities or village committees, and pays land leasing
compensations in accordance with the contract. The leasing period is one year, and the
amount of compensation is based on the annual output of the leased land plus the
costs associated with land leveling off and re-cultivation.
Article 51 in Chapter 5 of the Law designates the State Council via the Regulation for
Large and Medium-Sized Water Conservancy & Hydropower Projects responsibility
for prescription of compensation for land requisition under such projects. The current
YDSP, as described below is classified as a large water conservancy project and thus
falls under this regulation.
(b) Water Act of the People's Republic of China 1988 [Ref.11]
Clause 22 of the Act states that the local government shall be responsible for the
production and living arrangements of resettlers in a proper way, where the national
project construction requires resettlement. The costs due to such resettlement shall be
3-3



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                    CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
included in the investment scheme for the project construction. The resettlement shall
be completed as planned during the construction period.
(c) Land Compensation and Resettlement Regulation for Large and Medium-Sized
Water Conservancy & Hydropower Projects, State Council promulgated Order No.
74, February 15, 1991 [Ref.121
As indicated above, this Regulation is based upon the above-menlioned two Acts.
Within the regulation, the YDSP is classified as a flood-control project which will
bring significant social benefit, and thus compensation requirements are regulated to
standards below those applied for reservoir projects. It states that the State shall
provide pre-construction compensations, subsidies and production support to support
the development-oriented resettlement; that the relationships among the State, the
collective and the individual shall be handled appropriately and the resettlement areas
shall place the national interest before them; that compensations shall be provided to
enable the resettlers to enjoy the same living standards as before, or even surpass
them; and that higher compensation fees (to a limited extent) shall be provided to
those resettlers whose life is the hardest.
(d) Design Regulation for Flooded Reservoir Area Treatment at Water Conservancy
and Hydropower Projects, 1985, the Ministry of Hydropower [Ref.131
Clause 4 in Chapter 4 of this Regulation states that economically justifiable
reconstruction proposals for the flood-affected facilities such as highway, electric
power, telecommunications, broadcasting and TV which are in need of reconstruction
shall be presented following the guidelines of restoring their original scales and
standards, or of restoring their original functions.  The reconstruction-needed
investment shall be included in the compensation investment for hydropower projects.
Clause 4 also states that additional investments for increasing capacity or and raising
standards shall be provided by the organizations concerned (i.e. not funded by
compensation).  Due compensations shall be provided to resettlement-affected
facilities functional at the time of resettlement. The relevant authorities shall approve
this.
(e) Investigation Details for the Reservoir-flooded Physical Substances at Water
Conservancy and Hydropower Project, the Ministry of Hydropower, 1986, Chapters
1,2,3,5 [Ref.141
This act describes prescribed standards for calculation of compensation values for
structures affected by the project, as it applies to flood protection works in addition to
reservoir projects.
(f) Standards for Village/Town Planning, the Ministry of Construction, September 27,
1993, 2)    Classification of Villages and Towns; 4) Standards for Construction-
occupied Land IRef.151
Clause 2 describes relevant planning for villages and towns, relevant for the design of
new resettlement sites, while Clause 4 outlines calculation methods for unit prices of
residential land, and serving infrastructure.

3.3 Compensation Standards
In accordance with the above described laws, resettlement compensation will include:
3-6



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
(a)        Relocation transfer compensation (four kinds: house, auxiliary facilities,
scattered trees, transfer subsidy);
(b)        Land compensation (two kinds: cultivated land more than 1 mu and less
than 1 mu);
(c)        Compensation for infrastructures;
(d)        Other cost (including survey and design cost, scientific research fee,
project implementation management expenditure, technical training cost,
supervising and monitoring cost);
(e)        Preparatory cost (including basic preparation cost, price difference
preparation fee);
(f)        Total investment for resettlement (including static and dynamic
investment);
3.3.1 Determining Land Compensation Subsidies
According to Clause 5 of "Regulations on Land Compensation and Resettlement for
Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Project"
[Ref.121, under which the YDSP is classified as large, compensation for cultivated
land acquisition will be three to four times the mean annual output value of the land
over the previous three years. For large-sized flood-control and irrigation projects, the
regulation allows for compensation standards to be lower than the standard mentioned
above. A new regulation for Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy and
Hydroelectric Power Projects has not been released since issuance of the 1998 Land
Law, however, in determining compensation costs, multipliers above the three to four
stated in the regulation have been utilized, reflecting the increase legislated in the
1998 Land Law.
From the Land Management Execution Method used in the two provinces, land and
resettlement compensation rates, in compliance with the laws and regulations outlined
above, are listed in Table 3-2, and described in Section 3.3.2.
A project entitlement matrix is presented in Table 3-3, defining criteria for eligibility,
mode and magnitude of compensation and any other measures to mitigate project
impacts.
3.3.2 Output Value Calculation of Cultivated Land
The annual output value of paddy field and dry land in both provinces has been
calculated based on the annual statistics of villages in the project area from 1996 to
1998, mean unit output of various kinds of crops, annual increase rate and current
market price of agricultural products in the project areas. In Hubei rates were
established based on a multiplier of 5.5 times the average annual output of cultivated
land. In Hunan, two bases for calculation have been utilized. As the regulations
permit, where reductions in land areas may restrict resettler ability to restore
livelihoods, increased compensation is provided for. Accordingly, rates for lands
where per capita allocations are less than one mu are compensated for at a higher rate
(using a multiplier of 7.3 ) compared with average land areas greater then one mu
(rates calculated using a multiplier of 4.7). The higher rate for smaller land areas is to
better support agricultural or alternative income development options post
3-7



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                  CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
resettlement due to compromised economic viability of land resources. In addition, in
Wuhan, higher rates of between 4 (for "other lands") and 9 times the value of land
annual output is used in consideration of the "Wuhan Management Method of
Establishment Fund Collection for New Agricultural Lands", and the higher land
prices in this large urban centre.
3.3.3 Land Compensation Unit Prices
Lands compensated for include paddy field, dry land, market garden, water pond,
forest land, garden plot, house foundation and other land. Compensation unit prices
have been calculated based on the output value of cultivated land, land compensation
times and relative land management regulations.
The rates of land compensation and resettlement subsidy in Wuhan area are as
follows:
In accordance with the Collection of Vegetable Land Construction Fund Levy
Regulation of Wuhan City, this levy should be paid for all the acquired vegetable
land, farmland, barren land and slope land in the municipal area and the suburban
counties. It is temporarily set at the rate of 10000 yuan/mu for this preject.
3.3.4 Unit Prices for Temporarily Occupied Lands
The leasing period is one year, and the amount of compensation is based on the annual
output of the leased land plus the costs associated with land leveling off and re-
cultivation.
Compensation rates for leased land:?Dike construction period normally lasts six to
seven months each year, and the land leasing period is about six months. With the
factors such as filling back soil and recultivation taken into account, one and a half
years is added to the land leasing period, so it becomes 2 years. With the annual
output of dry land as a reference and recultivation costs taken into account, the
compensation rate for leased land is determined at 1800 yuan/mu.
3.3.5 Unit Prices for House Compensation
House compensation includes two kinds: one for private house (nrral living house,
town living house) and the other for public buildings which represent higher quality
constructions (enterprise and government buildings). For both types, the proposed
rates have been adopted to reflect replacement costs, estimatedl by costing the
materials involved in constructing various housing types, on a per meter basis (as
outlined in Table 3-4) Interviews with recent resettlers indicate that the proposed rates
will adequately meet replacment costs for private households.
3.3.6 Unit Price for Auxiliary Buildings and Scattered Trees Compensation
Auxiliary buildings mainly include brick wall, cement ground, water well, simple
buildings, water tower, tombs. It is divided- in two kinds: public houses and private
houses. Table 3-2 shows the detailed unit price for auxiliary building and scattered
tree compensation.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 3: LEGAL FRAMEWORK
3.3.7 Unit Price for Infrastructure Compensation
Infrastructures  include  communication,  telecommunication,  power  supply,
broadcasting, water supply facilities and some special facilities. Compensation
standard for each province has been worked out in accordance with the planning and
typical design as well as corresponding project standard.
3.3.8 Unit Price for Resettlement Subsidy
The unit compensation estimated for resettlement subsidy has been calculated based
on several factors. These include cots incurred for materials' relocation form original
site to the new resettler area. The subsidy also includes the material loss resulting
from transfer of the resettler population and any delays caused in achieving the
relocation process including the time spent in temporary accommodation waiting upon
the completion of resettler housing.
3.3.9 Unit Price for Reconstruction of Public Utilities
The unit prices set for reconstruction of public utilities in settlement areas have been
based on land acquired in the resettlement area, the land leveling and preparation cost,
construction of roads and highways, tap water supply, drainage, power supply and
other utility appurtenances.
3.3.10 Unit Price for Vulnerable Groups
Additional allowance has also been made for compensation to vulnerable groups and
economically disadvantaged people including the elderly, orphans, widows and
female headed households and other economically disadvantaged.
3.3.11 Unit Price for Other Compensation
This includes compensation for design, plan and construction of new townships for
resettlers and the cost incurred in their relocation to new township areas.
3.4 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 3 describes the legal framework against which the YDSP Resettlement
Action Plan has been prepared. These include both the international and national
guidelines and regulations. The World Bank operational directives on Involuntary
Resettlement (OD 4.30), on Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) and the Operational Policy
on Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-financed Projects (OP 4.11) have been
studied and the RAP investigated for compliance against these. Attachment 3-1 of
Chapter 3 lists all requirements given in WB OD 4.30, and shows the numbers of the
report chapter sections which describe the compliance actions.
Appropriate national regulations pertain to land and water resource management. Key
regulations studied and used for design of RAP include the Land Management Act of
People's Republic of China, 1998, Water Act of People's Republic of China, 1998,
the Land Compensation and Resettlement Regulation for Large and Medium Sized
Water Conservancy and Hydropower Projects, 1991 and other national and provincial
ordinances and decrees of Hunan and Hubei provinces on land management.
The key principles of YDSP resettlement compensation have been designed based on
3-9



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 3: LEGA, FRAMWORK
these laws and regulations. The guiding principle has been to award compensation
costs to the resettlers such that their original standard of living is maintained at the
least. Compensation standards have been worked out for (i) land, (ii) housing, (iii)
auxiliary buildings and trees, (iv) relocation and transfer, (v) public utilities in
settlements, (vi) relocation allowances, (vii) vulnerable and economically weaker
groups, and (viii) infrastructure and special facilities.
Compensation rates for private housing have been proposed in order to meet
replacement cost, ranging from 50-100 yuan/m2 for auxiliary structures to a maximum
of 270-410 yuan/m2 for brick-concrete housing, and 700 yuan/m2 for frame-structure
premises in Wuhan. Enterprises and public/institutional buildings' compensation
range from a minimum of 60 yuan/M2 to a maximum of 800 yuan/M2 between the
provinces. Interviews with project resettlers indicate that the proposed rates are
adequate to meet replacement housing costs. Land compensation has been calculated
for each resettled family on a per mu basis for two categories of land, one for per
capita cultivated land holdings of less than 1 mu and another for more than 1 mu. The
compensation ranges from 3,200 yuan/mu (for other miscellaneous, land) to 8,832
yuan/mu (for paddy field) in the former category to 3,600 yuan/mu (forest land) to
8,832 yuan/mu (for paddy) in the latter. In Wuhan, compensation rates for land are
higher (2.5 to 4 times) due their high investment costs, and are consistent between
areas both greater and less than one mu I size.
Use of these procedures is essential for contributing to achieving the basic
resettlement goal, namely that all families involved in resettlement will not be
disadvantaged by the project antd instead, to the extent feasible, will share in project
benefits.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                 CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
4. Resettlement Program
4.1 Introduction
The Yangtze Dike Strengthening Project being a flood-protection project, is widely
acceptable to the residents in the project area, including those in the area where their land
will have to be occupied by the project resulting in their resettlement. To ensure those
who will be affected by land, housing or employment losses are able to take advantage of
the benefits of the project, the following program has been developed to compensate and
manage resettlement impacts, with the objectives of overall providing a meaningful
improvement in the economic and quality of life conditions in the affected areas, such
that no affected people will be disadvantaged by the project. Chapter 4 presents the
Resettlement Program, which is designed to achieve these objectives. In particular, the
Resettlement Program presented in Chapter 4 is designed to meet both Chinese
Government requirements, and World Bank requirements as spelled out in Operational
Directive 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement [Ref 7].
4.2 Resettlement Guidelines
In compliance with relevant legislation, acts, ordinances, decrees and regulations, and
drawing on resettlement experiences from the completed major water resource
development projects in China, HnPPI and HbPPI have preliminarily prepared the
following guidelines for resettlement:
a) Affected agricultural population shall be resettled mainly on the State-owned land, but
they shall also be offered various job opportunities as a supplemenat.
b) Efforts shall be made to minimize the duration and potential obstacles during
transition period for resettlement. During transition period, appropriate technical and
financial assistance will be provided (for providing opportunities in agriculture and
tertiary activities) with the objective of creating practical support to the social and
economic reestablishment of resettlers. The basic social, cultural and occupational
characteristics of the project-affected population shall be given due consideration in
developing alternative employment opportunities, when job chaniges have to be made.
Economic activity changes shall be made on a voluntary basis.
c) Procedure for readjustment/reassignment of land between resett:lers and hosts should
be acceptable to both parties, and the necessary support for reco vering production and
income restoration also available to both parties.
d) Planning of the resettlement prograrn shall include attention to comments from
project-affected peoples.
e) Efforts shall be made to shorten resettlement distance. Opportunities shall be provided
for collective resettlement.
f) Resettlement areas and house layouts shall be made better than before.
g) Resettlement program shall be prepared in a way not to reduce farming income levels.
h) Resettlement program shall be implemented in an organized way so as to ensure its
timely and effective implementation under supervision and evaluation;
i) The capital investment for the resettlement program shall be 'provided in time. The
community and livelihood restoration plan shall be an integral component of the
4-1



YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP                    CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
resettlement program;
j) Resettlement generated social, economic and environmental impacts shall be
minimized and mitigated to an acceptable level.
k) The functions of the affected roads, telecomnmunications, power supply and other
infrastructure shall be restored or furnished, to give similar of even standards of
performance.
1) Job opportunities shall be provided in the labor force in cases where farmland sharing
is not sufficient to reach the expected income goals.
4.3 Household Restoration
From March to August 1997, the specialists from the HnPPI and HbPPI carried out site
reconnaissance of the project resettlement area. This reconnaissance was supported by
respective local governments and authorities. In response to different characteristics of
villages and towns, and to the resettler preferences (see Chapter 7 section 7.4), altemative
programs have been designed for livelihood and community restoration. These programs
include intemal resettlement, collective resettlement (to existing sites, newly established
resettlement residence districts in towns and cities, and safety platform settlements),
replacement housing in urban areas, and cash compensation for houses. Infrastructure
planning has also been completed to ensure a reliable and pleasing environment for the
work and life of resettlers.
Some 10,958 families with 47,992 people in the project area will have to be resettled,
including 4,464 families with 19,213 people in Hunan and 6,494 families with 28,779
people in Hubei. The current plan involves alternative relocation arrangements as
follows:
Resettlement Type               Number of HH       Number of People
Intemal Resettlement
(resettlement of rural households within the  8,078              35,484
existing village area)
Collective Resettlement
(relocation to new residential areas in rural and  2,880           12,508
urban sites (as appropriate), urban resettlement to
apartment blocks and rural safety platform sites)
TOTAL                          10,958               47,992
A further breakdown of modes of resettlement is provided in Table 4-1.
4.3.1 Guidelines for Household Restoration
a) The infrastructure conditions (incl. water, electric power and road) shall not be at a
lower level than those before resettlement.
b) The house plot area for countryside resettlers shall not be smaller than the State-
permitted minimum requirement.
c) Compensation for housing shall be calculated to meet replacement value.
d) The transition period for house building by resettlers shall not be longer than 3
months.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                   CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
4.3.2 Guidelines and Procedures for Resettlement Sites Selection
4.3.2.1    Guidelines
Resettlement sites shall have:
a) good topographical and geological conditions as well as reliable drinking water
source;
b) be suitable for production development;
c) be favorable for production, convenient for living and management;
d) preserve existing land uses by minimizing proposed use of occupied land;
e) have sufficient capacity for potential population growth;
f) lay out house groups to suit topography featuring lighting, ventilation, sanitation and
landscaping;
g) design house groups to suit resettlers' needs and their financial capabilities.
4.3.2.2   Procedures
In compliance with the above guidelines, the local governments and relevant staff of the
PPIs undertook potential resettlement site selection, made overall assessments of the
selected sites as regards their geology, topography, access, electric power, water
resources, etc, taking into consideration resettlers' production and living requirements
(farmning radius) before finalization of site selection through negotiations with resettlers'
representatives and local government at the host area.
4.3.3 Internal Resettlement
4.3.3.1    Resettlers and Resettlement Range
This individual, or internal resettlement to a nearby site back-set from the dike shall be
based on the resettlement guidelines, local conditions and resettlers' requirements. Such
resettlement shall range within the administration area of the village, and be at a safe
place at least 50-70 m away from the newly built dike.
4.3.3.2    Resettlement Sites
According to a preliminary plan, a total of 168 village administration areas will undergo
such internal resettlement. This will include 8,078 families with 35,484 people, as
outlined below.
Sites               Households           Population
Hunan              50                   2,236                9,741
Hubei              118                  5,842                25,743
Total              168                  8,078                35,484
In cases of internal resettlement, the maintenance of resettler income will be based on the
continuation of farming or other activities conducted before resettlement. Where land is
lost, the production restoration program described in- Section 4.4 accounts for re-
allocation of village lands and land compensation investment in land, enterprise and
industry development as relevant for each individual village.
4.3.3.3    House plot Areas
Standards for house plot areas (including housing, yard and other structures) are set in
4-3



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
accordance with relevant acts ordinances, and land management implementation methods
of local authorities. Standards for this project shall be as follows:
Hunan Province       130-210 m2/family
Hubei Province       140-200 m2/family
In Wuhan City, the relocation of residential houses adopts the method of property right
displacement, and the construction area of the house to be relocated should be used
during the course of property right displacement in accordance with the Urban House
Relocation Management Regulation promulgated by the State Council.
4.3.3.4   House Reconstruction
The houses for individual resettlers shall be rebuilt by the settlers themselves. Land
purchasing for such house foundations shall be handled by local resettlement authorities
and national land administration. House types A, B, C, D (see Part B Figures 7-1-7-4)
have been designed in accordance with the land occupation quota, housing compensation
level, resettlers' requirements and local customs. Resettlers can select the house type and
rebuild their houses based on their requirement and economic capabilities. They may also
design their houses on their own.
A typical house has its building area not in excess of 140 m2/family. Both front yard and
backyard are provided to each house. A further layout has been designed for lower
income groups, which can be developed to a 2-storey structure to suit better economic
capacities in the future.
At Wuhan City, disperse resettlement of urban residents should be carried out as
designated by the Urban Relocation Regulation, and the compensation rates for the
houses concerned should be equal to the replacement costs listed in this report, and no
discounts should be made.
4.3.3.5   Infrastructure and Community Services
No separate planning of infrastructure and community services shall be conducted
because the above-mentioned individual resettlement program shall occur internal to the
village and thus be based mainly on the existing facilities. The compensation of the
project-affected infrastructure and community services shall be made in accordance with
the rate derived from their typical analysis. The guidelines for restoration of their original
size, original standard and original function shall be observed for reconstruction works.
In addition, local authorities concemed shall concentrate capital or properly increase
investment for better construction layout in a unified manner. Its aim shall improve the
existing facilities to a certain extent.
4.3.4 Collective Resettlement
Collective resettlement shall involve 2,880 families with 12,508 people. Both provinces
have carried out overall analysis of such elements as geologic and topographic suitability
and existing access, power supply, telecommunications, and water availability to' select
22 sites with the necessary productive capacity and convenience of facilities for
collective resettlement. These sites will be of three types:
1. Towns or Communities - where new housing areas can be constructed in existing
communities
2. Township Blocks - where new residential blocks will be developed for resettlers
3. Safety Platforms - elevated platforms will be built nearby to villages, on top of dikes
4-4



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                 CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
where residential housing will be constructed.
4.3.4.1   Resettlement in Townships
Resettlers
Resettlers will relocate into new residential sites within their exisling township areas.
Resettlers will be largely from existing rural areas close to Township centers, and while
some loss of productive lands will result, most resettler income restoration will be based
on continued used of productive lands.
Residential House plot Standards
Hunan Province       180 m2/HH
Hubei Province       30-45 m2/person (approx. 129-193.5 m2/HIH)
Resettlement Program
Five towns have been chosen as collective resettlement site of 597 families with 2,561
people. Hunan has identified 4 towns or communuities for collective resettlement of 513
families with 2,141 people; Hubei has planned for 1 town collective resettlement sites of
84 families with 420 people,.
House Reconstruction
House shall be rebuilt according to planning requirements. Several house types shall be
designed to the needs of resettlers. For details of the typical house designs, see Part B
Figures 7-1-7-4.
Infrastructure and Community Services
Main infrastructure and communuity services for resettlement purposes are in existence at
the new sites. They consist of trunk roads, water supply and drainage, electric power,
telecommnunications system, shopping center, trading ground, school, hospital, etc. To
promote the expansion of towns or communities for resettlemrent and ensure due
implementation of the YDSP, the resettlers will access the already completed or would-
be-completed main infrastructure and community services. Land purchasing and grading,
trunk road & inter-resettlement road construction, main water supply & drainage system,
electric power system, etc. extension from the existing systems will be provided by the
project.
4.3.4.2   Safety Platforms
Based on experience in other such projects in Hunan, 10 locations for raised residential
platforms will be developed to house resettlers in Hunan Province. Safety platforrns will
be located in Linxiang City and Junshan Farm (9 in Linxiang)(see Part B Figures 8-10).
Only Hunan province will utilize this fonn of resettlement.
Resettlers
Resettlement to safety platforms will account for 1,715 households with 7,331 people,
from adjacent villages and townships. The safety platforms represent an efficient use of
land resources for residential purposes, allowing resettlers to maintain use of their
remaining lands following project lands acquisition and re-allocation. Here also, the
production restoration program described in Section 4.4 has evaluated the capacity of
each site, accounting for land, animal husbandry, enterprise, and secondary and tertiary
industry development as required.
Residential House plot Standard
70 m2/person for housing, 30 m2/person for house foundation.

4.3.4.3    Collective Resettlement in Township Blocks
Resettlers
Populations involved in house reconstruction in townships of Hubei Province are those
from townships or urban areas where no land is available for "set-back" relocation and
thus resettlement to a new area is required. These populations are distributed within
Shamaojie, Hannan District (510 persons in 72 households), Jinkou Township, Jiangxia
District, (738 persons in 86 households), Zhuankou District, Wuhan City (1,046 persons
in 239 households), and Chibi, Huangzhou District (322 persons in 71 households),
Huanggang City, totally 568 families of 2,616 people.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP               CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
Standardfor house reconstruction
The standard for house reconstruction varies from place to place, due to the differences in
economic development conditions and levels, population density., and the resettler's
income and funds availability.
New reconstructed houses will generally be two-storey brick-concrete-structure building
in the proposed areas which are small and medium scale cities or townships.
Accomnmodation of resettled enterprise staff will be into 5-6 storey brick-concrete
apartment buildings. The base area per household is not more than I 00m2, in accordance
with government's regulations.
House Reconstruction
After consultation with the local governnent, the inhabitants Shamaojie, Hannan District,
Jinkou Township, Jiangxia District, Zhuankou District in Wuhan City and Huangzhou
Township, Huanggang City made their choice on the houses, based on a selection of
standard designs developed in accordance with the principles of relocating a minimum
distance and encouraging decentralization.
Enterprises decide on replacement accommodation independently.
Housing Block Planning
Following the guidelines of" City Planning in People's Republic of China" [Ref. 181 and
"Rules of Township Construction"[Ref. 19], Hubei provincial urban designing and
planning institution made a reasonable overall arrangement, uniform programming,
matching construction to the blocks.
The key guidelines for this planning were as follows:
a) Taking the human being as the foundation, design of the block conformed to the
personal habits and behavior modes of resettlers.
b) Taking the environment as the priority, the overall layout varied from the landform and
relief and tried to make the blocks a garden with an increasing harmony between
mankind and nature.
c) Taking the convenience of daily life as the main function, guide the new service and
provide new items.
d) The classified roads with clear network and direction.
e) The diversification of the house style to satisfy different levels.
f) Maximize space for outdoor exercises and friendly talking.
Details of the resettlement and rearrangement programs for each province are provided in
Tables 4-3 and 4-4.
4.4 Production and Income Restoration
As the result of land losses, planning for the restoration of household income generating
capacity forms an integral aspect of the resettlement program. The following sections
describes (i) the principles and methods utilized in determining the target restoration
levels, followed by (ii) an overview of the analysis of capacities in determining viable
alternatives, (iii) the proposed arrangements, and (iv) the details of financing of the
proposed programs.
4-7



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
4.4.1  Principles
a) Production rearrangements must be made on the principle that resettlers shall be
rearranged with varieties of channels, types and methods providing that the resettler
have some land resources to guarantee their fundamental means of livelihood. The
rearrangement shall take the land as the primary means of support and thus
concentrated on agriculture.
b) Employment rearrangement must be incorporated with the local reconstruction,
resources exploitation, economic development and environmental protection. The
actual measures taken in different conditions shall be arranged in the program for the
purposes of resettlers' restoration and self-development .
c) Agriculture shall be concentrated on market gardening, taking the improvement of
working condition and the development of local village-run fabrication firms,
transportation, restaurant, trade and commence as key points.
4.4.2 Tasks
The population for rearrangement are those who lost their fundamental means of
production as a consequence of land taking over, and need to be rearranged for
production development. The planned population to be rearranged within the planned
years were calculated, using the village as a basic unit. The calculation was using the
total occupied tilled lands divided by the former tilled land per capita, taking into account
the population growth rate.
The formula is as follows:
PT=S . A X( 1+f)T-t
PT : population to be rearranged in Th year
S : area of land for acquisition
A: tilled land per capita before land taking-over
f: natural population increasing rate
T: Planned years
t: design base year
The calculation showed that the population to be rearranged is 13,561 in the design base
year (6,081 in Hunan Province and 7,480 in Hubei Province) and is 13,859 in the planned
year (6,208 in Hunan Province and 7,651 in Hubei Province).
Table 4-5 provides a breakdown of the resettler population, which will require income
restoration measures.
In some areas (in Hubei particularly such as Jingzhou, Jiangxia and E'zhou Districts),
although available land resources are low, and residents classified as rural, the estimated
displacement of rural workers is somewhat over-estimated by the formula described
above. In many such villages, village and township enterprises are the primary income
generation sources in the village, with productive lands contributing only a small amount
to overall village incomes. In such situations, the number of people economically
displaced through land loss will in most cases be lower than that estimated, and the
absorption of these workers into existing enterprises (expanded using land compensation
funds) will be the primary means of production resettlement.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                 CHAPTER 4 :RESETT]LEMENT PROGRAM
4.4.3 Target for Production Restoration
The main criteria to judge the capability of the income restoration proposal is that the
production activities have been restarted and the resettlers' standard of living have been
restored. It is normal that the criteria vary from place to place. In order to guarantee that
the resettlers' standard of living will not be lower than before, the rearrangement program
shall make a target to make the resettlers keep or exceed their net income than before.
Improvements of the agriculture working condition are required in the target, especially
in quality and technology, by means of supporting measures. Fuither the stability of
rising resettlers' income year by year shall be also one target for the program.
In the period between February and May 1999 (and December 1999 for parts of Wuhan
City), in cooperation with the local PMO's officers, the relevant PPIs made an
investigation on the family properties and incomes and registered them by household.
Analysis between income and spending for these families are made 1.0 get the net income
per household. The average net income in the planned years have been calculated based
on these analysis, taking the economic developing rate and increasing rate of net income
per capita as reference.
The target annual net income per capita for resettlers' rearrangement for the provinces are
shown as follows:
Hunan Province: 3,412 yuan for resettlement by land improvement.
3,239 yuan for resettlement by secondary & tertiary industry.
Hubei Province: 3,300 yuan
4.4.4 Analysis of Production Capacity
The environmental and economic capacity of the new settlement areas refers to the ability
of the resettlement community, when built and functioning to provide the resources and
means for resettler and host income generation activities while maintaining on overall
community environment which is clean, safe, and suited to supporting an acceptable
quality of life. In developing the production and income restoration program, analysis of
the environmental carrying capacity, and the viability of secondary and tertiary industry
development/expansion has been undertaken, as described below.
4.4.4.1    Analysis of Land Capacity
There are ample resources in most affected villages. The tilled land per capita in most
villages is about one mu or less. Before completion of the project, there are frequent
floods and so the agriculture output is not constant. This leads to a lack of investment on
land for such aspects as leveling, soil fertility enhancement, crop diversification, and
farming and watering facilities, resulting in below average yield values. After the
completion of the project, the land output value per mu will increase, because floods
decrease in frequency and improvements will be made by means of investing more on
land, improving the soil, making farming and watering facilities perfect. Such
investments will improve the land capacity beyond current levels.
Hunan
According to the analysis of the remaining land, the tilled land per capita in most of the
affected villages of Hunan Province is less than one mu. It is planned to increase the
production capacity by both improving the low-output land and changing non-irrigated
land to irrigated. The application of these two approaches, by calculation, shall increase
4-9



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
the production capacity by 10,195 persons, among which 1,371 persons shall benefit
from the improvement of low-output land and 8,824 persons from the change of non-
irrigated land to irrigated. For the capacity calculation in the village tilled land of Hunan
Province see Table 4-6.
Hubei
An analysis was made in Hubei province to see and compare the possible amount of the
remaining low or middle output land, which need some improvements, and rural
population which can be rearranged from the improvements, and the rural population
which need to be rearranged in every village. The analysis showed the production
capacity can accommodate 11,639 of rural population if we take the affected area of the
project as whole. For the production capacity calculation in the village tilled land of
Hubei Province see Table 4-7.
4.4.4.2    Analysis of Secondary/ Tertiary Industry Capacity
In recent years, secondary/ tertiary industries in the project areas have developed rapidly
and counted for more percentage in GNP, especially in some place near township, some
small fabrication firms, mining, transportation and restaurant with local characters have
developed to some level. The percentage of the secondary/tertiary industry will increase
with the process of speeding up the agriculture structure adjustment and township
population expansion.
Estimations of increased capacity are as follows:
a) 1,000 to 1,500 by developing small fabrication firns, water transportation, restaurants
and stores in project areas of Hunan Province.
b) 1,468 persons by developing animal breeding, village-run firms and tertiary industry
etc. in project areas of Hubei Province.
4.4.4.3   Production Capacity Conclusions
From the analyses of the land capacity and the secondary/tertiary industry we can
conclude that with the application of adequate land enhancement measures, the capacities
of the chosen new settlement areas can satisfy the requirements of resettlement and the
choice is appropriate.
4.4.5 Proposed Income Restoration Programs
There are sufficient resources in most effected villages. It is planned that the
rearrangement shall be mainly concentrated on agriculture, with the readjustment of
village lands and improvement of agricultural production, and the development of new
skills and income generation modes combining agriculture with industry, commence and
trade, in which the improvement of agriculture working condition shall be emphasized.
In case the population involved in gardening can not reach their original standard of
living because of the limitation of the land resources, they can develop secondary/tertiary
industry such as timber/orchard cultivation, intensive animal breeding, fabrication,
restaurants, commence and trade, according to their available funds and actual conditions.
Production plans for each province are outlined below:
(a) Hunan Province - Improve 52,762 mu of land to support 5,077 resettlers and
transfer 1,227 mu of foreign village tilled land to support 893 resettlers, among
whom 623 mu is irrigated tilled land and 604 mu is non-irrigated tilled land.238
resettlers will deal in second & tertiary industry.
4-10



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                 CHAPTER 4 :RESETT'LENENT PROGRAM
(b) Hubei Province - support 7,651 rural resettlers, among which 6,183 persons will
involved in improving 97,662 mu of low-output land, 342 persons in animal
breeding, 1,126 persons in village-run firms and tertiary industrv.
In the whole project area, 81 percent of income restoration is planned through land
improvement for 11,260 people, 6 percent (893 people) through land reallocation and in
only eleven instances transfer from other villages, another 342 resettlers will be provided
with animal husbandry opportunities (3 percent), and 1,364 persons in village-run firms
and the tertiary industry accounting for 10 percent.
The production restoration program for the project areas is provided in Table 4-8.
Development of tertiary and secondary industrial employment at the village level will be
determined through consultation between villagers and the Village Council. In these
meetings the Village Council will put forward proposals for development and villager
preferences will be determined. Potential developments may be of two forms:
1. Village enterprises - in these situations land compensation will be utilized to develop
the industry, and employment will be available to those with the skills and capabilities
required.
2. Individual Enterprises - Villagers may opt to take a grant from the land compensation
funds to develop small (household) enterprises such as stores, restaurants, or services.
This will be particularly important for women, the elderly and the less educated who
frequently are less desirable for employment in village industries, yet have likely
made significant contributions to family and village income through land cultivation.
Proposals agreed within the village meeting will then be taken to the Township for
approval before disbursement of land compensation funds.
4.4.6 Forecasting of the Resettlers' Standard of Living
After the rearrangement, agricultural land per capita will decrease. With the decreased
flood losses calculated from dike strengthening, by the end of the planned year, the
resettlers' net income shall be rising steadily as a result of the completed land
improvements, irrigation developments and improvements, the optimized market garden
structure, improved plantations and orchards, animal breeding, village-run firrns,
restaurants and other commerce and trade.
Forecasts of the resettlers' standard of living in each of the provinces are presented in
Table 4-9, showing that by the end of the planned year, the net income per capita shall
exceed the target.
4.4.7 Investment Estimation of Production Rearrangement
In order to restore or exceed the original standard of living, investment of 166,966,700
yuan is needed, including 54,623,700 yuan for Hunan Province and 112,343,000 yuan for
Hubei Province.
The investment per capita for rearrangement is 12,054 yuan.
Estimated investment requirements for production rearrangement are included in Table
4-10.

YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP                 CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
4.4.8 Adequacy of Land Compensation Funds for Production and Income
Restoration Programs
It is stipulated in the 9th clause of "Purchased Land Compensation and Resettlement
Regulation for Large and Medium-Sized Water Conservancy & Hydropower"[Ref. 12]
that the land compensation and resettlement funds shall be used by the unit, whose land
has been taken over, to restore and develop production, to rearrange the extra working
force and to compensate the personnel who can not work. It is also stipulated that these
compensation and funds shall be planned and arranged by the concerned city (county)
government to develop land and rearrange the production and living. These funds shall be
specially used and not be taken for other purpose or private purpose. In cases where the
land compensation and rearrangement funds can not cover the requirements of production
rearrangement, it is necessary to raise the rearrangement funds, hence, the land
compensation and the rearrangement funds are the only fund resources for resettlers'
production, which must be equal to, or marginally in excess of the total investment for
production rearrangement.
In the YDSP area, the cost for livelihood development is estimated to be 166.97 million
yuan, and the total compensation funds of 178.82 million yuan can be used for this
purpose, which exceeds by 11.86 million yuan. Thus the land compensation standard is
appropriate and can satisfy the resettlers funds requirements for production
rearrangement and guarantee the resettlers standard of living keep the original level after
the rearrangement.
The balance between the land compensation and the rearrangement Investment see Table
4-11.
4.4.9 Temporarily Occupied Lands
4.4.9.1   Affected Areas
The survey shows that the amount of leased land for this Project is 3,977 mu in Hubei
Province and 8,788 mu (this figure is collected by construction teams; it includes 4,150
mu hilly areas and 4,638 mu floodland on riverbanks) in Hunan Province.
Lands will be leased for one year periods, with the amount of compensation based on the
annual output of the leased land plus the costs associated with land leveling off and re-
cultivation. Total compensation for temporarily occupied lands in Hubei, at a rate of
1,800 yuan/mu is calculated at 7.5 million yuan (see Table 3-2).
4.4.9.2   Funding Temporary Land Costs
The above expenses are calculated as land acquisition resettlement compensations for the
respective provinces. The land leasing compensation is calculated into project
construction cost by the construction teams.
4.4.9.3   Conditions of Transfer
During the project construction process, when soil is taken from the leased land, soil-
taking procedures should be strictly followed to protect the soil layer of land. At the end
of the leasing period, the construction teams are responsible for the re-cultivation of
leased land. Resettlement supervision organizations will supervise the re-cultivation
process, and county land management authorities and resettlement offices undertake
inspection and acceptance.

4.5 Restoration of Infrastructure and Enterprises
4.5.1 Principle and Standard
a) Based on the analysis of the functions of resettlement village installations of water
supply, power supply, telecommunication, broadcasting, etc. installations which need
to be reconstructed will be replaced according to their original scale, standard and
function. Where no losses will be caused, or the existing function and need of facilities
has expired, no reconstruction will be planned.
b) Planning for water supply, power supply, telecommunication, broadcasting, etc. for
new residential area, are planned so that the operation of existing systems in the host
area will not be affected, mainly by connecting with the nearby facilities. However,
capacity increase for power supply and telecommunication installations shall be
considered during planning if necessary.
c) For water conservancy facilities such as hydropower station, electrical irnigation and
drainage pumping stations, reconstruction scheme shall be prepared according to the
specific condition of benefited area and the degree of impact. Reasonable
compensation will be made.
d) Special installations, with certain scale and class, such as ccunty level highway,
township road, 35 kV transformer substation and 35 kV power transmission lines will
be designed and planned by professional departments.
e) Relocating enterprises will be compensated according to their original standard and
scale. Existing equipment and technology shall be fully considered to limit losses
during relocation and reconstruction.
f) Relevant departments will finance any additional investment for expanding operation
scale, improving standard, regulating industry structure and conducting technical
transformation of the enterprises to be relocated.
4.5.2 Reconstruction of Infrastructure
4.5.2.1   Reconstruction Planning for Piped Water Supply
The relevant water department will finance the increased investment for expanding
operation scale, improving standard, regulating industry structure and conducting
technical transformation of the enterprises to be relocated.
The project will involve relocation of 105.22 km primary water supply pipes, including
3.9 km in Hunan and 101.22 km in Hubei. Recovery will be undertaken by local
professional construction team by local tap water Company and be financially
compensated. During replacement, the water supply Company will investigate the
quality of water at distribution points, and guide the Village Enviromnent Officer as to
methods for improving and ensuring quality.
4.5.2.2   Communication Recovery Planning
Relocation and land acquisition of the project will involve graded highways of 38.3 km,
simple road of 176 km, tractor's road of 44 km. After discussion with the relevant
departments of the affected counties (including city, district and farm), it is planned to
compensate and recover these facilities by professional construction team organized by
the local government.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM
4.5.2.3   Electrical Power Planning
The project will involve removal and relocation of 513 km of power transmission lines,
including 10 kV high-voltage lines of 143 km long (Hunan: 50 km and Hubei: 93 km), 20
km of 35 kV high-voltage lines in Hubei, low-voltage lines of 350 km (Hunan: 124.72
and Hubei: 225.44 km) and 97 sets of power transformation installations.
According to the characteristics of the distribution of above power transmission lines and
in consideration that most resettlers will be resettled by moving in close proximity to
their existing residence, only re-routing of lines to these locations is required.
4.5.2.4   Telecommunication Facilities
The project land acquisition will involve relocating mainly the aerial telecom lines and a
few telephone line with total length of 476 km, including 110 km in Hunan and 366 km
in Hubei. According to the characteristics of these lines, it only needed to move these
lines backward.
4.5.2.5   Broadcasting and TV cable Installations
The project will involve relocation of 254 km broadcasting and TV cable lines, including
24 km in Hunan and 230 kmn in Hubei. Recovery will be undertaken by local professional
construction team by relevant local department and be financially compensated.
4.5.2.6  Investment in Infrastructure Restoration
Compensation investment for relocation and reconstruction of the above-mentioned
special installations will be calculated according to their original scale and standard (see
Table 3-1). Relevant departments will finance the increased investment for expanding
operation scale, upgrading standard. It is calculated that total investment for
compensation of special installations will need 64.40 million yuan, including 16.6 million
yuan for Hunan and 47.81 million yuan for Hubei, as outlined in Table 4-12.
4.5.3 Relocation and Reconstruction Planning for Enterprises
4.5.3.1 Land Acquisition Relocation and Briefing of the Enterprises
The project will involve acquisition of a total 243,923 m2 of enterprise buildings (247
enterprises), including 144,237 m2 in Hubei (180 enterprises) and 99,686 m2 in Hunan
(67 enterprises) Of this, 7,566 M2 are framework buildings, brick-concrete of 146,461
m2, brick-wood of 81,691 m2, 212 M2 of wood, miscellaneous of 7,993 m2.
4.5.3.2   Relocation and Reconstruction
Many enterprise buildings will be only partially relocated, and these buildings may be
extended, or rebuilt in nearby areas. In both cases, relocation sites will be determined by
the affected organizations in consultation with local authorities. Compensation will be
provided for lost production as a result of relocation, which will be incorporated
compensation for lost of wages for employees.
Proposals will be made for the small-scale enterprises that need to be entirely relocated
according to the local resources; marketing, productivity level, and local government, in
accordance with the "Capital Construction Management Regulations"[Ref. 20], will carry
out relocation and reconstruction.
4.5.3.3   Compensation Investment for Relocated Enterprises
Compensation investment estimate will be calculated according to the original scale and
original standard of the relocated enterprises. Main works involving land acquisition

compensation, cost of water and electrical power supply, access road building and land
leveling, cost of compensation for buildings and auxiliary buildings, cost of
compensation for infrastructures, production facilities and equipment, loss due to ceased
production and relocation transportation.
The total compensation cost for the enterprises is 109.88 million yuan, including 29.47
million yuan for Hunan (27 percent) and 80.41 million yuan for Hubei (73 percent).
Details of these compensation cost are provided in Table 4-13.
4.6 Ongoing Resettlement in the Region
The Government is currently pursuing a parallel resettlement program to enlarge/reclaim
the storage capacities of the Yangtze Basin floodplain lakes of Hunan and Hubei. In the
past, flood events have lead to the frequent collapse of polders wilhin the floodplains,
causing economic loss and temporary and permanent displacement of resident
populations. The program for enlarging the diversion capabilities of the flood storage
lakes, such as Dongting Lake and for alleviating flooding damnages involves flattening of
the polder areas and resettlement of resident populations. Begun following the floods of
1998, this resettlement program will continue over a five year planning horizon,
involving resettlement of an estimated 1.2 million people in Hunan, and 900,000 in
1998/1999 in Hubei, as a long term flood control programn to relieve the resettlers of the
regular flooding to which they would otherwise be subjected to.
With this objective provincial governments have developed detailed resettlement plans
and designs, and with the mobilization and disbursement of both provincial and central
Government funding providing grants for housing construction, application of
preferential policies for resettlers, and provision of necessary infrastructure.  The
program has been designed to minimnize loss of agricultural land, and in many cases
involves relocation of households to safer elevations yet nearby to their lands so that
cultivation of productive lands can be maintained. Where village land has been acquired,
alternative lands have been provided. The resettlement program is being implemented
and supervised by the respective provinces, under domestic laws and standards, and is
proceeding according to schedule with no reports of outstanding problems.
The majority of affected people are resident along the Yangtze triblutaries and lakes and
co-incidence with resettlement/host villages of the YDSP is not evident. Given this and
the state of development of planning for the project, it is not considered necessary to
incorporate the program under the current YDSP RAP.
4.7 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 4 presents the Resettlement Program for the Yangtze Dike Strenthening Project.
The chapter outlines the various housing and economic restoration measures which have
been developed in order to; (i) minimize disturbance to resettlers by providing local
resettlement options, familiar production/income restoration alternatives, necessary
support in the period of transition, (ii) be acceptable to both resettlers and host
populations, (iii) maintain or improve income levels and standards of living of people in
the affected areas. Chapter 4 also describes the mechanisms for restoration of enterprises
and infrastructure and utilities affected by the project.
(a) Household Restoration
Some 10,958 families with 47,992 people in the project area will have to be resettled, of

which 4,464 families with 19,213 people come from Hunan and 6,494 families with
28,779 people from Hubei.
In accordance with the guidelines for minimizing distance to alternative resettlement
sites, and with resettler preferences, the following resettlement altematives were
developed, based on available land area and its capacity for increased production, and the
viability of industry expansion.
Resettlement Type                Number of HH   Nunber of People
Internal Resettlement
(resettlement of rural households within the existing  8,078      35,484
village area)
Collective Resettlement
(relocation to new residential areas in rural and urban  2,880     12,508
sites (as appropriate), urban resettlement to apartment
blocks and rural safety platform sites)
(ai)Internal Resettlement
Over 74 percent of resettlers will be relocated within their existing village administrative
areas, minimizing disturbance to existing social and economic systems. This type of
rural resettlement will be require land improvement and the redistribution of village
productive lands, and in eleven instances, the transfer of lands from adjacent villages to
supplement lands currently available within the village. Environmental and economic
capacity investigations identified the 168 villages as feasible for this means of
resettlement, in light of the production restoration measures proposed.
In most cases of internal resettlement, infrastructure and service displacement will be
minor, and the restoration of all impacted services is included in the resettlement program
and budget. House reconstruction will be undertaken by the villagers themselves, in
accordance with relevant standards.
(aii) Collective Resettlement
Collective resettlement shall involve 2,880 families with 12,508 people to 22 sites. There
are three types of collective resettlement sites including:
1. Towns or Communities - where new housing areas can be constructed in existing
communities
2. Township Blocks - where new residential blocks will be developed for resettlers
3. Safety Platforms - elevated platforms will be built nearby to villages, on top of dikes
where residential housing will be constructed.
In Hunan and Hubei 22 collective resettlement/residential sites will be developed for
rural resettlers in towns or communities, providing for a total of 2,880 households with
12,508 people. Through land re-allocation and land development, the RAP provides for
the largely rural resettlers to maintain agricultural livelihoods.
In Hunan, 10 residential safety platforms are proposed for the resettlement of 1,715 rural
households totaling 7,331 people.
In each instance, minimum housing and living space standards will be met, and
maintained access to adequate infrastructure and facilities including water supply and
sanitation, drainage, power will be ensured.
(b) Production Resettlement

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP                CHAPTER 4 :RESETTLEMENT PROGRAI
The income and production restoration program described in Chapl:er 4 was developed
according to guidelines of:(i) providing a variety of restoration alteniatives, with land as
the primary means of support, (ii) utilizing local resources and development activities
without adverse impact to the environment, and (iii) developmernt of secondary and
tertiary village run industries.
Target net income per capita rates have been set by the program as a target and measure
for successful implementation of the program. An analysis of the land capacity in the
affected villages, examined land availability and level of development of existing lands in
the identification of the selected sites where reduced land holdings, with appropriate
investment an development would not compromise carrying capacity.
Production plans for each province are outlined below:
(a) Hunan Province - Improve 52,762 mu of land to support 5,077 resettlers and
transfer 1,277 mu of foreign village tilled land to support 833 resettlers, among
which 623 mu is irrigated tilled land and 604 mu is non-irrigated tilled land.238
resettlers will deal in second &tertiary industry.
(b) Hubei Province - support 7,651 resettlers, among which 6,183 persons will be
involved in improving 97,662 mu of low-output land, 342 persons in animal
husbandry, and 1,126 persons in village-run enterprises and tertiary industry.
Implementation of these programs will require an estimated investment of 166.96 million
yuan, distributed as 54.624 million yuan for Hunan Province and 112.34 million yuan for
Hubei Province, which will be met by use of the land compensation and resettlement
funds.
The average investmnent per capita for rearrangement is 12,054 yuan.
(d) Occupation of Temporary Lands
Total affected lands have been identified as 12,954 mu. Compensation will be provided
based on annual output (for lost production), and to meet restoraticn costs. These costs
are not included in the RAP as they are met by the project construction costs.
(d) Infrastructure and Enterprise Recovery
Chapter 4 identifies affected infrastructure which will be relocated or reconstructed as a
result of the project, at a cost of approximately 64.40 million yuan.
Affected enterprises total 247, in many instances land acquisition will result in only
partial relocation or loss of land with minimal impact to productiorn. Investment for their
relocation and lost production is estimated at 107.25 million yuan.

million yuan in Hubei.
5.2 Resettlement Program Costs
5.2.1 Compensation Costs
These costs incorporate compensation for relocation (including houses and assets),
land compensation and compensation for public utilities, etc. Based on inventories
undertaken and compensation standards, total compensation costs are estimated to be
820.83 million yuan (almost 85 percent of the total resettlement budget), including
501.71 million yuan relocation compensation for resettlers, 232 million yuan land
acquisition compensation, and 87.12 million yuan compensation for public utilities, as
summarized in Table 5-1.
5.2.1.1   Planning and Management Costs
Planning and management costs represent five percent of the overall resettlement
budget, totaling 44.15 million yuan. This budget is composed of 19.53 million yuan
for survey and planning, 24.62 million for implementation administration, 3.76
million for technical training (for both resettlement staff and resettlers), 8.21 million
for supervising, 5.75 million yuan for monitoring and evaluation, and 2.11 million
yuan for the functioning of the Panel of Experts.
5.2.2 Contingency Costs
5.2.2.1   Basic Contingency
Contingencies for compensation, planning and management costs are 20.36 million
yuan in Hunan and 32.83 million yuan in Hubei.
5.2.2.2   Contingency Cost for Price Difference
Based on the annual investment plan and the price indexes, the contingency cost for
price difference is estimated to be 26.59 million yuan.
5.2.3 Subsidies for Vulnerable Groups

(low income families, female headed families, handicapped and elderly). Allocation
of a housing allowance supplement to these households represents 3.03 million yuan
(Hunan 0.669 million yuan and Hubei 2.36 million yuan).
A contingency of 5 percent of the housing compensation value has also been included
in overall project contingency to provide a safety net fund for livelihood restoration
for vulnerable groups 0.576 million yuan in Hunan, 0.86 million yuan in Hubei.

5.2.4 Total Estimated Costs
Total estimated costs are presented in Table 5-2 which provides a breakdown by cost
item for each province and the overall project.
5.3 Budget Program
5.3.1 Fund Disbursement
After approval, PMOs disburse the resettlement compensation funds to CiROs, which
consequently disburse to the relevant CoROs (except where resettlement will occur
within the city, and hence CoROs are not involved). Funds are then disbursed
according to the following classifications:
a) Land acquisition compensation and resettlement subsidy is disbursed to township
level governments who are held responsible for the implementation of production
resettlement of the villages (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2). CiROs and CoROs make
periodic surveys in regard to fund utilization.
b) Compensation for houses, relocation subsidy and house-building subsidy for poor
households are disbursed to township level resettler coordination groups, and then
paid to the resettlers via village committees and household commilLtees, sufficiently
in advance of relocation for arrangement for replacement housing and relocation.
c) Compensation for public utilities and infrastructure is disbursed, in installment, to
the contractor through CiROs and CoROs according to the contract.
d) Compensation for public utilities and enterprises is paid directly to the affected
organizations affected by the CiROs and CoROs.
e) For resettlement sites where houses are built collectively, to ensure funds for the
successful construction of the resettlement sites, CiROs and CoROs, following
approval from resettlers, collectively manage compensation funds for houses and
attachments. After completion of housing construction, it is paid in installments
according to the type of houses selected by the resettler.
5.3.2 Fund Sources
The total cost of resettlement is 966.14 million yuan. Funds will-be furnished from the
following sources:(a) Hydrological Construction Fund; (b) Provincial Governments
Agricultural Development Fund; (c) Provincial, city and coumty finance; (d)
Hydrological Construction Subsidy; (e) Special Labor Fund for Poverty Area and
Capital from Beneficial Units; (f) Income from water fee; (g) Municipal Maintenance
Fund; (h) Central Government.
5.3.3 Annual Investment Plan
Land acquisition and relocation must be finished before dike project construction can
proceed on the planned schedule. Resettlement implementation plan for this Project is
thus formulated (see Chapter 10 for details), and on this basis, the annual investment
plan for the following is made: compensation for rural resettlers., compensation for
urban resettlers, compensation for public utilities and infrastructure, compensation for
enterprises, compensation for major items, miscellaneous expenditure, and
contingency costs.
The annual investment plan for various charges is shown in Table :5-3.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP           CHAPTER 6: ORGANIZATICIN STRUCTURE
6. Organization Structure and Administration
Introduction
Each Provincial Project Management Office (PMO), as the owner of the project in
their respective provinces have overall responsibility for planning and implementation
of the Yangtze Dike Strengthening Project within their provincial jurisdiction. To
administer the project, the PMO is organized into sections responsible for various
aspects of the project: Financial, Consultation, Engineering, Administration, and
Resettlement Sections. This structure is replicated at the more localized level of city
and county, and to a less formal degree at the township and village level.
The Resettlement Offices (ROs) of the respective administrative levels (Provincial,
City and County) effect implementation of resettlement, while investigations and
planning is undertaken by provincial design institutes as delegated by the PMO.
The PMO is also responsible for the assignment of numerous contractors for provision
of various construction activities and services, of which the Supervisor of
Resettlement (SR) and Independent Monitoring and Evaluation Organization (IMEO)
are most relevant to resettlement. Parallel environmental management for the project
is described in the project ELA, and a summary of its organizalion relevant to
resettlement is provided in this chapter.
To coordinate the overall resettlement activities between the provinces, and to
facilitate coordination and communication between the provincial owners, the
Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and the Bank, appointrnent of an overall
resettlement coordinator for the two provinces is recommended.
Details of the key resettlement organizations and the division of responsibilities for
each is described below, and illustrated in Figure 6-1.
Resettlement Planning Organizations
As mentioned above, the PMO entrusts resettlement investigation and planning to the
appropriate provincial planning and design institute (PPI) within each province, as
shown below.
Province            Designated Resettlement Planning Institute
Hubei               Hubei Water Conservancy and Hydropower Survey and
Design Institute, Wuhan
Hunan               Hunan Water Conservancy and Hydropower Survey and
Design Institute, Changsha
While these agencies lead planning activities, other significant inputs are furmished by
the Water Resources Bureaus at all levels. The active consultation and participation
of local officials, villager representatives from affected townships, villages and
production teams has have also been integral in supporting the PPI in developing the
resettlement plans (See Chapter 7, Section 7.4 for more details of consultations
undertaken, ongoing and scheduled).
6-2



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP            CHAPTER 6: ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
The main planning tasks undertaken by the PPIs are:
(a) Site inventories of affected lands and assets, and where possible modification to
construction plans to minimize resettlement requirements
(b) Land and environmental capability studies of potential resettlement areas.
In addition, in cooperation with local governments, the PPI are responsible for:
(c) RAP preparation
(d) Budget determiriation for compensation
(e) Relocation planning
(f) Preparation of required maps and drawing related to resettlement activities.
During implementation, the PPI provides necessary support to implementing
organizations as follows:
(g) Support the Supervisor of Resettlement by providing necessary documentation
(plans, maps, figures, notifications, specifications)
(h) Assist the PROs and CoROs with implementation of resettlement and
production
(i)  As necessary, amend the RAP in response to actual conditions.
Resettlement Implementation Organizations
Tlhe PMO takes ultimate responsibility for resettlement implementation work. The
ROs of various levels (including provincial, city, county,) set up resettlement offices
to carry out the implementation of the resettlement plan. The number of staff at these
resettlement offices varies from 2 to 8 (Table 6-1). Since the resettlement work is a
government activity with strong social characteristics, these offices should include
personnel from Governments, Land Management Authorities, Water Resource and
Agriculture departments. The leaders of the resettlement offices are usually officials
with extensive management experience.
6.1.1 Resettlement Offices (ROs)
ROs at the provincial (PRO), and county (CoRO) levels are responsible for the
following tasks for resettlement implementation:
(a)  Participate or coordinate with local governments in the following areas:
formulation of physical index investigation (inventories), resettlement
compensation and relocation plans, and resettlement implementation.
(b) Organize and manage the implementation plan and compensation utilization at
both the county and township levels
(c) Coordinates withl the SR and IMEO, and other monitoring parties involved in
resettlement implementation so as to carry out the resettlement work
satisfactorily on behalf of the PMO.
(d) Cooperate with the PPI by arranging personnel to facilitate resettlement
planning.
(e)  Sutpervise and evaluate the performance of the townships and villages, and
6-3



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP            CHAPTER 6: ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
morntor and assess resettlement implementation within their administrative
zone, and report resettlement progress to the parties concerned.
These roles will be undertaken by the City RO (CiRO) or County RO (CoRO) as
relevant for resettlement under their jurisdiction. For convenience in :reference, in this
report, only the CoRO will be referenced in regard to these roles. The CiRO in the
initial channel for funds disbursement from the PMO, designated responsibility via a
contract with the PMO. For resettlement under CoROs, the CiRO wi ll then undertake
similar agreement with CoROs, assigning responsibility and disbursing funds.
6.1.2 Township and Village Level Administration
At the affected townships and villages, there are normally one to two officials in
charge of the resettlement work within their area (one official from township
government and one from the Land Management Dept. at the township level; at the
village level, the Village Leader takes up this responsibility). Township governments
are involved in agreements on compensation and confirmation of resettlement sites,
and other formal activities, however the Village is the primary implementing
organization.
Duties of leaders at the township and village levels involve assisting the local
resettlement office with:
(a) land readjustment
(b) development of secondary and tertiary industries
(c) organizing the relocation of resettlers
(d) assisting the resettlers to build houses
(e) informing the resettlers (and host populations) of relevant policies and
regulations, options for implementation and procedures for implementation
(fl solving problems encountered by the resettlers during the implementation
process
(g) providing assistance as required in restoring and improving the livelihood of
resettlers.
Supervision and Monitoring
6.1.3 Supervisor of Resettlement (SR)
The PMO will hire an organization with State level certification to control the
investment, progress and quality of the project, and in cooperation with local
authorities, to coordinate, supervise and monitor the work of both local authorities and
the planning organization and the acceptance of completed projects. In Hunan, the
Hunan Hydropower Supervision Corp. has been contracted to undertake this role.
6.1.4 Independent Monitoring and Evaluation Organization (IMEO)
The PMO will hire an independent monitoring and evaluating organization to monitor
and assess the resettler relocation process, achievements and impacts, and the social
integration of the resettlers. Responsibilities and relationships of the IMEO to the
ROs, the RS and the Panel of Experts (POE) are described in Chapter 7.

(EMO) will also be established at the provincial level, with responsibility for
coordinating implementation of the environrmental protection measures (EPMs)
outlined in the EIA. Environmental Construction Inspectors (ECIs) will also be
retained to inspect the implementation and performance of the EPMs. At the village
level is the delegation of a Village Environmental Officer (VEO) who reports monthly
on the progress and adequacy of construction and resettlement activities.
Of primary relevance to the resettlement is the monitoring of public infastructure and
services for health protection and improvement in the resettlement areas, including
provision of safe water supply to drinking water taps, provision for adequate toilet
/excreta management in houses and other buildings, provision of adequate solid waste
management, and provision of adequate surface drainage.
Overall YDSP Resettlement Coordination
As noted above, the project is actually composed of two sub-projects that are located
in different provinces, and thus separate administrative jurisdictions, and the ROs are
set up under the PMOs of Hunan and Hubei. However, it is recommended that an
Overall Resettlement Coordinator (ORC) position be established to work with the two
ROs to ensure coordination of the resettlement operations of all two provinces.
The ORC would function at the central level (either in Beijing or Wuhan)
coordinating the resettlement operations in both provinces. ORC will be a part of the
Central Project Coordination Office (CPCO) to be setup for overall project
coordination of YDSP, and will report to Ministry of Water Resources (MWR),
Yangtze Water Resource Commission (CWRC), and the World Bank through the
CPCO organizational setup, on matters relating to implementation of the resettlement
program. In addition the ORC will also be responsible for coordination with and
reporting to the Resettlement Panel of Experts (POE).
The ORC will form part of an overall resettlement coordination committee that will
have one representative from each PRO in addition to the ORC (see Figure 6-2). The
ORC will work with the Committee to reach agreement on the work to be done by the
ORC in cooperation and assistance of the PROs. The primary task of the ORC will be
to work with the PROs to prepare reports on overall resettlement program
performance, to facilitate the operations and visits of MVVR, CWRC officials, the
POE, and World Bank missions.
Responsibility of the ORC together with the RO leaders would be as follows:
(a) Review and coordination of operation of provincial Resettlement Supervisors
(SRs) and Environmental Management Offices (EMOs) with comments as needed to
obtain effective continuing improvement and achievement of resettlement targets in
the overall Project region.
(b) Recommending, gaining approval for and carrying out any special studies or
central government funding required to meet which are shown by the environmental
performance.
(c) Arrange and coordinate the visits of the MWR, CWRC officials, the POE, and
World Bank mission resettlement members.

(d) Periodic reports (twice a year) on project resettlement performance, including
environmental perfornance to the MWR, CWRC, POE and to the World Bank.
Resettlement Management System
Various measures have been taken in the project management process, including
employer accountability, monitoring and assessment, public bidding, and contract
management systems. The PMO will be in charge of resettlement implementation and
the public bidding of major component projects and infrastructure construction. In
addition, project constriction will be supervised by an organization with appropriate
State level certification, and all contracts of project construction should be managed
by the SR. Meanwhile, each PMO will retain the Yellow River Resettlement
Monitoring and Evaluation Co. Ltd. to monitor and assess the resettlement process.
In addition, the resettlement offices will use information management systems to store
the files of the resettlers and other relevant information during the implementation
process.
Staffing at the Resettlement Organizations
Staffing of the provincial, city and county ROs is illustrated in Table 6-1. In both
Hunan and Hubei province, the majority of these staff are from management and
engineering fields, and in most counties have extensive experience with past
resettlement projects, highlighting the significance of the training program
Training
In order to ensure the smooth progress of resettlement implementation, training plans
must be formulated to train both the resettlers and the resettlement workers.
6.1.6 Training Plan for Resettlement Officials
Staff training and human resource development system will be set up for the
resettlement organizations of various levels, in order to improve resettlement
management capabilities of planning and implementing staff. BudLget allocation has
been made, and a training program developed to take the formn of: lectures by
officials/experts, technical courses, visits to other resettlement projects, and on site
training for technical and managerial personnel etc. Content of the training will
include the following:
*  Principle and Policies for Resettlement
*  Resettlement Planning Management
*  Resettlement Implementation Planning
*  Implementation Progress Management
*  Resettlement Financial Management
*  Quality Control
*  Management Information System
*  Project Supervision
*  Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation

Project Management
Since the village and township leaders will be instrumental in implementing the day to
day activities of the resettlement program it is important for them to be trained and
proficient in various aspects of resettlement program implementation. Key areas of
training at the village level will include:
(i) enhancing awareness amongst the village leadership about national and provincial
laws and regulations on resettlement (land acquisition, compensation fund etc.) so
as to make them aware of their entitlements and privileges in this regard;
(ii) training in day to day resettlement planning and implementation at the very
grassroots level including the organization of the transfer process, reconstruction
of housing and facilities, information dissemination to resettlers on the
compensation standards and identifying problems and developing simple and
quick solutions at the village level itself;
(iii)procedures for coordination with township, county and city resettlement officials
for implementation of the resettlement program including sanction and disbursal
of funds, accounting, management and cost control and other issues related to all
aspects of resettlement;
(iv)training in public consultation and grievance redressal procedures;
(v) training in the understanding of contracts and agreements with Resettlement
Offices on housing, land and livelihood compensation and others;
(vi)training in use of more efficient cropping and land preparation and adjustment
techniques in those rural areas where land development is needed due to loss of
arable land;
(vii)vocational training and skills for development and engagement of rural people in
secondary and tertiary industries; and basic reporting techniques and procedures
for coordinating with the City, County and Township resettlement officials.
The proposed training program, listed in Table 6-2, involves training periods of
between one and five weeks, beginning with an introduction to the policies and
regulations relating to resettlement, and with particular emphasis on the requirements
proposed in this YDSP RAP. The program is due to commence in November 1999 and
continue through until November 2003.
6.1.7 Production Skills Training for Resettlers
Production skills and agricultural technology training will be conducted for the
resettlers before they move to new living and production environments. Some farmers
may find the agricultural production methods unfamiliar at their resettlement
destination, and some of them may need guidance in the growing of new types of
crops, such as vegetables, cotton, tobacco, and fruit. As a result, training and
agricultural development assistance should be provided. Some resettlers may be
employed to work in secondary and tertiary industries, so they need specialized
training. Some of the young resettlers with good educational background could be
6-7



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP            CHAPTER 6: ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
sent to technical schools/colleges to receive one to two years high level training, so
they could help the training of local villagers after graduation.
In response to the preferred income generating activities selected by resettlers, budget
allocations and practical arrangements have been considered for the provision of
required training to assist resettlers in making the transition to intensified farming
production, animal husbandry activities, small enterprise development, or for
participation in the secondary and tertiary industry sectors. A preliminary program is
illustrated in Table 6-3.
* Secondary and Tertiary Skills: The proposed training provides fcor initial training
of two to three weeks for all 1706 resettlers who plan to seek post-resettlement
income in these sectors
* Production Development: Training is programmed for various aspects of
agricultural production improvement including rice cultivation management,
aquaculture and cash crop planting. The training program has been estimated
based on provision to all working age members of resettled families who will
pursue their livelihood in agricultural production.
F Family Business: Necessary preparation for families planning to establish or
family enterprises, will include fundarmentals required for planning and operation
of such enterprises.
The proposed training programs will provide important first steps in helping resettlers
prepare for and initiate the use of new skills. Of instrumental importance will be the
provision of practical manuals for each of the training programs to which resettlers
can seek reference as needed in order to cement the concepts introduced during the
training courses. The training courses, and manuals should also highlight avenues for
resettler access to further information and advice (e.g. through township and county
agricultural extension and technology officers), and encourage mutual cooperation
between resettlers, possibly through the formation of formal or informal action groups
related to development of new skills, enabling the benefit of shared experience and
enhancing community cohesion.
Improvement Methods for Resettlement Organizations,
To improve performance of resettlement management and implementation, the
following key limitations have been identified:.
(a) Responsibility and scope of duties of resettlement organizations of various levels
should be clarified, and monitoring and management should be strengthened
Appointment of the ORC, together with the recommendations of the IMEO and
RS will assist in continuos review of the functioning of resettlement organizations
and provide assistance in the refinement and clarification of the scope of work
required and mechanisms and organizations to best address them. It is also
recognized that the POE and IMEO will play a key role in development of
monitoring practice;-
(b) Improve the capability of resettlement organizations of various levels, especially
the professional/technical capability; Provide technical equipment, such as
computers, testing apparatus, and transportation vehicles, etc.
Equipment to be purchased in support of the resettlement organizations is listed in
6-8



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP           CHAPTER 6: ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
Table 6-4.
(c) Recruitment of resettlement personnel according to a strict standard, and provision
of necessary training. Managerial personnel and technical staff at the resettlement
organizations should be trained to improve their managerial capability and
technical competence.
Recruitment of additional personnel with relevant experience will be sought as
required in each organization, while the objective of the training program
described in Section 6.8.1 above aims to upgrade the managerial skills required
for improved resettlement performance.
Summary and Conclusions
(a) The institutional structure for resettlement aspects of the YDSP is described in
Chapter 6. The discussion identifies the agencies and organizations responsible
for management, planning, implementation, supervision and monitoring of all
aspects of resettlement at the provincial level, independent external inputs, and
recommendation for appointment of a Overall Resettlement Coordinator to
operate as a linkage between the two provinces, the Ministry of Water
Resources, and the World Bank.
(b) Figures 6-1 and 6-2 illustrate the proposed institutional structure.
(c) In each province the PMO, as project owner, has contracted the relevant
provincial Hydropower Planning and Design Institute to develop the RAP,
including undertaking inventory, modifying design for resettlement
minimization, identification and evaluation of alternative resettlement and
production sites and income generation activities in consultation with relevant
agencies and affected populations.
(d) The PROs, through counterpart offices at the County level and through
representatives in each of the affected townships and villages, are responsible for
the implementation of the plan. Supervision of implementation will be provided
through furnishing an SR in each province to ensure quality and timely progress
on resettlement works.
(e) In addition, as noted in the project EIA, each province will establish an EMO to
have primary responsibility for ensuring that the resettlement program design
and implementation will comply with the EPMs specified in the project EIA.
The PMO will arrange for appointment in each village of a VEO to be
responsible for environmental management and reporting on resettlement
progress, while the provincial EMO and ECIs will supervise planning and
development public health infrastructure and waste management practices in the
resettled villages.
(f) Monitoring will be provided by an IMEO to regularly evaluate the progress of
resettlement, including the social and economic rehabilitation of affected
populations, and to provide direction and advice to the SR and PMO for
adequate performance and in the resolution of outstanding problems. IMEO
reports will be furnished to both the PMO and the World Bank.
(g) Successful implementation of the resettlement program will require sizeable
investment in training of resettlement staff in resettlement technology, and of
resettlers in undertaking new production techniques and industry skills. The

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP      CHAPTER 7: ONSLJLTATION AND AJDJUSTMENTS
7. Public Consultation and Social Adjustments
7.1 Introduction
Chapter 7 describes the specific measures planned to ensure the successful adjustment
of affected population following resettlement, including; preferential policies and
other assistance available to resettlers, mechanisms for participatiion of affected
populations in the development of the resettlement program, description of the
grievance system through which resettlers may seek redress if required, and the.
establishment of "safety net" plans to account for rectification of unforeseen
circumstances where resettlers are unable to restore livelihoods following resettlement
7.2 Preferential Policies for Project Affected People
Provincial Governments will abide by the National Policy to encourage and support
development resettlement through compensation and production support. To assist
resettlers in re-establishing their housing and livelihood after resettlement, resettlers
will be eligible for the following preferential policies:
(a) In each of the project provinces, the relevant Land Management Implementation
Method Ordinances [Refs. 16-173 allows for tax and levy deduction for acquired
lands, and for exemptions or reductions in the associated grain quotas, thereby
supporting both the resettlers and host communities. All resettlers will be entitled
to such reductions in land taxes and levies, and grain quotas for rural resettlers will
also be reduced accordingly.
(b) In addition, industrial, agricultural and animal husbandry taxes ;and levies at the
county and township levels will be adjusted in accordance with the magnitude of
impact in each administrative area.
(c) The resettlement budget included a contingency for the support of vulnerable
groups if they are disadvantaged by the project and due to unforeseen
circumstances, unable to restore their livelihood under the proposed RAP.
(d) In the year of resettlement, resettlers will be exempted from the requirement for
contribution of annual labor to dike maintenance.
(e) In accordance with the provincial Ten Year Plans, industrial projects concerning
the industrial and agricultural development in the affected areas will be given
priority, especially those projects relying on resources from the affected areas. The
resettlers should be given preferential treatment in employment.
(f) The resettlers have the right to enjoy the benefits of the applicable national poverty
support policies, and the affected counties will be given priority when granting
social development fund monies for selected aspects, such as irrigation,
transportation, telecommunication, poverty support, forestry, loans, education and
health service etc.
Compensation paid for lost or impeded modes of production are to be utilized for
recovery and development of production such that employment of the affected people
can be maintained or improved. To ensure the effective and assigned use of such
compensation, it is to be paid to, and managed by CoROs. In this way, the
multidisciplinary expertise of local governments can be utilized in planning and
establishing viable and equitable production systems and enterprises in a timely
manner, avoiding the risk or individual mis-management or poor investment decisions
7-1



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP      CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
if compensation were paid directly to resettlers. One task of the IMEO will be review
of the proposed usage of these funds by the CoROs, ensuring the proposed
development plans effectively target the needs of the resettlers.
7.3 Special Measures to Assist Affected Parties
(a) In each village, special assistance from village administration will be extended to
vulnerable groups within the community (such as economically disadvantaged
groups, widows, and the elderly living alone), particularly in regard to purchase
and construction of replacement housing. As mentioned above;- contingency
funding for the support of vulnerable groups will be available, in addition to the
special compensation allowance included in the project budget for vulnerable
groups.
(b) During the relocation process, local governments will formulate comprehensive
safety measures, provide necessary vehicles, helpers and temporary lodgings,
designate safety inspection workers, maintain orderly transportation conditions,
protect the safety of the resettlers' lives and properties, and make sure resettlement
progress smoothly.
When resettlers or residents within the relocation area encounters unforeseeable
difficulties, assistance could be sought through the following means:
(a) Local and provincial agencies may enact additional policies to support resettlers in
re-establishment of housing and income generation. Such policies may involve
supplernentary tax reductions, production quota waivers or priority employment or
training for improved production or alternative income generation activities.
(b) Local government loans and subsidies
The key to effective benefit from such policies comes in the early identification of
non-recovering affected people, which is the responsibility of the Supervisor of
Resettlement and the Independent Monitoring and Evaluating Organization.
7.4 Adjustments for the Transition Period
Resettlement is a complex task with widespread involvement and long
implementation times, and effective management of the transitional period is of vital
importance to the whole resettlement process. To support the successful realization of
this period, consultations with affected people have and will continue to be
undertaken in order to ascertain their preferences (as discussed in Section 7.5.2 for
Hunan Province) for resettlement sites and future activities. Particular efforts are
made to relocate resettlers of similar background (relatives, neighbors, communities)
to the same place in order to minimize their psychological pressure and anxiety during
the transition period.
The resettlement plan includes compensation allowance for temporary
accommodation, and losses of employment suffered during the transition period.
Compensation disbursements for affected structures and allocation of replacement
house plots/sites will be undertaken a minimum of three months in advance of
housing demolition to provide adequate time for resettlers to replace housing, and
thus minimize any temporary accommodation requirements.
In addition, in the transition period, many resettlers are unwilling to take risks. They
keep a conservative attitude and pay special notice to safeguarding their basic
7-2



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
livelihood needs. Hence, during the initial period when the resettlers have just settled
down, special attention is, and will continue to be paid by Resettlement Offices and
Village Leaders to make them feel secure about their new livelihood and production.
Ensuring the successful transition of the affected people will be achieved by various
means including: providing key infrastructures such as water supply, electricity, roads
and waste management as a component of the resettlement scheme; loans; technical
and training services about agriculture, secondary and tertiary industries to facilitate
their transition into new or altered livelihood systems; health services; assistance in
marketing of new services and products generated;; establishment of r esettler oriented
action groups; organization of activities to promote resettler activity and
independence and minimize the difficulties encountered. Together, these initiatives
will provide a solid base restoration of resettler livelihoods and community.
It is important to mention that even when compensation disbursements for housing
reconstruction and assets area made, experience suggests that many resettlers will
await a reduction in demand for construction materials, or slowly build their own
replacement housing, staying with relatives in their village. This may be the case in
the internal resettlement villages where usually only a small percentage of the village
must relocate and thus relatives are able to furnish accommodation.
During the transition period, resettlers will be able to rely on the compensation paid
for the crops on their acquired lands. As land acquisition has been scheduled to allow
for harvest of the seasons yield, farmers will effectively gain a double income for the
crop in the year of acquisition, providing a significant individual transitional support
fund.
7.5 Public Consultation
Public awareness and participation in resettlement planning has been strong in both
provinces to date. Villagers and Government Officials have been consulted in regard
to selection of relocation sites, and development of alternative production resettlement
schemes.
As illustrated in Figure 7-1, and described below, the resettlement planning cycle
explicitly involves information dissemination to and collection from resettlers and
relevant officials, and also their consultation and participation, by means of meetings
and discussions with resettler representatives, negotiation and entering of agreements
with affected parties, involvement in asset inventories, and sampling of resettlers'
intentions. The process of resettler involvement in the planning and implementation
process is described below, and Table 7-1 lists the activities undertaken to date in the
both provinces.
7.5.1 Participation of Affected People and Representatives
Step 1 - A draft plan is formulated before the site investigation is carried out, into
which the advice and suggestions of local governments regarding the scope, methods,
and requirements of investigation is incorporated.
Step 2 - When the inventory is being carried out, the Township, village and
production team leaders and resettlers take part in the investigal:ion, at which time
they are informed of the necessity of project construction, benefits and impact of the
project, compensation criteria and resettlement progress etc., and potential relocation
destinations for resettlers are discussed. As the inventory team progresses through the
affected villages, village meetings are held where all villagers are invited, including
women. Although not all members may participate, information is effectively
7-3



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
dispersed to the comnmunity through "word-of-mouth" following such large
gatherings.
Step 3 - During the resettlement planning stage, PPIs hold further discussions with
city, county and township officials to listen to their advice, requirements and existing
problems, and decide on the relocation destinations. In addition, further sample
surveys are undertaken to establish more detailed resettler preferences and attitudes.
An essential component of the planning process is the development of entitlement
booklets to be disseminated to every affected household. These booklets (as utilized
on the Xiaolangdi Reservoir resettlement project [Ref. 22] will outline resettler
entitlements (including compensation rates, basis for calculation, schedule for
disbursement, entitlement to tax and quota reductions and operation of the grievance
mechanism) and responsibilities of both the resettlers and resettlement implementing
organizations (including requirements for relocation, designated responsibilities for
infrastructure replacement, land allocation and development proposals and
entitlements including training).
Step 4 - Agreements are made with the affected resettlement and host villages in
regard to the loss of village assets and land, compensation rates, relocation sites and
methods, timing for implementation and the responsibilities of each party. If the
proposed resettlement plans are not acceptable to the affected villages, further
planning must be undertaken in consideration of the village requirements.
Step 5 - On agreement with the villages, individual households must also be in
agreement with the proposed conditions. Where resettlers cannot accept the proposed
plan, again, further modifications must be made in planning to resolve outstanding
issues. On final agreement, the modified entitlement booklets are distributed to every
affected household.
As outlined in the agreed resettlement program, active participation in all aspects of
the consequent resettlement implementation is paramount to its successful conclusion.
During resettlement implementation, participation of affected populations will be
essential in:
* House Construction - in rural resettlement situations, resettlers will be responsible
for construction of their replacement housing, undertaking it themselves, or hiring
contractors for the task. Resettlers will be able to salvage materials from their
acquired residence for use in the new sites, or other purposes, and will be bound to
demolish their original housing by the agreed date. Issuance of documents
formalizing the transfer of land and housing registration will be completed.
* Training - based on the conditions in the resettlement area, and the expressed
preferences of the resettlers, training resettlers are to be provided, as necessary, to
support the restoration and facilitate the betterment of pre-relocation incomes.
* Grievances and Complaints - resettlers and host populations will be encouraged to
utilize the grievance procedures (discussed below in Chapter 7.7), which provides
the mechanism for resolution of problems and overall identification of any
shortfallings in resettlement implementation at the village level (as discussed in
Section 7.7). Familiarity with the existence and operation of the process will be
ensures through the issuance of the entitlement booklets distributed to every
household.
During both training courses, and through Village Leaders, resettlers and hosts should
be encouraged to form or utilize new mutual interest and mutual benefit groups within
the village, and perhaps between villages. These groups could be both social and
7-4



YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
production related. Such groups could enhance the restoration of livelihoods through
the benefit of learning from shared experience, and generate cohesion in the altered
social environment. In addition, such organizations would more effectively be able to
identify problems and convey these to the Village Leader and ROs, and represent the
community in village meetings and visits undertaken by the IMEO.
The IMEO and will continue to collect data from affected commwuities relating to
income and lifestyle changes post-resettlement through data collection in sample
populations.
7.5.2 Survey of Resettler Preferences
The HnPPI conducted a sampling survey of resettlers' intentions. The study sampled
281 households, accounting for 6.3 percent of the total resettling households in
Hunan. This Study found that: all of the resettlers have a supportive attitude toward
this project, with 75.4 percent believing the project will have a major impact on them,
18.1 percent believing the impact to be small, and 6.5 percent believing the impact to
be very small. Most resettlers indicated a preference for relocation, a short distance
set-back form their current site (44.5 percent), or relocation with other members of the
community to alternative sites (33.8 percent)., with 21.7 percent selecting alternative
means. Surveys in regard to re-establishment of production showed that 31 percent
prefer to shift land within the village, 37 percent prefer to change to work in
secondary and tertiary industries, while 32 percent indicted preference for altemative
means, such as land transformation.
7.5.3 General Project Stakeholders
Opinions of various project stakeholders, including, but not limited to resettlers and
host communities have been undertaken as part of the EIA studies including contact
with the general public on their attitudes and opinions. Interviews have been held,
and questionnaires sent out relating to the various aspects of the YDSP to gauge
public opinion, and identify major issues in the public mind.
It is significant to note that many of the people interviewed raised issues relating to
resettlement as of primary concern to them. In particular, most expressed hope that
resettlement planning and compensation would be adequate.
These views were also reflected in further surveys and interviews held primarily with
representatives from government, as well as non-governmenital and business
organizations. Those interviewed were generally of a high education level, working
for agencies of education, health care, water resources, environmental protection,
commerce, forestry and so on. Their specialties covered indusl.ry and commerce,
medical science, forestry, water resources, law, literature, economics, news, civil
engineering and environment science etc. Some were members of parties of China
Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, China Democratic League, China
Association for Promoting Democracy, Chiu San Society, Revolutionary Committee
of the Kuomingtang, Workers' Union etc. Of these responses, sixteen of the thirty
eight respondents made special comment in regard to resettlement planning and
compensation adequacy and the disclose and publicity of the proposed plan.
These surveys highlight the prominence of resettlement manag-ment issues in the
minds of the public in the project area, and the necessity for continued awareness and
participation of project affected people and the public throughout implementation and
7-5



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
reestablishment of affected communities.
7.6 Publicizing Resettlement Information
7.6.1 Information Dissemination during Planning
From project inception up to the end of resettlement implementation, information on
the project and the resettlement related national laws and regulations have and
continue to be publicized through public participation activities (such as interviews
and discussions as illustrated in Table 7-1). Resettlement workers and local
govermments are responsible for informing project affected people of the following:
affected assets, the calculation process for compensation standards, means of
compensation, relocation methods, the disbursement and utilization of resettlement
compensation, their rights and preferential policies etc. Concurrently, the host
communities must be kept informed of relevant resettlement information, such as land
acquisition, land compensation criteria, utilization of compensation and information
of local resettlers. The issuance of the entitlement booklets will be of paramount
importance in ensuring awareness of all project affected people, enhancing
transparency, and increasing the efficiency of resettlement operations.
7.7 Grievances and Complaints
7.7.1 Possible Causes and Solutions
During the implementation process, grievances may be caused due to unforeseen
circumstances or operational errors. Experience with similar projects show that
resettler grievances are mainly of the following types:
(a) Issues in Regard to Recorded Assets (Inventory)
Errors during the inventory and calculation process, may include omission and
erroneous recording of assets affecting the resettlers' rights. When this problem
happens, either the victim or the village committee report, orally or in written form, to
the county resettlement office, and the resettlement office then processes this report
and sends it to the Employer and the Supervising Party. The Employer organizes
planning personnel and supervising professionals to conduct a field investigation to
verify the problem, and if it is found to be a mistake, the relevant asset is recorded and
compensation made according to determined standards.
(a) Compensation Criteria
Lack of resettler understanding of the national resettlement policies and regulations
leads to doubt as to the sufficiency of compensation criteria. Improved consultation
and information dissemination procedures as described in Section 7.3.2 above have
ensures that planning organizations, in cooperation with local governments and
resettlement offices, make on site plan presentation, explains national resettlement
policies and regulations and the calculation process of compensation criteria. This
approach ensures improved understanding of the project and resettlement standards
and procedures, instilling trust and confidence in the ability of required compensatory
mechanism to support their re-establishment of residential and production lifestyles in
the new locations.
(b)Fund Disbursement
Failure of compensation monies to be disbursed in a timely manner is a serious threat
to efficient livelihood and production resettlement and reestablishment. The inclusion
7-6



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP      CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
of supervising and monitoring personnel with effective control over funding, and
ensuring the progress and quality of all project components, will ensure compensation
is used for its designated purpose. In particular, the supervising and monitoring
parties will with the finance departments to ensure disbursement of fuiids according to
monthly progress monthly, so as to ensure resettlement progress on schedule.
7.7.2 Complaint Channels and Procedure
The Chinese Government has established a complete assurance system to protect the
people's legal rights, which is specified in the Constitution of PRC and the Civil Law
of PRC. With regard to appeal arrangement, offices for letters from, and calls by the
people as well as prosecution offices and courts have been established; and
committees and groups for mediation in civil litigation are available. In cases where
affected people are dissatisfied with the compensation arrangements, certain
procedures are available for seeking solutions.
(a) Complaint Channels
*  PROs have the responsibility to monitor their subsidiary offices in the
implementation of resettlement, and can address resettlers grievances.
*  Citizen Appeal Offices - In all the counties, cities and provinces, where affected
people can lodge complaints;
*  Supervisor of Resettlement (SR) for the project has the responsibility to supervise
local authorities to carry out resettlement implementation lawfully, and may solve
project affected people's grievances through the means of auditing, investigation
and coordination etc.
*  Independent Monitoring and Evaluation Organization monitors resettlement
implementation as required by relevant national regulations. It has the
responsibility to protect resettlers' legal rights and could accept complaints and
report the problems to the parties concerned.
*  Government agencies, such as administration supervision, auditing, discipline
investigation, law enforcement departments, deal with illegal or regulation-
violation cases.
(b) Complaint Procedure
When project affected people are unsatisfied with the resettlement arrangement, they
can report their grievance to the village committee. The village committee may
directly resolve the grievance, (as is this usual case). Where the grievance remains
unresolved after three days, the complaint is filed (either orally or in written fonn) to
the County Resettlement Office. This Resettlement Office makes a record of this
complaint, and negotiates it with the village committee and local resettlement office to
work out a solution within 10 days. If resolution is not achieved, in accordance with
the Administration Litigation Law of China jRef 231, the village committee could
follow the complaint channel (such as the PRO, Citizen Appeal Office,
Administration Supervision Dept., Discipline Investigation and censoring
departments) to file complaints. If the result is not satisfactory, the village comnittee
or the resettler could go to court. All affected villages will be made aware of their
entitlements and responsibilities, and use of the grievance procedure in resolving any
of their complaints or clarifying concerns through the issuance of the resettlement
entitlement booklet issued to each household.
While this system requires the recording of all grievances, this aspect is often
overlooked. This is particularly true at the village level, where grievances are
7-7



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS
primarily conveyed verbally and informally.  However, the recording of all
grievances, irrespective of their form and nature need to be recorded to assist in the
identification of larger trends and to instill the aggrieved parties confidence in the
significance and treatment of their concern. Table 7-2 includes a proforma to be
utilized in every village. These records will be regularly submitted to the CoRO, who
themselves must ensure adequate recording of grievances. Monitoring by the IMEO
will include an evaluation and review of the filed grievances, and ensure adequate and
timely responses to grievances, and utilization of the grievance procedure.
7.8    Relationship between Resettlers and Host Populations
For those resettlers who will re-build their houses only slightly set-back from their
original locations, or at identified resettlement sites nearby, resettlement will not
represent major changes in their living environments. All such internal resettlement
will mean that resettlers relocate within their original village, and thus no change in
community or host/immigrant situation is created. In only eleven villages in Hunan
will this resettlement require the acquisition of land for cultivation from adjacent
villages. In these situations, donor villages have offered to sell their land, and with
the provision of financial compensation, and given that the villages are already
neighbors, friction between the two villages is not anticipated. Project resettlement
monitoring will however also review the satisfaction of both hosts and resettled
villages under such arrangements.
Rural resettlement villages under the YDSP are not expected to act as hosts for
resettlers from other projects in the region. As discussed in Chapter 4.6, resettlement
from the polder areas is occurring in the lake areas and along the tributaries of the
Yangtze to areas nearby and in townships, not towards the Yangtze where the project
villages are located. At the same time, resettlement for upgrade of dike sections
outside the YDSP will similarly focus on internal resettlement and thus instances of
coincidence between resettlers and host populations between the various projects are
not expected, and no additional pressure on land resources or the income restoration
planning undertaken for the YDSP is anticipated.
Similarly, urban resettlers will be relocated in comparable environments and with
other members of their original community. Due to the proximity of relocation sites
and the homogenous culture between resettlers and host populations, for both groups,
adapting to the new communities created is not expected to create unnecessary
friction.. Certainly, this does not mean there will be no conflicts between the two
groups, and so the following activities have, and will continue to be pursued to assist
the integration of the two groups:
(a) Involvement in Planning -Consultation between both groups will ensure familiarity
with their rights, and facilitate their input into the identification and selection of
various alternatives in development of the resettlement plan. This transparency
and participation in planning, in general, will solicit their cooperation, and
encourage continued participation and feedback. Consultation with affected people
may be undertaken directly with them or facilitated through formal and informal
contacts with officials and representatives. Systematic arrangements will be made
in most cases, such as routine meetings between project officials and local groups,
which enables the resettlers and the affected residents to report their opinion on the
resettlement work during the planning and implementation phase.
(b)Provision of Adequate Resources - When the resettlers move into the host
community, the demand for land, water resources, wood, and social services will
7-8



YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 7: ONSULTATION AND AJDJUSTMENTS
increase, creating a potential for conflict due to competition for resources.
Planning for resettlement into host communities has included evaluation of the
capacity of existing services and resources to support the heightened demand.
Where services are determined inadequate, upgrading and expansion has been
planned and budgeted for, such as water supply, electricity and improved road
access. In addition, all resettlement sites will be introduced to improved waste
management practices and new standards for sanitation, which will significantly
improve existing public health conditions.
7.9    Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 7 reviews the activities included in the Resettlement Program relating to
provisions for public consultation and social adjustments to ensure achievement of the
goal that the affected parties (resettler families and the host communities) involved in
the Resettlement Operation are not disadvantaged by the project and to the extent
feasible will share with the project benefits.
Preferential policies specified by the Government and additional policies included in
the YDSP RAP will be available to resettlers. Policies of primary importance to
YDSP resettlers will be:
(a) tax and levy deduction for acquired lands, and for exemptions or reductions in
the associated grain quotas, thereby supporting both the resettlers and host
communities.
(b) industrial, agricultural and animal husbandry taxes and levies at the county and
township levels will be adjusted in accordance with the magnitude of impact in
each administrative area.
(c) The resettlement budget includes a contingency for the support of vulnerable
groups if they are disadvantaged by the project, and due to unforeseen
circumstances, unable to restore their livelihood under the proposed RAP.
(g) In the year of resettlement, resettlers will be exempted from the requirement for
contribution of annual labor to dike maintenance.
Consultation and participation of affected people and their representatives has been an
integral component of the development of the RAP. The process of consultation is
illustrated in Figure 7-1. Essential to the success of the planning and assurance of
resettler acceptance and understanding of the resettlement program is the issuance of
resettlement entitlement booklets (as utilized in the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project),
and the undertaking of agreements with all affected parties.
Grievance redress mechanisms in China are clear (Figure 7-2) and comprehensive,
yet the publication of the existence and use of this mechanism t[o affected people
through incorporation in the resettlement entitlement booklets will be essential to its
effective use, and thus management of resettlement implementation. Comprehensive
recording of grievance and responses and actions at all levels will also be undertaken.
Rural resettlement for the YDSP will primarily occur internal to the affected villages,
thus no host situations are encountered. Due to the geographic separation of the
YDSP and other resettlement ongoing in the region, no coincidence of project affected
villages and resettlement sites for other projects are expected. In eleven cases where

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTER 8: CONTRACTS AN:D AGREEMENTS
8. Resettlement Contracts and Agreements
8.1 Introduction
The project area covers 23 counties in 2 provinces. To strengthen project
management, it is essential for the PMOs to retain Supervisors of Resettlement (SRs)
to work under PMO supervision for overall quality control, and cost and schedule
control during the project implementation. The PMOs themselves can then focus their
efforts on management of components involving large cost estimates or representing
major impacts, and for the conclusion of important contacts and agreements.
Agreements will necessarily be made between resettled and host parties and relevant
local authorities, and contracts between construction contractors and the PMO for
major works and CoROs and villages for smaller works, will be required. The scope
of these contracts and agreements is outlined in this chapter.
8.2 Resettlement Agreements
a) Agreement on total resettlement cost estimates and financial sources: Agreements
on resettlement cost are concluded, on a lump-sum basis, between the PMO and
City ROs (see Attachment 8-1). Similar agreements are then made between
CiROs and CoROs, taking responsibility for completion of required resettlement
tasks within the financial requirements as stated in the agreements.
b) Agreement on resettlement scheme/host site section: Following consensus on
resettlement schemes proposed by the provincial planning institutes together with
counties, agreements will be reached between CoROs and resettlers, with
assistance from township governments, regarding the place and mode of
resettlement, the time of relocation, and the amount of compensation cost among
other things.
c) Agreement on assets to be relocated: Field survey and verification of physical
assets have been completed by the provincial institutes, and formalized with the
signing of family compensation contracts (see Attachment 8-3). Agreement has
also been reached with counties, townships and villages on this basis, and all
materials have been signed and accepted.
d) Agreement on compensation: Agreements on compensation cost will be signed
with local governments prior to the start of relocation, to identify, the amount of
compensation cost, the destination of people, mode of resettlement, and specific
responsibilities and obligations of the parties to the agreements.
e) Land share agreement: To keep host communities well aware of resettlement
planning, agreements on the share of land and other resources will be signed
between resettlers and host communities, with host communities compensated for
their share of land with resettlers, and financial support provided to enhance
productivity and yields (see Attachment 8-2). Specifically, this support may
include: provision of new irrigation facilities, terracing slopeland, improvement of
soil, and cropping of improved varieties in extensive areas. Land compensation
costs for host communities can also be used in this manner to increase agricultural
productivity and/or to fund training in, or establishment of new income sources
other than farming activities.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTER 9: MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
supervision of a Supervisor of Resettlement (SR), (as qualified and authorized by the
Government), with any problems identified and reported to CoROs and PMOs for
early solution with construction contractors, thus avoiding the intensification and
evolution of such problems. It is proposed to contract a single organization for this
work, under separate contracts with each PRO.
9.5.1 Purpose
The SR will exercise schedule, quality and cost control of resettlement
implementation and community infrastructure reestablishment, arrange acceptance of
completed works, in order to facilitate smooth completion of the resettlement
component according to quality and schedule requirements.
9.5.2 Scope of Work and Methodology
The following section, in describing SR work methodology uses the term RO to
represent the RO at the relevant level for the construction works involved.
a) Supervision Prior to Resettlement
* Review of the institutional arrangements and schedule proposed by ROs and
contractors and completion of resettlement schedule (see Attachment 9-B,
Schedule 1);
* Review of the labor arrangements, building materials and construction equipment
supply plans proposed by resettlement implementation organizations on the basis
of the schedule and complete labor arrangement, building material and construction
equipment supply plan review form (see Attachment 9-B, Schedule 2);

quarterly statement of income and expenditure) provided by the ROs, to enable
proper financing and application of resettlement costs, and complete balance sheet
review form(see Attachment 9-B, Schedule 3);
* Review of community infrastructure subcontractors, partners and suppliers selected
by the ROs, and complete subcontractor, partner and supplier qualification review
form (see Attachment 9-B, Schedule 4). When a contractor is selected according
to the conditions of contract, normally no subcontractor or partner shall be
otherwise selected unless approved by the supervision engineer;
* Review the task managers selected to be responsible for comnmunity infrastructure
reconstruction and production reestablishment projects. The contractor will provide
infornation on the past experience of the candidates, including experience in
similar projects, to the SR for review, with task manager qualification review form
completed (see Attachment 9-B, Schedule 5); and
* Careful review of resettlement sites prior to the start of resettlement, to ensure
readiness, before approval can be given for the commencement of the project, and
cause ROs to start work as provided for in the contract.
b) Quality Control
9-7



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP       CHAPTER 9: MONITORING ANID SUPERVISION
* The SR will examine the perfornance of ROs field management and quality
control systems, which will in turn require the contractor to properly handle his
internal quality control and construction records. Any inadequacies will be
promptly reported to ROs for early correction;
* The SR will arrange inspection and acceptance of completed projects. When any
residential site, production reestablishment project or community infrastructure is
completed, the engineer will be given 2 days notice to be present at the inspection
and acceptance. Representatives of relevant resettlers or departments will be
invited to be present at such inspection and acceptance. Where approval is granted,
a resettlement quality assessment form will be prepared and completed(see
Attachment 9-B, Schedule 6);
* The project acceptance standard will be determined according to design
requirements, to conform with the standard as agreed by the RO and the owner;
* The SR will propose, with due care, solutions to any quality accidents encountered
in the process of resettlement, and make a record of such instances with a
resettlement project quality accident (non-conformance) review form and quality
problem notice (see Attachment 9-B, Schedules 7, 8). In the event of any major
accident, on-the-spot material evidence will be photographed or videotaped
evidence will be appended to these records (see Attachment 9-B, Schedule 9); and
- The SR will be entitled to instruct suspension of work due to quality accidents or
any other reasonable reasons in the process of resettlement, with notices of
suspension prepared and issued Work will be not be resumed unless quality
problems are solved and the RO has received the RS's notice of resumption. (see
Attachment 9-B, Schedule 10).
c) Resettlement Schedule Control
* The SR will check resettlement progress on a monthly basis, and prepare
supervision monthly reports. In the event of any delay or dispute related to
construction progress, the SR will notify the RO, in writing, for prompt remedial
actions; and
* RO are obliged to complete their resettlement tasks on schedule as stated in the
contract, and in accordance with any approved extension to the completion date.
Approval of any extension, will be subject to the SR's review and the owner's
approval, with written notice given to the RO.
d) Resettlement Cost Control
* ROs and construction contractors are obliged to complete their resettlement tasks
within the resettlement budget as included in the contract. In the event of any
variation of work quantities and increase/decrease of items as a result of design
changes, detailed prices or unit rates will be estimated by the RO, and then directly
verified or amended by the SR, with a written confirmation given to RO and the
owner for implementation;
9-8



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP         CHAPTER 9: MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
* Resettlement costs will be paid in installment according to the terms of payment as
stated in the contract. Prior to each payment, the SR will carefully check the
quantity and quality of completed work, calculate the due amount of payment,
check that the interim payment requested by ROs and contractors is consistent with
the quantity of completed work. Payment certificates will be issued after
examination, permitting payment to be made by responsible departments; and
* For community infrastructures to be undertaken by contractors or subcontractors,
5% of each installment shall be retained, and paid to contractors or subcontractors
upon the expiry of default liabilities.
e) Resettlement Project Acceptance
* When the resettlement component is completed (or partly completed), the SR will
participate in the initial inspection and acceptance of the whole or part of works,
with any ungraded works (or location) carefully recorded according to the contract
and design requirements, then corrected or rebuilt by contractors (see Attachment
9-A, Schedule 1O)and ROs until meeting quality standards and requirements, and
finally formally accepted by the SR. If the acceptance is granted, certificates of
completed resettlement project acceptance will be issued by the SR together with
relevant organizations. The date of signature will be the date of completion;
- Upon completion of the resettlement component, the SR will hand over all and any
related technical file to the owner for record; and
* For any project where 5% of costs have been retained, the SR will require the
contractor to adequately remedy any defects in the defaults liability period. A

responsible for the coordination of YDSP resettlement operations throughout the
project provinces. The ORC will report to a committee comprising a representative
from each PRO. The ORC, working with each PRO, will prepare reports describing
the overall status of the YDSP resettlement, incorporating the results of each
province's monitoring. The ORC can then provide the necessary suipport to POE and
other World Bank missions as required. This support will involve furnishing these
regular reports to the missions, facilitating field visits and meetings with relevant
agencies, and responding to various queries as required.
9.7  International Panel of Experts on Resettlement
9.7.1 Need for Panel
An International Panel of Experts on resettlement (POE) will be established to make
periodic evaluations of project resettlement performance and based on this to make
recommendation on measures which may need to be taken so that project resettlement
perfornance will comply with requirements specified in the Government-Bank Loan
Agreement for the project. The POE is to be an independent panel, reporting both to
the Government and the Bank, but with administrative services for the panel's
function furnished by the Governrnent. The POE is expected to be of significant
guidance in planning/implementing the resettlement program, and to be beneficial to
the early resolution of complex problems to be encountered in resettlement work, thus
avoiding delays and losses, and helping to ensure smooth progress.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTER 9: MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
9.7.2 Establishment of Panel
The Panel will be comprise three experts in resettlement, including 1 foreign and 2
local experts. These experts are to be persons who are not MWR staff and who are not
WB staff. The suggested list of experts includes: Ferguson, Shi Guoqing, and Wan
Guosheng.
9.7.3 Responsibilities of Panel
The Panel will review and evaluate the overall resettlement progress, including
resettlement work done by all agencies involved in the resettlement program. The
work of the Panel will include not only review/evaluation of resettlement progress but
furnishing of assistance to any/all agencies involved in the resettlement program to
help in the resolution of outstanding significant problems.
9.7.4 Schedule
Two Panel meetings, each of 12 working days (plus travel time) will be held each year
from 2000 to 2003, covering the period of project construction. At a later time the
Government and Bank will evaluate the possible need for Panel function during the
operation period following completion at construction. The first meeting is scheduled
to take place in June 2000.
9.7.5 Reporting System
a) For each meeting of the Panel the ORC will prepare a report, to be given to the
Panel at start of its meeting, which represents a comprehensive review of
resettlement progress over the reporting period. In addition, the ORC will furnish
to the Panel at the start a memorandum which presents and explains the
recommended work program for the Panel on a day-by-day basis, and which
delineates the specific problems to which the Panel should give priority attention.
b) Each Panel member will prepare their own report on the Panel's
review/evaluation. There will be annexes to the Overall Panel report.
c) The foreign member will be in the lead for preparing the Overall Panel Reports
based on the two individual reports, to produce a final Overall Report which
represents the Panel consensus.
d) The Overall Panel Report, including the individual annex reports, are to be
submitted both to the Govenmment and the Bank.
9.7.6 Cost Estimate
The Panel cost estimate is included in foreign expenditures, and estimated at a total of
2.1 million yuan.
9.8  Summary and Conclusions
Efficient supervision and monitoring are key to effective implementation of the
resettlement program.   Both intemal and extemal (independent) monitoring
mechanisms are needed to ensure a transparent and smooth resettlement
implementation program.
Resettlement monitoring requires the integration of various parameters reflecting both
9-11



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP         CHAPTER 9: MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
the timely and satisfactory progress of physical works and prograrmned activities, as
well as the performance of resettled communities and implementing organizations in
achieving production reestablishment goals and social integration. Other monitoring
indicators include timely and correct disbursement of funds, contracts performance,
conclusion of agreements, reestablishment of vulnerable groups, site preparation,
transition period arrangements, safety network and project management and
resettlement organization and training.
Public consultation and grievance redressal are ke~y aspects of resettlement monitoring
and supervision. Consultation needs to be undertaken at regular intervals with both the
resettler population and the host communities' including women and vulnerable
groups. Well defined channels of grievance registration need to be put in place and
procedures for speedy resolution of any problems and disputes.
In YDSP resettlement, the PMOs will be responsible for internal monitoring of land
acquisition and resettlement work. The responsible PMO staff will have appropriate
experience and will facilitate coordination between different agencies involved in
resettlement. Training will be imparted to staff in monitoring and supervision as
detailed in Chapter 6. The PMOs will monitor the performance of ROs at various
levels (cities, counties, and village) during project implementation, coordinating
resettlement work by all parties, and keeping abreast of resettlement: implementation
status. Key activities will include (i) resettler relocation, sites allocation and housing
progress, (ii) quality of production reestablishment projects, (iii) recommendation on
any problems encountered  in  implementation, (iv) income restoration, (v)
infrastructure and community facility construction, (vi) reestablishment of vulnerable
groups, (vii) timely disbursement of funds, (viii) maintaining public consultation,
(viii) resettlement training services, and (ix) project and organization management.
The PMO will submit monitoring summary reports to the Overall Resettlement
Coordinator and World Bank twice a year.
An Independent Monitoring and Evaluation Organization (IMEO) viz., the Yellow
River Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation Co. Ltd. will be retained by the PMOs
for monitoring and evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement work under the
YDSP. Responsibilities of the IMEO will include technical consultation services,
monitor and supervise overall resettlement implementation, evaluate the resettlement
supervision organizations (SRs), and report resettlement to the PMOs/PROs and the
ORC on the status of resettlement progress. The IMEO will also take part in periodic
public consultation meetings at village and township levels. During its periodic site
visits the IMEO will evaluate public complaints and monitor t]he efficiency of
grievance redressal process and make recommendations as necessary on any possible
change to the process. The duration of independent monitoring and evaluation will
cover the project construction period and a two-year period after project completion.
A common IMEO is expected to be contracted by each of the project provinces by the
end of May 2000.
Supervision of resettlement will be delegated to a Supervisor of Resettlement (SR)
who will supervise resettlement implementation, resettlement project cost, and
identify any short-comings and report to ROs and PMOs for early solution with
construction contractors, thus avoiding the intensification and evolution of such
problems. The SR will exercise schedule, quality and cost contro[ of resettlement

implementation and community infrastructure reestablishment, arrange acceptance of
completed works, in order to facilitate smooth completion of the resettlement
component according to quality and schedule requirements. The SR will include head
office staff and field supervision teams. Typical staff profile will include a chief
engineer, and 2 full-time staff to be responsible for office and field work. Supervision
work will start no later than May 2000, and financial estimates put the total cost at
8.21 million yuan and have been included in the total resettlement cost estimate.
A position of an Overall Resettlement Coordinator (ORC) will be created at the
Central Project Coordination Office (CPCO), who will coordinate the resettlement
operations in the two provinces. The ORC will work with an overall resettlement
coordination committee comprising one representative from each of the PROs. The
ORC will report to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Yangzte Water Resource
Commission (CWRC) and the World Bank on matters pertaining to YDSP
resettlement. The ORC, working with each PRO, will prepare reports describing the
overall status of the YDSP resettlement, incorporating the results of each province's
monitoring and reporting to the Panel of Experts (POE), the World Bank missions and
MWR and CWRC officials as required. This support will involve furnishing these
regular reports to the missions, facilitating field visits and meetings with relevant
agencies, and responding to various queries as required.
A Panel of Experts (POE) on Resettlement will be established to make periodic
evaluations of project resettlement performance and provide recommendation on
measures which may need to be taken so that project resettlement performance will
comply with requirements specified in the Government-Bank Loan Agreement for the
project. The POE is to be an independent panel, reporting both to the Government and
the Bank and is expected to provide guidance in planning/implementing the overall
resettlement program. Two Panel meetings, of 12 days duration have been planned
each year from 2000 to 2003, covering the period of project construction. At a later
time the Government and Bank will evaluate the possible need for Panel function
during the operation period. After each meeting of the Panel the ORC will prepare a
report, to be given to the Panel at start of its meeting, which represents a
comprehensive review of resettlement progress over the reporting period. In addition,
the ORC will furnish to the Panel at the start a memorandum which presents and
explains the recommended work program for the Panel on a day-by-day basis, and
which delineates the specific problems to which the Panel should give priority
attention. Each Panel member will prepare their own report on the Panel's
review/evaluation.  The Overall Panel Report will be submitted both to the
Government and the World Bank. The cost for POE has been estimated at 2.1 million
yuan and is included in the foreign currency component of the resettlement budget.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP         CHAPTER10:IMPLEIENTATION SCHEDULING
10. Resettlement Implementation Scheduling
10.1  Introduction
Review of experiences elsewhere in China (and in other developing countries) shows
that incorporating resettlement made into the planning of major projects is difficult
too achieve, simply because this type of detailed resettlement planning is relatively
new in major project planning history in all developing countries,, and became the
primary interest of the planners is focused on achieving the project's engineering
construction  goals,  resulting  in  insufficient  attention  to  resettlement
planning/implementation so that when the time cover for people to move, the
resettlement facilities for living/employment are not yet ready. Based on these lessons,
a very important part of the present project's resettlement program is to ensure that
adequate attention is given to the project's resettlement cornponent so that
resettlement will proceed as scheduled with the houses/community facilities ready to
receive them and with arrangements already completed to enable theim to begin proper
earnings in their new situations. Chapter 10 presents the schedule for implementation
of the tasks described in the RAP, and the status of implementation to date, including
an outline of agreements made for ensuring implementation standards meet those
described in this RAP.
10.2 Principles for Scheduling
a) Set-back Houses: Because the resettlers in these instances are primarily rural
villagers, limitation related to agricultural production must be considered while
formulating the schedule. Land acquisition, relocation and house construction should
be scheduled for the idle period, i.e. from September to April, to minimize the impact
on agricultural production.
b) Resettlement Sites: Because the resettlers are mainly rural township residents,
seasonal impact on production is minimal. Land acquisition and relocation may
therefore be undertaken at any time throughout the year, but completed in advance of
construction.
c) Payment of. compensation, and allocation of replacement house plots should
commence at least 3 months before the dismantling of houses.
d) The establishment/reestablishment of public utilities/infrastru,cture should be
completed before housing construction starts to minimize the impact on the livelihood
of the resettlers.
e) At the major sites where resettlement workload is rather light, resettlement should
be completed in one phase. At those places with a heavy resettlement workload,
resettlement should be divided into not more than 3 phases.
f) The reconstruction of the community infrastructure should be scheduled during the
final phases of dyke works each year so as to minimize the impact of project
construction on the Major Items.
g) Training for resettlers is scheduled for 3 periods per year, each lasting 30 days.
These sessions would be timed for ebb periods, one third, halfway into, and at the
closure of the agricultural production season.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTERlO:IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULING
10.3   Schedule for Resettlement Implementation
The duration of resettlement implementation is estimated at some five years. In
Hunan, plans and implementation will span from August 1998 to July of 2001 and in
Hubei from June 2000 to June 2003.
The detailed resettlement implementation schedule is shown in Figure 10-1.
10.4 Implementation Status
Implementation of priority project works commenced urgently following the 1998
floods, and thus resettlement is underway throughout the project area. As described
below, the dis-aggregation of YDSP resettlement data from the overall flood control
projects being undertaken is difficult as World Bank participation remains to be
confuined. The status described below is based on consultation and data collection
undertaken with resettlement implementing organizations in the project provinces.
In Hubei, project implementation is awaiting confirmation of World Bank
participation. Resettlement in Hunan has commenced from 1998, and up to now 3566
households with 15369 resettlers have been relocated.
10.4.1 Compensation Standards and Funds Availability
As involvement of the World Bank and confirmation of the YDSP as a separate
project within the overall program is yet to be confirmed, resettlement is being
undertaken according to a wide range of compensation standards and modes of
disbursement within the project area, a situation governed primarily by the availability
of funds.
In general, adequacy of currently implemented compensation standards are
inadequate.
The PMOs have committed to complying with the compensation standards stated in
the YDSP RAP in accordance with the appropriate local and national regulations. In
doing so, current compensation standards for all project areas will be made uniform,
and supplementary compensation to resettlers already compensated at the lower
standards will be made to the YDSP RAP standards.
10.4.2 Housing Restoration
Rural house plot allocations have been provided in conformance with standards
described in the RAP. In each intemal resettlement area visited these were less than
300 meters from the original sites, and all of the resettlers interviewed were satisfied
with the location of the new sites.
Rural housing reconstruction has been managed by resettlers, based on both
recommended layouts and individual preferences. In most instances, resettlers have
made significant increase in size and quality of housing.
While no resettlement to townships has yet been undertaken, sites have been
identified, and resettlers interviewed in Hunan were aware of, and satisfied with the
relocation sites and proposed conditions.
Effective implementation of the rural households restoration program is currently
limited by the following:
10-2



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTERIO:IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULING
Compensation for rural structures has been less than adequate for housing
replacement, leaving resettlers to rely on personal savings and loans.
Disbursement scheduling in most instances has been linked to the commencement of
demolition of existing houses, leaving no time for resettlers to construct replacement
housing in advance of relocation and thus extending perio(ds of temporary
accommodation.
In addition to application of the proposed compensation standards as described- in
Chapter 10.4.1 above, the following measure is proposed to improve rural housing
restoration:
Commencement of disbursement a minimum of three months in advance of demolition
to allow for house completion before demolition, thus avoiding (or at least
minimizing) any needfor temporary accommodation.
10.4.3 Enterprises and Public Buildings
Compensation for enterprise structures is below the required standard, being provided
only for structures, and not for lost production and wages, or associated facilities,
causing loss in employment, and in some cases stalling restoration of enterprises or
public buildings.
Similar to issues of rural housing restoration, enterprise reconstruction is further
stifled by the lateness of disbursement. Rectification of the compensation standards
(including compensation for lost production and wages) and futjre adherence to
disbursement timing described in the RAP and as agreed by the PMOs will address
these shortcomings.
10.4.4 Land Development and Income Restoration
Compensation standards for land, where proposed, are below standard, and in most
instances have not yet been disbursed, preventing rural land development and
consequent land re-allocation and livelihood restoration programs.
Where compensation was provided for lost crops, this was below the standards
proposed in the RAP.
This situation is primarily linked to the availability of funds, which will be resolved
on the disbursement of fiinds in compliance with the compensations standards
recommended in the RAP.
The County/Township ROs have agreed to carry out land readjustment and provide
land/productive compensation as soon as possible in accordance with the guidelines
and standards specified in the RAP which will fund land improvement and
agricultural extension activities to improve the productivity of the land available to
resettlers after relocation.
10.4.5 Infrastructure
In the rural and urban sites visited, infrastructure restoration was minor or not
required. In the affected areas visited, infrastructure restoration had been completed
and was of acceptable standards.
10.4.6 Resettlement Organization and Management
Consultation with Provincial, City, and County ROs, and relevant township and
10-3



YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP          CHAPTER10:11IPLEMENTATION SCHEDULING
village officials highlighted the necessity for immediate implementation of the
training program, and staffing levels proposed in the RAP.
Management of resettlement information at all levels was poor, insufficient levels of
permanent staff are allocated to the resettlement task, and little coordination between
the various levels was evident.
The PMOs have committed to the following
Confirm establishment of project specific ROs at all levels, with staffing in
accordance with the requirements outlined in the RAP.
Commencement of the proposed training programs for the ROs by the end of May,
2000, and issuance of guidelines on the management of funds to all ROs.
Appointment of Independent Monitoring and Evaluation Organizations and
Supervisors for Resettlement at May, 2000.
10.4.7 Public Consultation and Social Adjustment
In rural areas, resettlers have participated in inventories, and signed off on their
affected assets, however they do not hold agreements in regard to compensation, and
although they felt compensation standards were too low, did not see any avenues for
redress.
Commensurate with the application of the compensation standards recommended in
the RAP, the following actions will be taken:
Agreements to be made with all affected households, enterprises and villages (for both
future resettlement and in areas where resettlement has already commenced).
Arrangement of relevant land tax, levy and grain quota reductions where appropriate
for resettlers.
Arrangement for the exemption of resettlers from the requisite annual labor on dike
maintenance in the year of resettlement.
Immediate preparation and issuance of the resettlement entitlement booklets which
describe compensation standards and other entitlements, the grievance process,
income restoration programs, and the responsibilities of both resettlers and
resettlement implementing organizations in realizing the RAP.
10.5 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter 10 outlines the major criteria in determining resettlement scheduling and
presents proposed resettlement schedules for the three provinces which accords with
these guiding principles by; (i) avoiding timing of construction which will disrupt
agricultural production, (ii) ensuring compensation and land allocation to resettlers a
minimum of 3 months in advance of relocation, (iii) provision or replacement of
infrastructure and utilities in advance of resettlement, (iv) scheduling resettlement
construction to minimize impacts on the overall YDSP works, and (v) scheduling
resettler training in production ebb periods
Resettlement for the YDSP is scheduled for implementation following the floods of
1998 through to the end of 2003. Resettlement activities have commenced in Hunan
province. As involvement of the World Bank and confirmation of the YDSP as a
separate project within the overall program is yet to be confirmed, resettlement is

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP         CHAPTER10:IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULING
being undertaken according to a wide range of compensation standards and modes of
disbursement within the project area, a situation governed primarily by the availability
of funds.
During field visits to project areas, several aspects of household restoration and
resettlement were observed to be progressing well:
Rural house plot allocations have been provided in conformance with standards
described in the RAP. In each internal resettlement area visited these were less than
300 meters from the original sites, and all of the resettlers interviewed were satisfied
with the location of the new sites.
Rural housing reconstruction has been managed by resettlers, based on both
recommended layouts and individual preferences. In most instances, resettlers have
made significant increase in size and quality of housing.
While no resettlement to townships has yet been undertaken, sites have been
identified, and resettlers interviewed in Hunan were aware of, and satisfied with the
relocation sites and proposed conditions.
In rural areas, resettlers remarked that they had participated in invenitories, signed off
on their affected assets, and were aware of the schedule and program for resettlement.
Consultations with resettlement implementing agencies, and field visits also identified
areas where improvements are required. These area, and the agreements reached with
the PMOs in regard to specific activities required to address these and elevate the
current program to RAP standards are outlined below:
Current staff levels are inadequate for the large resettlement task ahead, and are in
need of immediate implementation of the resettlement staff training program
described in the RAP.
Confirm establishment of project specific ROs at all levels, with staffmng in
accordance with the requirements outlined in the RAP.
Commencement of the proposed training programs for the ROs by the end of May,
2000, and issuance of guidelines on the management of funds to all ROs.
Compensation for rural structures has been less than adequate for housing
replacement, leaving resettlers to rely on personal savings and loans.
Compensation standards for land, where proposed, are below standiard, and in most
instances have not yet been disbursed, preventing rural land development and
consequent land re-allocation and livelihood restoration programs.
Compensation for enterprise structures is below the required standard, being provided
only for structures, and not for lost production and wages, or associated facilities,
causing loss in employment, and in some cases stalling restoration of enterprises or
public buildings.
Where compensation was provided for lost crops, this was below the standards
proposed in the RAP.
The PMOs have committed to complying with the compensation standards stated in
the YDSP RAP in accordance with the appropriate local and national regulations by
the end of July 2000. In doing so, current compensation standards for all project
areas will be made uniform, and supplementary compensation to resettlers already
compensated at the lower standards will be made to the YDSP RAP standards.

YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP        CHAPTER 11: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
11. Summary and Conclusions
11.1 Evaluation of Salient Aspects of Resettlement Program
11.1.1 Project Impact
The YDSP involves 22 counties (cities, districts or farms), affecting a population of
47,992 (10,958 households), including 19,213 people (4,464 households) in Hunan
Province and 28,779 people (6,494 households) in Hubei Province. A total amount of
1.763 million m2 of houses will be relocated, including 0.879 million m2 in Hunan and
0.883 million m2 in Hubei. The land of 33,749 mu will be required, including 18,577
mu in Hunan, 15,172 mu in Hubei.
11.1.2 Resettlement Plan
(a) As a component of the overall planning of the project, the resettlement schedule
has been completed by the project design organizations with the help of local
authorities. As the affected population scatters along the river bank, the impact of the
project on local social and economic system is not large, and thus they could be
relocated locally.
(b) Resettlement location plans are formulated according to local conditions, and there
are mainly two means of resettlement: concentrated resettlement and dispersed
resettlement. In the affected area of the project, a total population of 47,992 (10,958
households) has to resettle. This includes 12,508 (2,880 households) adopted
concentrated resettlement, accounting for 36%; 35,484 (8,078 households) adopted
dispersed resettlement, accounting for 74%.
(c) Agricultural resettlement is the main form of production resettlement,
complemented by non-agricultural channels. Through increasing input, improving unit
output of farmland, improving the infrastructure and service facilities, the
environmental capacity of the relocation areas remains adequate after population
increase. It can be expected that the living standards of the resettlers will reach and/or
exceed their original level.
11.1.3 Resettlement Progress
Overall the implementation of the resettlement plan will extend to Year 2003. It has
been started at some locations. To ensure the resettlement work progress on schedule,
detailed resettlement implementation plans have been formulated, and the resettlement
implementation process is being supervised, monitored and evaluated. The structure
and duties of resettlement management organizations are determined according to the
characteristics of resettlement work. In order to improve the implementation capability
of the resettlement management organizations and their managerial competence,
technical training is provided. Special attention is paid to those locations with a large
population of resettlers (such as Linxiang City, Hunan , Wuhan City and Jingzhou
City, Hubei) to control the implementation progress.
11.1.4 Investment and Fund Raising
Total investment for the resettlement of the Yangtze Dyke Strengthening Project is 966
million yuan (369.8 million for Hunan and 596.3 million for Hubei). Most of the fund
is from local government, rest from central govermment.

YDSP- REVISED FINAL RAP         CHAPTER 11: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
11.1.5 Resettlement Organizations
Resettlement organizations have been set up according to resettlement tasks in the two
provinces. Both national investment and provincial planning give priority to
developmental resettlement. The various resettlement organizations coordinate with
local authorities to improve productivity so as to solve the problems encountered in
the resettlement implementation process.
11.2 Overall Evaluation of Resettlement Program
(a) Resettlement Plan Is Feasible
According to the characteristics of this project and the distribution of affected
population, livelihood resettlement consists of concentrated resettlement and dispersed
resettlement. Production resettlement of the rural population is mainly by agricultural
resettlement, complemented by non-agricultural resettlement. The destination villages
could use the compensation to improve agricultural productivity and set up village
enterprises to make up their loss. As project construction progresses and the
development of local economy deepens, the above resettlement methods will not only
ensure but improve the original income level of the affected population.
(b) Living Conditions Are Adequate
Although the total accommodation area of the resettlers decreases after relocation, due
to careful planning the quality of their houses is higher than before, water supply,
education, and health service facilities have improved, and the overall quality of living
environment is better than before. In summary, their living conditions will generally
improve.
(c) Relocation Arrangement Is Reasonable
Relocation progresses with the project. It is planned to be finished in the Year 2003.
To ensure the plan is carried out on schedule, the resettlement organizations will
strengthen management. In addition, the supervising and monitoring organizations
will strengthen their control over progress, quality and fund.
(d) Resettlement Compensation Is Suitable
Based on the resettlement plan, in accordance with national- and provincial policies
and regulations, and with World Bank guidelines, the resettlement compensation is
determined, with project characteristics and local conditions taken into account. Basic
contingency and contingency cost for price difference is listed as required. Before
relocation, local resettlement authorities will determine the amount of compensation
according to the actual asset of each household, and sign agreements with them. After
resettlement compensation is approved, timely disbursement is planned to meet the
demands of the implementation plan and achieve the goal of at least keeping the
original living standards of the resettlers. A specialized monitoring and assessment
organization will be hired in each province to monitor and investigate the living
condition and production situation of both the resettlers and the residents in the host
destination area.
11.3 Summary and Conclusion
(a) The YDSP is a flood prevention, hazard minimizing project, and it brings safety
and assurance to the Project area, so it is welcomed by local residents. Even the
11-2



YDSP - REVISED FINAL RAP          CHAPTER 11: SUMMARY ANI) CONCLUSIONS
residents to be resettled seem very supportive of this project. Though they are required
to be resettled by the project, they are also among the beneficiaries, so they seem
generally willing to make contributions to their own benefits and piroject construction
as well. The host destination areas are beneficiaries too, and the resettlers are expected
to live harmoniously with the original residents. This project is different from other
reservoir projects in the respect of the resettlers' willingness, which is a very beneficial
factor toward successful resettlement.
(b) The farmland acquired by the project accounts for only a small fraction of the total
amount of -farmland available, and land acquisition is limited to belt shapes, hence
farmland acquisition is being readily accomplished. In addition, the affected
population is not concentrated, so the resettlement of agricultural population does not
have obvious pressure on local economy, and most of them will be relocated through
land rearrangement within townships/villages or land improvement. Local
governments will use land compensation and resettlement subsidy to caTry out
production development to increase the unit output of fannland and to develop local
economy.
(c) All in all, the resettlement plan of this project is concluded to be quite feasible.
The living conditions seem adequate, the resettlement arrangement seem reasonable,
the compensation seem suitable, and the plan seems to be actively supported by the
affected residents. It can be expected that, as long as resettlement management is
competent and fair, and the resettlement fund is disbursed on time, the resettlement
work of this project will finish on schedule, the resettlers will be resettled
satisfactorily, and the social, economic and environmental conditions in the
resettlement areas will have the potential for continuing development at adequate
quality of life levels.
