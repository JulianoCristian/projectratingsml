                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The three-pronged Project Development Objective contributes to the higher development objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas and improving natural resources
                         management. The project would enable poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (a) improve their production, processing and marketing systems; (b) protect their
                         assets: soil, water, rangeland, seeds and animals; and (c) get organized for the purpose of (a) and (b) above.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The process of formalizing the additional changes agreed upon to update and to enhance the Results Framework and Monitoring of RALP (with modified or new indicators and target
                         values) is in its final stage of completion and the signing of related amendment of the financing agreement are expected before the end of January 2013.

                         Very close monitoring of implementation progress continues to be required from the implementing entities [Project Support Unit (PSU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and
                         the Social Fund for Development (SFD)] to ensure that progresses remain on track in accordance to the revised and updated implementation plans in place.
