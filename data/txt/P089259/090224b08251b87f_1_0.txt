                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The three-pronged Project Development Objective contributes to the higher development objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas and improving natural resources
                         management. The project would enable poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (a) improve their production, processing and marketing systems; (b) protect their
                         assets: soil, water, rangeland, seeds and animals; and (c) get organized for the purpose of (a) and (b) above.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The construction of the new live animal quarantine facility of Al-Mokha is progressing well and expected to be completed by the closing date. To ensure that sustainable operating
                         arrangements for the facility are put in place and operational before RALP closes in September 2014, the tendering process to select and contract a suitable operator has been
                         initiated and will need to be completed as soon as possible before closing in September 2014.

                         Regarding the productive rural development component co-financed by IFAD, disbursements under this component have reached 54% in March 2014. The Social Fund for
                         Development (SFD) will continue to monitor progress closely and is confident that the IFAD loan will be almost fully disbursed by project closing if the current pace of implementation
                         is maintained.
