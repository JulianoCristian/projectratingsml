F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The three-pronged Project Development Objective contributes to the higher development
objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas and improving natural resources management.
The project would enable poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (a) improve their
production, processing and marketing systems; (b) protect their assets: soil, water,
rangeland, seeds and animals; and (c) get organized for the purpose of (a) and (b) above.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Project (RALP) was approved by the
International Development Association (IDA) on July 6, 2006. The corresponding IDA
Credit Agreement was signed on September 11, 2006, and became effective on September
24, 2007. IFAD financing for RALP was approved in September 2007. The IFAD Loan
for RALP was signed on January 21, 2008, and became effective on February 3, 2009.
Breaking with past trends of neglect, RALP was the first IDA-funded agricultural project
refocussing attention to the rainfed areas and their potential to reduce rural poverty. RALP
was also innovative in that it promoted active participation of the beneficiaries, resulting
in a demand-based delivery system. In parallel, it also built both private and public sector
capacity, utilizing private sector-community and public sector-community linkages. The
design helped the Government of Yemen (GoY) to deliver most of the expected project
results during a challenging period of recurrent socio-political unrest and uncertainty.

2.     This ICR presents the many achievements of the Project (all sources of funding
included). It was prepared during a difficult and extended period of renewed political
upheaval and deteriorating security conditions that prevented in-country visits.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and sector background
3.     At appraisal, almost half of the population living in rural areas was classified as
poor, and 83 percent of the poor lived in rural areas. They derived a large share of their
income from agriculture or agriculture-related activities. During 1996-2001, economic
growth had been driven mostly by agriculture. The sector had grown 5.4 percent a year.
Agriculture exports represented approximately one-third of the non-oil merchandise
exports. The 15 percent contribution of the sector to GDP, if anything, underestimated the
importance of agriculture in the economy, because of seasonal employment,
underemployment, and low productivity of the factors of production.

4.      The GoY’s Second Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) targeted agriculture as one of the
leading sectors for employment-generating economic growth, aiming at a 5.8 percent rate
of growth per annum in order to: (i) achieve a higher level of food security and
diversification of agricultural exports by raising productivity; and (ii) improve farmers’
income. The productivity gap as well as the extent of post-harvest losses pointed to a
substantial potential for improvement. However, Yemeni agriculture also faced severe
constraints to development, in particular the depletion of groundwater resources.




                                             1
5.      In spite of the potential for development, traditional rainfed 1 and livestock 2
production systems had been neglected for a number of reasons: (i) GoY policies supported
irrigated agriculture during the previous three decades; (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation’s (MAI) limited capacity to provide services (research and extension) for these
systems; (iii) lack of farmers’ ability to leverage the services; and (iv) the economic boom
in the Gulf countries in the 1980s, which provided employment opportunities for rural men.

6.      By appraisal, the situation had changed. The GoY acknowledged that agriculture
based on groundwater use was unsustainable. Upwards of 800,000 migrant workers had
returned since the first Gulf War, decimating remittances for rural areas. The rural economy
had to absorb the returning labor into the market place. Because most of the poorest people
in Yemen are farmers practicing agriculture under rainfed conditions, the GoY also
envisaged this Project as a vehicle to implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy Program
(PRSP) in rural areas. Investing in rainfed agriculture and livestock production systems
was expected to directly contribute to poverty alleviation, to improve natural resource
management, and to benefit rural women, one of the most at-risk segments of the
population. In addition, through backward and forward linkages, a boost to farming
activities was expected to trigger growth in agriculture-related activities, as well as in other
areas of the rural economy. Finally, helping farmers rehabilitate their field terraces was
also expected to inject much needed cash into the rural economy.

7.      The FY03 Yemen CAS was developed to support Yemen’s first PRSP (2003-2005),
as well as the government’s Second Five Year Plan, which defined the country’s
development challenges as: (a) high population growth, (b) water scarcity, (c) weak human
resources, and (d) weak institutional capacity. This Project was to address items (b), (c),
and (d) above.

Rationale for Bank assistance
8.     The project was conceived to complement other Bank-assisted operations aimed at
improving basic services in the rural areas (education) and infrastructure (rural roads, water
supply and sanitation, water and soil conservation infrastructure), such as the Social Fund
for Development III Project, the Public Works Project, the Rural Water Supply and


1
  Agricultural activities in the Highlands and the wadis of Tihama and the Eastern Plateau are based on soil
conservation and water harvesting through terracing, dikes, and small dams. Given the positive impact of
terraces on water harvesting, groundwater recharge, and soil erosion control, their maintenance is key not
only for the upper watershed areas but also for the downstream irrigation along the wadis, as well as flood
management. However, their maintenance is highly labor-intensive. The meager income derived from these
low productivity systems, compounded by male out-migration, led to insufficient maintenance and
abandonment of terraces. This had resulted in an increase in erosion and uncontrolled flooding downstream.
2
  Livestock represents at a minimum 20 percent of farm production in the Highlands and Tihama and is a
major source of cash income for households with inadequate landholdings. Indeed, livestock promotion is an
effective way to target the rural poor (they have easier access to livestock than to land or water rights) as well
as women, since livestock activities are mostly women’s activities.




                                                        2
Sanitation Project, and the Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP). These
projects brought the much-needed infrastructure and services to rural areas. The missing
link was to help foster viable economic activities to improve rural incomes and to finance
infrastructure maintenance and recurrent costs of services.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
Original Project Development Objectives (PDO)
9.     The Project Appraisal Document 3 (PAD) for the Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock
Project describes the Project Development Objective (PDO) in the following terms:

10.     “The three-pronged Project Development Objective contributes to the higher
development objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas and improving natural resources
management. The proposed project would enable poor rural producers in rainfed areas
to: (a) improve their production, processing and marketing systems; (b) protect their
assets: soil, water, rangeland, seeds and animals; and (c) get organized for the purpose of
(a) and (b) above". 4

11.     The PDO in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) had originally phrased it
slightly differently. In May 2013, through a level 2 restructuring, the project formally
aligned the PDO statement in the legal agreement with that in the PAD. Consequently, for
the ICR, the above PDO was used.

1.3       Key Indicators
12.       The PAD in page 4 presented the following PDO indicators 5 for the project:

      •   Poor rural producers, in rainfed areas of five governorates:

          (a) adopt improved crop varieties (local and from other regions of Yemen) and
              improved seed technology practices;
          (b) use more livestock services and inputs, and adopt improved animal health and
              husbandry techniques;
          (c) organize at community and inter-community levels;
          (d) diversify their production systems; and
          (e) increase their marketed output or their self-consumption.

      •   The cultivable area protected against soil erosion and with improved water
          harvesting structures is increased.

Revised Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
13.     The PDO was not changed. The PDO indicators were modified: (i) to adapt to the
reality of the Project on the ground during the first years of implementation and to take into
account the needed adjustments to the scope of some project activities as approved in June
2012 (including the heightened priority given to the construction of a larger and more
expensive quarantine station), (ii) to improve and enhance the definition of some
indicators, and (iii) to include core indicators as per the new Bank guidelines.

14.     PDO Indicators: (a) under Component 1 (Part A), the indicator monitoring the
number of seed growers associations with seed certification entities was moved to the
‘intermediate level’ as it was a step towards achieving the goal of 580,000 kilograms of
seeds produced; (b) under Component 2 (Part B), the definition of the indicator was
improved to reflect the “handling capacity of Al-Mokha quarantine station” instead of the
facility as “constructed and ready to operate”; (c) a new indicator to monitor “female
percentage of beneficiaries”, was added as core indicator, and (d) under Component 3 (Part
C), the language of “Area with improved soil conservation and water harvesting” was
changed to that of the new core indicator “Land area where sustainable land management
practices were adopted as a result of the project” and the original name was included in the
explanation of the indicator, with the specification that “additional” area was to be
monitored.

15.       The revised PDO indicators were as follows:

      •   Number of kg of improved seeds produced by seed producer groups;
      •   Number of clients of veterinary paraprofessionals in project areas;
      •   Handling capacity of the Al-Mokha quarantine station;
      •   Number of functioning rural producer groups, associations or networks;
      •   Additional revenue/capital per beneficiary (groups’ members) from: (a)
          production subprojects, (b) marketing subprojects, and (c) processing subprojects;
      •   Land area where sustainable land management practices have been adopted as a
          result of the project; and
      •   Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage).

1.4       Main Beneficiaries
Primary Target Group
16.      The PAD (in its Annex 9 page 75) identified direct project beneficiaries to include
local farmers and livestock owners. Farmers were expected to benefit from the introduction
and greater availability of improved seed and crop technologies which was expected to
result in increased crop yields and income. They were expected to gain also from improved
market infrastructure, better access to market opportunities as well as agricultural inputs
and services. Livestock owners were expected to be provided with more accessible
veterinary goods and services, innovative husbandry methods, feed supplements and
fodder for improved livestock productivity. Along with broader local communities, they
were expected also to benefit from funding programs for small-scale soil and water
harvesting facilities, community labor-saving devices (especially for women), agro-

                                              4
processing facilities, and production-related start-up activities. The latter was to include,
but not be limited to, new technologies and farm experiments, such as seed selection, forage
growing trials, village/district veterinary pharmacies and seed banks, or agricultural and
livestock input outlets at the village level.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)
17.      The project had the following components:

18.  Part A (Component 1): Farmer-Based System of Seed Improvement and
Management
      1) Promoting within the project area 6 ex-situ and on-farm conservation of local
         landraces by enhancing capacity and conducting research and development
         activities to collect, characterize conserve and improve them, and ensure seed
         quality by national mandated institutions in collaboration with farmer groups
         through the provision of goods and technical advisory services.
      2) Carrying out a program for promoting seed producer groups in the project area by:
         (a) establishing seed producer groups to produce quality landrace seeds at the farm
         level through the provision of technical advisory services; (b) enhancing the
         capacity of agricultural district offices through the rehabilitation and furnishing of
         such offices through carrying out of works, and the provision of goods and technical
         advisory services; and (c) developing the capacity of farmers in technological
         innovations related to seed production, variety improvement, maintenance and seed
         storage, and quality assurance through the carrying out of small works and the
         provision of goods, technical advisory services and training.
      3) Enhancing the capacity of seed producer groups to establish a network for seed
         delivery and marketing of local land races in the project area through the carrying
         out of works, and the provision of goods, technical advisory services and training.

19.      Part B (Component 2): Livestock Husbandry and Health Services
      1) Enhancing the capacity of the General Directorate of Animal Resources (GDAR)
         to develop livestock strategies, policies and regulations, and disease control and
         diagnosis through the provision of goods, technical advisory services, training and
         workshops.
      2) Rehabilitation and strengthening of national and regional veterinary laboratories
         through the carrying out of works and the provision of goods, technical advisory
         services and training.




6
  The project area consisted of the five governorates, namely Al-Mahweet, Hajjah, Al-Hodeidah, Lahej, and
Sanaa. However, at negotiations, since the US$ 10 million co-financing from the national Agriculture and
Fisheries Production Promotion Fund could not be made available, and a donor to bridge this financing gap
could not be identified, the government decided to restrict the project area to three governorates.


                                                   5
      3) Design, construction, and equipment of a live animal quarantine holding ground in
         Al-Mokha through carrying out of works and the provision of goods, advisory
         services, and the preparation of a design for a similar quarantine holding ground at
         Al Mukalla as well as conducting a needs assessment for the establishment of
         quarantine holding ground at Dhobab and Haradh through the provision of technical
         advisory services.
      4) Establishing a public-private partnership based on a contracting system for sanitary
         mandate and epidemio-surveillance, and promoting accessible delivery of
         proximity veterinary and animal husbandry services and goods to livestock owners
         through the provision of goods, technical advisory services, and training.

20.      Part C (Component 3): Productive Rural Development
      1) Enhancing the organizational capacity of poor rural producers at the community
         and inter-community levels to improve access to public and private services, as well
         as input and output markets through the provision of technical advisory services
         and training.
      2) Provision of Poor Rural Producer (PRP) Grants to poor rural producer groups
         within the project area on a cost sharing basis to finance demand driven productive
         rural community development initiatives, either directly or through non-
         governmental organizations acting as intermediaries for the Social Development
         Fund (SFD).
      3) Establishing a flow of market information between local producers and distant
         market stakeholders through the carrying out of works, and the provision of goods
         and technical advisory services.

21.      Part D (Component 4): Project Support Unit

1.6      Revised Components
22.      There were some changes in the project activities resulting from the June 2012
restructuring. Project activities were adjusted as follows: (a) the proposed capacity of the
quarantine facility at Al-Mokha was expanded to handle the increasing volume of imported
livestock through this strategically located port; (b) the remaining activities under
Component 1 (Part A) – Farmer-based seed improvements and management were
discontinued, except for activities related to the establishment of seed producer groups to
produce quality landrace seeds at the farm level, and the enhancement of their capacity to
establish a network for seed delivery and marketing of local land races; (c) the remaining
activities under Component 2 (Part B) - Livestock husbandry and health services - were
discontinued, except for activities relating to the promotion of accessible delivery of
proximity veterinary and animal husbandry services and goods to livestock owners; and
(d) the functioning of an epidemio-surveillance network was dropped.

1.7        Other significant changes
23.      The IDA Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was restructured three times. The
first restructuring, dated August 11, 2010, introduced changes which: (a) reinstated the
geographical coverage of the project to the original five governorates, following an
agreement with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to provide
US$ 16.7 million to bridge, inter alia, the remaining expenditures under Component 3 of
the Project; and (b) modified the procurement thresholds.

24.      The second restructuring, dated June 28, 2012: (a) adjusted the scope of the project
activities, and reallocated the proceeds across the modified activities (including the
assignment of the unallocated fund in the IDA DCA; (b) modified the project
implementation arrangements; (c) removed all procurement thresholds from the DCA and
transferred these to the Procurement Plan; and (d) extended the project closing date by 27
months.

25.      The procurement thresholds were updated to align them with the Regional
Procurement Manager’s Guidance Note prepared during the Project’s Independent
Procurement Review conducted in June 2010. With this restructuring, the implementation
arrangements were amended to transfer the implementation responsibility of Parts A.2 (a)
and A.3 from MAI to the Social Fund for Development (SFD). Part B.4 was split up into
two further sub-components: Part B.4 (a) “establishing a public-private partnership based
on a contracting system for sanitary mandate and epidemio-surveillance” which was
discontinued; and Part B.4 (b) “promoting accessible service delivery of proximity
veterinary and animal husbandry services and goods to livestock owners”. Implementation
responsibility for Part B.4 (b) was transferred to SFD. The closing date was extended by
27 months (from June 30, 2012 to September 30, 2014) in order to complete all project
activities that were delayed due to a one year effectiveness delay, the additional delays
resulting from the socio-political unrest in the country since late 2010, and the ensuing
Bank suspension of disbursements.

26.    The third restructuring of the IDA Credit, dated January 16, 2013, aligned the PDO
in the legal agreement with that in the PAD, and revised and enhanced the Result
Framework and monitoring of the Project 7. The revised PDO indicators are provided under
Section 1.3.

27.     The IFAD Loan for RALP was amended twice. The first amendment, dated June
25, 2013, (i) extended the completion date and the closing date to September 30, 2014 and
March 31, 2015, respectively (corresponding to revised closing date and end-of-
disbursement date of the IDA credit), and (ii) reallocated loan proceeds out of the “Rural
Finance” category since related activities could no longer be implemented in time before
the closing of the project because of significant startup delays with this sub-component.
The start-up delays arose when the implementing agency was unable to find microfinance

    For the revised PDO indicators, see Section 1.3.


                                                       7
institutions in the project areas who could assume implementation of this work. With
limited access to microfinance services in the targeted communities, the solution offered
under the project was to establish saving schemes in RPGs. As the Intermediate Outcome
Indicator 8 indicates, close to 95 percent of the RPGs established such schemes. The second
IFAD Loan amendment, dated August 12, 2014, reallocated loan proceeds out of the
“Unallocated” category to support additional productive rural development investments
and capacity building while maximizing the utilization of the funding available. This
decision had some positive implication. For example, from the additional allocation of
IFAD financing towards soil conservation and water harvesting investments (terracing,
dikes, water tanks, etc.), the result for the PDO 6 indicator improved to 417 ha, which was
174 percent of target.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Preparation
28.     Soundness of Background Analysis. The project preparation effort was informed
by a series of studies completed in early 2005, such as (a) the Farmer-based System of Seed
Improvement and Management in Rainfed Areas, (b) Support to Farmer Groups to
Implement Farmer-Demanded Subprojects, (c) Public-Private Partnership for Livestock
Husbandry and Animal Health Improvement, and (d) Soil Conservation and Water
Harvesting. In addition, four World Bank-financed projects were particularly relevant to
the proposed operation: the Agricultural Sector Management Support Project (ASMSP)
which closed on June 30, 2000, the Seeds and Agricultural Services Project (SASP) which
closed on June 30 2004, the Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) and SFD
III (which were ongoing at Appraisal). Many of the design features, including articulation
of the project objectives were based on the above studies and projects.

29.     Incorporation of Lessons Learned. In terms of lessons learned, some of the recently
closed and on-going projects clearly highlighted the deficiencies of addressing only supply-
side aspects. Thus, the project deliberately supported the demand side of services as well.
In particular, it aimed at strengthening the capacity of farmers to organize themselves. In
order to ensure accountability to the rural producers, the project design offered services to
them, through a tripartite contractual arrangement: the rural producer group, the project,
and the service provider. The service provider, in the case of agriculture and livestock,
was the staff from the District Agricultural Offices, for example, because the capacity of
Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) or the private sector to provide agricultural
advice was limited.

30.    Another major lesson learned from past projects in Yemen (and elsewhere) had
been that investing in technologies to increase productivity without helping farmers access
input and output markets, yielded disappointing results. Hence, Component 3 (Part C)
addressed, rural producers’ access to input and output markets. Component 3 also injected
much needed money into the rural economy through its subprojects (financed on a cost-
sharing basis), in particular the labor-intensive rehabilitation of terraces and other erosion


                                              8
control structures, which was to enable rural producers to earn incomes that they could
reinvest in their production systems.

31.     Project Design. The project objective and design addressed the needs of the poor
in Yemen. Yemen is predominantly a rural country and poverty is by and large a rural
phenomenon: 73 percent of the population, and 83 percent of the poor, live in rural areas.
Rainfed agriculture, which constituted half of all cultivated areas, had been largely
neglected by government services, in spite of its potential and the impact that improved
productivity in rainfed areas could have on rural poverty reduction. Livestock constituted
20% of farm production in the project area and was an important source of cash income for
the poor. Linked with the agriculture production system was the increase in erosion and
downstream flooding resulting from inadequate maintenance of terraces in the upper
watershed areas. The project was designed to alleviate rural poverty by targeting producers,
including women, operating in the agriculture sector under rainfed conditions, and in
livestock activities. The objectives, having been derived from extensive consultancies and
from past projects, were relevant. In addition, the GoY chose the governorates on the basis
of the incidence of rural poverty and of the importance of rainfed agriculture.

32.     The definition of the PDO, however, could have been more consistent. There were
differences between the PDO in the PAD and the DCA; the PDO in the Results Framework
was different from the main text. The PDO indicators too vary at different places in the
PAD: the main text had a truncated set of indicators (page 4), the Results Framework had
another set of indicators (pages 26/27), and the Results Monitoring Arrangements show a
mix of different indicators (pages 29/30). There were no indicators in the Results
Monitoring Arrangements table for Component 3 (Part C) of the Project, although the
Results Framework did identify a few.

33.     For Component 3 (with 70% of project cost), three implementation arrangements
were examined during the preparation mission, taking into account the strengths and
comparative advantages of existing key institutions: (a) direct implementation by the
Agricultural Offices or Development Authorities of MAI; (b) implementation through
contracts with NGOs (where available) or projects already operating in specific
governorates, e.g. CARE in Al-Mahweet or IDAS III (GTZ) in Lahej; and (c) SFD. The
project design opted for SFD, which had demonstrated a reliable institutional capacity for
project planning and implementation at the community level, through a network of well-
qualified consultants. In disadvantaged rainfed areas, they also had the capacity to
mobilize complementary funding to satisfy other basic needs that this project would not
finance, e.g. for health, education, or drinking water. This choice also shows that the
preparation team had correctly assessed the institutional capacities within the country.
However, the final arrangements were a bit onerous. Parts A and B of the project was to
be implemented through the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI), which used the
Project Support Unit (PSU) to coordinate implementation by the General Seed
Multiplication Corporation, the General Directorate of Animal Resources, and the Yemeni
Veterinary Medicine Association (YVMA). Part C was to be implemented by the SFD.




                                             9
34.     The Project was relatively simple with three components spread out over five
governorates. The project preparation had paid particular attention to social issues. These
were assessed during project preparation through a Social/Gender Assessment conducted
in selected districts of the five project governorates and through the Governorate
Preparation Field Reports. The objective of the social assessment was to evaluate the
opportunities, constraints and likely social impacts of the Project. It solicited stakeholder
participation and evaluated stakeholder views to inform project design and to respond to
social development concerns by tailoring the benefits of the Project to the poor and
vulnerable, particularly rural Yemeni women. Critical social issues identified in the Bank’s
timely and highly relevant Yemen Country Analysis (CSA) in 2005 were also reflected in
the project design.

35.      As regards environmental aspects and the risk relating to the construction of the
animal holding grounds at the Al-Mokha Port, which was by far the largest infrastructure
works under the project and posed the most significant environmental risks, the project
design had treated it separately with its own environmental management matrix. For the
small-scale infrastructure projects, the following actions were taken: (i) a process and
criteria for screening the subprojects was to be instituted; (ii) an M&E program for tracking
project environmental impacts was to be implemented; and (iii) an environmental training
and capacity-building and awareness program for the range of public/private sector
institutions and local populations involved in the project was recommended.

36.     Quality at Entry. Project effectiveness was delayed by more than a year after project
approval because the Project required the approval of the legislative body which among
other things is responsible for allocating counterpart funding for Bank-financed projects.
Once the project was launched in early 2008, the PSU and SFD were able to initiate
effective training and formation of beneficiaries, and set up functioning procurement and
management systems. Quality at Entry, particularly for Component 3, was enhanced by the
IFAD’s appraisal. For example, it clarified how the activities/subprojects would be
implemented by rural producer groups (RPGs) at three levels: (i) local community,
including activities implemented and projects that are prepared and implemented with/by
RPGs from the same local community; (ii) inter-community, comprising activities
implemented and projects that are prepared and implemented with/by a network of RPGs
from different local communities from the same district; and (iii) district/governorate,
including activities implemented and projects that are prepared and implemented with/by
RPGs at the district/ governorate level, mainly bigger water infrastructure.

37.    Risk Assessment. The quality of Risks Assessment in the PAD and the mitigating
measures taken proved to be effective. The PAD had correctly identified three critical risks,
namely: (a) lack of implementing capacity in MAI; (b) sustainability of the proposed
investments, laboratories and equipment, especially for the infrastructure outside Sanaa;
and (c) lack of complementary productive and social infrastructure necessary for the
subprojects selected by the rural producer groups to be successful. The mitigating
measures, also identified in the PAD, were undertaken. Towards risk (a), the Project
complemented MAI capabilities with capacity from other entities, such as the YVMA,
through contractual arrangements. Towards risk (b), the Project selected absolutely

                                             10
essential laboratory equipment and infrastructure, thereby, minimizing added recurrent
costs. Lastly, towards risk (c), the project utilized SFD which has access to other sources
of funding for infrastructure.

2.2    Implementation
38.     For Component 3 (Part C) of the Project, the co-financing of US$ 10 million that
was to be provided by the country’s Agriculture and Fisheries Production Promotion Fund
did not materialize. As such, there was a financing gap which could not be bridged, and
the government initially restricted the geographical coverage to three of the five
governorates, as was originally envisaged.

39.     The Project was declared effective about 15 months after project approval in
September 2007 because it required the approval of the government legislative body which,
among other things, allocates counterpart funding for Bank-funded projects. Once the
Project was launched in early 2008, considerable security issues arose. There was a series
of bomb attacks on police, official, diplomatic, foreign business, and tourism targets in
2008. Car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sanaa killed 18 people, including six of
the assailants in September 2008. Notwithstanding such formidable risks, the Bank project
team visited project sites at remote areas of Yemen and set up procurement and financial
management systems at the PSU. With the SFD already functioning well from previous
projects, the Project proceeded with some activities: farmer group formation, training
arrangements (for example with the private Yemeni Veterinary Medicine Association), and
rehabilitation of various buildings and laboratories.

40.    Subsequently, the financing gap was bridged through a parallel financing that was
provided by the International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD) in the amount of SDR 10.85
million, or US$ 16.7 million equivalent, to support, inter alia, the above-mentioned
Component 3 (Part C) of the Project. The IFAD Loan was signed on January 21, 2008, and
became effective on February 3, 2009. Per the letter of appointment dated February 15,
2008, IFAD delegated to IDA the responsibility for supervising the implementation of the
IFAD-financed activities.

41.     The mid-tem review of January 2011 had been very thorough and concluded that
the Project had a good chance to deliver the outcomes with a 12-month project extension
compensating for the delay at the outset. However, as part of the so-called Arab Spring
uprising throughout the Arab world, Yemen suffered from a severe political upheaval
throughout 2011. Amid security concerns, the Bank suspended missions to the country in
March 2011, and then also suspended disbursements for the entire portfolio from July 2011
to January 2012. This virtually brought the procurement and payment activities to a
standstill, and hampered implementation progress. Project ratings were downgraded
accordingly across the board. Notwithstanding, the MAI and SFD continued to make
progress towards achievement of the PDO. This was confirmed in June 2012 when ratings
were upgraded to reflect continued implementation progress with key project activities.

42.     The high level of national ownership and commitment to RALP, and the Project’s
steady implementation progress in spite of very difficult country conditions, were the most

                                            11
important factors that contributed toward speedy re-engagement and to successful
implementation after the hiatus in 2011-12. This re-engagement was supported with the
June 2012 restructuring in response to the government’s request with various changes to
the Project that included financing of a larger quarantine facility, dropping some activities
not implemented by SFD, and an extension of the closing date by 27 months. Since the
lifting of the suspension of disbursements in Yemen and the June 2012 restructuring,
project implementation progressed well and all remaining key contracts were awarded,
including the construction of the new Al-Mokha quarantine facility in the Governorate of
Taiz. All project activities were completed by the closing date of September 30, 2014
(which also is the equivalent of closing date for the IFAD loan). At closing, 99.32 percent
of the IDA Credit and 97.63 percent of the IFAD loan funds had been disbursed (in SDR
terms).

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
43.     M&E Design. The PAD had planned a Management Information System within the
PSU to serve as a management and monitoring tool. It covered the management side of
the components: financial management (FM), procurement, disbursement, budget
implementation, and contract management as well as project intermediate outcomes. As
to Component 3, the already established M&E system at SFD based on a computerized
management information system was expected to be used. The 2013 restructuring had tried
to correct several weaknesses in the PAD indicators (see Section 1.3 above). For example,
while one of the key outcomes was to establish a farmer-based seed production system
(which is included in the PDO of improving their production systems), the indicator at the
outset was “number of kg of improved seeds bought”. After the restructuring, this was
replaced by a more appropriate indicator: “number of kg of improved seeds produced by
seed producer groups”. In addition, a baseline survey was also expected to be established
during the first year of the project to provide a reference against which project outcome
would be assessed at mid-term review and project completion. However, the PAD did not
provide any details in this regard. Consequently, the M&E design had the basic weakness
of not having adequate evaluation arrangements including an ex-post cost-benefit analysis
for the overall project.

44.     M&E Implementation. Bank supervision missions reported M&E data obtained
from both implementing agencies. In addition, for Component 3, implemented by SFD, a
full-fledged impact assessment study with baseline survey and counterfactual was
conducted to assess the impact of the subprojects under this component. The researchers,
specialized in impact evaluation from the University of California at Berkeley, trained the
staff of the M&E unit of SFD and worked with them. Villages outside project
implementation were selected to provide the counterfactual to villages receiving project
implementation. The Project measured the production performances and agricultural
incomes with a double difference method: with and without project; and before and after
project implementation. It was correct to include such a study as part of project
implementation, and not have it under project preparation, because the village-selection
had to be done first as part of project implementation. The main shortcomings with the
above evaluation were that it was: (a) limited to one component (although it was the


                                             12
biggest); (b) not utilized to make a cost-benefit analysis to measure efficiency; and (c) not
supplemented by a similar survey at project completion.

45.     M&E Utilization. In view of the design and implementation as described above,
the use of M&E information was therefore oriented more towards monitoring of progress
by components. The Project did make reallocations based on what was progressing well
(or based on what could be implemented well given the circumstances). The impact
evaluation indicated above appears not to have been used, at least not explicitly. It could
be that it was implicitly understood that the livestock assets identified by the impact
evaluation would be best served by water-related constructions that also created local day-
jobs, surpassing the targets set in these areas.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

      A. Safeguards Compliance
46.     Environmental Safeguards: The Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) was
triggered in the PAD. The Project was classified as environmental category B, mainly due
to rehabilitation of veterinary laboratories, construction of the animal quarantine facility,
and the small-scale infrastructure relating to water harvesting and soil conservation. GoY
prepared an Environmental Assessment and Management Plan (EA/EMP), which specified
the process and criteria for screening for, and monitoring of, environmental impacts
relating to small-scale infrastructure projects and separate environmental management
matrices, one for the animal quarantine facility and another for the small-scale
infrastructure and veterinary laboratories.

47.     Social Safeguards: The Bank policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) was
not triggered as the Project did not finance any subprojects/activities involving involuntary
taking of land.

48.     Compliance with Environmental Safeguards: Potential negative impacts were
monitored and good practice mitigation measures were implemented, specific to the
rehabilitation of veterinary laboratories (by MAI) and small-scale infrastructure (by SFD).
As required, SFD reported back on compliance with the EMP through independent
environmental audits that it undertook for all of its operations, including activities under
the Project, funded through IDA. With regards to the animal quarantine facility at Al-
Mokha, the GoY was required to pay particular attention, noting that the quarantine was
one piece of a set of complementary efforts in ensuring the management of potential risks
of introduction of diseases in Yemen. Accordingly, feasibility and background studies were
undertaken, and the design was in line with international standards that covered aspects of
good practice measures on environmental and health-related risks in the operation and
management of the quarantine.

49.     Third Party Monitoring (TPM). As a result of the socio-political and security
situation, Bank missions and site visits were suspended. However, to verify
implementation of the EMP, a TPM firm undertook supervision of project activities, and


                                             13
the ensuing reports confirm satisfactory compliance. The Bank team stayed closely
involved with the TPM firm during its work.

   B. Fiduciary Compliance
50.     Procurement Management Arrangements: In view of the MAI experience with
Bank-financed operations, RALP and SFD’s capacity for managing and implementing
procurement-related processes was considered to be strong. Procurement activities were
implemented efficiently and transparently. A procurement post-review, based on a desk
review, noted that procurement had been handled well, and most payment reviews of RALP
transactions noted that funds were claimed for eligible expenditures, properly recorded and
reported, and that all related supporting documents were in order and filed accordingly.

51.     The performance of the Project Support Unit (PSU) procurement staff throughout
the Project was generally fair, as ratings shifted between satisfactory (S) and moderately
satisfactory (MS). The lower ratings were largely because of the disbursement suspension
by the World Bank (from July 2011 to January 2012). A lesson learned is that, if a dispute
occurs in a case, the project needs to address the complaints promptly as per the contractual
terms. Responding promptly to complaint letters from vendors (contractors, consultants,
suppliers, etc.) is important to avoid future complications. While handling complaints, the
project should also ensure compliance to the related provisions in the Bank Guidelines. In
a prior review case, the client should have sought the Bank's no objection before
cancellation of the contract.

52.     Financial Management (FM) Arrangements: The Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation (MAI), through a Project Support Unit (PSU), implemented Components 1 and
2. The PSU maintained acceptable FM arrangements in place (qualified staffing; automated
accounting system, acceptable FM manual, monthly reconciliation, and timely reporting).
The PSU maintained a segregated Designated Account at the Central Bank of Yemen for
the related IDA funds (IDA 4220-YEM) and used the traditional SOEs as the main
disbursement method beside the Direct Payments and Special Commitments.

53.     The Social Fund for Development (SFD) implemented Component 3 (and part of
components 1 and 2) of RALP supported by IFAD and IDA. The SFD has adequate FM
arrangements in place which have been utilized to facilitate the implementation of the
Project (qualified staffing, a developed accounting system, and comprehensive tools for
internal control, monthly reconciliation, internal audit, and timely reporting). The SFD
maintained two segregated Designated Accounts at an acceptable commercial bank in the
country for the related project funds (one for each fund: IDA 4220-YEM & IFAD C1170).
The SFD used the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) as the disbursement method for IDA
funds, whereas the traditional method of the SOEs was used for IFAD funds. All previous
audit reports were submitted to the World Bank and found acceptable. Each implementing
agency (PSU & SFD) will submit the final audit report to the Bank by end of April 2015.

54.    Overall, the FM arrangements in both implementing agencies have been considered
acceptable by The Bank during the project life. All withdrawal applications were smoothly
processed, except during the political and security crisis that affected Yemen in 2011 and

                                             14
led the Bank to suspend the disbursements across the Yemen portfolio from July 2011 to
January 2012. The PSU had minor fiduciary compliance issues which had been addressed
appropriately during the project life.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
55.    The biggest uncertainty for the post-completion phase is with the operation of the
Al-Mokha quarantine station. While the station construction has been completed and
bidding documents for contracting an operator for the station has been prepared, the actual
operation of the station has not commenced. The renewed and persisting political unrest
since September 2014 may prevent its operation, although local interests may be able to
come to an understanding among themselves.

56.     Most of the other project activities, however, were focused on the farmer groups
which are assuming control of the assets/activities. For example, in each governorate, one
seed growers association, or a network of seed growers groups, is distributing seed
produced by seed grower groups. The seed growers association is expected to continue
with its activities even with a non-functioning national government.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High
57.      A proper diagnosis, based on both studies and past projects, led to a project that
addressed the country’s needs throughout the implementation period. The last CAS
(written in FY09) targeted agricultural productivity increase in rainfed areas, which this
project addressed. The FY13 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) covering FY13-14 had as one
of its strategic pillars, achieving quick wins and protecting the poor by creating short-term
jobs, restoring basic services, improving access to social safety nets, and revitalizing
livelihoods. The Project had already been revitalizing livelihoods of rainfed farmers.
Through a restructuring, the Project also targeted to create 25,000 additional short-term
jobs to build rural infrastructure, such as those for terracing and water structures.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
58.     The Project had one PDO with three “prongs” (see page 2 above). To appreciate
what was achieved under the Project, it may be better to flip the order of the three prongs
in the PDO, and present them as follows.

      (c) The project enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to get organized for the
      purpose of (a) and (b) below, which allowed the project to enable poor rural producers
      in rainfed areas to:
      (a) Improve their production, processing, and marketing systems; and
      (b) Protect their assets: soil, water, rangeland, seeds, and animals.


                                             15
    This, in turn, contributes to the higher development objectives of reducing poverty in
    rural areas and improving natural resources management.

59.      The Project achieved the PDO indicated, as will be shown below, by the results of
most of the indicators meeting/exceeding the targets. The list of indicators can be found in
the Data Sheet at the beginning of this report, but it is worthwhile to see the results link by
link in the above chain of arguments.

    (c) The project enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to get organized for the
    purpose of (a) and (b) below.

60.     PDO indicator 4 was used for this purpose: number of functioning rural producer
groups, association or networks. The project created 2,221 functioning rural producer
groups, associations or networks, which was about 88 percent of target. This project
outcome of “formation of functioning rural producer groups” (RPG) under Component 3
was key in ensuring accountability of the service providers to the poor rural producers and
key to delivery of various benefits. RPG types include those for production and post-
harvest handling of cereal and legumes, livestock raising, bee-keeping and marketing,
livestock product processing (cheese, ghee), small vegetable gardens, coffee/fruit
production, handicraft production and marketing, etc.

61.      Specifically for seed growing, the project outcome of having one seed growers
association with contractual arrangements with public or para-public seed certification
entities per governorate (i.e. a total of 5), as well as having 70 seed growers groups formed,
trained, and with contractual arrangements, were achieved (intermediate indicators 3 and
2, respectively.

62.      For livestock husbandry and health services, instead of having village committees
etc., the Project relied on veterinary technicians and para-vets/Community Animal Health
Workers (CAHWs) trained and equipped 8 under the Project to provide livestock owners
with better access to basic inputs and services. The Project delivered 76 percent (221/290:
intermediate indicator 5) of the target for this outcome after the determination was made
that the reduced number of 221 para-vets was adequate and sufficient to ensure the full
coverage of the project targeted areas with basic services. For productive rural development,
village producer committees, created and functioning (intermediate indicator 6), reached
100 percent of the target of 230.

    Enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (a) improve their production,
    processing and marketing systems.

63.   The PDO indicator 5 (additional revenue/capital per beneficiary (group's members)

  They were not employed under the project. They had to create their own businesses serving the
communities and most, according to post-completion surveys, had over 100 clients.


                                              16
subprojects) was used for this purpose: all three had a target of YR 20,000, and on average
the results were 101% of target. The results for the three types of projects were: (i) YR
17,150 (86% of target); (ii) YR 20,300 (102% of target); and (iii) YR 26,750 (134% of
target). These results reflect the beneficiaries’ preference for processing and marketing
over production activities, coupled with higher income from processing subprojects.

64.     A related indicator (Intermediate indicator 7), number of (a) production
subprojects; (b) marketing subprojects; and (c) processing subprojects, similarly shows
mixed results: (a) 134% of target, (b) 78% of target, (c) 94% of target, although number of
clients who have adopted an improved agricultural technology promoted by the Project
was only about 54% of target. This also demonstrates the demand-driven nature of the
Project with challenges to set precise targets.

   Enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to): (b) protect their assets: soil, water,
   and rangeland

65.     The PDO indicator 6 (land area where sustainable land management practices have
been adopted as a result of the project) was used for this purpose. The result for this
indicator was 417 ha, which was 174 percent of target. This is partly due to additional
allocation of IFAD financing towards these types of soil conservation and water harvesting
investments (terracing, dikes and water tanks, etc.

66.    Protection of soil, water, and rangeland came from a long list of infrastructure
investments in terrace rehabilitation, wadi banks protection, upper catchment areas re-
vegetation, etc. Much of the work was demand-driven and had no targets. However, the
achievement was substantial, as shown in the following table:
                      Type of work                               Result      Target
    a- Total length of terraces rehabilitated reused     M      213,443      90,000

67.    As indicated in the section on relevance, the Project demonstrated the flexibility
desired in the FY13-14 WBG Interim Strategy Note and increased the number of short-
term jobs created under the Project. A severe deterioration of the security situation
associated with socio-political disturbances required changes in the engagement strategy
favoring the use of more short-term local labor. These were mainly through the

                                                17
infrastructure investments indicated above. The indicator (Intermediate indicator 13)
“Equivalent person/day jobs generated by these investments” shows a result of 674,275,
which was 450% of target.

   Enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (b) protect their assets: […] seeds,
   […]

68.     The PDO indicator 1 was used for this purpose: number of kg of improved seeds
produced and bought each year in the five governorates. The result for this indicator was
801 tons, which was 138 percent of target. The improved seed production was achieved
through the establishment of five seed growers associations (one per targeted governorates
with contractual arrangements with public and para-public seed certification entities) and
70 seed producer groups that were formed and trained. The overachievement reflects the
efficacy of Component 1.

69.     The Project financed research and development activities to characterize, conserve,
and improve landraces and ensure seed quality by national mandated institutions, in close
collaboration with local communities. The bulk of the funding was directed to support the
establishment of a farmer-based seed production system, which was indeed established in
all five governorates. In terms of landraces, the indicator “Number of landraces
characterized and conserved” shows that the result of 2,187 was 106 percent of target. 1304
out of 2187 landraces were transferred to the International Center for Agricultural Research in
the Dry Areas (ICARDA) gene bank, in spite of ICARDA itself facing considerable
difficulties to move its headquarters (HQ) out of Aleppo, Syria.

70.     Because of the use of better seeds and technology, in the Sanaa governorate,
farmers using improved seeds recorded production increases as follows: 31% for wheat;
28% for barley, 24% for sorghum, and 22% for lentils and peas. In the Lahj governorate,
farmers using improved seeds recorded similar increases: sorghum by 27%, millet by 26%,
and maize by 27%. In the Hodaidah governorate, the increases were: sorghum by 16%,
millet by 15%, and cowpeas by 6%. In the Mahwit governorate, the increases were:
sorghum by 22%, millet by 28%, and cowpeas by 15%. In the Hajjah governorate, the
increases were: sorghum by 25%, millet by 13%, and cowpeas by 16%. Overall, the Project
is estimated to have improved the yields of 60,000 farmers, who now use improved seeds
and seed technology on a total of 24,000 ha.

   Enabled poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (b) protect their assets: […] animals.

71.     The PDO indicator 2 was used for this purpose: Total clients of veterinary
paraprofessionals in project areas. The result for this indicator was 60,000, which was 100
percent of target. The Project delivered full coverage of small to medium-sized holders in
project areas with basic fee-for-services provided by project-trained para-vets (221). This
coverage contributed to protect the livestock assets of smallholders and is an important
aspect of the efficacy of Component 2.




                                              18
72.     In addition to the above PDO indicator, the number and diversity of tests practiced
in government laboratories was also a PDO indicator. However, when the Project was
restructured in 2013, the indicator was dropped, since priority had been given by the
Government to the construction of the quarantine station at Al-Mokha. The new PDO
indicator 3 was used for the quarantine station and defined as follows: handling capacity
of Al-Mokha quarantine station. The result for this indicator was 2,400,000 heads of
animals/year (i.e. 200,000 per month), which is 400 percent of the target. The GoY is in
the process of arranging the bidding for the operation of this station. As the PDO indicator
shows, when it came to controlling livestock-related diseases, the Project, by design, had
beneficiaries beyond the poor rural producers.

      Contributes to the higher development objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas

73.      The PDO indicators 7 and 8 were used for this purpose: direct project beneficiaries
and female beneficiaries as a percentage. The result for this indicator was 11,445, which
was 91 percent of target. Female beneficiaries as a percentage were 44.5, which was just
above the target of 43 percent. Direct project beneficiaries included local farmers and
livestock owners who received the benefits comprehensively. For example, these livestock
owners were provided with livestock, feed supplements, and fodder, in addition to having
coverage from para-vets. For other groups, these beneficiaries had access not only to better
seeds but also to community labor-saving devices (especially for women), agro-processing
facilities, and production-related start-up activities.

      Contributes to improving natural resources management

74.     The PDO indicator 6 was used for this purpose (also used to measure the protection
of natural resource assets of the poor farmers): land area where sustainable land
management practices have been adopted as a result of the project. The result for this
indicator was 417 ha, which was 174 percent of target. This is partly due to additional
allocation of IFAD financing towards these type of soil conservation and water harvesting
investments (terracing, dikes and water tanks, etc.). Given the lack of services to the poor
rural producers in rainfed areas, one could not identify a counterfactual groups and
determine non-project factors in leading to the above outcomes.

3.3      Efficiency

Rating: Modest
75.     At project completion, the overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) over thirty years
was estimated at 11.2 percent. Although this falls short of the ex-ante ERR of 17.7 percent,
the reasonably high ex-post ERR shows that the costs involved in achieving the project
objective were reasonable in comparison with the benefits, particularly in the context of
the fragile and severely conflict-affected state of Yemen. In addition, although the ERR is
below the hurdle rate of 12.0 percent indicated in the PAD, it is above the current cost of
capital for many developing countries. The financial analysis (see Annex 3) shows that
income-generating activities on farm (related to the main agricultural commodities
supported by the project) have been profitable and are therefore sustainable.

                                             19
76.    The quantifiable benefits from the components are presented below:

77.     Benefits from Component 1 – Farmer-based system of seed improvement and
management: As the Datasheet indicates, 801 tons of improved seeds were produced
annually at completion. The number of hectares covered by the Project, at completion, was
conservatively assumed to be equal to the target of 24,000 ha, although the Beneficiary
Assessment Survey (BAS) indicated that it was overachieved. After conversion of the
financial prices into economic values, the ICR used financial models as the basis for the
calculation of the overall economic benefit stream. This was confirmed with a Farm-Level
Income Analysis to estimate the average income increase per hectare. The annual benefit
from this component is estimated at YR 562,164,960 or US$ 2.6 million.

78.      Benefits from Component 2 – Livestock husbandry and health services: At
completion, the M&E system of the PSU estimated the total number of livestock owners
having obtained better access to basic inputs and services within the project area at 60,000
clients. There was no quantitative data available related to the incremental net benefits per
client/herder benefiting from better veterinary services. However, using indicative
economic results from Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Project (SAPEP;
livestock model illustrating similar activity in the same project area) of 135,357 YR per
stable, one estimates benefits from this component to be 812,142,000 YR (US$3.8 million),
which indicates the magnitude of benefits from better veterinary services, assumed to be
10 percent of the value of the stable on an annual basis.

79.     In addition, the benefits from having the Al-Mokha quarantine station were
estimated. The benefits come from ensuring that animals coming into Yemen (across the
Red Sea) for consumption and for re-export pose no threat to livestock within the country.
The calculation is based upon what the Government gains from the fees, having a 5 percent
profit margin, and assuming a 50 percent capacity utilization. The benefits are estimated at
YR 199 million (US$ 0.9 million) per annum.

80.     The ERR is quite sensitive to the profit margin of the Al-Mokha quarantine station.
Every percentage point increase in profit margin is equivalent to 0.5 percent increase in the
ERR. Consequently, if the profit margin increases to just 6.5 percent, the ERR is 12.0
percent and the efficiency of the project may be rated as Substantial just on the basis of
quantitative benefits alone. If consumer surplus to the importers and consumers are added
to the above amount, the benefit would be even larger.

81.     Benefits from Component 3 - Productive rural development: The main quantifiable
economic benefits from this component came from the terraces’ rehabilitation, water tanks
construction, irrigated canals, as well as new agricultural and agro-forestry plantations
(coffee, mangoes, guava, forestry trees, etc.). Indicative calculations based on information
on RALP economic activities available at SFD, the economic study conducted for SAPEP
and RGP provide an estimation of 141,975,544 YR (US$ 0.7 million) of total quantifiable
benefits under Component 3. The Table below presents the summary of the calculations.

82.     In addition to the quantifiable benefits, the project interventions yielded some
benefits related to the project activities that are difficult to quantify in monetary terms and,
thus, they were not included in the economic analysis. However, they certainly amount to
substantial socio-economic values. Among the non-quantified benefits are the following
five:

83.     Benefits from erosion control and water conservation. Soil erosion control and
water management investments aim at breaking the vicious cycle of poverty – i.e. poverty
leading to land degradation, thereby creating more poverty. Because farmers cannot afford
inputs such as fertilizers, improved seeds, or irrigation equipment, the productivity of their
lands decline, and low yields result along with pressure on marginal lands. Poor farmers
therefore tend to be associated with marginal lands and low yields, in a process that can be
described as a downward spiral of low productivity and land degradation, in which poverty
is not only a result of degradation but a cause of it. Economic valuation of soil erosion
depends on the perspective of the analysis. Soil erosion has both on-site and off-site effects.
Loss of soil productivity is the main on-site effect, while increased frequency of floods and
sedimentation are the off-site effects. Despite the importance of the soil and water
conservation as well as erosion control works, methodological difficulties and the absence
of reliable data prevent a satisfactory quantification of all benefits.

84.    Increased community solidarity and some measures of female empowerment.
The UC Berkeley university study suggests that the program has improved the capacity of
individuals and communities to develop agricultural production in rainfed areas.

85.     Institutional strengthening of the communities, coupled with training and
adoption of participatory approaches for local planning, resulting in more ownership and
better control by these communities of the investments put into place for their benefit. It
will also result in less social conflicts and better relations with the local authorities.

86.    Preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. The objective was: 2341
landraces characterized and conserved by the end of the project in 2014. Collection of the
landraces for the conservation and use was the first step of RALP to improve the production
of the rainfed system. These landraces are important to sustain the livelihood of rural
communities and for providing valuable genetic material for breeding for adaptation to
climate change and for rehabilitation of degraded farming systems.




                                                       21
87.    Survival of at-risk population and provision of day-jobs. The Project was
designed to address the vulnerability of the poor rainfed-agriculture farmers; it provided
674,275 day-jobs in the context of the fragile and severely conflict-affected state of Yemen.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
88.    The overall outcome rating for the project is “Moderately Satisfactory,” reflecting
the moderate shortcomings in the operation’s efficiency. The Project is of high relevance
and was rated substantial for achievement of its objectives. Minor improvements in
operational efficiency of the quarantine facility (e.g. profit margin increasing from 5
percent to 6.5 percent) would improve the project’s efficiency to Substantial and the overall
outcome rating to “Satisfactory”.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
89.    The Project was designed to have poverty reduction impacts, to address gender
aspects and social development, and it and was implemented accordingly.

90.     To assess the views of targeted beneficiaries regarding the project implementation,
a beneficiary assessment was carried out in August 2014. The study selected a sample of
465 subprojects through multi-stage stratified random sampling from a universe of 2,264
subprojects. The study collected information through structured questionnaires, guided
interview questions sheets used to collect data from individuals, small focus group
discussions, and unstructured questionnaires for informants. The study revealed that a
majority of targeted beneficiaries (62.2%) are satisfied with the services provided by the
Project.

91.    The project implementation has improved income, the standard of living, and the
health and nutritional situation for the beneficiaries. The majority of the beneficiaries
(86.4%) stated that their incomes have increased by practicing this profession. The
beneficiaries of the Seed Producers Groups (SPGs) interviewed asserted that the
productivities of their cereal crops have increased by an overall average of 29.5%.

92.    Women participated in groups activities at the level of districts and the communities.
The productive subprojects/activities are suitable to women’s capabilities and work
conditions, such as livestock raising, bees, poultry, food processing, and handcrafts works.
However, women’s involvement as members in the RPG and SPG are relatively low with
only 8% female members in two governorates.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
93.     The Project was designed to address difficulties of poor farmers in the rainfed areas
in getting the services they require from the various Government agencies. While these
agencies did get some support from the Project, what may have been strengthened more is
their ability to deliver on a contractual basis. The Project demonstrated that public

                                             22
institutions, when having incentives of gaining financially from contractual deliveries,
operate more similarly to private institutions rather than government bureaucracies with
budgets. Outside the Government, the village/producer groups were strengthened and
could be expected to serve their communities for the tasks they were created.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
94.     The main outcome that may have been partially unintended is that substantial
benefits from the creation of the quarantine facility will flow to large users of this facility.
To protect the health of the livestock of the poor, this is bound to happen when system
weaknesses are being addressed. Even when user fees are charged, these fees are not able
to extract the full “consumer surplus” of the big users. If the fee becomes too large, users
can be expected to smuggle in/bribe and, thereby, reduce the overall benefit of the facility.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
95.      A Beneficiary Assessment Survey (BAS) undertaken at the end of the project
(August-September 2014) carried out interviews and focus groups with a representative
sample of beneficiaries and stakeholders in 10 districts (two per targeted governorates) out
of 24 districts targeted. Annex 5 summarizes the main findings of the BAS. The survey
found overall positive evaluations of the project implementation, activities, and results by
interviewed beneficiaries. For Component 1, for instance, a majority of interviewed seed
producer groups’ (SPGs) leaders and beneficiaries stated their satisfaction with the services
provided by the project (42% as very good, 25% as good, and 29% as fair), while reporting
important knowledge and skills gained (in selecting of quality seeds, seed conservation
technics, drying process of seeds, and pest control). Eighty-one percent of beneficiaries of
rural producer groups (RPGs) reported selling their products inside their districts, with only
9.4% selling exclusively outside. Suggested solutions to address constraints facing the seed
productions include: construction of water harvesting reservoirs for complementary
irrigation (41%) and provision of maintenance equipment (23%).

96.     Regarding livestock aspects pertaining to Component 2, the majority (95%) of
interviewed RPG beneficiaries were also livestock/animal herders or breeders. Eighty-five
percent of them stated that the welfare of livestock improved as a result of the provision of
veterinary and animal health care services in their areas. Eighty-two percent of interviewed
veterinary para-professional Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) stated that their
number of customers exceeded 100 clients (animal owners and herders), with 86% of them
reporting an increase in their income with the practice of this newly learned trade.
Constraints listed by livestock herders and CAHWs include: lack of refrigeration to keep
treatments, inadequate training (limited to 2-3 months), and lack of financial resources of
community agents to open local veterinary facilities or shops, despite the needs and
opportunities.

97.    In relation to community investments (as opposed to individual ones) supported by
Component 3 to protect and to improve the sustainable management of natural resources
(watershed management, terrace rehabilitation, etc.), 79% of interviewed beneficiaries of
RPGs rated as positive the benefit to their communities of these types of investments, with
42% reporting the implementation of such investments in their areas.
                                              23
98.    The important role of women was also reported; 76% of RPG beneficiaries assessed
the women’s participation as good and 18% as fair; 68% assessed women’s participation
in group decision making processes as good and 24% as fair.

99.     Stakeholder Workshop. An end-of-project Stakeholder Workshop was held in
Sanaa in September 2014 with broad participation of Government officials, various
stakeholders and partner entities, and representatives of beneficiary communities and
groups (see Annex 6 for details). The participants confirmed the usefulness of the
interventions and investments supported by the Project and which, in their view, have
significantly contributed to improve living conditions of the population in targeted rural
areas through improved availability of quality seed suitable to the local climatic and
ecological conditions as well as through improved provision of basic services to increase
productivity of crops and livestock. The workshop highlighted the need to expand and to
scale up the type of interventions initiated by RALP to cover greater portions of the rainfed
areas where most of the small and poor farmer households are located. Recommendations
were also made on the way to better ensure the sustainability of the results achieved with
RALP through more effective distribution systems of the improved varieties of seed
produced and involving relevant government agencies and the established seed producer
groups and associations.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial
100. The Project developed a robust system that was able to cope with the security
situation in 2011. However, the current situation appears to be worsening which results in
a substantial risk to development outcome. The project’s sustainability utilizes both private
sector-community and public sector-community linkages. Consequently, the above risk
would materialize mainly through disruption of the part of the demand based delivery
system that requires public sector-community linkages. The Project utilizes public sector
capacity both at the national level as well as the local level. The institutional arrangements
at the national level, including that at SFD, are more vulnerable. On the other hand, many
working arrangements developed under the Project, e.g. between a community and the
para-veterinary, require very little support from the state. Others, such as the quarantine
facility, given the fees it would charge, could still conceivably operate, because it would
require a relatively stable political situation only for the area where it is located.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
101.   The rating is based on the following strengths:


                                             24
   •   The Bank identified how rainfed agriculture was very relevant for Yemen and
       facilitated preparation work that used extensive consultation with the beneficiaries.
       It used Bank inputs and processes well (such as balancing AAA with lessons from
       past projects).
   •   Specifically, within the beneficiary group, the Project addressed gender and
       environmental aspects, such as livestock-related activities which were
       predominantly women’s activities, and broken-down terraces and water harvesting
       infrastructures that had diminished water assets of the poor.
   •   The Bank appraised the strengths and weaknesses of the providers, including those
       of public entities, and it developed implementation arrangements so that two-thirds
       of the activities would rely upon a tested agency, while the other third would
       develop relatively weaker entities.

102.   Balanced by:
   •   Weak development of evaluation arrangements, including the lack of creation of a
       baseline (for example with ownership of livestock).

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory
103. The Bank was particularly proactive in identifying opportunities (reflected in
restructuring/reallocation of funds towards infrastructure works related to water assets) and
recognizing dead ends with appropriate resolution (for example with lack of credit
institutions in the project areas leading to creation of savings groups). This, of course,
required considerable flexibility from IFAD and was facilitated by the participation of
IFAD representatives in joint supervision missions. In addition, the rating is based on the
following:
   •   Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes, particularly in the beginning when
       the Project was developing many of the institutional arrangements. During that
       period, the supervision team regularly provided detailed Aide Memoires covering,
       among other things, fiduciary aspects.
   •   Focusing on development impact, leading to changing implementation
       arrangements when it was needed. This required being responsive to the Bank’s
       FY13-14 ISN when the project created a large number of short-term jobs in the
       project area (450% of target).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
104. Overall Bank performance is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory,” reflecting the
“Moderately Satisfactory” rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and the
“Satisfactory” rating for quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance


                                             25
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105.   The rating is based on the following:
   •   Ownership that included providing counterpart funding exceeding what was agreed
       during the June 2012 restructuring as well as senior leaders availing themselves to
       Bank missions without fail.
   •   Once the Project was approved by the legislative body, the GoY supported
       implementation arrangements, including appointment of key staff, and initiating
       restructuring requests.
   •   Moderate shortcoming arose when it did not always provide adequate budget to
       some agencies playing a supplier role.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies’ Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106.   The rating is based on the following:
   •   There were two implementation agencies: MAI and SFD. Implementation agency
       performance is rated as “moderately satisfactory”. Both were quite committed to
       achieving the project development objective.
   •   Fiduciary performance (FM, and procurement) was good at SFD, and adequate at
       MAI, throughout the implementation period. Auditors were chosen at both agencies
       as planned, and the auditors in their reports indicated that the processes at both the
       agencies were reliable.
   •   Developing the large quarantine facility required considerable coordination, for
       example with local councils, and extensive involvement of international consultants.
       MAI, in spite of delays, delivered on this.
   •   The SFD’s implementing performance was satisfactory, except for a proposed
       micro-finance sub-component under the IFAD loan. SFD was to contract out
       implementation of this activity to a specialized implementing agency. However, for
       many reasons, SFD could not contract out implementation of this component and,
       subsequently, IFAD funds were reallocated in agreement with the Bank and IFAD.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
107. Overall Borrower performance is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory,” reflecting the
“moderately satisfactory” rating for both Government and Implementing Agency
performance.

6. Lessons Learned

108. In Low-Income Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS), for efficient project
implementation under limited administrative capacity, develop a simple project design
that promotes active participation of the beneficiaries. The Project was relevant for
                                            26
addressing sustainable rainfed agriculture system in a very dry and water-scarce country,
and was effective in addressing this agro system that had been ignored by the GoY and the
donor community. It followed certain “principles” that helped even when the context
worsened after the Arab Spring and engagement strategy had to be adjusted. Some of these
principles have later been captured in the December 2013 IEG independent evaluation of
WBG assistance to FCSs (see overview pages 26-35). The Lesson Learned is that for the
design of new projects in FCSs, one should develop a simple project design that promotes
active participation of the beneficiaries, resulting in a demand-based delivery system. It
also requires building of both private and public sector capacity. This is because the Bank’s
approach to sustainability utilizes both private sector-community and public sector-
community linkages. Gender-based group formation also proves to be crucial for projects
in remote areas because of physical isolation.

109. Create local-level coordination early because it may develop faster than that at
the national level. SFD was to help farmers demand services from MAI, and the
institutional design required considerable coordination between MAI and SFD. At the
national level, this coordination was slow to develop. Maybe having to work with SFD to
implement agricultural activities (core work of MAI) was difficult to accept for MAI.
However, at the local level, collaboration between SFD, MAI, and farmers groups
developed more efficiently, and was quickly constructive and productive. In addition, at
the local level, MAI staff appreciated learning how to respond better to the farmers’ needs.
The successful collaboration was demonstrated both for: (i) formation of the seed producer
associations, and (ii) for training of veterinarians and para-veterinarians. The Lesson
Learned is that the Bank could start with a broad institutional understanding at the national
level, letting it develop more slowly, and quickly move to creating effective coordination
at the local level where the real work is taking place

110. Assess implementation capabilities carefully, including capabilities to use
languages for procurement or to receive training. The Bank had assumed, maybe because
of past experiences with SFD, that procurement professionals would not be hindered from
following Bank guidelines based on their lack of adequate knowledge of English. However,
at MAI, the availability of procurement professionals with adequate knowledge of English
proved to be difficult in the beginning. Similarly, staff selected for the Masters Program on
Animal Health had to postpone travel because the person was unprepared to take courses
in English. The Lesson Learned is that appraisal should include, in Yemen and similar
countries, stocktaking of such language skills within the implementing agencies and start
redressing them even before the project becomes effective. In more general terms, the Bank
should carry out capacity building assessments for the implementing agencies and provide
adequate training to carry out the implementation. It should weigh against giving
implementation responsibilities to entities which have yet to build their capacities.

111. Assign the construction of large facilities to other entities when the implementing
agency usually does not handle such large constructions. The Bank had assumed that,
with the help of an international consulting firm, the construction of the large quarantine
facility would be completed within a reasonable period. It was estimated that this US$ 3-4
million facility could be built in less than one year. In the end, the construction was

                                             27
completed at the end of the eight-year project period, with much of the delay fortunately
happening at the design stage. The Lesson Learned is that a good understanding of the
size of construction undertaken by the implementing agency is required. The Bank may
have to look within the Government and determine who generally undertakes the largest
construction project, and it should improve, if nothing else, the estimated time and cost for
such construction.

112. Improve evaluation designs so that PAD’s analysis could be replicated at
Completion. At appraisal, the Bank had developed complex models for cost-benefit
analysis. However, the M&E design did not include evaluation efforts that could replicate
the ex-ante analysis, or gather the data to measure efficiency. The Bank might have
assumed that the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission would be an appropriate time to make
a thorough analysis of what was needed for evaluation. However, such an analysis was
never undertaken throughout the Project. The focus was on monitoring progress and impact
analysis limited to one component, and that was without taking cost into account. The
Lesson Learned is that comparability of analyses and calculation of efficiency are
important; so the preparation/design team has to ensure that the project M&E design can
deliver what would be required at Completion. This is a clear and easy lesson which
nevertheless is missed with surprising regularity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

113. The executive summary of the Borrower’s completion report is presented in Annex
6. It is included as received from the Borrower, without modifications. Because of the
socio-political and constitutional crisis prevailing in the country at the time of the
finalization of the ICR, no further comments were received from the Borrower on the final
ICR.

114. The Yemen RALP ICR was shared electronically with the implementing agencies.
Both the PSU and SFD highlighted a few corrections and clarifications inserted directly in
the text of the document to confirm the level of results and achievement at the project
closing. These have been taken into account as warranted and included in the final ICR. In
addition, the implementing agencies are also of the view that ratings of the project outcome
and of the performance of Bank/IFAD and the Borrower should be upgraded to satisfactory
because of the high level of achievement of results in spite of a series of disruptive
challenges and obstacles that were faced throughout implementation. The disruption of the
socio-political crisis of 2011, which led to a suspension of disbursement by the Bank,
combined with a deteriorating security situation in the country prevented the
implementation of the project in full accordance with the initial schedule and plans.

(b) Cofinanciers

115. Parallel co-financing was provided by the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD). IFAD’s comments and feedback provided during the preparation of
the ICR have been taken into account.

                                             28
116. IFAD’s final comments on the ICR are provided in Annex 8. The main issues
raised are: (a) the concerns related to the rural finance sub-component envisaged as a major
feature of the Project but that was eventually dropped during implementation, (b) the need
for a better-articulated explanation of the reasons that led to the dropping of this sub-
component, and (c) the overall implications of this decision on the overall assessment and
impact of the whole project.

117.     It is highlighted in the ICR that the Rural Finance sub-component was introduced
only at the time of the appraisal of the IFAD loan for RALP and was not part of the original
design of RALP. Three actions were recommended, namely: (a) support to existing micro-
finance institutions in the project areas; (b) give MF institutions capacity to cover project areas
and develop; and (c) engage in policy dialogue concerning the development of community-
level savings and credit institutions. The ICR articulates the justification behind dropping
the topic as follows: (a) start-up delays arose when the implementing agency was unable
to find and to mobilize microfinance institutions in the project areas which could assume
implementation of this work. Additional delays were also due to the disruption associated
with the political upheaval and that led to the suspension of disbursement by the World
Bank. These delays rendered the related rural finance activities no longer implementable
within the implementation time left for RALP. Furthermore, because of IFAD’s flexibility
and responsiveness to the client’s needs, the reallocation of fund, from the rural finance
sub-component towards soil conservation and water harvesting investments (terracing,
dikes, water tanks, etc.), allowed the Project to exceed the targets for these much-needed
basic infrastructures that are also in high demand from the beneficiaries.

118. Finally, the dearth of rural microfinance institutions in the project area made it
difficult for the implementing agency to offer full-fledged financial service in these areas.
Combining with similar findings, the ICR articulates the lesson learned as follows: In Low-
Income Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCS), for efficient project implementation
under limited administrative capacity, develop a simple project design that promotes active
participation of the beneficiaries.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Not applicable.

Annex 2: Summary of Principal Outputs by Component

1.     Component 1: Farmer-based system of seed improvement and management

 •   Group members (see component 3 below) received adequate training on technical,
     financial, and managerial aspects related to seed production, varieties’ maintenance,
     secured storing, and operation and management of community organizations.
 •   Knowledge of the group members on new technologies and farm practices was
     significantly improved.
 •   Facilities and farm machinery delivered to the Seed Growers Associations (SGAs)
     encouraged about 13,000 farmers to adopt improved crop varieties and cultivation
     technology and practices.
 •   Some Seed Producer Groups (SPGs) and SGAs were trained and facilitated to produce
     quality landrace seeds at the farm level, which led to the establishment of a network
     for seed delivery and marketing of the developed landraces.
 •   The International Centre for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) was
     contracted to provide technical backstopping and training for the project partners
     involved in this component. A total of 157 staff were trained in a range of thematic
     areas, covering genetic resources (conservation, characterization, documentation);
     participatory crop improvement; seed science and technology (variety identification
     and maintenance; seed production, processing and quality control); seed enterprise
     development and management; and seed marketing and seed business plan
     development.

2.     Component 2: Livestock husbandry and health services

•    The General Directorate of Animal Resources (Currently the Directorate General for
     Animal Health & Veterinary Quarantine [DGAHVQ] and the Directorate General for
     Animal Development [DGAD]) was supported to improve its capacity to fulfill its
     core functions. Among other things, capacity of the central Directorates was improved
     through training and capacity building programs. In addition, technical staff working
     in the field of veterinary services and livestock husbandry were trained inside and
     outside the country.
•    The Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Sanaa and three regional laboratories
     (Taiz, Hodeida, and Abs) were fully equipped. The CVL was equipped with diagnostic
     equipment and solutions. In addition, a biological crematory was purchased and
     installed, four 4WD vehicles were purchased and distributed, a vaccination production
     unit was established, and a unit specialized on analyzing environmental impacts of
     drugs as well as analyzing fodder, food, and water was established in each of the three
     laboratories.
•    After a survey of quarantine facilities, the one at Al-Mokha was expanded. The need
     for a larger quarantine with greater capacity to adequately service the port of Al-
     Mokha, stemmed from the need to handle the increasing volume of imported livestock
     through this strategically located port to satisfy the fast-expanding demand for meat
     in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.


                                            31
Component 3: Productive rural development

•   Rural producers’ capacity building is at the core of this component. Capacity building
    activities were achieved either directly through: (i) the provision of facilitators and
    technical advice to farmer groups (male, female, youth) to help them get organized;
    and (ii) indirectly through farmer groups implementing subprojects of their choice, with
    technical and financial support from the Project.
•   In total 70 Seed Producer Groups (SPGs) in the five target governorates were
    established and operating.
•   At each of the five Governorates, a regional Seed Growers Associations (SGA) was
    established. These were related to the enhancement of rainfed cereals and legumes
    production and post-harvest handling, including seed production and management.
•   In addition, 2,221 groups of small rural producers were formed (about 88% of what
    was planned).
•   Farmers' access to livestock services through public-private partnerships was improved.
    1,461 livestock producer groups, 82 poultry producer groups, and 491 honey producer
    groups were established. The Project also trained 221 para-vet workers, who have
    received basic veterinary tools and some drugs to support them to start private
    businesses, providing veterinary services in rural areas. In addition, 33 vet technicians
    have been qualified and mobilized.
•   In addition, projects covered: (a) small vegetable gardens; (b) fruit production and post-
    harvest handling/marketing; (c) coffee production, post-harvest handling and
    marketing; (d) handicraft production and marketing; and (e) soil conservation, water
    harvesting, and agro-forestry.

                                       I.         Cost-Benefit Calculations

1.       As shown in Table 1 below, at Completion, the overall Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) over thirty years is estimated at 11.2 percent. Although this falls short of the ex-ante
ERR of 17.7 percent, the reasonably high ex-post ERR shows that the costs involved in
achieving the project objective were reasonable in comparison with the benefits,
particularly in the context of the fragile and severely conflict-affected state of Yemen. In
addition, although the ERR is below the hurdle rate of 12.0 percent indicated in the PAD,
it is above the current cost of capital for many developing countries.

                             II.        Data sources and general assumptions

2.      Sources. The analysis carried out at project completion assessed the relevance of
the assumptions made at appraisal based on key data provided by the Project Support Unit
(PSU) and different documents, such as the Quantitative Evaluation of the Social Fund for
Development (SFD) and the Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Program (RALP) by
University of California, Berkeley, in 2013; and the Beneficiary Assessment of RALP in
2014 (see Annex 9 for a complete list).

3.      Currency and exchange rate. On the subject of Yemeni national currency
(Yemeni riyal [YR]), it should be noted that in the wake of the unrest that began in early
2011 the riyal came under severe downward pressure. In response, the Central Bank kept
the official rate steady at about YR 215 = USD 1.00. The same exchange rate has been
used throughout the present analysis.

4.      Prices. Input and output prices were collected in January 2015 and expressed in
constant terms. Standard conversion factors have been used in economic analysis to adjust
the local content of costs assumed to be non-traded 10. A distortion was perceived in the
market prices with respect to border prices of major cereal grains (sorghum, wheat, barley
and millet) for which a conversion factor 11 of 0.9 was applied for the economic analysis.
Shadow prices for rural labor were estimated at 50% of the prevailing market wage rate,
while for skilled labor, the market rate was assumed to reflect its opportunity cost.

5.      Cost Stream. In order to estimate the Project's economic viability, in the form of
the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) presented above, the cash flow included the actual
project costs. Table 2 (below) provides a breakdown of actual costs per component. In
addition, annual future replacement (for infrastructure investments office and computer
equipment/materials, etc.) and recurrent costs (mainly operation and maintenance for
transportation, equipment, and materials) were estimated at 10 percent of actual project
costs.

6.      Benefit Stream. The benefits stream corresponds to the quantifiable benefits from
the three components, including the benefits of having the quarantine station at Al Mokha.
After conversion of the financial prices into economic values, the financial models
described in the financial analysis section below were used as the basis for the calculation
of the overall economic benefit stream. Given the lack of data, it has also been assumed
that during the investment period the build-up of benefits (except for the Al Mokha facility)
corresponds to the project disbursement rate.

7.            The incremental quantifiable benefit streams were calculated as follows:

8.      Component 1: Farmer-based system of seed improvement and management.
At appraisal, it was assumed that 580 tons of seeds of prominent landraces will be produced
and supplied annually to farmers by the fifth year of project implementation to allow
coverage of 24,000 ha with improved landraces. At completion, the BAS indicated that 801
tons of improved seeds were produced each year. The target of 24,000 ha has been over
achieved; however, given the lack of data related to the exact number of hectares covered
by the Project, at completion it was conservatively assumed that only 24,000 ha were
covered. Table 3 below presents an indicative calculation of the benefits from Component
1. Total economic quantifiable benefit from this component is estimated at 562,164,960

 10.     The ICR used the above information to estimate the income increase per hectare. It
 averaged the income increase for various farms, eliminated the top and bottom two results,
 and arrived at an estimate of YR 18,200/ha. Consequently, the annual benefit from this
 component was estimated at YR 436,800,000 (YR 18,200/ha times 24,000 ha), which is
 comparable with the benefit of the Component of YR 562,164,960 from yield-increase
 models above (Table 3). The benefit from the yield-increase model was used to calculate
 the ex-post ERR.

 11.     Component 2: Livestock husbandry and health services. At appraisal, benefits
 from livestock investments were calculated based on herd size estimates at governorate
 levels (including cattle, small ruminants, and camels). It was assumed that, without the
 project, about 30% of the total herd in 5 governorates had access to veterinary services.
 With project, the animal population having access to improved veterinary services was
 assumed to reach 60% of the total animal population of the 5 governorates. At completion,
 the M&E system of the PSU estimated the total number of livestock owners having
 obtained better access to basic inputs and services within the project area at 60,000. At this
 stage, there is no quantitative data related to the incremental net benefits per client/herder
 benefiting from better veterinary services. However, using economic analysis carried out
 under RALP and indicative economic results from SAPEP (livestock model illustrating
 similar activity in the same project area) of 135,357 YR per stable, one obtains 812,142,000
 YR, which indicates the magnitude of benefits from better veterinary services, assumed to
 be 10 percent of the value of the stable on an annual basis.

 12.     In addition, the benefits from having the Al-Mokha quarantine station was
 estimated. The benefits come from ensuring that animals coming into Yemen (across the
 Red Sea) for consumption and for re-export pose no threat to livestock within the country.
 This benefit is estimated at YR 1.99 billion (US$ 9.3 million). The calculations (see Table
 5) is based upon what the Government gains from the fees, having a 5 percent profit margin,
 and assuming a 50 percent capacity utilization.

 13.     The ERR is quite sensitive to the profit margin of the Al-Mokha quarantine station.

                                              36
Every percentage point increase in profit margin is equivalent to 0.5 percent increase in the
ERR. Consequently, if the profit margin increases to just 6.5 percent, the ERR is 12.0
percent and the efficiency of the project may be rated as Substantial just on the basis of
quantitative benefits alone. If consumer surplus to the importers and consumers are added
to the above amount, the benefit would be even larger.

14.     Component 3: Productive rural development. Main quantifiable economic
benefits from this component came from the terraces’ rehabilitation, water tanks
construction, irrigated canals, as well as new agricultural and agro-forestry plantations
(coffee, mangoes, guava, forestry trees, etc.). Indicative calculations based on the economic
study conducted for SAPEP and RGP provide an estimation of 141,975,544 YR of total
quantifiable benefits under Component 3. Table 6 presents the summary of the calculations.

                                       IV.       Financial Analysis

15.     The financial analysis below shows that income-generating activities on farm
(related to the main agricultural commodities supported by the project) have been
profitable and therefore sustainable.

16.     Component 1: Farmer-based system of seed improvement and management.
The rationale behind the component design was that traditional rainfed production systems
represent about 60% of the cultivated area. However, no development support has been
provided to this system in the past. RALP was the first project that targeted the rainfed
system and dealt with the local cereals and legumes landraces which are the staple food for
the rural community. At appraisal, a financial analysis of improved agricultural production
(supported by Component 1) was carried out based on several cereal and pulses models.
Table 7 (below) presents the yields per crop and per governorate. At appraisal, assumptions

                                                       37
on yields without project were based on the average yields per governorate and per crop
over the past four years. With project, the crop productivity per hectare for all the crops in
all governorates was to increase by 10%. At completion, information collected by Project
Support Unit (PSU) for the Beneficiary Assessment Study (BAS) shows a productivity
increase per hectare going from 6% (for cowpeas in Hodeida) to 31% (for wheat in Sanaa).
The best results have been obtained after 3 cycles of crop improvements for wheat, barley,
maize, sorghum, and millet, and after 2 crop improvement cycles for peas and lentils.
Limited results for cowpea are due to the fact that only one crop improvement cycle had
been carried out for this crop.

17.     Crop models developed at appraisal have been revised at completion using the
actual yields and constant prices of 2015. Given the fact that at appraisal calculations were
made using constant prices 2004, incremental net benefits per crop have been inflated to
obtain 2015 prices. Table 8 (below) presents the summary of these calculations.

18.     Crop budgets constructed using data collected on the field by PSU show that the
cultivation of the crops supported by the project is financially profitable for the project
participants, as the application of the technical package for seed production and the training
received by farmers translated into increased availability of seeds, increased agricultural

                                                                           38
production, and incremental net benefits per hectare in the range from 8,250 YR for
cowpeas in Hodeida to 62,563 YR for sorghum in Hajjah. Return to labor of these models
varies from 1,179 YR to 10,650 YR per day which is close to or above the standard daily
wage of 2,000 YR/day. This suggests that a farmer was better off working on the RALP-
supported crop production that than looking for work elsewhere.

19.     It has to be mentioned that the main objective of the component was twofold: (i)
promote on-farm conservation and participatory improvement of prominent landraces; and
(ii) create a sustainable farmer-based system for seed multiplication and distribution of
landraces in rainfed areas by encouraging farmer groups to establish themselves as seed
producers groups and ultimately marketing associations. With this regard, the component
has been successful not only in generating additional income for participating farmers but
also in creating a sustainable farmer-based system for seed multiplication through 70 Seed
Producers’ Groups and 5 Seed Growers Associations in all participating governorates.

20.     Component 2: Livestock husbandry and health services. The rationale behind
the Component 2 design was that improving livestock owners’ access to quality services
and goods (through proximity services and inputs delivery and training of community
veterinary technicians and animal health workers) will enhance the health and have a
positive impact on productivity of their animals.

21.     During implementation, RALP strongly promoted activities improving livestock
owners’ access to quality veterinary services and essential inputs, with 192
community/village animal health workers (CAHWs) and veterinary technicians trained in
2014, bringing the total of health workers and veterinary technicians to 221. Out of these
221 veterinary technicians, 33 were provided with veterinary equipment and medicine bags
to start their activities and provide veterinary services to their communities in the 5
governorates.

22.     At appraisal, benefits from livestock investments were calculated based on the
assumption that ‘with project’, meat and milk productivity would increase by 40% within
the project area and by 15% in other governorates. At completion, the ICR team didn’t
have access to data related to milk and meat productivity increases at the farm level.
However, financial calculations made in 2014 for the purpose of the World Bank co-
financed SAPEP for similar activities and project area (based on empirical data by the MoA
and SDF) suggest that improved animal husbandry will generate an annual net benefit of
75,599 YR for 10 sheep and 41,893 YR for 10 goats. Financial calculation made in 2013
for the IFAD-funded RGPs shows a net benefit of 135,357 YR for a stable with one cow
and six small ruminants.

23.    Quantitative Evaluation of the Social Fund for Development of RALP undertaken
by UC Berkeley in 2013 presents strong evidence that the program increased ownership of
goats and sheep, showing the Project promoted types of agricultural investment that would
not otherwise have been made. The size of the effects also suggests positive spillovers on
animal ownership beyond the initial grant. The estimated impact on the average number of
animals owned was an increase of about 1.5 goats or sheep per household.

                                           39
24.     Component 3: Productive rural development. The rationale behind the
component 3 design was that technical assistance to rural producers to upgrade and
diversify their agriculture and livestock production, processing and marketing systems, and
better conserve soil and harvest water in the Uplands would help producers to upgrade and
diversify their agriculture and livestock production, processing and marketing systems,
better conserve soil and harvest water. Under the component 3 around 242,443 meter²
terraces were rehabilitated, 282 water tanks (with 56,180 m3 tanks capacity) were
constructed for complementary irrigation and/or livestock, 810 hectares of agricultural land
benefited from irrigated canals, 11 hectares of the projects land were planted, 15,000 coffee
seedlings and 13,460 different seedlings (mangoes, guava, forestry trees) were planted.

25.     At appraisal, no financial analysis was carried out for the Component 3. At
completion, the lack of data on the impact of the activities carried out under Component 3
on the livelihoods does not allow to carry a full financial analysis. However, some
indications can be found in the recent studies carried out by the SFD for SAPEP. Table 9
(below) presents an indicative summary of the incremental net benefits from the different
activities similar to the ones carried by Component 3 of RALP. This provides some
indications on the level of benefits that could be obtained by RALP.

                              V.      Non-quantified Benefits

26.     In addition to the quantifiable benefits, the project interventions yielded some
benefits related to the project activities that are difficult to quantify in monetary terms and,
thus, they were not included in the economic analysis. However, they certainly amount to
substantial socio-economic values. Among the non-quantified benefits are the following
five qualitative ones that merit mentioning:

27.     Benefits from erosion control and water conservation. Soil erosion control and
water management investments aim at breaking the vicious cycle of poverty – i.e. poverty
leading to land degradation and thereby creating more poverty. Because farmers cannot
afford inputs such as fertilizers, improved seeds, or irrigation equipment, the productivity
of their land declines and low yields result along with pressure on marginal lands. Poor
farmers therefore tend to be associated with marginal lands and low yields, in a process
that can be described as a downward spiral of low productivity and land degradation, in
which poverty is not only a result of degradation but a cause of it. Economic valuation of
soil erosion depends on the perspective of the analysis. Soil erosion has both on-site and

                                              40
off-site effects. Loss of soil productivity is the main on-site effect, while increased
frequency of floods and sedimentation are the off-site effects. Despite the importance of
the soil and water conservation and erosion control works, methodological difficulties and
the absence of reliable data prevent a satisfactory quantification of all benefits.


28.    Increased community solidarity and some measures of female empowerment.
The UC Berkeley university study suggests that the program has improved the capacity of
individuals and communities to develop agricultural production in rainfed areas.

29.     Institutional strengthening of the communities, coupled with training and
adoption of participatory approaches for local planning, resulting in more ownership and
better control by these communities of the investments put into place for their benefit. It
will also result in less social conflicts and better relations with the local authorities.

30.     Preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity: The objective was 2341
landraces characterized and conserved by the end of the project in 2014. Collection of the
landraces for the conservation and use was the first step of RALP to improve the production
of the rainfed system. These landraces are important to sustain the livelihoods of rural
communities and for providing valuable genetic material for breeding for adaptation to
climate change and for rehabilitation of degraded farming systems.

31.    Survival of at-risk population and provision of day-jobs. The Project was
designed to address the vulnerability of the poor rainfed-agriculture farmers; it provided

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

1.     The objectives of the Beneficiary Assessment Survey (BAS) to assess the project
achievement, implementation arrangements, institutional performance, outputs, and
problem and constraints as seen from the direct beneficiaries’ and informants’ perspectives.
The survey also intended to assess and reflect the overall beneficiaries’ satisfaction, and it
provides an overall assessment of the project objectives from the beneficiaries’
perspectives.

Methodology
2.          The assessment:
     (a)   Selected two (2) districts from each of the 5 Governorates;
     (b)   In these 10 districts, about 1033 productive subproject activities had been
           undertaken; 465 subprojects were selected as a sample for the BAS and (representing
           45% of the total);
     (c)   Used data collection tools: structured questionnaires, semi-structured checklists,
           unstructured interviews, and observations; these instruments were used with the seed
           producer groups (SPGs) and rural producers groups (RPGs) at the community level
           and at inter-community level that were formed and funded by the SFD;
     (d)   In addition, 22 of the veterinary paraprofessionals and CAHWs were interviewed
           individually, and 30 seeds producers groups at the community level were also met
           as a Focus Groups Meetings / discussions (FGDs); and
     (e)   It was undertaken after the project was completed.

Main Findings
3.     At the governorate level, the most important services provided by the Project as
mentioned by the SGAs leaders are: (a) provision of seeds covers (21%), (b) provision of
water pumps (12%), and (c) provision of improved seeds (11%). The rest of services
mentioned are training on modern production practices/methods, provision of seed
threshers, construction of watershed reservoirs/storage (infrastructure), etc.
4.      The majority (83%) of the SPGs leaders indicated that the beneficiaries/producers
participated in collecting and improving of germplasm/landraces with researcher in their
areas. The most important knowledge/skills gained by the beneficiaries as stated by the
SPGs leaders/representatives are:
    (a) Selecting a good quality seed (53%);
    (b) Learning seed conservation techniques (35%);
    (c) Learning the drying process of seed correctly (7%); and
    (d) Knowing the seed pests, and getting the appropriate seed (2%) for each situation.

5.     A majority of SPGs leaders/beneficiaries interviewed stated that their satisfaction
with the services provided by the Project as very good (42%) and good (25%). Another
29% rated the services as fair.
6.      The total numbers of rural producers groups' (RPGs) activities/subprojects included
in the sample were 440 subprojects broken down as follows: livestock (61.1%), honey

                                                44
production (30%), and poultry (6%) of the total RPGs subprojects, in addition to other
subprojects, i.e. threshing machine (1.8%), almond nursery (1.1%), etc.

7.      The beneficiaries of the RPGs interviewed reported that the subject matter of
technical advice obtained was as follows:
    (a) Modern production inputs (31.1%);
    (b) Training on modern production methods (31%);
    (c) Bookkeeping, problem analysis, marketing (32%);
    (d) Bee and beehives (1.6%), and
    (e) Seed storage and water harvesting tank/storage (0.1%);
    (f) A vast majority (81%) of the RPGs beneficiaries sold their products inside their
        districts, while another 9.7% sold both inside and outside their districts. The rest
        (9.4%) sold exclusively outside their districts. Seventy-six percent of the
        beneficiaries did not face marketing difficulties during the sale of their products,
        while the rest (24%) faced difficulties during sale. The types of marketing
        difficulties were: 57% faced low prices, 25% had transport challenges, and 18%
        had problems finding buyers;
    (g) The RPG beneficiaries interviewed expressed their satisfaction of the services
        provided by the Project as very good (22.6%), good (39.6%), and fair (26.4%); and
    (h) The majority (83%) of the RPGs leaders indicated that they had no
        knowledge/experience in forming RPGs/productive groups before the project. A
        large majority of the RPGs (90%) also indicated that beneficiaries’ subprojects
        were still active after the project had closed.

8.      The most suggested solutions to solve the problems/constraints of the seeds sub-
sector according to the beneficiaries of the RPGs are as follows:
    (a) Construction of the reservoir water harvesting for complementary irrigation (41%);
    (b) Equipment provision for maintenance (23%);
    (c) Bird controls (9%) and providing a tractor for every district (9%); and
    (d) Increase the amount of seeds that are distributed (6%).

9.     Another common complaint was that the producers were unable to get the
equipment and machinery services at the same time they needed them for starting the crop
planting season, because the season is short and distances between their districts are
considerable.

Improvement in livestock and the provision of these services
10.     The majority of the beneficiaries of the RPGs (95%) were also livestock/animal
herders or breeders. Eighty-five percent of them stated that livestock welfare has improved
as a result of the provision of veterinary and animal health care services in their areas.

11.     The majority (73%) of the Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) interviewed
stated that their training had lasted for 3 months, and the rest stated it had lasted 2 months.
All CAHWs indicated that they had received portable veterinary bags, as well as a sample
of the treatments/drugs. Eighty-two percent indicated that their number of customers
exceeded 100 clients (animal owners and herders); 86.4% of them also stated that their
                                              45
incomes have increased by practicing this profession. Sixty-four percent of animal health
workers indicated that they have not been involved in national awareness campaigns.

12.       Constraints mentioned by the livestock herders/owners and CAHWs:
      •   Lack refrigerators for keeping veterinary treatments in/or near the targeted areas,
          especially in warm regions;
      •   Inadequate training for health care workers, technicians, and veterinarians;
      •   Some veterinary treatments available for diseases that affect animals/livestock in
          the targeted regions are not appropriate/suitable for such diseases; and
      •   The inability of veterinary care workers and technicians to open veterinary clinics
          in their districts due to inability or lack of financial resources, despite their
          importance.

13.       The main problems faced in forming groups were:
      •   Disputes over membership due to lack of awareness;
      •   Dependency and complacency, and agreement on the organization of work groups
          and task allocation; and
      •   Inability to pay the financial contribution required.

11.       The economic benefits for the group’s members:
      •   Improved productivity and production of crops, livestock, poultry and, bees;
      •   Availability of milk from sheep to the children;
      •   Meat for holidays and Eid;
      •   Improved standard of living from veterinary services which improved animal
          health;
      •   Work/job opportunities for community members, and new sources of income;
      •   Availability of water for irrigation and watering the animals; and
      •   Increased productive assets of farmers.

12.     Forty-two percent of the beneficiaries of the RPGs reported joint infrastructure
projects for community (as opposed to individual ones) to protect their natural resources
such as: watershed management, terraces rehabilitation, etc., which were implemented in
their areas. Seventy-nine percent of them rated the benefits to their communities from
such common projects as positive.

13.    Women’s role: 76% of the beneficiaries of the rural producer groups (RPGs)
assessed women’s participation as good, and 18% assessed it as fair. Sixty-eight percent of
the beneficiaries of the RPGs assessed women participation in group decision making
process as good, and 24% assessed it as fair. With regard to beekeeping subprojects as an
income-generating activities for rural women, some women indicated that the selection of
such subprojects were unsuccessful and also were unsuitable with regards to the privacy of
rural women, because the bees require frequent transporting from one place to another.

Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.     In September 2012, an enlarged workshop was held in Sanaa to which a number of
stakeholders, government officials, implementing agencies, and representatives of funding
agencies and international organizations as well as representatives of the benefiting
communities and Seed Producers' Associations were invited.

2.      The following conclusions and recommendations were formulated:
     (a) The Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock Project (RALP) has significantly
         contributed to the government efforts to improve living conditions of the population
         in rural areas by improving quality of seeds suitable to the climatic and ecological
         conditions prevailing in the rainfed farming system as well as providing basic
         services to increase productivity of crops and livestock and consequently raise farm
         incomes, which enabled rainfed farmers to compensate losses caused by low
         seasonal rainfall and irregular precipitation;
     (b) Sustainability of activities achieved by RALP will not be insured unless a
         monitoring program is operational to systematically follow up with continuity
         programs. For example, it is crucial to support the General Seed Multiplication
         Corporation (GSMC) to be able to supply farmers with the quantities of improved
         varieties of seeds and also buy the quantity of cereals produced by Seed Producer
         Associations (SPAs) in different areas as well as provide technical advice to the
         farmer groups and community organizations established by RALP;
     (c) Where needed, SPAs should be better connected with the official institutions to
         insure that they will get adequate technical and managerial support usually provided
         to associations working in the agricultural sector;
     (d) SPAs are established at governorate level, while Seed Producer Groups (SPGs) are
         located all over the governorate. This means that the GSMC is obliged to deliver
         small quantities of seeds to the farmers in districts like Luhayah and Jabal Rass
         which are located about 400 km from each other. It will be more economic if seeds
         are delivered to the SPA's offices and if the Seed Producers' Associations undertake
         distribution activities to the SPGs in different districts;
     (e) The Beneficiary Impact Survey (BIS), according to the presentation delivered by
         the BIS consultant, has indicated that beneficiaries are fully satisfied with the
         results achieved by using improved varieties of seeds provided through RALP ;
         they affirmed that productivity of cereals has increased by 30-50% which positively
         affected farm income; and
     (f) Workshop participants have strongly urged government to make arrangements to
         provide funds to continue RALP and expand its activities to cover most of the
         rainfed areas in the country because the majority of the small and poor farming
         households in the country are located in rainfed areas (as opposed being in irrigated
         areas).

Annex 7: Borrower’s Completion Report—Executive Summary

     Prepared by: The Project Support Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and
         Irrigation in collaboration with the Social Fund for Development
                                 Republic of Yemen

                               EVALUATION SUMMARY

I      PROJECT FORMULATION

1.      Project concept and design: The design of the Project took account of the lessons
learned from the earlier rural development projects implemented by the World Bank/IDA
and/or other donors. Therefore its concept and design are considered Highly Satisfactory,
since most of the targets have been achieved eventually. The PRSP follow-up has indicated
the necessity for initiating a development program that would assist rural poor relying on
rainfed agriculture to improve productivity of the cereals and legumes produced under dry
conditions that consequently would also increase family incomes and improve living
conditions of rural households. Rainfed farming is a significant income source for more
than 50 percent of the population in Yemen as well as main source for providing basic
foodstuffs for rural families.
2.      Relevance: Assistance to the agricultural sector is considered essential, for the
country’s economic growth. The Government of Yemen's (GoY's) Second Five-Year Plan
(2001 – 2005) targeted agriculture as one of the leading sectors for employment generation,
aiming at a 5.8 percent rate of growth per annum in order to achieve: (i) increased food
security and diversification of agricultural exports by raising productivity; and (ii) improve
farmers' incomes. The productivity gap as well as the extent of post-harvest losses point to
a substantial potential for agricultural development.
3.       In spite of the potential for development, traditional rainfed and livestock
production systems had been neglected for a number of reasons. GoY policies concentrated
on irrigated agriculture during the past three decades, applying the philosophy of some
foreign experts who disseminated the idea saying "traditional agriculture is labor-intensive,
its development programs are very expensive and economic rate of return is very low",
therefore it is not advisable to spend foreign loans and credits on that which would not
enhance the economic growth rate. They argued that it was more profitable to support
programs to develop irrigated agriculture where productivity can easily be increased and
market production expanded. These views towards rainfed agriculture and the availability
of low priced imported cereals encouraged rural populations to slowly leave rainfed
farming and become consumers of the imported products. This behavior has caused
significant deterioration of the rainfed terraces to the level that rehabilitation is being very
expensive; in addition, most of the fertile soils have been washed out and re-cultivation of
such crop areas in some mountain slopes has become difficult or impossible.
4.       Stakeholder participation in formulation: During the project life, a number of
farmers were duly trained and facilitated to improve productivity and increase annual farm
income. The project implementation strategy is based fully on participation of the
benefiting communities by the execution of the development plans. Improving productivity

                                              48
of cereal crops in rainfed areas could not be achieved unless a number of basic elements
had been developed: (i) variety of seeds planted is suitable to the climatic and ecological
conditions in the rainfed highlands; this goal could only be realized by identifying,
collecting and conserving the most prominent landraces usually used by rainfed farmers in
the past, which had to undergo several processing measures to verify quality and purity of
each variety to be recognized as improved seeds for successful production; (ii) the seed
production, distribution, marketing and storing system needed to be changed to transfer
seed production, multiplication and marketing responsibilities to the farmers concerned
with this issue at community/district level, where farmers can cooperate to establish CBOs
such as seed producer groups that should be formed based on several technical and social
criteria. These groups had to be promoted, trained and supported by several agencies
including SFD, GSMC, and AREA to ensure they are operating properly.

Project Components
The project had the following four components:
Component 1: Farmer-based system of seed improvement and management;
Component 2: Livestock husbandry and health services;
Component 3: Productive rural development; and
Component 4: Project Support Unit.

5.      Component 1 included three sub-components: (i) crop improvement, variety
maintenance and seed quality assurance; (ii) promotion of seed producer groups (on-farm
seed production); and (iii) initiation of seed delivery and marketing network for rainfed
areas. Implementation of activities related to the three sub-components was actually
divided between several actors, which included: AREA, GSMC, SFD, Aden University,
Sanaa University, Quality Control Division of MAI, ICARDA, and PSU with the overall
management.

6.       SFD was given major responsibilities, which included: (i) establish, train and
facilitate seed producer groups at community level in each district; (ii) establish, train and
facilitate Seed Growers Associations (SGAs) at governorate level; (iii) supplying SGAs
with cultivation machinery and equipment; (iv) provide SGAs with office furniture; (v)
construction of stores to store seeds; (vi) construct water tanks for watering animals; (vii)
construction of water harvesting reservoirs for supplementary irrigation; (viii) distributing
fruits and forestry seedlings; (vii) rehabilitation of terraces in some specific districts to be
planted with olive trees; and (viii) construct structures in some specific Wadi embankments
to protect land against water erosions.

7.      According to the SFD report published in August 2014 five SGAs were established
at governorate level, 70 Seed Producer Groups (SPG) and in total 1,811 rural producer
groups had been formed. In addition, 1,635 eligible rural families received funds to carry
out small productive projects in the field of agriculture and related activities, which are
distributed as follows: livestock production 1,324, beekeeping 461, farming 196, and other
productive activities 102.

8.        The results achieved in different sub-components designated to SFD are as follows:
                                      Activities                    Unit      Quantity

9.      In addition, SFD supplied the five established Seed Growers Associations (SGAs)
with five tractors and the related parts, five mobile machines for cleaning and processing
seeds, five threshing machines, five stores with different storing capacities, and 18
reservoirs for complementary irrigation. Offices of the five SGAs have been completely
furnished and required materials and utensils (like seed bags, chemicals, spray machines,
etc.) have been provided in the five governorates.
10.        In the field of livestock husbandry and health services of Component 2: SFD
trained 221 animal health providers who received basic tools to serve communities on how
to protect animals against different diseases, how to improve feeding practices, and how to
produce healthy and productive animals. Therefore, results achieved by SFD are
considered as Satisfactory.

II        PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
11.     Project Governance: The Project was governed by a Steering Committee (SC)
chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation and which included representatives of
the following ministries and agencies as members: (1) Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation (MoPIC), Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI),
Ministry of Finance (MoF), General Corporation for Seed Multiplication (GSMC), Social
Fund for Development (SFD), General Directorate for Animal Health and Quarantine
(GDAHQ), and the Project Manager. Daily activities and operational tasks were performed
by the Project Support Unit (PSU), led by an Executive Manager appointed by the MAI
Minister in consultation with the donors. The Project Manager reported directly to the MAI
minister and was responsible to manage daily activities, including technical, financial and
administrative tasks. In total 15 meetings were held which were presided over by the three
succeeding Ministers. Minutes of the meetings were prepared and decisions taken by the
SC meeting were followed up by H.E. the MAI Minister and by the Director General:
before starting an SC meeting the MAI Minister and Chairman of the SC meeting was
obligated to quickly review whether the decisions taken in the previous meeting had been

                                                 50
followed through. During the meeting, the RALP Director General was obligated to update
the Minister and SC members regarding the implementation status of the project activities
related to components 1 and 2, while SFD representatives from his side briefed the Steering
Committee regarding activities designated to the Fund; SC was responsible to facilitate and
provide the assistance required by the PSU to enable project staff to accomplish obligations
and tasks. Cooperation between PSU and ARDU at the SFD head-office enabled the project
to achieve targeted results within the time schedule. Therefore, the project governance was
Highly Satisfactory.
12.     Administration and Management of the Project: Project budgets were
monitored and controlled, procurement rules and regulations were adhered to, and
disbursement rates were in line with the implementation level, although the allocation of
funds by components had been modified to reallocate proceeds to cover the cost increase
for constructing and equipping of the quarantine facility in the Mokha area. The Project
was characterized by an excellent disbursement rate, approaching 100% at the time of the
ICR Mission. Activities related to the second and third sub-components implemented by
SFD were completed in a timely manner, and disbursements reached about 100%. Reports
and other relevant documents were easily traceable at the project office, and the project
staff was well versed with their tasks and duties. However, the PSU did not include some
important divisions like a section for monitoring and evaluation, and a technical division
that should design and supervise technical issues related to the project. The “soft” parts of
the Project, however, contributed to sustainability. Therefore, the management of the
Project is ranked as Highly Satisfactory.
13.     Stakeholder participation on project implementation and partnerships: Nearly
all stakeholders participated in the implementation of the Project. The sector's situation has
been taken into consideration sufficiently and definitely included a number of steps in the
design and stakeholder consultations, and Steering Committee meetings were conducted
periodically. Partnerships existed between the Project and several entities, in particular the
Agricultural Research and Extension Authority (AREA), the General Directorate for
Animal Health and Quarantine (GDAHQ), and local authorities, especially MAI branches
in the governorates. Involvement of stakeholders and rural farmers in the implementation
of project activities has encouraged seed producers to improve productivity; a significant
production increase was realized within three crop seasons. Production of cereals increased
by 15% and 31% by framers have adopted the improved production technologies compared
with farmers didn't adopt them. However, this increment would not have been achieved if
farmer groups and Seed Growers Associations (SGAs) had not been established, trained
and facilitated. So participation was considered Satisfactory.
14.    Risk management: One of the largest risks facing the project was the political
insecurity for a considerable period. Implementation agencies were forced to postpone
some project activities until the situation was normalized and field activities could be
continued. The second risk was the involvement of several actors in the project
implementation which reduced coordination efficiency and delayed action plans. Hence,
the management Risk is considered Satisfactory.
15.    Co-financing: IFAD provided parallel financing to the Program by allocating USD
16.7 million, most of which was used for financing activities to be implemented through
SFD. Disbursement reached 100% at the ICR, implementation indicators revealed that

                                             51
results have been achieved according to plan, and sometimes results have exceeded the
plans. Some of the outputs of the IFAD-financed activities were necessary to assist the
participatory approach of the Project. The IFAD financing results of the Project is
considered Satisfactory.
16.     Monitoring and Evaluation: Despite of the lack of a clear plan to conduct M&E
during implementation of the Project, IDA was compelled to hire international experts to
execute annual missions to follow up project activities and assess effectiveness of project
interventions and assess progress made by implementing agencies. Regrettably,
contributions of some international experts could not be provided due to the political
situation in the country, and hence the PSU, from its side, involved national expertise,
which mostly contributed to the M&E activity in an acceptable manner. The M&E Unit of
SFD performed M&E for RALP activities implemented by ARDU; in addition, the
Veterinary Doctor's Association was contracted to monitor activities related to livestock
husbandry and health services. Regularly meetings took place under the chairmanship of
H.E. the MAI Minister, with participation of donors’ representatives (WB and IFAD) and
Government representatives from the MOF and the MOPIC. The Steering Committee
members have attended the SC meetings in which implementation progress was discussed,
and where difficulties and constraints were jointly tackled. Thus, monitoring and
evaluation was considered Satisfactory.
17.      Work plans relating to the Project’s interventions were properly elaborated, and
although budgets for some of the activities were insufficient, collaboration between the
implementing agencies and funding organizations allowed revisions of financial aspects,
including reallocation of funds, which enabled a smooth continuation of implementation
activities and achieve a high disbursement rate.
18.     Use of Logframe and Adaptive Management: Logframes were adjusted from
time to time, taking account of the circumstances in the country. The original one appeared
in the Project Implementation Plan, the second in the Project Appraisal Document, the third
in the Mid-Term Review Report (25/3/2011), and the last one in a Restructuring Paper
March 2012. Therefore, the adaptive management of the project is considered Satisfactory.

III    ATTAINMENT OF OBJECTIVE AND OUTCOMES

The Project Development Objective and Key Indicators
19.    The three-pronged Project Development objectives contribute to the national
development objectives to reduce poverty in rural areas and improve natural resources
management. The Project was designed to enable rural producers in rainfed areas to:
(a) Improve production, processing and marketing systems;
(b) Protect assets: soil; water, rangeland, seeds and animals; and
(c) Get organized for the purpose of (a) and (b) above, through: (i) the development of
    farmer-based systems of seed improvement and management (Part 1); (ii) the
    enhancement of livestock husbandry and health services (Part 2); (iii) the promotion
    of collective rural investments within the project area (Part 3); and (iv) the project
    support unit (Part 4).


                                            52
20.   Parts 1, 2 and 4 were implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
(MAI) through a Project Support Unit (PSU), and while part 3 was implemented and
managed by the Agriculture and Rural Development Unit (ARDU) of the SFD.

Specific Objectives:
       (a) Promote ex-situ and on-farm conservation and participatory improvement of
           prominent landraces; and
       (b) Create a sustainable farmer-based system for seed multiplication and
           distribution of landraces in rainfed areas by encouraging farmer groups to work
           together and establish Seed Producers' Associations (SPAs) and ultimately
           marketing associations.
21.      At completion, results indicate that management of natural resources has been
improved significantly. In the crop production, productivity of some cereals has slightly
increased due to the introduction of the improved seed varieties that have been selected
from the identified, classified, and processed landraces. Incomes of farming households
who are members of Seed Producing Groups (SPG) has also increased through better
utilization of physical and financial resources available as well as the improved marketing,
storing, and handling practices.
22.     The means for improving the value chain may be in place, but that does not
immediately imply improvements to farming operations, without setting up an adequate
seed quality law and seed certification system to replace the weak enforcement of the
current regulations and to better control management of the natural resources. The
introduction of improved farm technologies appropriate to rainfed farming has increased
farmer interest to adopt such technologies and practices; therefore the fulfillment of this
objective is Satisfactory.

Result 1: Improved crop varieties & seed technology practices are adopted
23.     This outcome has after some delay been realized. In total 70 Seed Producer Groups
(SPGs) in the five target governorates were established and are operating. In addition 1,811
groups of small rural producers were formed (about 80% of what was planned); group
members have received adequate training on technical, financial and managerial aspects
related to seed production, varieties maintenance, secured storing, and operation and
management of community organizations; knowledge of the group members on new
technologies and farm practices was significantly improved. Facilities and farm machinery
delivered to the SGAs encouraged 13,000 farmers to adopt improved crop varieties and
cultivation technology and practices.
24.       The five regional Seed Growers Associations (SGAs) established in the five
target governorates, were supposed to be supported and motivated by the GSMC through
continuously supplying required quantity of improved seeds in each governorate and be
committed to buy the outputs produced by group members; this recycling process has been
interrupted and many farmers have neither received the quantity of improved seeds nor
were they able to sell their products to the relevant agency who should refine and process
seed to be sold again to other farmers. The reasons for this interruption, as stated by GSMC,
is lack of funds to collect quantities of seeds produced in different governorates and
perform the necessary processing operations. They requested 7 million YR to cover these
                                             53
expenses but their application was not accepted by MAI. Therefore the achievement under
this component is considered Moderately Satisfactory.

Result 2: Livestock husbandry and health services are improved
25.     This component includes the following sub-components: (i) reinforcement of the
General Directorate of Animal Resources (Currently Directorate General for Animal
Health & Veterinary Quarantine [DGAHVQ] and Directorate General for Animal
Development [DGAD]) to improve its capacity to fulfill its core functions, (ii)
improvement/construction of the Central Veterinary Laboratory and three regional
laboratories (Taiz, Hodeida, and Abs), (iii) rehabilitation and survey of quarantine facilities,
and (iv) improvement of farmers' access to livestock services through public-private
partnership. Most of the activities specified under the sub-components have been achieved
before the project closing date (September 30, 2014) including: (i) capacity of the central
DGs has been improved through training and capacity building programs provided by
RALP; technical staff working in the field of veterinary services and livestock husbandry
have been trained inside and outside the country; (ii) central and regional laboratories have
been developed and equipped, and the following activities were completed at central
laboratory: diagnostic equipment and solutions were delivered, laboratory as well as hall
were completely furnished, a biological crematory has been purchased and installed, four
4WD vehicles were purchased and distributed, a vaccination production unit was
established, a unit specialized on analyzing environmental impacts of drugs as well as
analyzing fodder, food and water was established in each of the three laboratories. The two
regional laboratories in Hodaidah and Abs have also been developed, equipped and
furnished.
26.     The need for a larger quarantine facility with greater capacity to adequately service
the port of Al Mokha, stems from the need to handle the increasing volume of imported
livestock through this strategically located port to satisfy the fast-expanding demand for
meat in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. The cost estimates for this better suited but
costlier quarantine station is around US$ 4.0 million (up from the original estimates of
US$ 1.0 million).
27.     Regarding the construction of the quarantine facility in Al Mokha, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) is being built and equipped by a construction company
and followed up by the PSU to insure that works are in compliance with the environmental
management plan. At the time of the national ICR preparation, construction was fully
completed with basic equipment installed (electricity generator, incinerator, water pumps,
etc.) The supply of equipment and material for the regular functioning of the facility is to
be provided as part of public/-private partnership operating bid already initiated.
28.      SFD has trained 221 veterinary workers who have received work facilities like
pages with veterinary tools and some drugs to support them to start private businesses,
providing veterinary services in rural areas. In addition, 33 veterinary technicians have
been qualified and mobilized. The total number of livestock breeders who benefited from
the vet worker services was 60,000 at the time of ICR; SFD has also formed 1,461 livestock
producer groups, 82 poultry producer groups, and 491 honey producer groups. Results for
Component 2 are considered to be Satisfactory.


                                              54
Result 3: Rural development productivity is increased
29.     Component 3 is co-financed by IFAD and IDA. It was expected to: (i) enhance the
organizational capacity of producers at the community and inter-community levels to
improve their access to public and private services as well as input and output markets; (ii)
provide financial services and technical assistance to rural producer groups (RPGs) to
upgrade and diversify their agriculture and livestock production, processing and marketing
systems, and better conserve soil and harvest water in the uplands; and (iii) improve market
information dissemination. It was based on demand-driven and participatory approaches,
and the final list of activities was determined by the producer groups and the producers’
committees. The approach was adopted not only to ensure that the activities were needs-
based, but also to contribute to the broader goal of empowering the communities by
contributing to the development of conditions that would allow them to decide on resources
allocated for their development.
30.     Results achieved by the farmer-based seed improvements and management by
establishing farmer groups, Seed Producer Groups (SPGs), and Seed Growers Associations
(SGAs) who are trained and facilitated to produce quality landrace seeds at farm level as
well as improved livestock husbandry practices and health services, created the
opportunities for rainfed farmers to establish networks for seed delivery and marketing of
the genetically developed landraces and provided access to veterinary and animal
husbandry services that increase farm income and consequently improve family living
conditions and reduce poverty in rural areas.
31.     Establishment of SPGs and SGAs, as well as delivery of improved seed varieties
developed through genetic process for three cropping seasons and training provided on new
farm technologies and cultivation practices increased farm production in the target areas.
In the Sanaa governorate wheat production increased by 31%, barley by 28%, sorghum by
24%, lentils by 22% and peas by 22%. In the Lahj governorate sorghum production
increased by 27%, millet by 26%, and maize by 27%. In the Hodaidah governorate
sorghum production increased by 16%, millet by 15%, and cowpeas by 6%. In the Mahwit
governorate sorghum production increased by 22% 22%, millet by 28% and cowpeas by
15%. In the Hajjah governorate sorghum production increased by 25%, millet by 13%, and
cowpeas by 16%. Results achieved for Component 3 are therefore considered as Highly
Satisfactory.

Project Restructuring
32.      RALP was restructured three times. The first amendment, dated August 17, 2010,
introduced changes which: (i) allowed a broader geographical project scope (from three to
five governorates); and (ii) modified the procurement thresholds. The second amendment
dated June 26, 2012, introduced: (i) adjustments in the scope of remaining project
activities; (ii) modification of the project implementation arrangements; (iii) reallocation
of proceeds; (iv) removal of all procurement thresholds from the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) and their transfer to the Procurement Plan; and (v) extension of the
project Closing Date by 27 months to September 30, 2014. The third amendment, dated
December 11, 2012 contained: (i) an alignment of the PDO in the legal agreement with that
in the PAD; and (ii) a modification and enhancement of selected indicators in the Result
Framework and Monitoring of the Project.

                                             55
33.     The first project restructuring was manifested in the form of an amendment, dated
August 17, 2010 and introduced changes which modified the: (i) procurement thresholds;
and the (ii) description of the category (2) of Schedule 1 of the DCA to remove the
limitation of disbursements under this Category to only three of the five governorates
targeted by RALP. The second restructuring of RALP was effected in 2012 to include: (i)
adjustments in the scope of the remaining project activities; (ii) modification of the project
implementation arrangements; (iii) reallocation of proceeds; (iv) removal of procurement
thresholds from the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and their transfer to the
procurement plan; and (v) extension of the project Closing Date by 27 months.
34.       The Government of the Republic of Yemen has requested in its letter dated March
13, 2012, certain changes to RALP that included the extension of the Closing Date of the
project and that highlighted the GoY's priority to build with RALP support a quarantine
facility in Al Mokha with a large capacity to handle the increasing volume of imported
livestock through this strategically located port.
35.    The RALP closing date was extended by 27 month, from June 30, 2012, to
September 30, 2014, to enable completion of key remaining activities to achieve the PDO.
The Borrower was in compliance with the Credit covenants, and there were no outstanding
or unsatisfactory audits. The overall performance of the Borrower and the implementing
agencies were considered acceptable and the PDO is achievable.
36.     IFAD Loan No 732-YE issued to co-finance Rainfed Agriculture and Livestock
Project (RALP) was also restructured and modified two times. The first restructuring was
made according to the request submitted by MOPIC with its letter dated 27-05-2013. GoY
requested: (i) reallocation of funds of category III Rural Finance related to sub-component
3 for RALP; and (ii) a six-month extension of the Completion Data and Closing Date. The
MOPIC letter proposed that the amount of 2,650,000 SDR originally allocated for a Rural
Finance Program should be transferred to other project categories, 2,400,000 SDR should
be allocated for Civil Works, and 250,000 SDR for Goods, Consultants Services, and
Grants. The request was approved by the IFAD Board on June 19th 2013. A second
modification was made according to the request submitted by MOPIC with its letter dated
18-05-2014 that proposed reallocation of the originally unallocated amount of 1,070,000
SDR to be transferred to other categories, 489,000 SDR be reallocated to the Civil Works,
and 581,000 SDR to Goods, Consultants Services, and Grants.

IV.     OVERALL PROJECT RATING

37.    In Consideration of the economic, political, and security situation prevailing in the
country, RALP performed well and has achieved good results on different components and
sub-components. The overall project rating is marked as Highly Satisfactory.

Results Framework Analysis

1.    Country and Sector Issues
38.    Yemen is classified as one of the poorest countries in the world with high
population growth rate and scarce natural resources, with nearly 50% of the people living
in absolute poverty and 42% living in food poverty. It is also essentially a rural country,

                                             56
with 77% of the population living in rural areas in over 41,800 scattered hamlets. Due to
the geographical nature of the country, and Islamic inheritance law, land properties are
divided into very small holdings that tend to be scattered over many terraces. Cultivated
areas owned by rural families plus the limited quantity of annual rain and very low
production per unit lead to low family incomes, very difficult living conditions, illiteracy,
malnutrition among children, and therefore poverty has become largely a rural
phenomenon: almost half of the rural population is classified as poor; 83% of the poor live
in rural areas and derive a large share of family income from underdeveloped agriculture
or agriculture-related activities.
39.     Agriculture is the largest sector in Yemen, driving the economic growth, and it
contributes to GDP more than its relative share. Agricultural exports represent
approximately one third of the non-oil merchandize exports. Economic importance of the
agricultural sector can't be measured by its contribution to the GDP only, since agriculture
has a lot of indirect impacts on the economy as a whole; it provides employment and
income for about 55% of the active population in the country. During the period 1996-2001,
economic growth was driven mostly by agriculture, which grew at 5.4 percent a year, and
contributed GDP growth more than its relative share. The discrepancy between the low
contribution of agriculture to GDP and the percentage of those employed in the sector
reflects seasonal employment, underemployment, and low productivity of the factors of
production, which results in low incomes and poor standard of living for those relying on
the sector.
40.       Though rainfed agriculture represent more than 50% of the total cultivated area,
development programs in the past were concentrated mainly on irrigated agriculture, due
to: (i) increasing water use efficiency to raise productivity and yield per unit to match with
the rapid increase of the market demand for foodstuff; (ii) pressures practiced by some
influential people – Sheikhs, landlords, high-ranking officials and merchants – who own
most of the cultivated areas in the Wadis and plains to be developed; they were the main
beneficiaries of irrigation schemes constructed by the government; (iii) underestimation of
the importance of rainfed agriculture by strategic planners, while rainfed areas are the main
sources for income generation of the majority of the farming households; this policy
deprived most of the rainfed farmers from receiving basic services such as financial
resources, as well as inputs and improved agriculture technologies and practices.
41.     Despite the potential and profitability for developing rainfed farming, traditional
agriculture and livestock systems have steadily been neglected, though most of the poor
and small farmers are relying on rainfed farming that should actually be targeted by
development programs.
42.     Experiences have revealed that neither huge investment on irrigation schemes nor
introduction of new varieties of seeds could change the situation of grain shortages. To the
contrary, the gap between demand and supply has gradually expanded; the reasons are that
rich farmers do not cultivate their own properties, they rather hire income tenants who are
treated like slaves, which has resulted in low production and very low incomes.
43.    The rainfall occurs largely during two seasons; the summer rains derived from the
south-west monsoon winds which yield precipitation between June and September. The
cyclonic north-east spring rains are more erratic and weaker, occurring in late March-May.

                                             57
Rainfall varies from more than 800 mm in the southern uplands – particularly the Ibb region
- to between 50-150mm/year in the western plain, Tihama and eastern provinces where
soils tend to be chalky or sandy and cannot well-retain rainfall or apply water in the crop
rooting zone against gravitational pull. Frost and even hail can occur from November to
January at elevations above 2,200 m above sea level and can damage young crops of some
fenugreek (Holba) varieties for instance, shred maize leaves and puncture potato leaves,
and lay the latter crop open to secondary fungal infections.
44.     Yields per unit of most field crops have declined over the last decades. There are
several reasons behind the decreasing productivity of most cereal crops which are the main
foodstuffs for rural families. This includes:
  • shortages of water for irrigation whether rainwater, groundwater, or spate;
  • deterioration of the soil and environment, through negligence and overuse cultivated
     fields;
  • deterioration of the genetic resource base - yield potential of seed has not been
     maintained due to lack of knowledge regarding new technologies, lack of services
     required by farming families including financial, inputs and marketing information,
     low purchasing power of farmers in the rainfed areas; and
  • lack of farmer-first focus and application by research and extension agencies.
45.      The strategy in the agricultural sector for achieving good results, and thereby
sustaining production, must be better in terms of harvesting of the rainfall and Wadi flows;
and more efficient usage of available water resources, from whichever source and for
whatever purpose. The rainfed sub-sector production system is in the medium- and long-
term far more sustainable than that of the irrigated sub-sector, and has to provide for the
majority of the rural population, which is also poor. Yet it is particularly the rainfed system
that is characterized by declining productivity and a deteriorating environment, caused by
demographic and economic pressures. Currently, rainfed land is estimated to account for
nearly 75% of the total arable land, the remaining 25% is being irrigated.

Annex 8: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

IFAD’s final comments communicated via e-mail dated March 27, 2015, from the Country
Programme Manager, Near East, North Africa and Europe Division, Programme
Management Department were as follows: “As discussed, my main concerns is related to
the RF [Rural Finance] component. The design envisaged access to rural finance as a major
component and the Project rationale was built on this. The justification of dropping the RF
component in the ICR is not well articulated. Para 27 of page 7, mentioned that (“Rural
Finance” category since related activities could no longer be implemented in time before
the closing of the project because of significant start-up delays with this sub-component).
I am not sure if this is the right justifications for dropping this component. Is it a matter of
the capacity of SDF, what implementation support was provided by [the] WB/IFAD? Was
this discussed in the MTR and what was the position of the WB at MTR? I know lately we
agreed to reallocate the allocation of RF to Civil Works; then what was the implication of
this decision on the whole project rationale and impact. I know there is dearth of
information to provide concrete answers. However, even from a normative perspective we
need to say something”.
