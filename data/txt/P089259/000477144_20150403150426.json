moderately satisfactory outcome\n            with substantial risk to development outcome. Both the Bank\n            and the Borrower received moderately satisfactory\n            performance ratings for their part in the project. The IDA\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was restructured three\n            times. The first restructuring introduced changes which: (a)\n            reinstated the geographical coverage of the project to the\n            original five governorates, following an agreement with the\n            International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to\n            provide to bridge, inter alia, the remaining expenditures\n            under Component 3 of the Project; and (b) modified the\n            procurement thresholds. The second restructuring: (a)\n            adjusted the scope of the project activities, and\n            reallocated the proceeds across the modified activities\n            (including the assignment of the unallocated fund in the IDA\n            DCA; (b) modified the project implementation arrangements;\n            (c) removed all procurement thresholds from the DCA and\n            transferred these to the procurement plan; and (d) extended\n            the project closing date by 27 months. The third\n            restructuring of the IDA Credit aligned the PDO in the legal\n            agreement with that in the PAD, and revised and enhanced the\n            result framework and monitoring of the Project. Several\n            lessons were learned from this project including the\n            following: (1) in low-income fragile and conflict-affected\n            states (FCS), for efficient project implementation under\n            limited administrative capacity, develop a simple project\n            design that promotes active participation of the\n            beneficiaries, (2) create local-level coordination early\n            because it may develop faster than that at the national\n            level, (3) assess implementation capabilities carefully,\n            including capabilities to use languages for procurement or\n            to receive training, (4) assign the construction of large\n            facilities to other entities when the implementing agency\n            usually does not handle such large constructions, (5)\n            improve evaluation designs so that PAD\u0092s analysis could be\n            replicated at completion."}, "docdt": "2015-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
