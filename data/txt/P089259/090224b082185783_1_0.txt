                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The three-pronged Project Development Objective contributes to the higher development objectives of reducing poverty in rural areas and improving natural resources
                         management. The project would enable poor rural producers in rainfed areas to: (a) improve their production, processing and marketing systems; (b) protect their
                         assets: soil, water, rangeland, seeds and animals; and (c) get organized for the purpose of (a) and (b) above.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR update is based on the outcome of the implementation support mission conducted in Sana'a in October 2013. RALP is now only months away from its closing date of
                         September 30, 2014. Overall project implementation is proceeding well. Since the last mission in April 2013, RALP has maintained a steady pace of implementation. Key ongoing
                         activities remaining to be completed include the construction and opening for operations of the new live-animal quarantine facility in Al-Mokha, and various community investments

                         (pertaining in particular to watershed management, soil and water conservation, livestock and income generation) in project areas. If the current pace of progress is sustained over
                         the remaining implementation period, RALP is on track to achieve satisfactorily its stated objectives and expected results before the project closes in September 2014. Accordingly,
                         the IDA credit and IFAD loan are also expected to be fully disbursed by project closing.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The signing of the amendment to the IDA Development Credit Agreement for RALP to reflect the changes adopted in the Results Framework was completed in May 2013. Similarly,
                         the final approval was provided on June 25, 2013 to: (a) extend the completion and closing dates (to September 30, 2014 and to March 31, 2015 respectively) of the IFAD loan co-
                         financing the productive rural development component of RALP, and (b) reallocate resources from the idle rural finance sub-component to faster moving and highly demanded

                         community investments pertaining to watershed management, soil and water conservation, livestock and income generation.

                         With the construction of the new live animal quarantine facility of Al-Mokha is well underway for completion in June 2014, the mission highlighted the need for the Ministry of
                         Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) to ensure that effective and sustainable operating arrangements for the facility are put in place and operational before RALP closes in September
                         2014. To achieve this, it is important that the ongoing identification and definition process of such arrangements be completed before the end of 2013, and that the tendering process
                         to select and contract a suitable operator be initiated promptly thereafter.

                         With regards to the productive rural development component co-financed by IFAD, disbursements under this component have accelerated in recent months. The Social Fund for
                         Development (SFD) will continue to monitor progress closely and to ensure that investments on the ground under this component are delivered and completed with quality and in a
                         timely fashion. The IFAD loan is expected to be fully disbursed by project closing if the current pace of implementation is maintained.
