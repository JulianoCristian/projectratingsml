The lessons learned indicate that project\n            design should be simple and focused. In this case, the\n            relatively modest incremental resources brought by the\n            project were unable to resolve systemic institutional issues\n            in research, extension, supervision and maintenance of rural\n            works, farm credit, livestock marketing, and local\n            government finance, among others. More attention should have\n            been paid to the broader policy context and the specific\n            linkages of the project to policy reform. In this case, the\n            free inputs and subsidized cattle were meant to motivate\n            technology change to further the poverty alleviation policy\n            goal but ran counter to the rural credit policy reform goal.\n            Operational manuals setting out details of how a project is\n            to be implemented at all levels should be prepared prior to\n            Loan approval, to ensure that preparation is adequate and\n            that all involved partners have a clear and common\n            understanding of the project and its resource implications.\n            Revolving funds in nonfinancial sector projects are unlikely\n            to succeed without institutional and policy support from the\n            financial sector. Line agencies of governments generally do\n            not have the requisite mandate and skills. There is a role\n            for community-managed micro-finance in Indonesia, but this\n            should be savings-led and integrated with the rural banking system."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
