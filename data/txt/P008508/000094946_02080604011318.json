Finance and Enterprise Development\n            Project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as likely,\n            institutional development impact as substantial, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The general economic decline in 1994-1996 a\n            and social tension arising from the transition program, and\n            frequent changes in the government structure and counterpart\n            arrangements affected project implementation. The\n            Borrower's ownership of and commitment to the project\n            is critical for the success of the project. Flexibility of\n            design is essential in technical assistance operations,\n            particularly in rapidly changing environments of a\n            transition economy. The project design and implementation\n            arrangements should be simple. Close and frequent\n            collaboration with project beneficiaries is an essential\n            element of technical assistance projects and helps to\n            reinforce borrower commitment. Complex IT procurement\n            requires close supervision and strong technical support both\n            o the part of the beneficiary and the Bank. Continuity in\n            staffing is a critical factor for project success. Funding\n            of the project audit should be incorporated into the project\n            costs to ensure that adequate counterpart funding will be available."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
