Some lessons learned included:  a\n            responsive national training and fellowship program should\n            be better linked to economic priorities and should include\n            private sector opportunities. The project has positively\n            influenced a reduction on expatriate staff employed within\n            the public sector. Community involvement in the planning and\n            operation of a new a toll school increases commitment and\n            assists with the resolution of arising problems. The formula\n            of using periodic implementation consultants was more\n            economical and a good approach for the on the-job training\n            of project implementation unit (PIU) staff. Government\n            realized that unless increased linkages existed between\n            economic priorities and the fellowship allocations, the\n            reduction of nationals kill shortages will be more\n            difficult. It also noted that unless the private sector was\n            able to obtain some access to training and fellowships the\n            country's economic growth will remain slower."}, "docdt": "1996-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
