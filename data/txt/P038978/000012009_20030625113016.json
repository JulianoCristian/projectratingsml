The inclusion of\n            social partners  to build consensus, positively affected the\n            implementation of the project, and the achievement of its\n            objectives . But a systematic and ongoing consensus during\n            implementation is needed, to build close consultations with\n            beneficiaries, key representatives of employers'\n            federation and labor unions during supervision, a factor\n            that helped find institutional alternatives for a continuing\n            dialogue. Moreover, understanding the political and social\n            environment in which the Bank operates, thus demonstrating\n            flexibility, becomes paramount, as in this case where the\n            existing environment was not favorable to the introduction\n            of an in-service training law, but the revision of the 1974\n            Vocational Training Tax decree, was proposed and implemented\n            instead.Nevertheless, to ensure the adequate implementation\n            of innovative mechanisms, the Bank should consider investing\n            early on, in improving the technical competencies of\n            implementing agencies, through new follow-up instruments,\n            such as impact studies for example, which have the greatest\n            chance of being implemented, if technical training,\n            seminars, etc., are held at project preparation and\n            implementation. In addition a project that aims to improve\n            private sector competitiveness by upgrading workers skills,\n            requires close collaboration between all ministries involved\n            in the sector - such as Industry and Vocational Training,\n            and between Bank departments, e.g. Human Development and\n            Private Sector Development."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
