Some lessons learned included:\n            the government commitment and implementation capacity of the\n            project should have been assessed independently of the\n            concomitantly designed adjustment operation. The task team\n            repeatedly discussed these problems with the Government, but\n            without success in gaining an early decision on how these\n            reforms should proceed whiles the disbursements continued at\n            a slow pace. This underlines the importance of more in-depth\n            risk analysis in project design and during implementation.\n            Testing projects on a pilot basis is important to their\n            success. Restructuring the treasury operation was an\n            important part of the project. Effective coordination of\n            activities with other donors and projects requires time and\n            can delay implementation. The decision to restructure the\n            project was opportune at that time because it quickly and\n            effectively assisted the Government with addressing the\n            pressing needs for Avian Influenza (AI) mitigation."}, "docdt": "2010-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
