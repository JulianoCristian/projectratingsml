For the Veterinary\n            Services component, the EMP addresses zoonotic disease\n            containment  and waste management as pertain to special\n            waste, emissions and materials at laboratories, and training\n            for veterinary services workers, to include procedures for\n            safe handling of AI materials; safe culling of infected and\n            at-risk poultry; and disposal of carcasses.  Specifically,\n            mitigation measures include using soil as overfill; using\n            fencing and implementing a comprehensive security strategy\n            to prevent contamination; sealing covered containers and\n            transport vehicles; using disinfectant and sprays to wash\n            down vehicles; placing carcasses in bags; covering carcasses\n            with lime before burial; using impermeable surfaces to\n            prevent leaching; and collecting and storing the\n            disinfectant used. For the Human Health component, the EMP\n            focuses on equipment, refurbishing and training for\n            reference and regional diagnostic laboratories to include\n            key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and\n            waste management. The EMP provides mitigation plans and\n            monitoring plans to ensure appropriate attention to\n            environmental issues, and to tracking progress or problems\n            in their management."}, "docdt": "2006-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
