1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Government of Azerbaijan implemented a number of policy measures in the 1990s to
reduce macroeconomic imbalances, promote economic growth, and ensure rapid
transition to a market-based economy. Concurrently IDA mounted several
complementary operations, including the first policy-based operation in Azerbaijan (the
Rehabilitation Credit) and the first Institution Building Technical Assistance Project
(IBTA-I). By the end of the decade, a growing incidence of institutional and economic
issues compromised the early stages of Azerbaijan's economic recovery.

In 2000, following a period of slow structural reforms (particularly in governance and the
public sector), the Government expanded and intensified its reform efforts to stimulate
growth of the non-oil economy and reduce poverty. IDA responded by preparing two
operations: the Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC-II; March 2002), and the
Second Institution Building Technical Assistance Credit (IBTA-II; June 2002). The
objective of SAC-II was to enhance policy reforms, while IBTA-II was designed to
provide requisite capacity and expertise to the Government to implement SAC -II-
supported policy measures. Together with the IMF program and other public sector
reforms, these operations were intended to strengthen the Government's ability to
manage its rising oil revenues, which were expected to grow from 2006 onward.

IBTA-II was IDA's second operation to build the country's capacity to implement public
sector reform in Azerbaijan. IBTA-I, approved in the mid-1990s, helped the Government
develop and implement its economic reform policies and programs, efforts that continued
under IBTA II. In addition, a financial sector TA project, approved in 2001, eased
capacity gaps in that area. These activities were considered critical to put in place before
the window of opportunity for reform could potentially narrow with Azerbaijan's new oil
revenue stream.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective was to improve the public financial and expenditure
management process by providing greater transparency and accountability in the
management of public resources. More specifically, the project aimed to provide
resources and expertise for improving transparency and accountability in public financial
management; strengthening the tracking of poverty-reducing public expenditures and
monitoring their impact; improving the strategic priority setting and transparency of
public expenditures; and promoting private sector development. It also provided
assistance for the design and implementation of the Government's reform program
incorporated in the State Program of Poverty Reduction and Economic Development
(SPPRED) and was meant to build the institutional capacity needed to carry out these
programs. In achieving the aforementioned objective, the project sought to (i) provide
technical assistance to support specific policy measures and programs under the Second
Adjustment Credit, and (ii) help the Government to build the required institutional
capacity and skills to carry out these programs.



                                             1
The key performance indicators were (*):
     Improved public financial management evidenced by audit reports of the
       Chamber of Accounts indicating compliance with the Budget Systems Law, the
       Procurement Law, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, and the Public
       Investment Program.
     Improvement of the business environment evidenced by the results of the annual
       survey of business environment.
     The adoption of international standards and compliance with privatization
       guidelines provided by IDA (e.g., use of reputable advisors for transactions such
       as Gas Distribution and Water Distribution).

    (*) A fourth outcome indicator, reduction of quasi fiscal deficits is mentioned once in the main text of
    the PAD but does not appear in Annex 1of the PAD which contains the project performance indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
In 2005 the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus emerged as a global threat,
and in January 2006 the Bank's Board approved the Global Program for Avian Influenza
and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI) to provide immediate
emergency assistance to countries seeking support to address this public health threat. In
February 2006, the Government of Azerbaijan requested emergency Bank assistance after
a number of HPAI outbreaks led to five deaths and culling some 500,000 birds in several
commercial poultry farms. At the Government's request, IDA responded by restructuring
the IBTA-II, so as to use unused Credit funds to help address the threat posed by HPAI.
Accordingly, the PDOs were amended in March 2006 with the addition of a second
objective, namely, to: minimize the threat posed to humans and to the poultry industry
by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection, and in preparing for, control,
and response to the HPAI pandemic and other infectious diseases."

Project scope was expanded to strengthen the country's HPAI preparedness and response
capacity, with an aim to contribute to diminishing the burden of disease and loss of
productivity and limiting the spread of HPAI. Three additional outcome indicators were
specified:
    Improved effectiveness of animal and health services in preparing for and
        responding to HPAI outbreaks and/or an influenza pandemic;
    HPAI outbreak in poultry effectively contained;
    Risk of human infection reduced and treatment improved.

To implement the restructured project, its Closing Date was extended to March 30, 2008.
The amendments to the Development Credit Agreement became effective on June 29,
2006.

The original and the restructured parts of the project constituted two essentially separate
projects, the original project covering public financial management issues, and the
restructured part addressing the very specific challenge of the Avian Influenza emergency.
Implementation under a single, unchanged project code necessitated the preparation of a
single ICR. As a consequence and given that the original and restructured parts absorbed


                                                    2
approximately equal shares of the overall credit amount, the ratings presented in this ICR
are simple average of the ratings for the original and the restructured parts of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The main beneficiaries of strengthened expenditure management included: Government,
Parliament, the Ministry of Finance, local governments, budgetary employees, social
assistance recipients, and users of public goods and services. Beneficiaries of public
procurement reform included: Government, Parliament, central and local budgetary
entities, domestic and foreign suppliers, and contractors. Beneficiaries of improved audit
and financial controls included: Parliament, Government, Ministry of Finance, line
ministries, local governments, and public enterprises. Beneficiaries of improved social
expenditure effectiveness included: Ministry of Finance, and Ministries of Health,
Education and Labor and Social Protection. Finally, beneficiaries of increased private
sector development included: Government, Ministry of Finance, and entrepreneurs
(domestic and foreign).

With the addition of the HPAI component in 2006, two additional beneficiary groups
were added: commercial and backyard poultry owners and those who might become
infected by H5N1. New institutional beneficiaries were the State Veterinary Service
(SVS) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), in particular its central and regional
veterinary laboratories, and the HPAI reference hospital in Baku. The Ministry of Health
(MOH) also benefitted from the AI component. The works, equipment, training, and
technical assistance to be provided for MOH, MOA, the reference hospital, the SVS and
the laboratories were intended to upgrade significantly their institutional capacity to
detect any future outbreak of HPAI and to respond rapidly and effectively to any
emerging threat from the virus. This enhanced detection and response capacity, coupled
with a substantial public awareness and information campaign, was intended to ensure
that poultry owners' risk of losing their flocks to the virus would be minimized and that
any humans infected with H5N1 would receive immediate and effective treatment.

cost: US$2.24 million; Actual costs: US$0.18 million) included: (i) implementing the
recommendations of the business environment study (conducted by FIAS) and providing
funding for the monitoring process to track progress made in this area; (ii) providing
financial advice and technical and legal consultants for the privatization of gas and water
distribution.
Component 5, Project Management (Estimated cost: US$0.68 million; Actual costs:
US$0.63 million) included support for project implementation and the cost of project
management.

1.6 Revised Components
The project restructuring approved in March 2006 added a component, Emergency
Assistance for HPAI Preparedness and Response with four subcomponents, designed to
assist the Government in preparing for and responding to the threat of Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza:

Veterinary Services to support: (i) enhancing HPAI preparedness and response
capability of relevant institutions, including the preparation of a National Action and
Contingency Plan; (ii) strengthening the veterinary services' disease surveillance and
diagnostic capacity for HPAI and other zoonoses; (iii) strengthening H5N1 outbreak
containment capacities; (iv) improving bio-security in poultry production and trade; and
(v) design of a compensation facility for poultry growers in order to mitigate their
financial losses the event of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry. In the veterinary sector
relatively little attention had been paid to upgrading facilities, procedures and staff skills
since Independence, and so the needs to be addressed ranged across a fairly wide
spectrum. On the other hand, much care had to be taken to dovetail the AIPP activities
with those supported by the US-financed BTR Project that was designed and




                                               4
implemented at about the same time.1 The project therefore focused on laboratory
upgrading and training of laboratory staff and veterinarians so as to strengthen the SVS
surveillance and monitoring capability, biosecurity training for poultry producers,
serological surveying to monitor for HPAI outbreaks, essential equipment and protective
gear for first responders, the establishment of a computer- and internet-based interactive
National Animal Disease Information System (NADIS), upgrading the training facilities
at the Veterinary Faculty of the Agricultural University, initiating a systematic approach
to upgrading the SVS to meet international standards (PVS and Gap Analysis, 2 to be
followed by the development of a Strategic Plan), and formulating a policy and
procedures to compensate poultry owners for their losses in the event of mandatory
poultry culling. Not included, in marked contrast to most other IDA-supported HPAI
projects, was any actual or contingency financing to cover the cost of compensating
poultry owners for animals culled under government order, because the Government
committed itself to provide funds for compensation from its own resources.

Human Health to support; (i) enhancing planning and coordination in the public health
sector, (ii) upgrading the public health surveillance systems, and (iii) strengthening the
response and control capacity of the health services, including through the provision of
vaccines and drugs in case of emergency. Based on a specific assessment by the WHO,
there was considered to be, in particular, an urgent need for equipment upgrades in
diagnostic laboratories, for negative-pressure isolation rooms in the primary AI reference
hospital in Baku, and for specific hospital and laboratory staff training.

Public Awareness and Information to support: (i) development, production and
dissemination of communication materials aimed at various target groups; (ii) training
courses, seminars and workshops for various professionals; and (iii) strengthening
coordination and collaboration among government agencies, non-governmental
organizations and the international community. Through an effective public information
and communications effort this subcomponent sought to generate public awareness of the
threat of HPAI to poultry and humans, educate the public on preventive measures, and
assure the public of the state's determination and capacity to ensure public health and
safety. The priorities here, taking into account initiatives already taken by other agencies,
were to formulate ­ in partnership with all concerned institutional stakeholders ­ a
comprehensive national communications strategy, identify effective tools and channels to
reach the key population groups, devise and implement appropriate and effective message
content and format, and to assess periodically the level and changes in public awareness,
attitudes and behavior.

Implementation Support to facilitate: (i) effective project management and
coordination; and (ii) project monitoring and impact evaluation.

1.7 Other significant changes
In addition to formal restructuring which also extended the closing date to March 30,
2008 to provide two years to implement the newly-added AI component, the project
underwent two additional minor restructurings to extend the closing date: first to
September 30, 2009; and then to March 30, 2010 to allow completion of project
activities. At restructuring, implementation responsibility was transferred from the PIU
in the Ministry for Economic Development to the PMU of the State Agency for
Agricultural Credits (SAAC), MOA's agency for overseeing internationally-supported
agriculture projects. At this time, GOA increased its counterpart funding by almost US$1
million to support the newly-added AI activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
There was no quality-at-entry review undertaken by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG).
However, in September 2001, QAG carried out a Quality Enhancement Review of SAC -
II, which found SAC-II to be too broad and recommended that the reform areas be
accompanied by substantial capacity building measures, leading to IBTA-II.

The project was prepared to help Government carry out its reform program supported by
SAC-II. IBTA-II was thus central to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objective
and pillar of helping Azerbaijan manage the oil boom while rationalizing budget
expenditures. During preparation, the task team ensured that IBTA-II development
objectives and scope were consistent with the SAC-II reform agenda and appraised the
project in close coordination with the SAC-II team. It also coordinated with Bank
operations in education, health, social assistance, pension, the financial sector, rural
development, agriculture, environment, energy, water, and transport, as well as TA
programs of other international financial institutions and donors. Task management
turnover was low with only two task managers. This helped maintain effective
collaboration with implementing agencies. The task team was experienced in TA
operations in ECA as well as IBTA-I. In retrospect, the Bank team might have: (i)
assessed more cautiously the borrower commitment on the private sector component
(given the protracted appraisal time), and (ii) prepared a more easily monitorable logical
framework.

The AI component was prepared during project supervision and restructuring and took
place within the framework of the GPAI and under the provisions of the Bank's
emergency policy guidelines (OP/BP 8.50) at a time when outbreaks of HPAI throughout
Asia, Africa and Europe and including in Azerbaijan itself were posing the threat of an
imminent pandemic as the disease already had claimed the lives of five people in the
country. Although several other donors readily agreed to dedicate some resources under
ongoing operations to meet the HPAI threat, only IDA was in a position, by restructuring
IBTA-II, to step in on very short notice with an overarching assistance effort to attempt to
meet the critical needs in the policy, planning, public health, veterinary services and
public awareness fields.




                                             6
With the limited funds available and the short time-frame of only two years originally
envisaged to implement this component, the focus had to be limited and clear. Care had
to be taken to avoid overlap and duplication with other initiatives planned or already
begun by the Government, by other donors, and under other IDA projects. 3 The project
therefore did not cover all H5N1-related aspects in the human and animal health fields,
but sought to address specific gaps in the health and veterinary services considered of
critical importance in the short- and medium-term and not already being targeted by
others. To ensure this, the project design drew directly on the findings and
recommendations of WHO and FAO/OIE country preparedness assessments carried out
in February 2006. Lessons were also incorporated from several HPAI projects appraised
for other countries during the preceding months.

The two-year implementation timeframe envisaged in 2006 for the AIPP component was
unrealistically short, an aspect characterizing many of the HPAI projects prepared at that
time. To allow for the completion of all project activities, the closing date therefore had
to be extended twice, for a total of 24 months.

2.2 Implementation
A key factor affecting implementation was the slippage of project preparation caused by
protracted discussion between the Bank and the Government on the scope of the IBTA -II
reform. At the time, SAC-II was being implemented, with strong up-front condition, and
IBTA-II was viewed as complementary to deepen that reform agenda. But slippage of
the preparation pushed the implementation of crucial activities (privatization, treasury
reforms) into the heart of the oil boom, when the fiscal pressure for reform greatly
diminished and the commitment lingered. IBTA-II involved a large number of
implementing agencies, with different capacities and constraints. They included:
Ministry of Economic Development (public investment program, private sector
development, and oversight and coordination of IBTA-II); Ministry of Finance (public
expenditure reform, reform of audit and financial controls, Treasury operations); Ministry
of Health (health expenditures study); Ministry of Education (education expenditures
study); Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (social assistance reform and labor
redeployment); State Procurement Agency (public procurement reform); and Chamber of
Accounts (external audit reform). There was a clear need for extensive inter-agency
coordination. Similarly, the activities of the MED and SSC needed to be closely
coordinated to update and analyze the poverty profile. Inter-agency coordination and
cooperation were not flagged as implementation risks, nor was existing capacity in the
respective agencies to implement their part of the reforms. The fact that capacity was
known to be weak coupled with the Government's wavering commitment to its public
sector reform agenda - which was flagged at a risk ­ led to uneven implementation and
disparate results. In the case of the PIP preparation iand implementation of the TIMS, it


3
    IDA provided some immediate HPAI assistance under the First Agricultural Development and Credit
    Project (ADCP-I) and the Health Sector LIL, which were both in their final phase of implementation,
    and subsequently also under the Second Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP -II) and
    the Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP), both of which were under preparation when the HPAI threat
    erupted.


                                                  7
led to extensive delays. In the case of enterprise privatization, it led to inaction for
reasons external to the project design and implementation arrangements.

A major factor causing delay in implementing the privatization component was absence
of the Presidential Decree to finalize the privatization of water and gas distribution
enterprises. After months of delay and debate, the Government decided to adopt a
different approach to privatization of the enterprises; decided to restructure and improve
their operational efficiency before privatization, though privatization has not occurred as
of the writing of this ICR. At the same time it created uncertainty regarding the
conclusion of the large-scale privatization program in Azerbaijan.

In one case (improving the business environment) the Ministry of Finance delayed the
process of contract approval and eventually did not sign the final contracts even though
the bidding and evaluation process were long completed. In another case (labor
redeployment) substantial amendment to the original proposed contract (under IBTA -I)
was needed, but the Government then decided not to go ahead with this sub-component.
Delays in purchase of equipment, however, were minor, except in the case of the
Treasury, where the required software needed to be developed and tested before the
tender for equipment was finalized. The time spent to test the software plus the delays in
renovating and preparing the regional offices delayed the procurement of the modified
hardware by several months.

Funds provided by IBTA-II were not sufficient in some areas. The State Statistical
Committee (SSC) needed more hardware. The Chamber of Accounts (COA) intended to
improve audit practice and standards, professional, technical and management training, as
well as organization and human resource management, but the funds that GOA intended
to borrow as part of IBTA-II were substantially less than what COA needed to carry out
these activities. It was therefore necessary to seek alternative funding arrangements to
complete the institutional development needs of that agency and this caused some delays
in completing the work of the Chamber. Also, with grant funding available from various
sources the Government became more reluctant to borrow funds for technical assistance
purposes (e.g., improving business environment under IBTA-II). The availability of a
Swiss grant enabled the Government to complete the poverty and inequality indicators.
USAID complemented IDA's resources and financed the Treasury system for the costs
associated with the application software (US$2.5 million) as well as the costs associated
with IT related consultancies (US$0.325 million) and training (US$0.1 million). In 2005,
USAID also funded a US$5 million project to support the M edium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF).

The substantial restructuring in early 2006 virtually resulted in a new project, the A vian
Influenza Preparedness Project (AIPP), because all the essential original IBTA-II
activities had either been completed at that time or no longer needed IDA financial
support.

Implementation of the AIPP component was satisfactory, benefiting from the presence of
an existing and experienced PMU and a committed Government. The continuous



                                               8
dialogue between the Bank task team and the Government enabled the timely resolution
of potential problems. Counterpart funding was adequate and provided in a timely
fashion. The two ministries with a direct stake in the project, the Ministry of Health and
the Ministry of Agriculture, maintained a sustained interest in the project throughout
implementation. No problems were encountered in financial management or
procurement matters. All financial management and audit reports were provided on time
and were found satisfactory.

A key aspect of AIPP implementation was the strong and continuous need for
coordination with other donors (e.g., WHO, FAO, OIE, UNICEF, USAID, US DTRA)
and also with the IDA-supported Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) and Second
Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP-II). This was effectively
accomplished, mainly through frequent face-to-face meetings. Project implementation
benefited significantly by utilizing synergies across project boundaries and by combining
and/or supplementing resources and efforts wherever possible. AIPP procurement of
laboratory and computer equipment, for instance, was planned so as to supplement
equipment supplies through other projects and could thus focus on needs not filled by
others. Similarly, expertise developed through training-of-trainer programs of other
projects was utilized to extend skills upgrading to larger numbers of human and animal
health professionals under the AIPP. Indeed, the human resources capacity building
effort was exemplary. At least five different major donor agencies coordinated their
training programs: FAO (16), WHO (4), USAID (13), US DTRA (56) and the AIPP (31)
together organized some 120 training courses, seminars and workshops between 2006
and the first quarter of 2010 on HPAI-related topics in a concerted effort to raise
awareness and increase technical capacity while optimizing resource use and impact.
The outcome of this coordinated training program was substantially more pronounced
than had been anticipated, not merely in terms of individuals trained, but also in terms of
impact across a large spectrum of institutions. On the other hand, the need to coordinate
efforts and to avoid duplication also caused occasional delays in some areas, either
because it was necessary to agree first on the proper sequencing of steps or because
certain project activities required prior completion of some actions by other projects.

AIPP implementation was not always expeditious and without problems. Indeed, the
project was not completed within the initially anticipated two-year time frame, and its
Closing Date was extended by a total of 24 months. While this was in part attributable to
an overly optimistic implementation schedule set at the time of IBTA-II restructuring and
AIPP appraisal, it also resulted from delays, some rather significant, in moving
procurement matters along. It took an inordinately long time, for example, to finalize the
list of critical veterinary laboratory equipment needed and the technical specifications for
it, largely because of the need to coordinate procurements with those planned by the
DTRA Project. Similarly, the design of the hospital isolation ward took considerably
longer than expected, because of the lengthy search for appropriate international technical
expertise and because of subsequent misunderstandings between the PMU and the WHO
concerning the scope of works that were to be implemented.




                                             9
Delays were also encountered in securing official governmental approval of key policy
documents. A good Communication Strategy was developed early on, based on the
initial Knowledge, Attitude, Behavior (KAB) Survey, but its approval was much
delayed by the intricacies of governmental procedures involving more than a dozen
ministries and agencies, some of which took no account of the emergency nature of this
undertaking. Implementation of the public information campaign in the high-urgency
environment of the HPAI threat could not wait and therefore began well before the
official approval of this strategy. The final formulation of the National Action Plan 4 also
took much time. Good sectoral action plans were prepared early during the project life
for both the human health and the animal health subsectors, and a complete draft of an
integrated National Plan was ready by April 2008. Its finalization was then postponed,
however, until after the completion of tabletop and real-time field simulation exercises,
and this was only accomplished almost 18 months later, and the National Action Plan
was therefore approved only at the beginning of April 2010. It would, in fact, have been
highly desirable to conduct the field simulation much earlier than September 2009, more
than three years after the project became effective. Had there been any significant
outbreaks of HPAI in the country after the spring of 2006, this failure to test the response
capacity could have had serious consequences. An important issue still to be addressed,
following the specific recommendations provided by a project consultant in 2008, is the
revision of GOA's policy and of the associated implementation guidelines regarding the
payment of compensation to poultry owners in the event of government-mandated culling.
The current legal framework and operational guidelines contain several provisions that
should be modified; most importantly, poultry owners should not be obliged to satisfy
any requirement other than that of ownership. GOA now intends to consider these policy
modifications in its forthcoming review of the national veterinary legislation.

A commendable feature of AIPP implementation was the flexibility shown by both
Government and IDA to respond actively to changing circumstances and emerging needs
and to reallocate funds accordingly, albeit within the given project objectives and scope.
This has allowed the project to set the stage for a more comprehensive upgrading of
national response capabilities in both the human and the animal health sectors to public
health threats well beyond merely HPAI, as was demonstrated when the A/H1N1
pandemic erupted. The establishment of the interactive computerized and internet -based
National Animal Disease Information System (NADIS), now operational already in 20 of
the 66 raions, is a major case in point, as are the operation of a state-of-the-art isolation
ward with eight rooms at the Lung Disease Institute and the substantial strengthening of
the epidemiological surveillance and monitoring capacity through the provision of
modern diagnostic laboratory equipment and the associated staff training.

The public awareness and information effort was well targeted and used effective tools to
reach its target audiences. The content of the messages disseminated was appropriate,

their design was professional and attractive, and their reception among the public was
good. Judging from the findings of the final KAB survey carried out in September 2009
it appears, however, that the impact of the campaign has waned somewhat w ith the
passage of time and with the general perception that the HPAI threat is a thing of the past.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The IBTA-II did not include in its M&E design quantitative indicators to measure
progress toward fulfilling the PDOs. Instead, qualitative indicators were used to assess
progress toward establishing institutional frameworks through legislation to enable
capacity-building and subsequent milestones, i.e., the implementation of the Procurement
Law. The M&E was undertaken by the PMU that worked closely with the project team.

As soon as AIPP implementation began, the PMU employed a full-time M&E specialist
for most of the implementation period. A set of specific M&E indicators was identi fied
and included in all project progress reports. Detailed quarterly progress reports were
prepared on time and provided to all institutional stakeholders and to the Bank. They
adequately reported both progress made and problems and delays encountered and thus
were a useful management tool.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
There were no safeguard issues for the IBTA-II. The PIU, which had gained substantial
experience under IBTA-I, coordinated the project activities of numerous implementing
agencies and beneficiaries and effectively dealt with procurement and financial
management. It thoroughly followed appropriate accounting and internal control
procedures and prepared and submitted to the Bank the required financial and annual
audit reports.

The only Safeguard considered applicable for the AI component of the project was
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). The restructured project was assigned
Environmental Category B, and an Environmental Management Plan was drawn up and
adopted in July 2006. The main concerns related to the safe disposal of infected
materials (animal carcasses, laboratory waste and hospital waste), the possible impact of
disinfectants used in village containment operations on surface and groundwater quality,
and the containment of the HPAI virus in hospital isolation wards. On the whole, the
mitigation and monitoring activities recommended in the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) were implemented satisfactorily, but waste management deficiencies were
found in the final project year in some of the laboratories that required additional staff
training and better oversight to be rectified.

Lack of funds precluded doing more within the confines of this project with respect to the
issue of hospital waste management from infectious patients. However, a National
Health Care Waste Management Policy was prepared in 2009 under the HSRP, so that
this issue can now be addressed with resources available from other projects and the
Government's budget.




                                            11
AIPP was implemented by the existing PMU which is responsible for the implementation
of other bank-financed projects. The expansion obviously led to additional work-load and
pressures for the procurement and financial management staff which coped with the new
challenges in a competent manner. Procurement functions were carried out in full
compliance with the Bank's procedures. Post-reviews were carried out and major issues
were never identified. The AIPP financial management system was satisfactory to the
Bank. Quarterly financial reports and annual audit reports were timely submitted and
found to be acceptable to the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Most of the IBTA-II activities have already been incorporated in the regular operations of
the line ministries. The FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) carried forward
many structural reforms initiated under SAC-II and IBTA-II, particularly on governance,
accountability, and public financial management.

Regarding the AIPP component, the ongoing ADCP-II continues and expands the
capacity building in the veterinary services, while substantial support for far-reaching
reform in the public health field is being provided through the ongoing Health Sector
Reform Project. A new Bank assisted project in the agricultural sector is under
consideration for FY12 and would include a significant animal health component. Major
support for upgrading laboratory capacity continues to be provided through the
Biological Threat Reduction Project under implementation by the US Defense Threat
Reduction Agency. The recurrent O&M costs of the facilities and services strengthened
under the AIPP have been absorbed in the regular budgets of the respective services.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The IBTA-II objectives were consistent with the circumstances of Azerbaijan at the time
the Credit was approved. They supported SAC-II policy measures, were relevant to the
development priorities of the country, and were supported by the Bank's CAS -- aiming
at improving public sector efficiency and accelerating non-oil sector development. Other
CAS objectives, supported by SAC-II and IBTA-II included: (i) reforming public sector
institutions; (ii) strengthening the business environment for private sector development;
and (iii) investing in social development, including targeted poverty alleviation measures.
By providing the needed human resources, IBTA-II sought to address the critical skill
gap that slowed the preparation and implementation of previous reform programs. The
IBTA-II was thus timely in addressing institutional bottlenecks and helping the
Government to implement its intensified structural reforms. These reforms were also
reflected in the Azerbaijan's PRSP (also known as SPPRED, the State Program for
Poverty Reduction and Economic Development), which IBTA-II continued to support.
However when the project was restructured and its closing date extended in 2006, not all
original components had experienced the same level of government ownership and
commitment -- due in large measure to diminished fiscal pressure for capacity reform in
the wake of the oil boom. Nevertheless, between effectiveness (2002) and final closing
(2010), there was some progress on the reform agenda identified in the project. The
greatest progress occurred in the social sectors.


                                            12
The HPAI-related PDOs added in 2006 were highly relevant, and the investments and
activities envisaged were appropriate for an emergency operation of this type. They were
targeted at specific high-priority institutional and operational weaknesses identified by
international expertise from UN technical agencies and the Bank. Where others had
already stepped in or were prepared to take the lead in helping to address particular issues,
close consultations ensured that duplication was avoided and synergies were mobilized.
The tight focus on clear short-term priorities ensured that the project was not overly
complex and that it did not unduly tax the implementation capacity of the agencies
involved. And although the immediate concern was to help close obvious short -term
gaps in country preparedness and response capacity, the project was also laid out so as to
provide the foundation for future broadening and deepening of the institutional
strengthening needed in the animal and human health sectors to deal with public safety
threats other than only avian influenza; this aspect gained increasing prominence during
implementation as the HPAI threat diminished and the institutional development
perspective broadened and lengthened.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The achievement of PDOs was uneven: those originally identified for the IBTA-II were
only partially achieved, while those subsequently added for the AIPP component were
fully achieved.

The IBTA-II was generally successful in achieving its objectives to improve transparency
and accountability in public financial management, to strengthen the tracking of poverty-
reducing public expenditures and monitoring of their impact and to improve the strategic
priority setting and transparency of public expenditures so as to reduce poverty. The
strengthening of the government's expenditure management capacity is being achieved
only modestly, and significantly slower than originally expected. Improvement of the
business environment has not progressed as expected ­legislative improvements in
business registration have been made, though the privatization of water and gas
distribution have not occurred, though neither has the strengthening of their governance
capacities and subsequently suggested by government.

Component 1 improved transparency and accountability in public financial management
and public procurement processes in line with policy measures supported by SAC-II.
These improvements in turn paved the way to improve the effectiveness of budgetary
expenditures. Analytical work outside the project (CPAR 2008) has suggested that
additional reforms are needed to modernize the implementation of the Public
Procurement Law. Furthermore, transparency of the budget would be further enhanced if
the COA's annual audit of the budget we made available to the general public rather than
just the members of the Parliament.

Component 2 is lagging significantly in implementation. While capacities in the core
functions of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development have
been strengthened by the project, implementation of a system to prioritize the Public
Investment Program and implementation of an automated Treasury system are
significantly behind schedule.


                                             13
While the MTEF is prepared according to the Budget Systems law, its preparation has not
served to introduce fiscal discipline and to maintain public spending at fiscally
sustainable levels. The Azerbaijan Country Economic Memorandum 2009 documented
that public spending is unsustainable at current levels and made specific
recommendations to strengthen the MTEF which have not yet been implemented.

Component 3 improved social expenditures and contributed to improving resource
allocation and the effectiveness of social programs. Substantial progress in the
development of a medium -term targeted social assistance for the vulnerable groups.
Service delivery and efficiency of expenditures in the health and education sectors
remains a challenge, but significant progress has been made with follow-up Bank and
other donor instruments.

Component 4 was aimed to support privatization and private sector development. The
achievements fell short of the original objectives. The Government moved slowly in
making concrete policy decisions in this area. Work on improving the business
environment was much slower than originally expected, with no disbursements taking
place for either the improvement in the business environment or the privatization
component. However, following the original project design, the government secured
technical assistance from the IFC after the restructuring and made significant progress on
the legislative aspects of the business environment. 5 Late in the implementation of the
project, the Government dropped privatization objective in favor of strengthening those
enterprises first.

The project achieved the added AIPP-specific objectives: Azerbaijan is today much better
prepared to respond to outbreaks of HPAI or other zoonoses than in 2006. Although this
cannot be exclusively credited to the implementation of the AIPP, given the parallel and
complementary efforts of other projects and initiatives since 2006, the project contributed
considerably to this achievement. Strengthened national preparedness is evidenced in
improved national capacity for surveillance and monitoring, the capacity to respond to
zoonotic outbreaks with effective containment and control measures, and the capacity to
treat patients. The effective response to the recent A/H1N1outbreaks demonstrates this
much improved preparedness.

The country now has a sound national action plan for responding to pandemic threats. In
the human health sector, a National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan has been
adopted, updated clinical protocols are in place, and the modern hospital isolation ward
established in Baku will be of great value in dealing not only with HPAI patients. In the
veterinary field, the project has not merely strengthened national capacity to respond to
the HPAI threat, but has laid solid groundwork for the overall strengthening of the
veterinary services, a field previously receiving little attention. The AIPP has helped

generate awareness that animal health concerns, and hence effective veterinary services,
are in fact public health concerns requiring commensurate attention by policymakers.
Actions implemented in the SVS are prerequisite stepping stones for further reform to
strengthen the national veterinary services; this includes not only the upgrading of
laboratory capabilities, but most notably the introduction of the NADIS in a number of
pilot raions and the PVS assessment by the OIE that will now be followed by the Gap
Analysis as a preparatory step towards formulating a strategic plan for strengthening the
SVS and veterinary services in general. The public information and awareness effort
generated very high levels of awareness of the HPAI threat among the population.

3.3 Efficiency
The IBTA-II as originally designed required no economic analysis because of the nature
of the institutional capacity-building reforms. For the AIPP component added in 2006,
no economic analysis was undertaken at appraisal, but the analysis undertaken at
completion related AIPP project costs to the economic value of the stream of losses
avoided in human health and the poultry industry from project activities (see Annex 3).
The benefits are expressed as the expected value of the economic loss avoided from one
outbreak occurrence in a period of 15 years (2008-22) for With and Without Project
scenarios.

Human health benefits estimated include the economic value of: (i) hospitalization costs
averted, (ii) income loss avoided from days lost due to illness, and (iii) lifetime income
loss avoided due to fatal HPAI cases. Poultry industry benefits were also estimated in
terms of loss avoidance and include the economic value of: (i) poultry meat production
loss avoided, (ii) egg production loss avoided, and (iii) the avoidance of the loss of the
layers before the end of their productive lives. The number of human and poultry
affected in an outbreak of HPAI and death rate estimates were difficult to estimate;
nevertheless, the estimates and sensitivity analysis provided robust results.

The base case scenario results are highly robust with a 138% ERR, a Benefit-Cost ratio of
9.9 and a NPV of US$48.7 million. Even under more restrictive sensitivity analysis
parameters allowing only 50% of the benefits to be claimed by the AIPP because of the
other AI and AI-related projects in Azerbaijan at the time, the results remain robust with
a 24% ERR, a Benefit-Cost ratio of 1.9 and a NPV of US$3.4 million, confirming the
project's economic value added.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall outcome rating is an average of moderately unsatisfactory for the IBTA II
and satisfactory for the AIPP component. For the project as a whole, the overall outcome
is rated moderately satisfactory.

The IBTA-II overcame five months of effectiveness delays and achieved a part of the
initial outcomes. Progress was satisfactory in certain sub-components (poverty profile,
targeted social assistance, expenditure studies on education and health), moderately
satisfactory in others (procurement law and chamber of accounts), moderately
unsatisfactory in others (PIP, TIMS and business environment), and did not achieve the
expected progress in other components (privatization, labor redeployment) mostly due to


                                              15
the government's change of plans. On the satisfactory components, examples of the
project achievements in social assistance, education and health include (i) analysis on
social assistance that ultimately helped design the Targeted Social Assistance Scheme,
(ii) capacity building on education policy which were ultimately adopted by government
and supported by the Education Sector Development Project (ESDP), and (iii) health
sector analyses and training which have eventually resulted in the preparation of a
Concept for Reforming Health Financing System and Introduction of Mandatory Medical
Insurance in the Republic of Azerbaijan as well as the establishment of a State
Mandatory Medical Insurance Agency under the Cabinet of Ministers was approved by
Presidential Decree in January 2008. In 2008 the Bank undertook an LSMS survey
which showed Azerbaijan's Targeted Social Assistance Scheme was very efficient, on
par with the better manages systems in the world. 6

On the moderately satisfactory components, capacity to implement the procurement law
was increased, as was the capacity of the chamber of accounts to undertake audits, though
the TIMS implementation has lagged beyond the restructuring date of the project.

The objective of involving IBTA-II in the privatization of large-scale enterprises was to
accelerate this process, which had slowed down considerably, and to move ahead more
forcefully according to international best practice by hiring international advisors to build
capacity in MED for preparing large and complex enterprises for privatization.
Following the assistance under IBTA-I, which aimed at bringing the two enterprises in
water and gas distribution to the advanced stages of the pre-privatization process, the
Government initially decided to use IBTA-II resources to complete this process.
However, despite the considerable preliminary and diagnostic work done by the
international advisors and Bank staff, activities under this component were slow and fell
far short of original expectations, with the Government finally deciding in the last stages
of the project not to proceed with such privatization (Presidential Decree was not issued).
The task team, concerned about the slow progress of this component, urged the
authorities to take the necessary actions to change the course of events. However, the
authorities delayed concrete decisions in these areas. In retrospect, the project team
underestimated the constraints and risks involved in a successful privatization of large
enterprises in Azerbaijan. However, it is difficult to see a clear design alternative on the
privatization component for IBTA-II given the work that had already been undertaken
under IBTA-I and in view of the commitments of the Government under SAC-II. One
alternative could have been not to get the Bank involved (or to limit its involvement) in a
highly politically charged activity such as large privatization in Azerbaijan. This
approach was eventually taken by the Bank in some other countries in the Region.

The outcome of the AIPP component is satisfactory. The objectives and design were
appropriate, implementation was satisfactory, the development objective was achieved,
and the economic analysis gave good results. This project com ponent made a significant

respond to outbreaks of zoonoses and other highly infectious diseases.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The Government with the support of the IBTA-II initiated the development of a Medium-
Term Social Assistance Program in order to enhance its targeting capability. The Bank's
LSMS survey (2008) assessed Azerbaijan's Targeted Social Assistance Scheme as very
efficient. This was accompanied by the implementation of an improved new household
budget survey (HBS), supported by the Bank and carried out by the State Statistical
Committee. New data from these surveys allowed analysis of social protection targeting
on a regular basis. This analysis also complemented the information gathered from the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP) local offices to
improve targeting. On the whole, the work for this task entailed three phases. The first
phase was an analysis of the existing social assistance structure and the preparation of a
medium-term strategy. The second and third phases included design and implementation
of pilot programs in one rural and one urban area. However, the MLSPP was not
completely satisfied with the consultant's work in the second and the third phases since
the consultant required more time, and requested extension of contract with a higher rate,
to conduct the pilot programs and to prepare the final report. The reason for this delay
was the late issuance of the Presidential Decree on establishing a medium -term social
assistance program, which left little time for the consultant to complete his work. The
work was useful, however, for preparing a targeted social assistance benefit that was
implemented in July 2006. In the end, the results of the targeting survey were considered
exemplary. This effort is also being supported by the Pension and Social Assistance
Project, which became effective in January 2005. TACIS is also assisting with training
the newly-recruited staff on the methodology and operation of the new targeted social
assistance.

After almost two years of preparation, Azerbaijan introduced a targeted social assistance
(TSA) program in 2006, eligibility for which is based on a means-testing mechanism. At
the beginning, approximately 60,000 families received assistance. By 2008, the number
of beneficiary families increased to about 170,000. The Government, through the
MLSPP, has made monitoring and evaluation an integral part of the TSA program. GOA
intends to use rigorous monitoring and evaluation of the program as a managing-by-
results tool by testing features of the program to modify design and improve effectiveness
over time. To achieve this, the MLSPP, in collaboration with the Bank, implemented a
nationally representative Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) during the first
quarter of 2008. The 2008 LSMS, based on a sample of over 6,600 households, provides
an opportunity to evaluate the TSA. The survey was designed to allow evaluation of
several features of the TSA: (a) coverage (a fraction of the target population--the very
poor--receiving the TSA), (b) targeting performance, (c) the implementation mechanism
and how well it works, and (d) the impact of the TSA on household welfare. The LSMS
oversampled program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries.

The AIPP component's poverty and gender impacts--through loss avoidance (see Annex
3) --are potentially significant, but are only likely to be fully realized in the event of any


                                              17
future HPAI outbreak. Backyard poultry are an important feature of rural livelihood
systems, particularly for the poorer households, and it is primarily women who manage
birds and realize income (be it through sales or home consumption) from their small
backyard flocks. However, the effective public information campaign, which also raised
public awareness of the state's improved readiness to detect and respond to future
outbreaks, already directly benefitted many small poultry owners by providing
reassurance, thereby helping bring the wave of panic-induced poultry slaughter that
occurred in the immediate aftermath of the February-March 2006 avian influenza
outbreaks to an end.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project's institutional development impact is considered substantial. IBTA-II
focused on developing the capacity to implement SAC-II reforms. The main beneficiary
agencies responsible for SAC-II measures had limited capacity for procurement, financial
management, and implementing reform. Through expert advice and training, IBTA-II
helped improve capacity, including computing capacities, of those agencies. It also
improved institutional capacities of a number of implementing institutions by putting into
operation improved systems and procedures on budget formulation and MTEF process
and on poverty monitoring.

IBTA-II contributed to strengthening oversight capacities of the State Procurement
Agency (SPA) and the Chamber of Accounts, including establishing stronger internal
controls and audit practices and standards. It increased the appraisal capacity of MED to
evaluate investment programs. The implementation of a fully functional and automated
Treasury system will serve as an effective instrument for budget execution and cash
management as well as for more comprehensive accounting and fiscal reporting.
Improved operations in the Treasury will also help strengthen the oversight of MOF and
its ability to provide more timely services to line ministries. At the regional level,
institutional development is beginning to show its impact by the progress in the
adaptation of the Treasury system in four pilot raions.

The AIPP component, in both the veterinary and the human health fields, left the
beneficiary institutions significantly strengthened and better prepared to detect, respond
to and contain future outbreaks of zoonoses and other highly infectious diseases. This
was demonstrated when the A/H1N1 pandemic erupted in 2009. Epidemiological
surveillance, disease monitoring, laboratory diagnostics, field response capabilities and
patient treatment facilities have all been upgraded through investments in human
resources, facilities and equipment and through the development and testing of updated
operating protocols and guidelines. The institutional response capacity of the public
sector at large (including police, local administrations, MENR, Ministry of Emergency
Situations, etc.) has been strengthened and effectively tested and demonstrated in a
successful field simulation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The project included support for development of the National Animal Disease
Information System (NADIS): hardware and software to set up the system, and training
and technical assistance to make it fully operational. The SVS has been particularly pro-


                                            18
active, compared to its counterparts in other countries and similar projects, in
implementing this system. They operationalized the system very quickly in the six pilot
raions, scaled it up to a total of 20 raions, and intend to establish the network country-
wide in a very short time frame. This has required commitment of Government resources,
in addition to project funds, and establishment of an epidemiology center with dedicated
staff for the system. The system initially focused on data collection and analysis from the
brucellosis pilot areas of ADCP-II, but is being expanded to the full complement of
reportable animal diseases for the national disease surveillance program and for
international reporting to the OIE and trading partners. There also is interest to increase
the system's capacity to encompass additional disease information modules and animal
identification.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The risk to development outcomes is rated as moderate. The risk to development
outcomes was rated high at the time of appraisal of IBTA-II, but mitigating actions
seem to be in place to offset these risks. However, a risk to development outcomes that
affected all components was the lack of inter-institutional coordination. A constraint
during IBTA-II implementation was coordination among implementing ministries and
agencies -all of which had different capacity support needs. This was an underestimated
risk to realizing the desired development outcomes; nevertheless, despite a slower
implementation pace than expected, overall project outcomes, while uneven, has
provided a platform for sustaining results into the future
The risk to sustaining outcomes of the AIPP component is moderate, mainly because of
the uncertain prospects of adequate recurrent budget support for future operation and
maintenance of the upgraded laboratory and hospital facilities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Bank performance is considered only moderately satisfactory. The project was well
linked to the CAS objectives, and its timing was appropriate, coinciding with the
intensification of the Government's reform programs that emphasized public sector
reform and improving the business environment for private sector development.
Instrument choice was appropriate: linking the project to SAC-II made it possible to
connect institutional strengthening efforts directly to the implementation of related policy
conditionality. A stand-alone TA credit for public sector reform would not have had an
appreciable impact on economy-wide capacity building, and a separate free-standing TA
project for Treasury operations most likely would have led to further delays in
implementing these reforms.

However, project design was complex, wide in scope, and did not sufficiently take into
account capacity weaknesses in implementing agencies. The PAD preparation also
seemed to be rushed. Project design considered risks and mitigation measures, but certain


                                            19
risks, such as delays in large enterprise privatization or implementing recommendations
of the Business Environment study, were underestimated as was the need for effective
coordination across the levels of government. The logical framework was rudimentary,
as neither the PDOs nor the Intermediate Outcome Indicators were tied to any
quantifiable targets, making progress toward their achievement difficult to measure and
impacting dialogue about meeting benchmarks during implementation. Lastly, the
possibility of rising oil revenues and their potential impact on incentives for
comprehensive reform was not considered sufficiently. Diminishing fiscal pressure on
the Government from oil revenues reduced incentives to carry out policy reform and
capacity-building efforts in key ministries and agencies as supported by IBTA -II,
undermining the privatization component and causing protracted disbursement delays.

(b) Quality of Supervision
 Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. Supervision of the original IBTA-II
was regular and frequent based on good working relationships with partner agencies. It
was carried out both from the country office and headquarters, involving specialists from
the education, health, social assistance, and infrastructure sectors. Mission aide-
memoires were informative and well prepared, highlighting implementation problems to
Government. However, the Bank team (both the supervision teams and the management)
was unable to persuade the Government not to pull back on the private sector
development components or to obtain GOA agreement on directing project savings to
other public expenditure and financial management areas, despite which the Bank
remained engaged, rather than cancelling the remaining credit proceeds, in expectation of
eventually meeting the PDOs.

Project restructuring in 2006 responded to an urgent request by GOA and was carried out
rapidly and effectively. The new AI component was designed within the parameters of
the GPAI and on the basis of in-country assessments and specific recommendations by
expert teams fielded by WHO and FAO. It correctly focused on critical priorities, well
dovetailed with activities funded by others and properly geared toward the needs and
implementation capacities of targeted institutions. This aspect of project supervision was
highly satisfactory.

AI component supervision following restructuring was also satisfactory. Day-to-day
supervision took place out of the country office in Baku where the new task team leader
and several technical specialists were based. Continuous implementation support by the
Bank country office was valued by the client. Five formal supervision missions were
fielded between the spring 2007 and spring 2010; they included health and veterinary
specialists as well as procurement and financial management expertise, and the same
technical specialists remained involved throughout. An environmental specialist
participated in the July 2009 mission when weaknesses in EMP implementation became
of some concern. Communications experts visited the project twice to review the public
awareness and information effort. There was good rapport between implementing
agencies' management and staff and IDA's task team. The latter proactively identified
implementation issues and suggested appropriate actions to expedite resolution.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


                                            20
In view of the moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and supervision of the
original IBTA-II, overall Bank performance for the project as a whole is rated moderately
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The Government closely
engaged in project identification and preparation and actively discussed the contents of
each component and their costs. Preparation of IBTA-II took place in parallel with that
of SAC-II and greatly benefited from the attention it received from the various SAC-II
implementing agencies. However, the Government could have more carefully considered
its own commitment to carry out the private sector Component as agreed. Up to the time
of appraisal, the Government made substantial progress in small and medium enterprise
privatization, and the Law and Presidential Decree on the Second Privatization Program
implied GOA's readiness to move ahead with a more comprehensive privatization agenda.
In the end, the privatization of water and gas enterprises proved problematic for the
Government and commitment waned. Ultimately, the dialogue between the Bank and the
Borrower could not be sustained.

The Government was fully committed to the AIPP, demonstrated by the establishment,
by Presidential Decree, of a State Commission for Prevention of Avian Influenza in
February 2006, as well as by its additional counterpart funding of US$0.96 million for AI
project activities. Counterpart funding was adequate and timely throughout the project
life. This commitment was not always sufficient, however, to overcome administrative
inertia, so that delays were encountered in securing approval of key policy documents
such as the Communications Strategy and the final National Action Plan. Still awaiting
government action are the recommended revision of the policy directive and the
associated operating guidelines on compensating poultry owners in the event of
government-mandated culling.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Overall implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The PIU,
guided by the MED, was effectively managed and staffed with well-qualified local
professionals. Having become familiar with Bank procedures during the IBTA-I, it
performed efficiently under IBTA-II. However, it had no authority over implementing
agencies or their budget allocation and spending decisions and was therefore not able to
exert pressure to stimulate necessary action at critical junctures during implementation.
Some implementing agencies did not have adequate capacity to effectively implement
consultants' recommendations or to supervise consultant work effectively (e.g.,
Ministries of Education and Health), compromising quality and performance.

The Ministries of Economic Development, Labor and Education had varying levels of
commitment and effectiveness in implementing IBTA-II activities; nevertheless, results
were gradually achieved. The Labor Ministry achieved substantial results in poverty
targeting and intended social effects; similarly, the Education Ministry achieved
significant outcomes by strengthening its own capacity to implement targeted education
program and introducing a new education management information system. The


                                            21
Economic Development Ministry ultimately did not implement the key privatization
component, despite which the business environment substantially improved over time.

In the Ministry of Finance, there was initial lack of implementation capacity and
commitment, in that the inputs of consultants were not well supervised or absorbed,
causing delays in nearly all activities. Yet as of writing of this ICR, progress is gradually
being made in the implementation of the Treasury system.

AIPP implementation was coordinated by the PMU of the State Agency for Agricultural
Credits (SAAC). SVS was responsible for the veterinary subcomponent, while MOH
implemented the human health subcomponent. The Communication Specialist at the
PMU was responsible for the activities carried out within the Public Awareness and
Communication subcomponent.

SVS effectively implemented its project activities, including development of a sectoral
action plan, field simulation exercise, laboratory upgrading, staff training, biosecurity
training for poultry producers, serological monitoring for HPAI, upgrading the training
facilities at the Veterinary Faculty of the Agricultural University, and establishment of
the National Animal Disease Information System, which is already operating in 20 raions,
considerably more than had been expected. It also initiated, with PVS implementation, a
systematic approach to upgrading its capabilities so as to meet international standards.
The only activity not yet fully completed is the revision of the policy and procedures
concerning the compensation of poultry owners in the event of mandatory poultry culling,
which is, however, a governmental responsibility. SVS performance is rated satisfactory.

MOH formulated a solid National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan, secured
adequate vaccine and drug supplies, strengthened its laboratory capabilities with
additional equipment and supplies and with topical staff training, and set up and operated
an HPAI hotline for the general public. The construction of the hospital isolation ward,
however, took considerably longer than expected due to a lengthy search for appropriate
international technical expertise and of subsequent misunderstandings between the PMU
and the WHO concerning the scope of works that were to be implemented. MOH
performance is rated satisfactory.

The SAAC PMU satisfactorily managed the AIPP component. Strong teamwork and
commitment to high quality standards contributed to the success of AIPP. Financial
management, procurement and M&E activities were effectively carried out. Public
awareness and information campaigns were well targeted, used effective tools to reach its
audiences, had appropriate message content with professional and attractive design, and
were well received.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
A large number of key reforms in public expenditure management (completed), Treasury
system (protracted implementation), social assistance (achieved), and procurement and
accountability mechanisms were implemented under the original IBTA-II components.
However, the quality, sustainability, and commitment to outcomes is in some instances
not clear or less than adequate, as in the case of the preparation and implementation of


                                             22
the MTEF and PIP. Component 4 results were disappointing: state-owned enterprises
(SOE) were not privatized and labor redeployment was compromised and subsequently
dropped. Only the business environment showed improvement based on Doing Business
surveys through 2009. The social assistance objectives were a notable exception and
gained momentum after the decline in oil revenues and the advent of a financial crisis.
Implementation of the AIPP subcomponents was, on the whole, accomplished
successfully.

Faltering GOA commitment to the envisaged enterprise privatization and less than
satisfactory performance in labor redeployment and business environment improvements
detract from an otherwise positive performance record. Overall Borrower performance is
therefore rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
The government commitment and implementation capacity of the TA project should
have been assessed independently of the concomitantly designed adjustment operation.
Recall the IBTA II was designed to help implement SAC II conditionality. It adopted the
Development Objectives of the SAC II and its milestones. But the TA and the
adjustment operations should instead focus on separate milestones with measurable
indicators of efficiency and effectiveness. The components of the IBTA-II did not move
concomitantly with some parts of the adjustment operation, which lagged behind. In
retrospect, the team should have reassessed the commitment on the TA operation when
the PRSC series (SAC II follow up operation) was discontinued.

A TA operation could be an expensive venue for policy dialogue when policy
uncertainty is far more important than lack of capacity in advancing the reforms. The
IBTA-II supervision missions highlighted to the Government the slow progress in the key
reform areas of privatization, business environment, and labor redeployment. The task
team repeatedly discussed these problems with the Government , but without success in
gaining an early decision on how these reforms should proceed while the disbursements
continued at a slow pace. This underlines the importance of more in-depth risk analysis
in project design and during implementation.

Testing projects on a pilot basis is important to their success. Restructuring the
Treasury operation was an important part of the project. This was new to the country and
needed to be tested and modified before extending it throughout Azerbaijan. Similarly,
the education MIS was pilot tested in three raions before its nationwide roll-out. Both
efforts benefited greatly from the experience of the pilot units.

Ambitious multi-sector operations such as the AIPP require sufficient time to
implement. While many specific emergency response activities (e.g., procurement of
protective gear, equipment, consumables) can be carried out quickly, institutional
strengthening and capacity building take time, whether it concerns hardware or software.

Effective coordination of activities with other donors and projects requires time and
can delay implementation. The efforts to dovetail the AIPP support for veterinary



                                           23
laboratory upgrading with the assistance provided under the US-funded DTRA project
were successful and resulted in substantially more efficient use of Credit resources. But
such inter-agency collaboration and coordination entails some cost, as implementation
schedules may need to be harmonized and this may cause slippages from the initial work
plans. Where cross-donor coordination is envisaged, it is therefore prudent to incorporate
flexibility into implementation schedules.

The decision to restructure the project was opportune at that time because it quickly and
effectively assisted the Government with addressing the pressing needs for AI mitigation
and at the same time preserved IDA funding for the country. However, given the
continued use of the same initial project code, this approach has necessitated preparing an
ICR which rather artificially treats two separate projects in one single report.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Enhancing Accountability in Public Financial Management

Key indicators for this component were stated as: (i) building institutional capacity in the
State Procurement Agency to comply with the procurement law; and (ii) building
institutional capacity in the Chamber of Accounts to conduct audits. Both institutions had
very limited or no capacity at the outset. Progress was moderate in achieving these
indicators. IBTA-II succeeded to a large extent to set up the required procedures to
implement the Procurement Law combined with establishing standards and procedures
for audit in line with international practice. SPA started implementation of the Law with
pilot procurement audits and publishing their results, which included plans for remedial
actions. SPA's website currently provides procurement information for potential bidders
and its MIS system is up and running. However, SPA has a long way to go before its
operations are fully reformed. With the support of IBTA-II, the COA's operational
structure, recruitment criteria, and job description were developed. In addition, the review
of legal requirement governing working of the COA was completed and auditing
standards and methods was put in place. The financial plan for the COA (FY2003- FY
2005) has been approved by Parliament and the Chamber has reported annually to
Parliament on its findings. In 2004, the COA undertook analysis of expenditures of 8
ministries and 12 state enterprises for 2002-2003. During the same period, the Chamber
audited 13 ministries and government agencies. Most recently, in 2006-2008, the COA
has been auditing about 40 agencies per year. However, the COA has not yet conducted
the audit of extra-budgetary organizations based on international standards nor does it
make its finding public.

Component 2: Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Capacities

The IBTA-II performance indicators for this component include: (i) preparation of a
medium term expenditure framework, including a public investment program, based on
sector strategy and programs; and, (ii) strengthened Treasury operations including the
needed institutional framework, systems and procedures. Unsatisfactory progress was
achieved on both the first and second indicators given that reform efforts on the PIP
preparation have stalled, and implementation of the Treasure Information Management
System (TIMS) is progressing with several years of delays. The Cabinet approved the
first PIP along with the MTEF in April 2003. Subsequently the three year rolling MTEF
and the PIP was approved and endorsed by Presidential Decree covering the period 2003-
2005. Budgeting in 2006 -2008 showed that principles of sustainability in medium term
budgeting were ignored. Azerbaijan continues to produce four year PIPs on a rolling
annual basis, but they are not made available to the public or the full parliament at the
project level; appraisal methods have not changed significantly since IBTA -II
implementation. However, the increasing spending on public investment suggests that
appraisal capacity needs to increase. In the preparation of its first and subsequent MTEFs
the Government tried to include its poverty reduction programs as highlighted in the




                                            26
SPPRED. In subsequent years, a SPPRED for 2006-2008 7and one for 2009-2016 were
produced. In addition, perhaps more importantly, the Government has prepared a State
Program for Economic and Social Development of the Regions for 2004-2008 and one
for 2009-2013.

To strengthen the MTEF while broadening the comprehensiveness of the budget, the
Budget Law was amended, and approved in May 2003. The new Law made it possible to
integrate all extra-budgetary funds into the state budget (with the exception of the Oil
Fund and the Social Protection Fund). With this integration Parliament now approves t he
overall public expenditure envelope, including the Oil Fund expenditures. However, the
Parliament does not approve the list of investment projects for the budget (either the
domestically funded or the foreign funded projects). Only the overall budget envelope
allocated to the PIP for domestically funded projects is approved. Computerization of the
Treasury and the establishment of the Single Treasury account have resulted in improved
cash management and better control of budget execution through improved monitoring of
cash flow and determining cash limits of budget organizations. The TIMS constitutes the
core of the Treasury information system and would allow the central Treasury and 85
regional offices to perform comprehensive accounting functions, implement the budget,
and generate the needed reports on the status of actual expenditures. In March 2009
Azerbaijan introduced the next phase of modernization of the public expenditure process
with the passage of a Presidential Decree to introduce feasibility studies as part of the
project preparation process and to require the employment of economic analysis for
projects once the project has passed the feasibility stage. While the MTEF is prepared
according to the letter of the Budget Systems law, its preparation has not served to
introduce fiscal discipline and to maintain public spending at fiscally sustainable levels.
The Azerbaijan Country Economic Memorandum 2009 documented that public spending
is unsustainable at current levels and made specific recommendations to strengthen the
MTEF which have not yet been implemented.

Component 3: Reforming Social Expenditures.

Output indicators for this component cover four areas: (i) the institutional capacity in the
Ministries of Health and Education for better analysis and targeting of health and
education spending; (ii) the institutional capacity for poverty monitoring and an update of
poverty profile; (iii) a more efficient medium term social safety net system with a better
targeted social assistance program; and, (iv) benefit from pre-and- post layoff services
and temporary income support for labor affected by reforms. Progress in achieving these
indicators was slower than expected. The expenditure studies on Health and Education
provided a good basis for preparing the 2003 budget taking into account the poverty
priorities as identified in SPPRED. However, the studies did not help improve
appreciably expenditure efficiency or the targeting of the programs in these two sectors.
On poverty profile, improvements were made on the questionnaire and a new HBS was

    With the assistance of the UNDP



                                            27
carried out in 2002, which provided a more realistic picture of poverty in Azerbaijan.
According to the 2002 estimates, the overall poverty stood at 46.7 percent and the
extreme poverty at 8.8 percent in 2002, compared to the 2001 estimates which had put
the overall poverty at 50 percent with extreme poverty at over 17 percent. With regards to
social assistance, the new data from HBS allowed analysis of targeted social assistance
on a regular basis. The Government's program on social assistance is now supported by
the 2004 Pension and Social Assistance Project, which aims at: implementing a national
roll-out of the targeting social assistance benefits based on eligibility assessment;
consolidating various benefits into a single targeted family benefit; and strengthening the
capacity of MLSPP to administer social assistance benefits using computerized MIS. The
development of social assistant strategy has also helped the Government to make
informed decisions on the development of poverty alleviation programs and social policy
measures. A framework Law on Targeted Social Assistance was approved by Parliament
and signed by the President in November 2005. On labor redeployment, the Government
carried out the first national Labor Force Survey in 2003 to monitor employment progress
in the formal and informal sector. However, the Government program for establishing a
comprehensive labor redeployment scheme, which dates back to IBTA -I, also moved
slowly under IBTA-II.

Component 4: Promoting Privatization and Private Sector Development

Key indicators for this component were: (i) implementation of the recommendations of
the FIAS study to improve business environment; (ii) a more transparent and effective
privatization process; and, (iii) preparation of gas and water enterprises for privatization.
Despite the progress made in Doing Business surveys to 2009, no substantial progress
was made towards meeting outcomes and performance indicators for this component
before restructuring; the majority of its subcomponents were not implemented. The
Government succeeded in implementing some recommendations of the FIAS study,
namely those related to improving business registration and other Doing Business-related
indicators. The Government was not successful in privatizing the two Gas and Water
distribution companies, despite the fact that both IBTA-I and IBTA-II provided financial,
technical, and legal advice for this purpose. During implementation of the project the
government changed its strategy for the two state-owned enterprises, and decided to
invest in them and set to improve their corporate governance. The potential benefits that
were anticipated with privatization did not materialize.

Component 5: Project Management

The Credit also supported the project implementation by covering the operating cost of
the Project Implementation Unit. While the MED had an overall responsibility for the
project, the PIU was responsible for its day to day implementation. The PIU did follow
appropriate accounting and internal control procedures, as well as prepared and submitted
to the Bank the required financial and annual audit reports. Nevertheless, in its essential
role as project activity coordinator, the PIU was not able to fully integrate the project
with the diverse set of national policy makers and decision-makers, as most visibly
shown in the lack of outcomes of Component 4.



                                             28
Component 6: Avian Influenza

National Preparedness Planning. A key output of the project was the Action Plan for
Prevention of HPAI (known as a National AI Action Plan), approved by the SCPAI in
April 2010. . It draws together the essential aspects in both the human and animal health
sectors, defines the chain of command for all agencies involved in case of HPAI
outbreaks, specifies the actions to be taken, including the arrangements for culling and
carcass disposal. This national action plan builds upon the two sectoral action plans
prepared previously, the Action Plan for Prevention of Avian Influenza developed by
MOA under emergency conditions in January 2006 and adopted by the SCPAI in March
2006 and the Human Health Sector Avian Influenza Action Plan (which includes new
Infection Control Guidelines) adopted by MOH in January 2008. These sectoral action
plans were developed with technical assistance from the FAO and WHO, respectively.
To subject these action plans to a reality check, to test response procedures and capacity
as well as inter-agency cooperation, and to identify gaps and shortcomings in the overall
readiness for HPAI response a tabletop simulation exercise was carried out in July 2008,
followed by a real-time field simulation exercise in September 2009. Such exercises had
never before been carried out by either SVS or MOH. Both were observed and assessed
by international experts and found to be very successful, and the National Action Plan
was subsequently modified and finalized in view of the lessons learned.

For enhancing public health program planning and coordination, the project also
supported the development of a National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan (NPIPP)
which was approved by the State AI Commission in August 2008. The Plan was
developed per recommendation and with support of the WHO and includes emergency
planning and risk assessment, public health and anti-epidemic measures and outlines also
implementation steps to be taken at different stages of pandemic and actions of all related
government agencies and local authorities.

Capacity Building. The project invested heavily in a variety of training events for
members of different target groups. The 31specific events funded and organized by the
project were part of a carefully coordinated and much larger program of training and
capacity building organized, funded and implemented by several donor-supported
projects. FAO, WHO, USAID, US DTRA and IDA's AIPP together financed and
organized some 120 training courses, seminars and workshops between 2006 and the first
quarter of 2010 on HPAI-related topics in a concerted effort to raise awareness and
increase technical capacity. Particularly noteworthy was the substantial training provided
to large numbers of private village-level veterinarians who are the critical first link for
ensuring rapid response through surveillance at village level. The project also provided
laboratory and computer equipment to the veterinary faculty at the Agricultural
University in Ganja to modernize its teaching laboratory and the training center.

Veterinary Facilities. Project contributions to upgrading the physical facilities of the
veterinary services were also very closely coordinated with those of other donors,
particularly with the US DTRA project that is funding very substantial investments in



                                            29
laboratory works and equipment,8 and were targeted at gaps not filled by others. This
included 18 mobile incinerators to dispose safely of poultry carcasses, a boat for
undertaking HPAI surveys of wild birds, personal protective equipment, biotainers and
transport bags, and urgently needed miscellaneous laboratory equipment, reagents and
consumables. For the veterinary service in Nakhchivan the project rehabilitated the
veterinary laboratory and provided a PCR machine to allow same-day virus detection.

SVS Institutional Capacity. A key output of the project has been the PVS assessment of
the State Veterinary Service conducted in September-October 2008; this is now being
followed under the ADCP-II with a gap analysis that in turn will lead to the development
of a strategic plan for reform of the SVS. A second major output has been the
development and successful introduction of an interactive, computer and internet based
National Animal Disease Information System (NADIS) that is now already being used in
20 raions (the project target was six) and will be expanded country-wide in 2010 under
the ADCP-II.

Compensation Policy. An appropriate policy on compensating poultry owners for bird
losses due to HPAI or, more importantly, due to government mandated culling is an
essential tool for early detection of HPAI and for public acceptance of possibly drastic
control measures. The project has, with international TA, provided specific guidance and
recommendations on modifying the existing policy and operating guidelines that were
adopted by the Government in April 2007. These will be taken into account during a
forthcoming review of the country's veterinary legislation.

Human Health Response Capacity. Much support in the human health sector was and
continues to be provided through IDA's Health Sector Reform Project,9 the DTRA
project and the USAID Primary Health Care Strengthening Project. As in the veterinary
field, the AIPP therefore focused on evident gaps not covered by others. In addition to a
number of training events (see Table 1), this included the establishment of an AI hotline
staffed around the clock, the rehabilitation of two raion-level virology laboratories, and
the construction and equipment of a modern isolation ward with eight negative-pressure
rooms at the national reference hospital for HPAI, the Scientific Research Institute for
Lung Disease.

Public Awareness and Communication. A well-targeted Communication Strategy and
Action Plan was prepared under the project and endorsed by the SCPAI in 2008.
Training materials on Communication techniques and risk communication were
prepared and several training events conducted for different groups of clients. Four
animated TV clips targeted at different target groups were produced by the project and

    The DTRA Biological Threat Reduction Project funded interim renovations and an upgrading of
    equipment in the RVL virology unit to facilitate its diagnostic and training activities, but DTRA is also
    funding the construction of a new, combined animal and human health Central Reference Laboratory.

    The project provided IT equipment, personal protective equipment, mobile disinfection equipment,
    surveillance equipment and 40 vehicles for mobile epidemiological surveillance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      Several donor-supported projects were initiated or modified in Azerbaijan as a
result of confirmed H5N1 outbreaks between 2 February and 18 March 2006. 10 Besides
the IDA-assisted Avian Influenza Preparedness Project (AIPP), the restructured IBTA -II,
this included USAID's STOP-AI project (2007-2008), the AI.com communications
project, interventions made by the WHO, a Japanese Grant (US$500,000) and
community-level interventions by UNICEF. Several regional FAO projects (funded by
USA and Canada) contributed to eradication and control support. Human health projects
containing HPAI-focused activities included the IDA-assisted Health Sector Reform
Program, the USAID Primary Health Care Strengthening Project, and interventions by
the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). These projects mainly focused on
laboratory renovation and rehabilitation, clarifying operational procedures,
training/capacity building, and communication & awareness programs concerning both
human health and poultry management. The major HPAI project, however, was the AIPP.
While it built on many of the achievements from other projects, the AIPP was
instrumental in consolidating and strengthening the country's preparedness to contain
future HPAI outbreaks. This annex outlines and identifies the benefits and costs of the
AIPP and includes an economic analysis that relates the AIPP costs to the benefits (in
terms of economic value loss avoidance) identified for project activities targeted at
human health and at poultry issues. An economic analysis of the AIPP was not
undertaken during the restructuring of the project.

A. Project Costs
2.      Project costs, as of the end of December 2009, were US$5,518,920 from IDA and
US$944,393 from GOA, giving a total of US$6,463,313. Disbursement from the IDA
Credit was close to 99% at this time. For the analysis, costs for the four project years
(2006 to 2009) are in terms of constant 2009 US$; the Azerbaijan Consumer Price Index
(CPI) was used to convert 2006-2008 project costs into constant 2009 prices. GOA
incremental recurrent costs beyond 2009 were set at US$500,000 per year for incremental
salaries, materials, O&M costs (see Table 2). The exchange rate used was US$0.8 =
AZN 1.00.11

       Affected were wild birds, domestic poultry and dogs. Eight human cases were diagnosed, with five
       known deaths.

       Conversion factors on project costs were not used in this analysis. All costs are net of taxes and duties.

B. Project Benefits

Human Health Project Benefits

3.      The project impact on human health is to decreases the percentage of the human
population infected by HPAI, thereby reducing the number of hospitalizations and the
number of deaths attributed to HPAI. Benefits are thus expressed in terms of loss
avoidance and include the economic value of: (i) hospitalization costs averted (AZN 281
for an average 7-day stay per hospitalized person), (ii) avoidance of income loss from
days lost due to illness (assumes 25% of the affected population would lose 2 days
income, plus 40 days income loss for each hospitalized survivor at a daily wage of AZN
12.5/day (US$15.60/day)), and (iii) income loss avoidance from fatal HPAI cases
(average remaining lifetime earnings expressed as the present value of annual take-home
income of AZN 275/month over 15 years discounted at 12%).12

4.      The affected human population (Gross Attack Rate) for an outbreak of HPAI was
estimated at 3% of the population, with 10% of the affected population being hospitalized
and a 3% death rate for those affected (the Without Project scenario).13 The With-
Project scenario estimates were that 2% of the population would be affected by HPAI,
with 10% of those affected requiring hospitalization and a 1.5% death rate among those
affected. 14 These parameters are difficult to estimate, and it is difficult to get
practitioners to provide estimates because they have no good statistical data and
information to base their estimates on and there is a divergence of opinions within the
medical profession regarding these numbers. Historic patterns of the severity and
incidence of influenza outbreaks are also changing with the change in world-wide travel
patterns, making the estimation of such parameters even more difficult.

5.      For the economic analysis, the economic value of human health losses avoided is
calculated with the assumption that an HPAI outbreak would occur in any one of the 15
years from 2008 to 2022, using the above Gross Attack Rate and other parameters. This
represents the base analysis calculation. The Gross Attack Rates and other parameters
estimated above may be considered as representative of a severe HPAI outbreak, and the
numbers are in fact much higher than those recorded during the actual outbreak
experienced in 2006. In the analysis, the population is estimated to grow at 1% per
annum over the 2010-2022 period.

6.      One major unquantifiable project benefit needs mentioning. The programs put in
place in response to the HPAI outbreaks by GOA and donor agencies, especially the
communications and awareness programs as well as the training and capacity building,
have strengthened the country's preparedness to respond not only to future outbreaks of


12
     Hospitalization costs from the Sanitary-Epidemiological Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health;
     daily wages and annual take-home income from State Statistical Committee.
13
     Other similar World Bank projects used Gross Attack Rates as high as 30%.
14
     Estimates from the Sanitary-Epidemiological Surveillance Department, Ministry of Health, based on
     WHO information and experience of the Azerbaijan and other regional outbreaks.


                                                   33
HPAI outbreaks, but also of other zoonoses and highly infectious diseases. This was
demonstrated during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 to which the general population as well
as the medical specialists reacted far more calmly than to the HPAI outbreak three years
earlier because the health system had the experience, information and means to cope with
the situation.

Livestock Sector (Poultry) Project Benefits

7.      There were about 22 million poultry in Azerbaijan in 2009 -- mostly chickens,
with small numbers of ducks, geese and turkeys. Thirty-five percent of poultry are in
large enterprise, the remaining 65% in medium and small farms and household backyards.
The large enterprises produce both meat and eggs. The poultry sector essentially operates
in a free market with no quotas, subsidies or price restrictions on products or inputs.
About 60% of the domestic poultry meat marketed is from enterprises and 40% from
small farms; for eggs the split is about 50-50. About 25% of poultry meat and 1.5% of
egg consumption is from imports; some eggs are also exported.

8.      The project's impact on the poultry industry is to decrease the number of poultry
infected by HPAI and, thus, the number of poultry deaths attributed to HPAI. In the
economic analysis the benefits therefore are losses avoided and include: (i) the economic
value of poultry meat production loss avoided (average value of live chicken farmgate
price of AZN 4.2 x number of broiler deaths averted, assuming that 50% of chicken
deaths would be broilers), and (ii) the economic value of egg production loss avoidance
plus the value of the layer birds at the end of their productive life (an average 154
eggs/bird/year x farmgate egg price of AZN 0.16/egg x layer deaths avoided, assuming
that 50% of deaths are layer hens, plus the meat value of a layer hen at the end of her
productive life set at 50% the value of a broiler x the number of layer deaths avoided,
assuming that 50% of chicken deaths are layers). The data and information are from the
State Statistical Committee and from the State Veterinary Service.

9.      The avoidance of the cost of culling and replacement programs is also included as
a benefit. At the time of the 2006 outbreak, the government did not have an eradication
or poultry replacement program in place, 15 but during the 2009 Swine Fever outbreak it
did provide compensation at market value for losses. For the present analysis, the market
price of a broiler (AZN 4.2) was used for compensation, and 50% of the broiler price was
added for the culling and associated costs.

10.    Other possible benefits are (i) an avoidance of a decrease in GDP growth, (ii) the
avoidance of an increase in foreign exchange requirements for imports of poultry m eat

     A side effect of the 2006 HPAI outbreak was that farmers slaughtered healthy birds during the crisis
     and processed and froze them for later use. This was done due to panic and misinformation and to
     avoid the possible loss of poultry due to either HPAI itself or to a Government-mandated culling
     program in the absence of a compensation program. This is also a cost that can be significantly
     reduced through the public awareness program of the project. However, no data are available to make
     an assessment.


                                                   34
and eggs (and possibly other substitute food products) during the crisis period, and (iii)
the avoidance of economic losses to consumers because of price increases (cross -price
elasticity effects) for other livestock products. These were not analyzed because of data
and time limit constraints.16 However, the effects on GDP and foreign exchange
requirements are likely to be small. Agriculture and forestry contribute 5.7% to GDP
(2008), and the poultry sector accounts for only a small part of agriculture and forestry
GDP (the value of cattle alone is ten times the value of poultry).

11.     Data from the SSC indicate that imports of eggs in 2006, the year of the HPAI
outbreak, increased 21% over 2005 and then declined again in 2007 to normal import
levels. However, 2006 chicken meat imports decreased by 45% relative to 2005, but
2006 bovine meat imports rose 42% over 2005 imports and then fell again to normal
import levels in 2007.17 While poultry prices decreased and other animal product prices
increased during the outbreak period, this situation was over after about four to six
months. There thus seems to be a clear effect of the HPAI outbreak on prices of animal
products. However, no attempt was made to identify the specific gainers and losers and
the amounts gained and lost, because the amounts are not likely to be very large.

12.     For the analysis, the infection rate during an outbreak (Gross Attack Rate) of
HPAI was estimated at 3% of the poultry population, 18 with 100% mortality of the birds
infected (the Without-Project scenario). These estimates are based on the fact that
during the 2006 outbreak about 600,000 birds (2.7% of about 22.3 million) either died
from HPAI or were culled. Although not every bird culled was infected by HPAI, the
recommended practice is to slaughter all birds in a flock or village where an outbreak is
confirmed. For purposes of analysis, thus, all birds culled are deemed to have been
infected and killed as a result of the HPAI outbreak.

13.     The With-Project scenario estimates were that only 2% of the poultry
population would be infected and would die from HPAI or be destroyed by government
order. The mortality rate remains 100% for the infected birds: the project can reduce the
number of poultry deemed to be infected because of the improved diagnostic and
detection capacity and the ability to contain outbreaks, but it does not decrease the
mortality rate once a flock is infected.19 As in the human health sector, these parameters
are difficult to establish because practitioners rarely have solid statistical data and
information upon which to rely and there is a divergence of opinions within the
veterinary profession.



16
     The economic loss to tourism has not been included in the analysis, due to the scarcity of available
     information and data for the analysis. However, the effects in terms of economic losses are not likely
     to be very high.
17
     The SSC data indicate that poultry numbers increased from 18.2 million in 2005 to 19.0 million in
     2006, but then decreased slightly to 18.8 million in 2007.
18
     Gross Attack Rates may differ considerably among countries because of geographical and
     environmental conditions and the type of H5N1 strain.
19
     The estimates of the percentage of birds infected are from the specialists of the State Veterinary
     Service, Ministry of Agriculture, and based on their experience in Azerbaijan and in the region.


                                                     35
14.     For the analysis, the economic value of poultry losses avoided was calculated
with the assumption that an HPAI outbreak would occur in any one of the 15 years from
2008 to 2022, using the above Gross Attack Rate and other parameters. This represents
the base analysis calculation. The Gross Attack Rates and other parameters estimated
above may be considered as likely during a severe outbreak of HPAI in the poultry
industry in Azerbaijan, and they correspond to the actual outbreak experienced in 2006.
In the analysis, poultry production is assumed to grow at a 2% annual rate from 2009
onwards.

C. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis

15.     The analysis relates AIPP costs (Table 2) to the benefits from the economic value
stream of losses avoided in human health and in the poultry industry from project
activities -- expressed as the expected value of the economic loss avoided from one
outbreak in a 15-year period (2008-2022). Project benefits are assumed to remain
realizable over the 15-year period, attributable to the project expenditures on laboratories,
equipment and awareness programs and the increase in human capital from the projects
training activities. There were project costs in 2006 to 2009, but benefits are not assumed
to become realizable until mid-2008. At that point they are assumed to be only 50% and
in 2009 still only 75% of full effectiveness, with 100% effectiveness of project benefits
attained only by the end of the project in 2010.

16.     The market prices used for poultry and poultry products are considered to be
economic prices, because the markets, for the most part, operate freely without
production quotas and subsidies for poultry or poultry inputs. Wages and other market
prices used in the analysis are also assumed to be economic prices.

17.     Table 3 first presents the results of the economic analysis based on the above base
case assumptions and parameters for the combination of both human health and poultry
sector losses avoided. The results are highly robust, with a 138% ERR, a Benefit -Cost
Ratio of 9.9 and a NPV of US$48.7 million. The results are dominated by the human
health benefits: the economic value of human health loss avoidance is about 24 times that
of the economic value of the loss avoidance in the poultry sector. Taking this into
consideration, a sensitivity analysis concerning the poultry sector was not undertaken,
because even large changes in all poultry parameters will have an insignificant effect on
the overall rate of return.

18.      The two parameters that drive the economic value of the human health benefits
are (i) the percentage of the human population affected by HPAI, and (ii) the expected
number of deaths as a percentage of total human population. Since the base case returns
are so robust, changes are made to the two parameters that decrease the economic value
stream of losses avoided in human health. As shown in Table 3, even with parameters
that indicate a very low expected mortality rate from HPAI infection and only a very
small reduction in the percentage of the humans infected with HPAI attributable to
project activities, the returns remain robust. For example, Scenario 4 with a very low rate




                                             36
of infection avoidance and a low mortality rate suggests an ERR of 54%, a B/C ratio of
3.8 and a NPV of US$13.8 million.

/1 WOP = Without Project; WP = With Project.
/2 Scenarios 5 and 6 calculate the returns allowing the AIPP to claim only 50% of the total economic value
stream of losses avoided in human health and in the poultry industry under the Base Case scenario and
under Scenario 4.

19.     It may be argued that the AIPP cannot claim the total economic value stream of
losses avoided in human health and in the poultry industry, because it is only one of
several projects that sought to address the HPAI threat in Azerbaijan since the 2006
outbreak. However, although the AIPP built on the achievements from other projects, it
was instrumental in consolidating and strengthening the country's preparedness to detect
and contain future HPAI outbreaks. It can be argued, in fact, that without the AIPP many
of the other projects' investments might not have been used to as great an effect and
should thus be treated as sunk costs.

20.     Alternatively, one may decide to attribute to the AIPP only a portion of the total
benefits. The returns presented in Scenarios 1 to 4 attribute 100% of the total economic
value stream of losses avoided in human health and in the poultry industry to the AIPP.
Scenarios 5 and 6 calculate the returns when attributing to the AIPP only 50% of the total
economic value stream of losses avoided in human health and in the poultry industry
under the base case scenario (Scenario 5) and under Scenario 4 (Scenario 6), respectively.
The returns are still highly robust in Scenario 6 with an ERR of 24%, a B/C ratio of 1.9
and a NPV of US$3.4 million.20




20
     Separate rates of returns for human health benefits and for benefits to the poultry industry are not
     presented, partly due to the difficulty of separating out the component project costs for human health
     and poultry activities, but largely because AIPP activities are an integrated package which would not
     be undertaken separately.




                                                     37
D. Concluding Comments

21.     While the non-robustness of the Gross Attack Rates and mortality rate estimates
for both humans and poultry may make the economic analysis less convincing than
desired, there is no question as to the overall benefits from HPAI projects in terms of the
decrease in human suffering and deaths which alone can be said to justify such projects.
The economic returns to the AIPP are highly robust, even under sensitivity analysis
parameters that severely restrict the benefits, and confirm that from an economic point of
view the project was worth undertaking.

   1. Letter from the Ministry of Economic Development, dated August 02, 2010
      addressed to the World Bank Country Office in Baku:

The Ministry of Economic Development has reviewed the letter concerning the draft ICR
on IBTA-II and AIPP projects. Considering the fact that the mentioned projects have
been implemented successfully, the Ministry of Economic Development does not have
additional suggestions on the given issue.

   2. Letter from the Ministry of Agriculture, dated August 19, 2010 addressed to the
      Country Manager in Baku:

This report on the Avian Influenza part of the project was prepared by the Ministry of
Agriculture.

1. The background and the scope of the Avian Influenza Preparedness Project

In February 2006 Azerbaijan experienced the first wave of the highly pathogenic avian
influenza (H5N1) in both poultry and humans with a number of fatal cases among the
population. To respond immediately to the Avian Influenza (AI) pandemic threat, the
Government of Azerbaijan (GoA) has taken a series of actions to strengthen the
infrastructures of health and veterinary services and launch public information campaigns
to raise awareness among the population in the country.

To provide emergency assistance to the country, the World Bank has restructured the
Second Institutional Building Technical Assistance Project (IBTA-II) upon the request of
the Government of Azerbaijan. The project savings were utilized for the Avian Influenza
Preparedness Project (AIPP) officially launched in June 2006.

The overall objective of the project was to: (i) reduce the threat posed to humans by HPAI
infection and other zooneses in domestic poultry; and (ii) prepare for control and response
to an influenza pandemic and other infectious diseases. AIPP was expected to be
completed in two years. However, the project was extended twice, taking into account that
some of the activities could not be completed and the project's financial proceeds were not
fully disbursed. As a result, the Project was successfully finalized on March 30, 2010.

The most important key factors of successful implementation of the AIPP were: i ) the full
commitment and strong interest of the Government and of all implementing agencies ii)
the flexibility of the project to the changing circumstances: and iii) coordination and
cooperation with other donors involved in the same areas of activities.

2. Achievements and outcomes of the Project / Sustainability of the Project

2.1. Project Achievements




                                           44
The Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of the Government of Azerbaijan rates the project
effectiveness as satisfactory. The AIPP has achieved its development objectives. The
country preparedness to any outbreak of HPAI and other epizootic diseases and rapid
detection, early response and control capabilities are considerably improved and
strengthened. Achievement of this goal significantly reduces the threat of human
epidemic in Azerbaijan and helps safeguard the livelihoods of the rural and pre-urban
population.

The successful implementation of the project resulted in the following Key Long-term
Outcomes:
 Enhanced AIPP prevention and preparedness capability;
 Strengthened veterinary services, disease surveillance, diagnostic capacity and
   applied research for AIPP and other zoonoses;
 Improved National Action Plan for Prevention of HPAI;
 Development of compensation mechanisms; Establishment of the National Animal
   Disease Informational system (NADIS)
 Improved bio-security in commercial and small-holder poultry system following the
   successful implementation of awareness campaigns and knowledge transfer activities
 Enhanced veterinary education capacities through the support of Veterinary Faculty
   of Ganja Agricultural University (development of the Strategic Plan for the Faculty
   and upgrading of laboratory training facilities);
 Enhanced public health program planning and coordination;
 Strengthened national public health surveillance system;
 Strengthened health care system's response capacity (establishment of a hotline
   available to the general public; establishment of isolation units at reference hospitals)
 Explicit Communication Strategy developed and endorsed by the State AI
   Commission;
 Raised public awareness of target audiences through effective communication tools;
   and
 Enhanced knowledge and skills of the stakeholders through implementation of
   training courses, seminars, workshops and other events for veterinary staff, health
   workers, and spokespersons from priority sectors.

It is important to stress that the specified outcomes and the overall objectives were
achieved in close collaboration with all AI-related projects of different donors acting in
Azerbaijan and planning of activities with consideration of all initiatives of the
Government. This approach has shown very good results as it has allowed the avoidance
of overlaps and repetitions, to coordinate all the activities in order to achieve their highest
effectiveness and to cover all the important issues. Very high impact was gained from the
numerous coordinated training programs, implemented in cooperation with other partners.




                                             45
It should be pointed that the project had played a significant role in the development of
the sustainable and up-to-date National Action Plan for Prevention of HPAI. Although
the process of development of the Plan's final version and its official approval was quite
long, it was reasonable as the viability and sustainability of the Action Plan was
definitely ensured through its practical application in very successful field simulation
exercises with the involvement of all concerned agencies and stakeholders.

The main activities of the Project were directed on enhancing HPAI preparedness and
prevention capability and strengthening HPAI surveillance, diagnostic and outbreak
containment capacity in the veterinary sector. As a result, the project has contributed
considerably to the overall strengthening of veterinary services. The project's input of
great importance is the establishment of a computer-based National Animal Disease
Information System (NADIS), which allows the effective surveillance for the control of
diseases throughout the country. In the human health sector the modern hospital isolation
ward established in the Lung Diseases Institute within the framework of the project is
unique in Azerbaijan. This outcome of the Project is highly appreciated as it is obviously
indispensable in dealing not only with patients infected by HPAI, but also with other
dangerous infectious diseases.

The Project's efforts were also directed on supporting of informational campaigns for key
target groups in order to reduce the risk of the threat of avian influenza by influencing
population behavior in such a way that they are able to protect themselves and their
communities. It focused on raising awareness in the population on basic HPAI prevention
practices, bio-safety and safe consumption of poultry products. In this regard, the
Communication Strategy and Action Plan for preparation of AI and Possible Human
Pandemic was prepared under the Project. The Comparative Analysis of Knowledge,
Attitude and Behavior (KAB) surveys carried out before and after the project
communication campaign has shown the positive effectiveness of the project's efforts and
approach in raising population awareness. The most effectiveness in this regard have
shown TV spots, produced and broadcasted on TV channels by the AIPP.

2.2 Sustainability of the Project

A number of factors suggest sustainability of outcomes:

Policy Sustainability: GoA at all levels have: (a) recognized the importance of HPAI
threat containment ; (b) important policy documents, as Integrated Action Plan for
liquidation of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and Communication Strategy in place;
and (c) strengthened and coordinated inter-agencies' cooperation in response to HPAI
outbreak, proved by field simulation exercises. With policies, rules, regulations and a
responsibility system put into place, the work of emergency response to HPAI outbreaks
is guided by the rule of law.

Human Resource Sustainability: Training activities have improved the capacity of the
veterinary and medical staff at all levels in prevention, control and response of HPAI
outbreak and other animal and public health emergencies.



                                            46
Sustainability of Program Achievements: The Government at all levels has
comprehensive and detailed emergency response plan designed under the project. The
surveillance, outbreak investigation and response capacity of veterinary and human
health sectors was increased. The project has established a solid base for the overall
strengthening of the national veterinary service.

3. Bank and Borrower Performance
3.1 Bank Performance

The Bank's performance during the design phase and the quality of supervision are rated
by the Borrower as satisfactory. Although the Bank had very limited time for the project
design due to the urgent request of the Government of Azerbaijan, the project's
objectives, approach, and design were strategically relevant and technically sound. The
project correctly addressed all critical needs of the country, not covered by the
Government and other donors. As a result, the project successfully achieved its objectives.

The Bank's supervision has also proven to be flexible in deciding alternative solutions,
and in responding to emerging needs. Bank supervision was regular, well organized, and
participatory. Implementation bottlenecks were identified and successfully addressed.
Supervision missions were staffed with well qualified and appropriate professionals able
to participate and contribute to the strategic discussions on policy and regulatory
framework options and the way forward to achieve the program outcomes. Supervision
findings were expressed with candor and on a timely basis.

3.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government performance

The Government of Azerbaijan (GoA) demonstrated its full commitment and political
will in its response to HPAI. Strong signals from GoA leadership on the critical strategic
importance of the containment of avian influenza threat to Azerbaijan greatly facilitated
all the concerned agencies to initiate immediate action. It shared information on HPAI
internationally, and sought to open up to global experiences by requesting international
assistance with technical and policy aspects of the HPAI epidemic response.

   (b) Implementing Agencies Performance

The Project Management Unit (PMU) established within the State Agency for
Agricultural Credits under the Ministry of Agriculture (SAAC) was responsible for the
day-to-day management and coordination of project implementation. The main
implementing agencies were the State Veterinary Service (SVS) at the Ministry of
Agriculture for the veterinary component and the Ministry of Health (MoH) for the
human health component.
The Project was undertaken with dedication and enthusiasm and with full appreciation of
the urgency with which Azerbaijan had to respond to the HPAI crisis and develop the
capacity to respond to highly infectious zoonotic disease epidemics. The PMU was


                                            47
staffed with individuals who had been involved in the sector and Bank projects for many
years and thus embodied important institutional and sectoral knowledge. They were also
able and willing to draw on technical expertise and advice from the technical assistance,
national expert panels and colleges from other AI related projects. The key outcomes
agreed for the program were achieved.

4. Lessons Learned

   i) Strong ownership and commitment from the highest levels of Government is
        critical to project success - in this case it created clear and unambiguous signals in
        the system at all levels to: (a) initiate evidence-based action to the crisis; (b)
        create space for policy discussions and debate as a basis for policy development
        and action; (c) enhance staff capacities (at all levels) to respond to the emergency;
        (d) improve the level of transparency and openness and involve the general public
        in the epidemic response; and (e) mobilize resources to support the national
        response.
   ii) The Project's flexibility is critical (even with appropriate program objectives and a
        clear program structure) to ensure enough flexibility is built in to enable
        adjustments to be made as circumstances change.
   iii) The joint donor activities and cooperation resulted in improved coordination
        which assisted in ensuring good outcomes.
   iv) Designed appropriately, the Project provided a very good platform for sound
        dialogue between international technical assistance, national expert panels and
        local institutions which also enhances local capacity and ownership of outcomes.
   v) International experience provided by experts (e.g. from FAO under the program)
        and from the World Bank (in preparation and during project supervision) are
        critical to knowledge development and dissemination of international practices.

   5. Letter from State Procurement Agency, dated August 17, 2010 addressed to the
      Country Manager in Baku:

Your letter dated 19 August, 2010 was reviewed in the State Procurement Agency. The
letter requests relevant agencies to review the documents and comment on draft ICR for
IBTA-II and AIPP projects. As stated, the ICR is documenting the achievements of
original IBTA-II and the restructured AIPP projects. State Procurement Agency's
participation in the project is limited to IBTA-II only.

During the implementation of the project State Procurement Agency and the World
Bank's cooperation was very effective and productive. A more detailed description of
joint work in the report could have given a deeper and more precise impression about the
performance on implementation under the project.
