on the successful\n            approach of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project.\n            Objectives of the five-year Pilot Program will be: 1) to\n            create employment and stimulate private-sector activity in\n            urban areas; 2) to repair basic urban infrastructure; 3) to\n            promote microenterprises; and 4) to assist local governments\n            obtain the skills they need for promoting economic\n            development in the long run. The project will test\n            approaches to the program's implementation during its\n            first two years. Pilot project components are: 1) establish\n            the necessary implementation framework for the proposed\n            program by expanding the existing Rural Development Fund\n            into an Albanian Development Fund; 2) urban works. Organize\n            approximately 30 public works, which will rehabilitate small\n            infrastructure, create needed market facilities, or address\n            environmental problems; 3) small-scale credit and\n            microenterprise support; and 4) studies and training to\n            evaluate project impact and help local governments to\n            acquire the skills needed for promoting long-term local development."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
