The\n            performance of the Bank was highly satisfactory, having\n            played a proactive role in project design, by securing grant\n            financing for the pre-pilot phase, and actively guiding its\n            activities. Similarly, the performance of the borrower was\n            satisfactory, who actively implemented work-related, pilot\n            urban subprojects during preparation, and, initiated the\n            urban micro-credit. Regardless of success, the key lessons\n            suggest that: 1) while implementation of the Albanian\n            Development Fund (ADF) is commendable, the Board of\n            Directors of a social investment fund, should include\n            technical specialists, and stakeholders, for, ADF Board of\n            Trustees was comprised entirely of Government officials,\n            rendering the fund vulnerable to political pressures; 2)\n            initially, the project area for urban works, was limited to\n            few municipalities, which were non-responsive to ADF's\n            requests for co-financing, or subproject maintenance. The\n            situation improved as the project area expanded, which due\n            to the competitiveness among a larger number of\n            municipalities, quality and project implementation largely\n            improved. 3) Early technical assistance should have been\n            provided to establish sound financial management, and\n            transparent practices, to ADF's urban credit\n            department, and avoid the current Besa Foundation, from\n            handling the financial procedures."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
