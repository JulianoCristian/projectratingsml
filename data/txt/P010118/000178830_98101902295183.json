The Tarbela Reservoir will have a gross\n            storage capacity of about 11.1 million acre feet (MAF) of\n            water available for irrigation during the winter season and\n            for power generation (2,000 MW when all 12 units are\n            installed). There is a risk that the dam will experience\n            further technical problems.
