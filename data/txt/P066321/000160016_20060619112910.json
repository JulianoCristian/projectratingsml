In 2002, the Government of Mexico\n            designed and initiated an ambitious sector reform agenda\n            that was subsequently adopted by all States. The\n            reform's key objective is to provide social protection\n            in health for the non-formally employed. With the launch of\n            the reform agenda, the original Project objectives became\n            too narrow or irrelevant and Project implementation\n            experienced substantial delays. The proposed changes align\n            the Project with the sector reform agenda and include\n            comprehensive changes to the Project's Development\n            Objectives, components, activities and outputs. The proposed\n            restructuring also includes changes to the Project's\n            fiduciary arrangements. These changes would permit the\n            Government to transfer funds to States that would execute\n            Project activities under unified procurement norms (SWAp\n            arrangements). Transfers would be monitored under a separate\n            disbursement category. As the majority of project activities\n            would be executed under the SWAP arrangements, the\n            restructuring entails a reallocation of approximately $60\n            million to the disbursement category of transfers. The\n            reallocation of undisbursed loan amounts across disbursement\n            categories with varying Bank financing shares would result\n            in a reduction of Government counterpart fund requirements\n            and the Project size of approximately $33 million or 7\n            percent of the original Project size."}, "docdt": "2006-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
