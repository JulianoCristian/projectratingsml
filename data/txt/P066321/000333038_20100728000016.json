STAFF GRANT PROGRAM - YUKI MURAKAMI", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7061", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Basic Health Care\n            Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: follow-up operations, even if\n            scaling up Bank assistance to what had been highly\n            successful predecessor projects, are not guaranteed to\n            perform well, especially if realities and more importantly,\n            the government's priorities or programs change\n            implementation modalities. The project followed on the\n            earlier PAC (Second Basic Health Care Project - Programa de\n            Ampliacion de Cobertura) that had been rated highly\n            satisfactory for outcome, yet the Government's health\n            reform resulted in a major redirection in its sectoral\n            priorities. The pressure to move towards loan approval,\n            especially in the immediate aftermath of a change in\n            Government administration, may lead to supporting a project\n            that no longer responds to the new administration's\n            priorities. Financing large operations in federal states\n            pose unique challenges, especially given the different\n            institutional capacities and social realities of the various\n            federal entities. Targets for activities addressing\n            institutional capacity strengthening, for example, should be\n            conservative to take into account the challenges of working\n            with various levels of government with a wide range of\n            capabilities. In highly decentralized systems, successful\n            implementation of comprehensive health sector reforms hinges\n            on the effective use of incentive and support systems and,\n            yet, tends to require ample time (often up to two decades).\n            Projects should also have in place agreed, reliable and\n            efficient information systems that support the\n            project's monitoring and evaluation, from the start of\n            implementation. The adequacy of these systems should be\n            reviewed periodically by the Bank in the course of routine supervision."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
