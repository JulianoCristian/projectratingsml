The objective of this first phase program\n            is to provide the basis for ratification and implementation\n            of the International Convention for the Prevention of\n            Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) by the Developing\n            Countries of the Wider Caribbean Region (DCWCR). The project\n            will finance consultant services and their logistical\n            support to: 1) assess existing legislation and regulations\n            of the DCWCR; 2) identify legal remedies available under\n            international agreements to comply with regulations; 3)\n            assess existing waste management systems in the DCWCR; 4)\n            formulate regional engineering criteria for waste reception\n            facilities at the ports; 5) coordinate discussion with\n            shipping and cruise lines on reducing waste; 6) develop\n            integrated waste management alternatives; 7) develop\n            strategies for the integration of collection, treatment and\n            disposal of ship-generated waste; 8) assist ports in\n            defining the appropriate tariffs for receiving wastes; 9)\n            develop proposals to ensure that DCWCR achieves full cost\n            recovery of the collection; 10) develop strategies for\n            public awareness programs; 11) brief potential donors,\n            financing institutions, and nongovernmental organizations on\n            the status of MARPOL 73/78; and 12) based on the success of\n            the project, develop a strategy for expanding benefits to\n            other areas."}, "docdt": "1994-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
