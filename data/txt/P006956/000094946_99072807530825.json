The project, judged as\n            satisfactory with a likely sustainability, learned the\n            following lessons: a) there was an underestimation of time\n            required to reach consensus among the 22 involved countries;\n            b) better definition of respective responsibilities for\n            supervision and procurement were needed prior to signing; c)\n            more intensive involvement of the Bank's legal and\n            environmental specialists would have improved preparation;\n            d) the IMO's appointment as executing agency imposed a\n            barrier between the Bank and the beneficiary countries; e)\n            in the absence of a region-wide suitable institution,\n            special attention should have been given to the involvement\n            of suitable sub-regional institutions; f) when a project\n            represents a new area of work for the Bank, a formal\n            mid-term review should have been included in the Project\n            Document; g) the decision to close was based on the\n            Bank's judgement that agreed deadlines were not\n            achieved and in the face of the \"inability\" of the\n            IMO to follow agreed procedures and action; and h) the Bank\n            should continue to support the efforts of IMO and\n            governments to implement and sustain MARPOL 73/78."}, "docdt": "1999-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
