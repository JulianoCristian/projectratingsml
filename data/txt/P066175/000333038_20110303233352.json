Third Integrated Financial Management Technical Assistance\n            Project for Guatemala is expected to deepen and consolidate\n            reforms initiated under the Integrated Financial Management\n            System - IFMS (SIAF) project geared to increase public\n            sector efficiency and transparency at the central and\n            municipal levels in the areas of public finance planning,\n            management, and control by strengthening the processes and\n            systems and supporting the institutionalization of these\n            processes and systems through the transfer of ownership to\n            the relevant institutions. This document changes in the\n            components, in the results framework and monitoring table,\n            in the institutional arrangements and in the Project costs\n            and allocation of proceeds of AF for the Third Integrated\n            Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (the\n            Project), as described in: (a) the project paper on a AF\n            Loan in the Amount of US$20.0 Million to the Republic of\n            Guatemala, dated March 4, 2008; (b) the Loan Agreement\n            providing AF for the Project between the Republic of\n            Guatemala (the Borrower) and the International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) (the AF Loan\n            Agreement); and (c) the AF implementation letter, as defined\n            in appendix one to the Loan Agreement. Adjustments are\n            required due to several reasons including a delayed start to\n            project activities stemming from slower than anticipated\n            congressional approval of AF to the project, the need to\n            strengthen SIAF's capacity to address some issues\n            arising from the global economic crisis, as well as the need\n            to reinforce the consolidation of SIAF with the Ministry of\n            Finance (MOF) prior to loan closure in mid 2011. The results\n            framework includes some new or modified indicators or\n            specific benchmarks. The project objectives remain the same.\n            The AF Loan Agreement and the AF implementation letter will\n            be amended accordingly."}, "docdt": "2011-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
