                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project restructuring and additional financing is expected to deepen and consolidate reforms initiated under the SIAF project geared to increase public
                         sector efficiency and transparency at the central and municipal levels in the areas of public finance planning, management, and control by strengthening the
                         processes and systems and supporting the institutionalization of these processes and systems through the transfer of ownership to the relevant institutions.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports on progress, issues and findings observed in a supervision mission held in November 2010. Overall project implementation is moderately satisfactory due to
                         accumulated delays and limited progress in some components. In view of existing delays and less likelihood of achieving some of the expected results, the Bank together with the
                         Government agreed on the revision of targets for some results indicators. A restructuring proposal will be submitted for Bank review and approval in the near future.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project Restructuring: As a result of the assessment of project progress and considering accumulated delays in some of the project components and activities, the government
                         decided to restructure the project in order to better reflect both scope of activities andexpected results to be completed by the end of the project. A detailed proposal has been
                         prepared and submitted for Bank review within the next month.
