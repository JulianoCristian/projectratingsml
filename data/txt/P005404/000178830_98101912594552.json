through provision of better social and\n            agricultural services. Livestock development operations will\n            focus on animal health, genetic improvement and fodder\n            production. The forestry component will include the\n            establishment of forestry plantations and the introduction\n            of better management and harvesting techniques. At the farm\n            level, the project will introduce improved crop production\n            techniques and encourage the use of modern inputs while\n            altering the land-use system."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
