Lessons learned:\n            Community-Based Natural Resource and Wildlife Management\n            Project (GEPRENAF's) success in bringing about policy\n            changes in the management of natural resources demonstrates\n            that a few carefully calculated risks can produce valuable\n            results. In approaches such as GEPRENAF's that rely on\n            sustaining community commitment to conservation and\n            sustainable use of wild resources through the\n            materialization of future economic benefits, the design\n            should err on the side of caution. In both countries, the\n            AGEREFs and the inter-village development committees favored\n            local development activities over conservation work. The\n            GEPRENAF approach tested a model that fully empowers\n            communities. Modern wildlife management is a complex and\n            highly technical operation that should be conducted by\n            trained, experienced professionals, and not by amateurs. The\n            project signed several protocols with government agencies\n            and NGOs for the provision of technical services."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
