F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The PASS has four objectives:
   (i)    to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health,
          nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the
          Government’s Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its
          articulation with critical actions in health and education;
   (ii)   to improve budget management to support the performance of these social sectors
          within the CCT program;
   (iii)  to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social sectors; and
   (iv)   to enhance transparency and accountability to users by strengthening the enabling
          environment for a better informed demand for improved public sector performance in
          the social domain.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


1.       In 2009, the Fernandez administration had a solid political base to undertake reforms. At
the time the Development Policy Lending (DPL) series was launched in October 2009, the Dominican
Republic (DR) stood as a middle income country relying on tourism, mining and light manufacturing as
its main exports. For over a decade the DR had competitive elections and peaceful transitions of the party
in power. President Fernandez had been reelected for a second consecutive term in May 2008 and his
party held a majority in both Chambers of Congress. His government was well positioned to implement a
reform agenda focusing on addressing the energy crisis, social protection, fighting corruption and
building institutions, and improving competitiveness and the investment climate. He convened a National
Summit to define a long-term national development strategy. He also created a consensus with all
political parties to make some changes to the constitution, realigning the electoral calendar and
eliminating presidential reelections.

2.       High levels of poverty called for a new social agenda. Economic growth during the 1990s had
brought improvements in the quality of life, despite the 2003-4 crises which has pushed 1.3 million
people into poverty (poverty increasing from 28 percent in 2002 to 43 percent in 2004). By 2006, the
situation had rebounded, with a GDP growth of 9 percent, fueled by tourism, construction and
telecommunications. Since the crisis, despite stabilization and robust growth over several years, poverty
had declined only slightly, aggravated by a high income inequality. By 2009, 36 percent of the population
was poor and 13 percent extremely poor. Structural poverty had increased the vulnerability of poor
households to external and internal shocks, establishing a clear need for improved social protection
services. The Fernandez Government had articulated a new social sector policy, aimed not only at
reducing poverty levels, but also to increase the capacity of the poor to move themselves out of poverty
and integrate into the economy and society at large. DR’s social sector policy was structured around four
pillars: social protection, social security, the provision of social services (mainly education and health)
and labor market interventions. The Government’s social protection policy was based on building human
capital and increasing risk management capacities of the poor, in order to reduce their vulnerability to
shocks. In September 2005 the Government established a cash transfer program (Solidaridad) to replace
two existing, institutionally weak, programs. After a few years, a consensus emerged that Solidaridad
needed significant improvements to become a full-fledged conditional cash transfer (CCT) program.

3.       The Government of the Dominican Republic (GoDR) was aiming at maintaining economic
stability to minimize the impact of the international crisis. In the two years prior to the 2008
international crisis, the DR had a growth rate well above the regional average. Even for 2008, growth was
about 5.3 percent. Internally, the government had implemented reforms to enhance fiscal sustainability.
The manufacturing and service sectors –communication, commerce, and tourism – were growing strongly
and external factors also showed strong growth with important foreign exchange inflows from tourism,
remittances, and foreign direct investments. Although during 2005-2007, the DR had achieved positive
results in terms of fiscal balances, debt and international reserve ratios, and inflation, the situation
deteriorated due to the international crisis. For 2008, the overall deficit had reached 3.2 percent of GDP,
mainly due to increased spending in the run-up to the Presidential elections and increased subsidies
starting in early 2008. Inflation had declined from 51.5 percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2007 and 10.6
percent in 2008. The IMF had agreed a program supporting a policy of gradual return to balanced fiscal
accounts. Declining revenues, higher energy sector deficits, and reduction of financing sources had
created a risky situation. By requesting the IMF support, the Government had managed to secure

                                                    1
sufficient additional financing and had signaled its commitment to macroeconomic stability. The
evolution of some key economic indicators during the six-year period prior to launching the DPL series is
shown in Table 1 below.

              Table 1: Key Economic Indicators for Dominican Republic, 2003-2008

 Real GDP growth (% change)                  -0.3       1.3         9.3         10.7      8.5        5.3
 Inflation (%) (End of period)              27.4       51.5         4.2          7.6      7.4       10.6
 Gross Domestic Investment                  15.0       14.9        16.5         18.4     18.9       19.7
 Gross Domestic Savings                     19.3       18.9        13.4         14.0     11.4       11.0
 Total Public Debt                          40.5       47.4        34.5         36.4     33.4       34.0
 Foreign Direct Investment                    3.1       4.2         3.5          4.3      3.8        6.5

4.       By the time the first DPL of the series was appraised, the medium-term macroeconomic
outlook was positive. Growth was expected to be moderate during the following few years, supported by
an improved external environment, and implementation of fiscal countercyclical stimulus supported by an
IMF program. It was anticipated that inflation would remain subdued and domestic and external factors
would support the medium-term growth prospects. It was foreseen that while the external financing needs
for future years were substantial, they could be attained with the assistance of the IMF and other
international financial institutions. The medium-term sustainability depended on the IMF program
support, including a policy of gradual return to balanced fiscal accounts, sustained growth, further
improvements in the quality and control of public spending, and the implementation of a multi-year
budget system. The main risks were associated with the possibility of declining revenues, energy sector
deficits and lack of adequate financial resources.

5.       The education sector had plenty of room for improvement. Despite almost universal coverage
in basic education (94 percent), access to preschool and secondary school was limited (31 and 53 percent,
respectively) and unequal. A substantial gap, equal to more than three years of schooling, existed between
the poorest and richest families compounded by wide urban-rural differences, particularly for pre-school
and secondary attendance. In addition, there were serious issues with student retention and completion
rates with significant percentages of overage students and student drop-outs. These issues were
contributing to low educational efficiency compounded by quite low levels of public expenditure on
education, reaching barely about 2.1 percent of GDP.

6.       Primary health services at the first level of care were in urgent need of strengthening.
Significant obstacles remained in terms of access at the first level of care. The number of hospital births
had reached levels over 95 percent for the poorest quintile but maternal mortality rates were stubbornly
high, estimated for 2007 at 150 per 100,000 deliveries. Post-natal checks and children with full
vaccination coverage were under fifty percent. Other countries in the region with comparable or lower
levels of development and healthcare coverage were showing better health outcomes. The disparity
between high levels of service coverage and high levels of mortality suggested substantial shortcomings
in the quality of delivery for key primary health services, in particular at the first level of care. The poor
results were partly a product of scarce public resources allocated to the health sector. Public expenditure
in health was among the lowest in the region, barely averaging 1.4 percent of GDP.

7.      High poverty levels called for protecting social expenditures. By 2005, the GoDR had
estimated approximately 700,000 households were poor, of which about 112,000 extremely poor. In this

                                                      2
context, it was assumed that a decline in social public expenditures, triggered by the global crisis, would
damage efforts to improve equitable access to quality education and health services, undermining the
capacity of the social protection system to serve as a buffer for the poor. There was a consensus in the DR
on three major social policy challenges. Firstly, it was urgent to preserve the human capital of the poor in
the short term, especially through the protection of expenditures on social transfers, education and
primary health care services. In particular, the Solidaridad program, although imperfect, had been playing
a key role providing an income protection floor to maintain consumption levels. Secondly, an adequate
supply-side response to the increased demands of beneficiaries required an expansion of health and
education services. Lastly, the crisis presented an opportunity to improve the impact of public services in
the social sectors over the medium term, through social and public sector policy reforms that could not be
postponed due to the adverse macroeconomic context. This approach provided a solid base for designing
the policy reform program for the DPL series.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

8.        The Bank and the Government had prepared, by mid-2009, a Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) that became timely for providing a strategic framework for the DPL program. The CPS gave
special emphasis to protecting the poor while enhancing competitiveness and strengthening public
institutions for performance accountability. These priority areas were expected to be addressed by
implementing actions to achieve four strategic objectives: (i) strengthen social cohesion and improve
access to and quality of social services, (ii) promote competitiveness in a sustainable and resilient
economic environment, (iii) enhance quality of public expenditures and institutional development, and
(iv) build capacity and constituencies for reform. The structure of the DPL program was in line with the
new CPS. In particular, the reform of the safety net program, measures to improve budget management
and a better informed demand for improved public sector performance in the social domain were well
aligned with the stated objectives. It should be noted that the progress reports on the CPS dated December
2011, confirmed that the four broad objectives of the CPS remained consistent with the Government’s
agenda and that progress had been good and had validated its targeted approach, remaining relevant for
the remainder of the CPS period. The progress report also highlighted that the Government had
undertaken several institutional reforms to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of
government operations. Further, it noted that although the Dominican Republic registered a slowdown
during the global economic crisis, growth had quickly recovered and the country continued to be one of
best performers in the region, that the overall economic outlook for the country remained positive, and
continued structural reforms were still needed to close the large electricity sector deficit and improve the
reliability of service. On the social front, poverty rates continued to remain high, the levels of social
spending were modest by regional standards, but poverty and social indicators, however, would likely
have been worse without the proactive decisions of Government to protect the levels of social spending
and reform social service delivery.

9.       The design of the DPL program complemented well the activities undertaken by other
programs supported by the Bank. The Social Protection Investment Project (PIPS) was not providing
finance to the Solidaridad program as such, but was assisting in providing poor undocumented
Dominicans with national identity documents, which enable them to have access to social protection
programs. The PIPS was also focused on improving the coverage and effectiveness of the targeting
instrument and provided technical assistance and capacity-building for the reform of the Solidaridad
program. Specifically, the DPL series was aimed at supporting the redesign of the program, setting up the
instruments required for its implementation, aligning managerial and staff capacity to the new operational
rules of the redesigned CCT, and supporting the development of a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation system. The DPL series also provided a good complement to the ongoing second phase of the
Adaptable Program Loan for the support to the Health Sector Reform. Specifically, it was designed to

                                                     3
provide a framework for improving intersectoral coordination for human capital investment and an
enhanced accountability framework for the social sector. Furthermore, the education actions supported by
the DPL series complemented well the sector initiatives that were being addressed by the Early Childhood
Education Project. Finally, there were strong complementarities between the DPL series and the Public
Finance and Social Sector DPL, which was presented jointly to the Board. The Public Finance and Social
Sector DPL supported measures aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of public spending,
especially in sectors that matter for poverty reduction and human development, and strengthening overall
fiscal sustainability.

10.     The DPL series incorporated relevant lessons from recent interventions in the DR and
elsewhere in the region. In particular, the 2004 Social Crisis Response Adjustment Loan showed an
effective manner for achieving short-term crisis alleviation measures along with advances on medium-
term policy actions. This was reflected on a careful selection of policy actions, reaching consensus with
GoDR on these actions, and seeking a close inter-sectoral and donor coordination. The experience with
Peru’s Programmatic DPL in social sectors, was also used, since it offered interesting lessons related to
the need to fully involve social sector ministries in the implementation of performance-informed
budgeting, and the value of supporting an enabling environment for a better informed demand.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.     The PASS has four objectives:
        a. to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition,
           education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government’s
           Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical
           actions in health and education;
        b. to improve budget management to support the performance of these social sectors within the
           CCT program;
        c. to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social sectors; and
        d. to enhance transparency and accountability to users by strengthening the enabling
           environment for a better informed demand for improved public sector performance in the
           social domain.

12.     The social and public sector policy reforms supported by this DPL series were consistent
with the Government’s long term goal of improving major human development indicators in
education and health, especially for the poorest citizens. Long term results extending beyond the time
span of the DPL series in education included an increase in the share of extremely poor children in early
childhood development programs and in basic and secondary education. In health, key long term results
included increased Government performance in the delivery of critical nutrition, child and prenatal health
care services for the poorest citizens.

13.      The Key Development Indicators defined to assess achievement of the program outcomes, in
the four policy areas included in the DPL series, are listed in Table 2 below.




                                                    4
                                      Table 2: Key Development Indicators

Policy Area I – Enhancing the performance of social sector agencies
   Share of CCT beneficiary households receiving transfers that are registered at their designated Primary Care Unit
    (UNAP) or school, or who received a letter warning of potential suspension due to incompliance with registrations
   Share of CCT beneficiary transfers paid on the basis of the timely verification of compliance with co-responsibilities.
   Share of students from CCT beneficiary households who are enrolled in and attending pre-primary, basic and
    secondary education.
   Share of children between 0 and 5 years old who comply with the series of consults established by the national
    standards of comprehensive care for healthy children (growth and development check-ups).
   Share of children between 6 and 60 months who receive micronutrient sprinkles (iron and zinc).

Policy Area II – Improving Budget Management
   Deviation between proposed budget to cover the supply gaps in health, nutrition and education services and the
    overall national budget, in relative term.
   Deviation between scheduled quota and actual budget proportion to cover the supply gaps in health, education and
    nutrition.
Policy Area III – Supporting the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements
   Number of priority programs in health, nutrition and education related to the Solidaridad program, that have
    successfully developed the log-frame methodology.
Policy Area IV – Improving transparency and oversight
   Number of registered users in the consulta amigable budget information portal.
   Number of community-scorecards completed by beneficiary committees, as a share of total number of community-
    scorecards distributed



1.3 Revised PDOs and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

14.       The PDOs were not revised. Slight adjustments were made to the original key indicators when
designing the second operation. During appraisal for PASS2, it was proposed that two indicators,
originally included under PASS1, would no longer be considered as key outcomes for policy area 1.
These were related to improving maternal/child care and vaccination rates and to assessing beneficiary
satisfaction. In both cases, it was considered that the effect of these two indicators was adequately
reflected by other indicators already included in the results framework. The change was introduced when
the second operation was presented for Board approval. Also, as baseline data became available when the
results from the Social Protection Evaluation Study (the baseline for the rigorous impact evaluation of the
program) were published in September 2011 (data from July 2010); targets were established and/or
revised for a series of indicators related to Policy Area 1.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

15.     In line with its strategic vision and the Government’s program, the PASS had four inter-related
objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition,
education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government’s CCT program,
Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; (ii) to improve budget
management to support the joint performance of social sector agencies within the CCT program, as part

                                                         5
of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending and support the required
improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services; (iii) to support the gradual
introduction of performance agreements in the key social sector agencies; and (iv) to enhance
transparency and oversight in social sectors. These policy areas remained the same for all three operations
of the DPL series. The main policy areas supported by the PASS, main sectoral issues and linkages to the
Government’s programs are discussed below.

16.      Policy area 1: Enhancing the performance of social sector agencies to promote equitable
access to human capital. This policy area supported the enhancement of the transfer program
Solidaridad to a full-fledged CCT focused on the promotion of human capital related to critical actions in
health and education, select actions to enhance the overall quality of service to beneficiaries, and the
effectiveness of the targeting system. The key reforms of the CCT were aimed at: (i) focusing the CCT
exclusively on cash transfers conditioned to the investment in health and education by poor families; (ii)
establishing a clear division of responsibilities among, and shared accountability within, key agencies of
the Social Cabinet; (iii) establishing a clear division of responsibilities among, and shared accountability
between, the CCT program and the education and health ministries, to ensure the compliance of
beneficiaries with co-responsibilities in health, nutrition and education and its verification at national and
regional level; and (iv) establishing an integral system of monitoring and evaluation shared by all
agencies within the Social Cabinet and with the education and health ministries. Additionally, specific
actions were introduced in the health sector for improving primary health care services. In the education
sector, actions were focused on enhancing the articulation between the redesigned CCT program
(Solidaridad) and the supply of education services to verify the compliance of co-responsibilities and to
monitor student learning outcomes. Another reform supported by the program was related to enhancing
the quality of services to CCT beneficiaries by expanding the network of businesses that accept the debit
card of the program. It also included actions to improve the information provided to beneficiaries on
transfer amounts and balances. One last line of action was aimed at reducing errors of inclusion and
exclusion by updating the targeting registry and giving the specialized agency (SIUBEN) full
responsibility for maintaining and updating the registry of the CCT beneficiaries.

17.     Policy area 2: Improving budget management to support the performance of the CCT
program. This second policy area was intended to address the need to both increase budget allocations to
meet the entitlements envisioned under the CCT program and other social programs, and to ensure that
the budget for CCT is executed as programmed. Its main actions were focused on developing rolling
multi-annual projections of supply gaps in health, nutrition and education, and the provision of adequate
budget resources to cover the gaps.

18.     Policy area 3: Supporting the gradual introduction of performance agreements in the social
sectors. This policy area was focused on addressing the need to enhance the performance orientation of
the budget and management processes. Budget management was largely focused on controlling financial
and human inputs hindering the prioritization of the programs based on their outputs and outcomes. A
very gradual movement toward a flexible performance-informed budgeting framework was conceived to
support better decision making, including managerial flexibility, transparency and accountability for
public spending.

19.      Policy area 4: Improving transparency and oversight. This last policy area of reform
addressed some of the most critical challenges hindering a more informed demand for improved public
sector performance in social sectors. At budget level, the program aimed at introducing a full disclosure
of budget information to improve public access and understanding of the budget through a web based
tool. At the CCT program level, the reform promoted the public disclosure of all critical information and



                                                      6
the introduction of a social auditing scheme and a complaints system associated with the provision of
services in schools and health facilities.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

20.     The Policy Areas were not revised.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

21.    Disbursements for the three operations were carried out quite close to the schedule established
when the first operation was appraised and agreed with the Government. Table 3 summarizes the dates
and amounts.

                                 Table 3: Disbursements for each operation

22.     Specific policy actions, to be met before Board approval, by the first operation (PASS1) in the
four policy areas included in this programmatic DPL series are summarized in Table 4. The evolution of
policy actions for the three operations under the PASS are shown in Annex 1.

  pregnant women and children under two years old.
  6. Necessary measures are taken to ensure that sufficient funds will be included in the Borrower’s      Completed
  2010 Budget Law to cover the supply-gaps linked to the redesign of the Solidaridad Program, as well
  as special measures to ensure that those funds are disbursed in a timely fashion.

  7. An institutional diagnostic has been completed to assess the preparedness and capacity building      Completed
  needs for the introduction of Performance Agreements in the education and health sectors.
  8. The Secretariat of Health has signed results-oriented internal management agreements with two        Completed
  Regional Health Services.
  IV. Enhanced Transparency and Civil Society Oversight
  9. The Solidaridad program has published electronically the list of beneficiaries and the assessment    Completed
  quantifying and estimating the costs of supply gaps in health, education and nutrition.

  Overall Approach/Basic Management Agreements
  10. A basic management agreement has been signed agreeing on the policy and institutional               Completed
  strengthening actions needed to improve the performance and accountability of the Solidaridad
  program.


 23.     The second operation (PASS2) introduced some changes to the formulation of the prior
 actions previously drafted (at the time PASS1 was agreed). However, most prior actions under PASS2
 remained consistent and on track with the original program. Of the 18 triggers originally envisaged for the
 second operation, only three were modified, as follows: (i) under Policy Area I, the sub-component on
 developing the baselines for the verification of compliance with co-responsibilities was postponed due to
 complexities for developing a full-fledged nationwide M&E system to cross-reference data across regions
 and sectoral programs on a regular basis; (ii) actions plans, in the health sector, to improve prenatal
 controls, quality of delivery services and improvements in vaccination rates would be replaced by
 additional protocols under PASS3; and (iii) under Policy Area IV, the development of the web-based tool
 (Consulta Amigable), was rescheduled to be completed by June 2011.

 24.       The review process in the Bank decided that PASS2 should be focused on fewer prior
 actions. An attempt was made to have fewer prior actions for PASS2, reducing them to ten instead of the
 original eighteen triggers. This reduction required selectivity, focusing attention on fewer critical
 measures that were needed for reaching the full potential of the PASS series PDOs. In this context,
 although some original policy actions had already been implemented, they were no longer considered as
 criteria for disbursement. These revisions are detailed in Table 5 below.

 25.      Further adjustments were introduced to the formulation of the prior actions under PASS3.
 As mentioned earlier, Annex 1 provides a detailed comparison of prior actions both with the initial
 formulation as well as those envisaged under PASS2. Following the experience gained under PASS2, the
 number of prior actions was maintained at a more manageable size, limiting them to the most critical
 measures needed for reaching the full potential of the reforms. The original policy actions continued to
 show significant advances, but some were replaced by other policy actions that were considered to be
 more central to the program objectives. Particularly, the original trigger in education to adjust student
 learning outcome tests was removed because the Government had embarked on a broader reform of its
 curriculum. It was replaced by a series of key policy actions to improve the efficiency of education
 spending, which had been identified as a key constraint for improved results. Similarly, in the health
 sector, the original policy action requiring the formulation of plans to improve certain programs was
 replaced by the formulation of new protocols, training programs and improving registration of services
 provided under the clinic management system. Additionally, certain actions were reformulated to reflect
 achievements beyond expectations. For example, the action related to the establishment of Regional
 Intersectoral Committees in at least half of the regions was transformed to reflect the fact that the
 Government had already established these committees in all regions.

 26.     An additional section was introduced under the policy area aimed at enhancing
 performance of the social sectors (introduced as a trigger for PASS3 in the program document for
 PASS2). It was aimed at providing support for updating the targeting instrument being used for the
 Solidaridad Program. A new census, reaching 1.8 million households, was carried out to update and
 improve the targeting of its social programs, including an update of the information on households and
 individuals, an increase of census coverage in geographic areas already covered by the last census, and an
 expansion of census coverage to geographic areas, with high poverty levels, not previously included. A
 summary of policy actions included in PASS3 is presented in Table 6.

     2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

     27.     The key factors that contributed to the successful implementation of the three operations carried
     out under this DPL program, and difficulties faced, are summarized below. These are structured under the
     following headings: commitment shown by the GoDR providing support to the DPL series, background
     analysis carried out, and the role of critical design features under each policy area covered by the
     program. The relevance of key risks identified and the effectiveness of mitigation measures are also
     discussed.

     28.      GoDR’s commitment and the looming crisis were key factors for the implementation of the
     social sector reforms sponsored by the program. It should be noted that, from the perspective of
     availability of budgetary resources, the social and economic environment prevailing in 2009 was not
     favorable for implementing reforms in social policy and programs. At the time of the DPL program
     preparation (mid 2009), serious concerns arose that the food, fuel and international financial crises could
     dramatically increase poverty and unemployment and severely diminish social spending for safety nets,
     education and health. In this context, the Government took bold steps to initiate key reforms in the social
     sectors consistent with the development objectives supported by the Program. The GoDR’s commitment
     for redesigning the Solidaridad program, as an integrated program covering health and education related
     services, was critical for mitigating the risk of budget cuts in social sectors linked to the prevailing crises.
     Improving planning and budget management for the CCT program and its associated provision of health,
     nutrition and education services was also a very positive step. Moreover, these efforts were integrated into
     the first-ever National Development Strategy 2030 that aimed at creating sustained economic growth and
     distribute its benefits to all Dominicans, emphasizing poverty reduction, equity, sustainable development,
     and efficient, transparent institutions. It is likely that the crisis gave the reforms an added sense of
     urgency and therefore contributed to the success of the reform program.

     29.     Several years of a positive dialogue on social policies and practices provided a sound basis
     for designing the PASS. Design of the PASS built on extensive analytical work carried out by the Bank
     and other agencies during the 1990s. Available analytical and advisory reports provided a solid base for
     defining key areas of reforms needed for improving performance and accountability of the social sectors.
     Analytical work done by the Bank to define a strategic approach to improve public sector performance
     was particularly useful. Additionally, and consistent with the CPS approach, two strategic, programmatic
     Non-Lending Technical Assistance products were extremely useful for supporting participating
     government agencies in achieving policy commitments and outcomes included in the PASS series. They

                                                             12
covered human development issues complementary to the scope covered by Solidaridad in the education
sector and, the second one addressed public sector performance, focusing on the improvement of the
quality of public expenditures. It proved also very useful to incorporate into PASS design relevant lessons
learned, particularly from a recent Bank operation on social crisis response and the Peruvian experience
on performance-informed budgeting.

30.      Reforming Solidaridad was a critical decision for establishing the basis for a national social
protection system. A key design feature was reorganizing the structure of the Solidaridad program,
including improvement of targeting and eligibility rules, adopting more efficient transfer payments to
beneficiaries and setting up effective coordination mechanisms among ministries and agencies involved.
Furthermore, the redesigned Solidaridad was set up as the primary axis of the national Social Protection
System adjusting its organizational structure to bring it in line with the new objectives and operating
rules. The design also created a new institutional framework aimed at improving intersectoral decision
making and establishing decentralized program operations. Most importantly, it introduced the practice of
associating transfers to fulfillment of co-responsibilities by the beneficiaries. These co-responsibilities
were linked, on the education side, to children’s enrollment in primary school (6 to 16 years old) and
compliance with a minimum standard of attendance, and in health, to children’s meeting the standards of
periodic controls for early detection of health problems (0 to 5 years old). One major obstacle that the
program faced was related to difficulties for implementing its information systems to allow for a
systematic verification of compliance with co-responsibilities and enforcing sanctions when applicable. A
first verification of CCT co-responsibilities could only take place in late 2010. At that time, co-
responsibilities measured only in terms of registration of families at their primary health centers and/or of
school-age children in schools were verified. It appears that the complexities associated with transforming
Solidaridad to a full-fledged CCT were underestimated. In particular, great difficulties were faced for
implementing the verification of co-responsibilities. These are discussed in more detail in section 2.3
below. Other aspects of the DPL program were, by and large, implemented with no significant
difficulties. Issues that arose were addressed by ministries and agencies involved without significant
delays upon policy actions supported by the program.

31.      The selection of policy actions under the program had a positive effect for improving the
provision of services to Solidaridad beneficiaries. In the health sector, the GoDR put in place a series of
reforms to strengthen service delivery in line with the increased demand for primary health care services
generated by introducing co-responsibilities in Solidaridad. In particular, it promoted the use of
preventive health services including prenatal and puerperal consultations, infant and child check-ups and
immunizations. In education, critical steps were taken to strengthen its articulation with Solidaridad, by
investing in bridging supply-gaps through a targeted approach. Another key set of actions were aimed at
initiating an assessment of alternative transfer structures to schools, defining standards and tests to
measure learning outcomes and to increasing the efficiency of education expenditures. The GoDR also
took important steps for improving the payment mechanism to beneficiaries, through a debit card which
can be used at participating stores (colmados). The payment agency (Administrator of Social Subsidies,
ADESS) expanded the number of stores and improved access by beneficiaries to their account
information. It also made arrangements with a pro-consumer organization for monitoring the quality of
services and by providing beneficiaries with greater information on the services and their rights as
consumers.

32.      Improvements in budget management in the health and education sectors provided critical
support to the reform program. In particular, the program design introduced for the first time in DR, a
multi-annual plan for the public sector containing provisions for implementing social protection policy
actions including projections in terms of coverage and budget. It also included the appropriation of fiscal
resources for the programs aimed at closing gaps in the supply of social services. This plan represented a
significant improvement to increase predictability of the budget and was an important first step for

                                                     13
developing a medium-term expenditure framework. At the same time, a special program was set up to
protect the budget required to close gaps for supplying an adequate level of services in education, health
and nutrition over a rolling three-year period. It also worked to increase transparency to monitor the
execution of resources on a quarterly basis and publish the findings. Additionally, linkages were
established with results-oriented budgeting, with the introduction of performance agreements between the
Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of the Economy, Planning and Development; the Ministry of Public
Administration; and key social sector ministries and agencies.

33.     The design also included important features adequate for improving transparency,
accountability and participation. One key aspect was the introduction of a web-based information
window to enable budget analysis and monitoring with adequate coverage of centralized agencies. At the
CCT program level, significant progress was also achieved in terms of improving transparency, civic
participation and oversight. This area of reform focused on establishing mechanisms for improved
transparency and oversight by introducing an effective social auditing scheme and also by implementing a
system of complaints. The community scorecard proved to be quite a useful tool for social auditing and
the Government is currently considering its use in other programs.

34.     Relevant risks and mitigation measures were properly assessed. Macroeconomic risks were
adequately mitigated in spite of a volatile external environment that prevailed throughout the
implementation period. There were no significant shifts in institutional priorities and no budgetary
constraints surfaced that could have hampered implementation. It should be highlighted that, during the
period 2009-2012, the GoDR remained highly committed to the policy actions agreed for the DPL
program. The only implementation risk that could have been mitigated more effectively was the
management of the complexities associated with the development of the M&E integrated systems
mentioned below in more details in section 2.3. Political risks associated with the presidential elections
held in May 2012 were dissipated when the candidate of the ruling party won in the first ballot. The
candidate had included in his program a further strengthening of the social protection programs and a
proposal to expand Solidaridad to reach an additional 200,000 families.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35.      The PASS program included support for the development of an integral Social Protection
M&E system. The system was conceived with the broad scope of an integrated management system. The
key design feature under this arrangement was that the integrated system would become a management
tool for all social protection services provided to beneficiaries and coordinated by the Social Cabinet.
Such an integrated system would include a common registry, an integrated system of data bases of
institutions in the social protection network and a single entry point for beneficiaries. A key component of
the integrated M&E system was the design and implementation of a management system for Solidaridad,
which would enable its administration, monitoring its operation, and provide information for evaluating
processes and results. The design of this SP M&E system included the interaction of five systems.

36.     The M&E system for the Solidaridad program included modules for program management,
operations monitoring, and results and impact evaluation. Initially, the plan for verification of
compliance with co-responsibilities was to use a manual system in all schools and health clinics.
However, in early 2011, the GoDR decided to avoid creating a duplicative system, and opted for using
sectoral systems in the health and education ministries, designed to serve a series of management
purposes beyond the verification for the CCT program. Shifting to these new systems was an ambitious
decision, as it meant that the program would need to rely on the establishment of two much broader
sectoral systems, but it was the correct decision from a development’s perspective, in that it would
contribute to the develop of strategic tools (rather than opt for the easy solution of developing parallel
systems limited to the function of verification). This shift led to long processes to define and procure the

                                                    14
systems, efforts for an initial uploading of basic information on each individual, and required an
important shift in both ministries institutional culture. As a result, despite strong commitment, the design
and implementation of these sectoral systems faced significant delays. In the interim period, additional
data collection instruments were put in place to meet the needs for the verification of co-responsibilities.
In addition, a series of regular data audits (on a sample of the program’s beneficiaries) has been
undertaken to certify the actual level of compliance with co-responsibilities.

37.     The Ministry of Education had developed a school-based management information system.
This web-based system aimed at enhancing the ministry’s capacity to collect, monitor and update student,
teacher and school data at the school-level. It provides for collection and exchange of information on key
variables, including enrolment and attendance, to allow for the timely verification of CCT co-
responsibilities. Initially, implementation faced difficulties, particularly for cross-referring its database
with Solidaridad’s databases of beneficiaries. In particular, in attempting to cross-check the Ministry of
Education and Solidaridad databases for student enrollment, problems were discovered in the
incompatibility of the unique identifying variables across databases. However, as of the end of the
implementation period of the DPL series, the compatibility between Solidaridad’s information system
and the ministry’s database has been ensured (all beneficiaries with a code are found in the Ministry’s
database), but the capacity of the Ministry’s system to register attendance is still incomplete.

38.      The Ministry of Health had started the implementation of its Clinic Management System
(CMS) as a new management information system and an integral component of its health
information system. The CMS provides a platform for the registration of patients’ medical data aiming at
improving the quality, accountability, and management of primary health services. The CMS is also
designed to provide data for the verification of CCT co-responsibilities. The CMS represents a
fundamental change in the data collected and reported by physicians, providing electronic medical records
and instantaneous reporting to central and regional administrators. The cultural change, of getting doctors
and/or staff to register primary health care consultations on a daily basis faced great difficulties. This was
compounded by software problems, frequent power interruptions, and insufficient training on the use of
computers and the new system. The ministry made significant progress in addressing these issues through
establishing the mandatory use of the CMS, as well as a new ministerial incentive scheme to improve
uptake, and the provision of additional training and small generators.

39.      The Government has made important progress in the evaluation of its core social programs
and in enhancing the GoDR’s ability to use these tools. The program introduced the practice of making
routine evaluations of processes and outcomes of Solidaridad. Two surveys were conducted to identify
issues that were affecting the transfers to beneficiaries that led to improvements in expanding the network
of shops accepting the debit card used and access to balance of fund available. An impact evaluation was
carried out during 2011, based on a survey to a sample of beneficiary households and a control group
composed of household eligible to participate but not registered in the program. The impact evaluation
showed significant achievements within beneficiaries, compared with the control group, on the rate of
pregnant women receiving prenatal and postnatal controls and children attending periodic health controls
and completing the vaccination protocol. On the education side, beneficiary households also showed
positive results on improvements of school registration and attendance, particularly at the pre-school
level. Equally importantly, these evaluations introduced the tools and the practice within the institutions
managing the social protection programs.

40.      More generally, actions supported by this DPL series have built important monitoring and
governance mechanisms. Reforms to the budget management processes – including the development of
logical frameworks for priority programs and the development of performance agreements on the basis of
these indicators – have resulted in an increased culture of defining key indicators, establishing baselines,
setting targets, and putting in place mechanisms for regular monitoring of progress. These were limited to

                                                     15
core social priority programs initially, but the Government is now contemplating the generalization of this
practice to all priority programs in the country. This is part of a systematic effort to shift towards a culture
of results-based management in the GoDR.

41.     The PASS program also promoted progress in terms of civil society’s ability to monitor and
evaluate public actions. In particular, it contributed to the effort of greater transparency in budget
management through the publication of budget data on the web and the training of CSOs in its analysis
and through the development of a methodology and operational procedures for community scorecards,
that will be scaled up in the entire country to monitor the CCT program and its associated health,
education, and payment services. These efforts have been adopted and scaled up beyond the targets set for
the PASS program.

42.      In summary, the overall impact of the M&E reforms supported by the PASS program has
been very significant and its design, implementation and utilization are satisfactory. Indeed, while
deciding to build sector-wide systems (rather than a limited ad-hoc system for the verification of co-
responsibilities) has delayed the full operationalization of the verification process, it has resulted in the
two sector-wide information systems that serve a much broader set of policy decision on budget
allocation, quality, programming, etc. Furthermore, the Solidaridad program now has a full set of
functioning M&E tools beyond the information system – impact evaluations, process evaluations,
community scorecards, etc. – which have significantly changed the management culture, leading to a
results-focus in the program’s management, and have been fully institutionalized. Finally, the broader
efforts for greater transparency and governance have also been scaled up more broadly.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

43.     In line with the prevailing CPS, which covers the period 2010-2013, the Bank has continued the
policy dialogue on social protection issues, and the provision of quality health and education services to
the poorest, through the implementation of the DPL series, ongoing investment operations (in social
protection and health) and its programmatic social sector non-lending technical assistance.

44.      After organizing a high-level policy workshop in June 2012 to share progress, lessons, and
challenges with the incoming administration (that formally took office in August 2012), with the
participation of key actors of the outgoing administration, including the Vice-President and the head of
the Social Cabinet. Since the workshop, the Bank team has rapidly engaged with the new team to provide
the technical assistance it needed as it prepared its plan for the 4-year administration. After a series of
technical events and missions, the incoming administration has fully endorsed the reforms supported by
the DPL series across the board. The new administration is particularly keen to continue strengthening the
core institutions supported by this DPL series (the targeting system, the payment system, the CCT
program), further work for the rationalization of the sector and its institutionalization, and continue its
effort to promote results-based management practices, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and
the Ministry of the Economy. The new administration has asked the Bank to continue supporting the
reform program supported by the DPL series, its investment operations, and its non-lending technical
assistance during its four year mandate (2012-2016).

45.      While a fourth DPL was foreseen in the CPS progress report, the country management decided to
place the funding on hold due to the dialogue on the broader macro-economic context, and in particular
the sharp rise in the fiscal deficit in 2012, an election year. However, the dialogue with the new
authorities in the social sectors has been extremely positive, and there has been no change in the policy
direction (on the contrary, the reforms continue to be consolidated and strengthened). The Bank is in the
process of preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy, which will lay out its involvement.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      The objectives of the DPL series, which were highly relevant for the social protection sector
and for the country at the time of preparation, remain relevant at the time of the ICR. The
operation’s design was consistent with stated objectives, and the DPL series’ implementation proved to
make an important contribution toward implementing the policy actions to strengthen implementation of
social protection programs. Several government officials acknowledged that Bank played a critical role in
assisting GoDR to better achieve its priorities by defining specific achievable steps within an overall
strategy. The DPL series was particularly effective in contributing to foster coordination among ministries
and agencies involved in the implementation of social protection programs and by introducing better
budget management tools in the social sectors. The operation’s design included features that represented a
sound and consistent framework with a strategically appropriate and achievable scope. As an instrument,
a programmatic DPL implemented in a series of three operations allowed to adapt policy actions in the
second and third operations based in the experience gained and some difficulties faced during early
implementation. Finally, the implementation of the policy actions remain also highly relevant, as they
have resulted in tools, systems, procedures, and practices that continue to be implemented and further
strengthened by the GoDR.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

47.     The policy actions in the Policy Matrix were conditions prior to Board approval for each
operation. As discussed earlier, in detail in section 2.1 and Annex 1, the program of policy actions was
implemented in a satisfactory manner, setting a legal and operational framework that enabled the overall
achievement of development objectives. Overall, the targets for key indicators in the four policy areas
supported by the PASS program were met, with minor shortcomings in some dimensions and results that
went beyond targets in others. The continued strengthening of the policy reforms in all the dimensions
supported by the PASS program further confirms the sustainability of the Program Development
Outcomes. Achievements for each development objective are discussed in more detail below, and
achievements for the rest of the monitoring indicators are shown in Annex 2.

Policy Area I – Enhancing the performance of social sector agencies

48.     The objectives in terms of enhancing the performance of social sector agencies were met
with minor shortcomings. The objectives fell into three categories: objectives of improvements in the
use of social services (for health, education, and nutrition) for which there were small shortcomings,
objectives of the program’s ability to monitor compliance with co-responsibilities which both suffered
some limitations, but overall demonstrated important gains significantly beyond the initial objectives of
the program, and objectives of improvements in the management of the CCT program itself (payment
process improves, and targeting is updated) which were exceeded.

49.     In terms of improvements in the use of social services, targets were met with some
shortcomings. In the health sector, targets were only partially met (indicators 1.2.1-1.2.5). Indeed, both
the share of pregnant women receiving prenatal checks and the share of children under 2 with complete
vaccination set (as verified using the alternative verification system and the program’s impact evaluation)
were below the set targets (68 percent, versus a target of 94 percent for pregnant women and 40.3 percent
versus a target of 65 percent for children’s vaccination). However, it is important to note that these
percentages reflect the number of women/children for which the services were registered in their health
carnet (and is therefore expected to significantly underestimate those who actually received the services

                                                    17
since the updating of health carnets is not systematic). In terms of nutrition (indicators 1.3.1-1.3.3),
similarly, targets were not fully met; with significant gaps in the number of children who receive
micronutrient supplements. This is linked to the delay in the implementation of the nutrition program
supported by the World Food Program. Finally, in terms of education (indicators 1.4.1-1.4.6), enrolment
targets were significantly exceeded for compulsory basic education (95.9 percent versus a target of 85
percent), but not fully for pre-school and lower secondary education (with rates of 35. 6 and 47.5 percent,
versus targets of 50 and 55 percent respectively). It is however, important to note that enrolment data for
secondary education was calculated using the total population of children aged 14-18, without accounting
for those who already finished the secondary education cycle or are still in primary education, which is
expected to result in a significant underestimation of the value of this indicator (the indicator was initially
going to be measured with the third round of survey of the program’s impact evaluation, which is planned
for 2013, and would have excluded those children aged 14-18 who are in other educational levels).
Attendance targets were met or exceeded for all levels (with attendance rates of 93-96 percent for the
three educational levels, versus targets of 70-90 percent). Overall, improvements are still needed in the
provision of basic health and secondary education services in the Dominican Republic.

50.      In terms of the program’s ability to monitor compliance with co-responsibilities, as
discussed above, compliance of co-responsibilities could not fully be verified as planned during the
period of implementation of the DPL series. At the time the DPL series was designed, there was no
meaningful monitoring system for co-responsibilities, and the establishment of an adequate system was
defined at the outset as a priority action. The initial plan was to implement a relatively simple system to
verify compliance within the Solidaridad program. But, the GoDR soon decided that, rather than to
develop a parallel system which would serve only this function and work in total isolation from the
sectors, it would instead invest in developing two sectoral systems that serve broader management and
planning purposes within the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. These systems are critical
to the broader agenda of improving the quality and efficiency of health and education services, and their
development is a major achievement of this PASS program. However, for the more specific purpose of
verifying compliance, interim mechanisms had to be established (for instance, an assessment was made to
identify beneficiaries receiving transfers who were registered with their primary health care unit and/or
school, regular audits are carried out to verify compliance, etc.). This being said, the targets in terms of
compliance with co-responsibilities were met or exceeded (indicators 1.1.1 and 1.1.2). Indeed, 97.7
percent of beneficiaries were registered with their primary health care unit (target was 95 percent), 85
percent of households met their health co-responsibilities (target of 80 percent) and 80.7 percent met their
education co-responsibilities (target of 80 percent). Additionally, the policy reforms supported by the
DPL series will result in broad improvements for both the health and education sectors, beyond the actual
verification of co-responsibilities. These unanticipated results are critical to the broader policy reforms to
improve the management of both sectors. The medium-term impacts of the reforms can be expected to
significantly exceed those initially anticipated.

51.     The objectives of improving the management and efficiency of the CCT program itself were
exceeded. Under this objective, the DPL series supported reforms in two areas. First, policy reforms to
significantly expand the network of stores where beneficiaries of the CCT program can use their
debit cards. This network (Red de Abastecimiento, RAS) is managed by the ADESS (Administrator of
Social Subsidies) and initially comprised only about 2,000 establishment, with under-coverage in certain
areas, and the Government agreed to significantly broaden the network and to set up a mechanism to
monitor the quality of services provided by the stores (accessibility, prices, availability, quality, etc.). By
the end of the DPL series, the targets had been exceeded, with almost 5,000 establishments in the
network, and with a formal agreement with a consumer protection institution to monitor the payment
services. The review of payment services provided by the community scorecards implemented by the
program in selected localities revealed a very high overall quality of services, as judged by beneficiaries.
Also, mechanisms are in place to channel complaints or requests to the payment agency. Furthermore, the

                                                      18
Government is currently exploring additional payment mechanisms (including payment with full-fledged
debit cards) as well as mechanisms to allow beneficiaries to closely monitor their balance (through the
establishment of Puntos Solidarios, where all requests related to the CCT program will be submitted).
Finally, the Government is exploring options to promote greater financial inclusion for CCT beneficiaries
through financial education and access to other services.

52.      As a second policy area under this objective of improvement in management, the DPL series
supported the updating of the national targeting mechanism used to identify and select beneficiaries
for the CCT program, SIUBEN (Sistema Unico de Beneficiarios). This is a critical step for the updating
of the roster of beneficiaries, to reflect the evolution of living conditions for poor households, and ensure
greater efficiency of public spending. The target set for the PASS program of “database update” was
exceeded, as the information was indeed updated for the families that were in the initial SIUBEN, but in
addition, the geographic coverage of the SIUBEN was extended beyond the initial area which covered the
poorer neighborhoods. As a result, the number of families in the SIUBEN increased to 1.8 million
households (increasing this number by more than 300,000). Beyond the CCT program, the SIUBEN is
also used to target the subsidized health insurance regime (SENASA), as well as Bonogaz and Bonoluz
(programs of energy subsidies for the poorest). These two institutions – the payment mechanism and the
targeting mechanism – are critical elements of the Dominican social protection system and their
consolidation is expected to have impacts that go beyond the CCT program itself, as other programs
improve their targeting and channel their payments efficiently through the ADESS.


Policy Area II – Improving Budget Management

53.      The targets of the DPL series in terms of budget management were both exceeded. The first
indicator relates to the actual budget spent by the program to close supply gaps in health, nutrition and
education services for Solidaridad beneficiaries. This indicator calculates the percentage difference
between planned and actual budget appropriations for the programs for closing the supply gaps (extent to
which the planned budget is indeed executed), and compares it to the similar percentage difference for the
overall national budget. The objective was to have an indicator of less than 1 (which would indicate that
the programs for closing supply gaps have been protected from reductions more than the overall budget
on average). During the period 2010-2012, the actual allocations to the priority supply-gap programs were
fully consistent with the planned budgets for these items, resulting in indicators of close to zero (the best
value for this indicator). This was due to the allocation mechanism adopted by the Ministry of Finance
that provided an absolute protection to these items in the national budget from being revised during the
fiscal year. Moreover, the Government adopted this practice for selected budgetary allocations beyond the
scope agreed for the PASS.

54.      The indicator that measures the degree to which the budgeted expenditure (in the national
budget law) was indeed largely realized (disbursed) in practice was exceeded. The target initially set
for the end of the PASS program period was for a disbursement ratio of at least 85 percent; and the actual
disbursement rate was 98 percent in 2012. Furthermore, beyond the actual protection of the spending, the
DPL series has also resulted in the institutionalization of the practice of multi-annual budgets, which
promote medium-term planning and greater predictability, which covers all sectors, beyond those
supported by the DPL series.

Policy Area III – Supporting the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements

55.    The objectives in terms of introducing a results-base focus in social sectors were exceeded.
Five priority programs in health, nutrition and education related to Solidaridad have implemented

                                                     19
Performance Agreements (which include a logical framework), and the nutrition program and child labor
eradication program have developed logical frameworks for results-based management. The Ministry of
the Economy, Planning and Development took the lead in introducing performance agreements in the
policy actions agreed for the DPL series. The initial phase focused on issuing the regulation needed to
implement the law allowing the introduction of performance agreements. At the same time, the process
was initiated to introduce the concept to core social ministries, resulting in its acceptation by authorities in
the ministries of education and health. The actual drafting of the Performance Agreements had a positive
impact in helping decision makers to establish a clear relationship between budgets allocated and the
outcome expected for a specific program. In late 2011, it was agreed to introduce five performance
agreements for the 2012 budget. These were for pre-primary, basic and secondary education in the
Ministry of Education, and programs for immunization and maternal and infant care in the Ministry of
Health. Furthermore, other programs, including the nutrition program and the child labor eradication
program have put in place their logical frameworks. The Ministry of Economy, Planning and
Development is now considering requesting Performance Agreements for all “priority” programs, as a
pre-condition to them being designated as priority programs (which provides them with some protection
in case of budget adjustments during the fiscal year). This would expand the use of this tool to all sectors,
with a view to promote the use of logical frameworks and the focus on results in line agencies.

Policy Area IV – Improving transparency and oversight

56.      Both objectives in terms of improving transparency and oversight were largely exceeded, as
the government has implemented reforms that go much beyond the expected advances. In the area
of publication of national budget data, the Government’s website has registered over 15,000 visits during
2012, well beyond initial expectations. But, perhaps more importantly, the Government has kept
increasing the quantity and type of information provided on its webpage (data both on revenues and
expenditure, with disaggregation along alternative dimensions) and is planning to further publish planned
investment projects, starting with the sector of education, in which the Government has launched an
ambitious investment plan. The initial effort to publish basic data in the context of the DPL-supported
social reforms has resulted in a significant shift in terms of transparency that goes much beyond the
sectors supported by this DPL series. broader

57.     In the area of oversight of the CCT program, the target set for the end of the DPL series
was exceeded, with score cards distributed to beneficiary groups completed by 78,5 percent of them
(target was 70 percent). More importantly, however, given the success and acceptability of this tool, the
Government decided to expand its application to the entire territory, and has approved its expansion plan
for 2013. Also, the Government established local-level intersectoral committees to address grievances
raised by the score cards in each community, which have demonstrated large success in addressing and
resolving most issues (the experience was analyzed through a process evaluation, and an impact
evaluation is underway). Community scorecards, and the processes to address the issues they raise, have
now become a full-fledged part of the program’s management system (with the local committees) and
monitoring and evaluation system (in addition to the management information system, process
evaluations, and impact evaluations).

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Satisfactory

58.      The overall outcome rating is satisfactory, reflecting the achievements of the program
development objectives, the efficiency of this achievement, and the extent to which many results went
significantly beyond the agreed targets, despite the limited shortcomings noted for some outcome

                                                      20
indicators. Overall, observed progress went beyond the expected in many dimensions, not only in terms
of exceeding quantitative targets, but also in terms of contributing to the institutionalization of significant
systems, tools and practices that are expected to have important developmental impacts in the medium
term (impacts in terms of sectoral information systems, targeting and payment mechanisms for the
broader social protection sector, as well as transparency mechanisms and results-focus which have spilled
over to other sectors). These policy reforms supported by the PASS program remain highly relevant, and
this despite a change in administration, as reflected in their institutionalization, continued improvements
and broadened use.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

59.     The key objective of this series of DPL operations was to improve results in social sectors.
Given its development objective, this series of DPLs was essentially centered on social protection,
education and health, preserving in the short term and enhancing in the medium term the human capital of
the poorest citizens. Additionally, through the policy actions implemented by the Government, it achieved
important goals for improving the targeting systems being used to allocate resources to beneficiaries of
social programs. It also enhanced the quality and scope of services being provided to households under
the poverty line in the access of their children to pre-school, basic and secondary education, and to
primary health care and nutrition.

60.     In terms of specific poverty and human capital impacts, in 2012, the CCT program managed
to reach over 650,000 households, with a very strong targeting performance, as it covers more than 90
percent of the extreme poor households, and as many as 80 percent of the moderately poor households
that were eligible. Within a context of crisis, we estimate that the program alone is responsible for a
reduction in one percentage point in the poverty rate. In terms of impact on human development,
similarly, the program has contributed to significant gains for the poorest – with the program resulting in
a reduced risk of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending in health, a greater size/weight among children
under the age of 3, a lower risk of teenage pregnancy, and a lower prevalence of grade repetition in
middle school. More generally, the program has supported a significant effort in closing the gaps that
existed in the supply of basic services in the poorest areas of the country, which has contributed to
reduced inequality and greater social inclusion.

61.     The targeting system has resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency of public
spending, with the share of social assistance spending that is targeted to the poor increasing from 6
percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2011. As an increasing number of programs rely on this targeting system
to allocate resources, the system, which is already used the CCT program, but also by other programs,
such as the subsidized health insurance regime and the targeted fuel subsidies, will continue to contribute
to poverty and social impacts. The targeting of the poorest for the CCT program has also resulted in a
large effort to provide identification documents to the poorest (supported by a parallel Bank investment
operation), which results in greater social inclusion and provides a mechanisms for the inclusion of the
poorest in other social programs.

62.      The programs supported by the PASS program also have a strong gender dimension. In
particular, the CCT program works mostly through mothers and empowers them by providing them with
the transfers. As an indirect effect, this has resulted in a significant number of women obtaining, for the
first time, their own identification document (a pre-requisite for eligibility) which opens other
opportunities beyond the program itself. Also, by nature, many of the health services that have been
further expanded target women, with a strong focus on maternal health. Finally, the participation in the
CCT program is expected to result in greater empowerment through the various community activities and

                                                      21
participation (including through the community-scorecards). In the coming years, as the program
continues to improve, it is also expected to connect women to a broader set of financial services, a key
element to promote greater income-generating activities.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.     The DPL program played a key role for strengthening institutions under the Social Cabinet
contributing to enhance its role and improve the management of social programs. In the first place,
it supported the enhancement of the CCT program Solidaridad. Secondly, it assisted in establishing the
legal and regulatory framework for the restructuring and strengthening of the Borrower’s social protection
systems. Thirdly, it helped developing a strong coordination among ministries and agencies involved in
social protection by creating two committees (Interagency and Intersectoral), chaired by the Vice-
President, which played a critical role for implementing a complex program. Lastly, it provided a
template for the development of performance agreements for the social sectors, which promotes results-
focus and can be replicated to other priority programs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

64.      The policy reform program supported by the series of DPLs had impacts beyond the CCT
program and the social sectors on which it focused. Indeed, some of the tools (budget transparency,
Performance Agreements) are already used, or planned to, by other sectors in the public sphere. Also,
tools such as the payment system (ADESS) or the targeting system (SUIBEN) are used beyond the CCT
program itself, providing other programs with both efficiency gains (e.g. in the payment of the energy
subsidies) and effectiveness gains (e.g. with the targeting of the subsidized health insurance system to the
poor). In the coming years, it will be critical to ensure the continued strengthening and consolidation of
such public expenditure management practices and payment/targeting tools, and to continue broadening
their use and application. Finally, the development of sector-wide information system discussed earlier is
also an outcome that goes beyond the expected outcomes of the PASS series, and that will contribute to
improvements in the quality and the efficiency of basic social services in health and education.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Moderate

65.      There are positive expectations that the newly elected government would provide a strong
commitment continuing to support the policy actions adopted during implementation of the PASS
program. It has also announced the creation of the Ministry of Social Development that should provide a
more solid framework for consolidating the advances made on institutional arrangements and for
implementing its own agenda on social protection. Additionally, progress made on targeting tools and
results achieved on development outcomes provide a sound base for having a sustainable scheme. The
long term outcome will basically depend from the continuity in commitment that the newly elected
government will provide to enable consolidating the social protection system that was supported by the
DPL series. Finally, the new administration has fully endorsed the reform program supported by this DPL
series, and asked the Bank to continue provide support to this agenda.

operations of the PASS program include the team composition and level, the combination of analytical
and operational inputs, and flexibility in adjusting policy actions to reflect progress and new
opportunities. Building on the lessons learnt from other operations supporting decentralization,
institutional reform, and social protection, the Bank deployed a large, strong, multi-sectoral team
throughout the PASS program, during the preparation of each DPL and its supervision, to ensure that all
aspects of the reforms were covered. Also, the design of the PASS program was strongly anchored in
analytical underpinnings, both in the Dominican Republic and in the region. These prior analytical
foundations established by the team members themselves were critical, especially in the context of the
preparation of PASS1, which was prepared on an accelerated calendar because of the need for urgent
support to help the Dominican Republic face the impact of the 2008 global crisis. Analytical work was
also set up throughout the program, to inform later policy decisions, ensuring that the Bank team and the
Government counterparts had the capacity to explore alternative options. For the three DPLs of the PASS
program, the Bank team demonstrated flexibility in revising the triggers and prior actions to recognize
areas where progress was made faster than initially planned and to integrate new areas that could benefit
from inclusion in the program. An important element was the team’s ability to identify risks and
mitigation measures, which proved critical to ensure the three DPLs could be implemented in a
satisfactory manner. Finally, although appropriate attention was given to the importance of developing an
M&E system, the one area to which closer attention could have been given is the institutional
arrangements required for implementing such a complex system involving the Social Cabinet, two
ministries and three government agencies.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Ratings: Satisfactory

67.     The Bank provided an adequate supervision effort for the three DPL of the PASS program,
with a positive contribution for achieving targets. In the context of a programmatic series, the task of
supervising an ongoing operation was done concurrently with preparation of the following operation, and
practically, it becomes a single activity for achieving both ends. Missions maintained a positive dialogue
with GoDR on the policies and actions that were needed to ensure full implementation of the policy
reforms and to ensure targets were met. As needed, problems that arose from time to time were
adequately addressed by providing advice to seek adequate solutions, using other Bank instruments
(including the simultaneous technical assistance and investment operations) to address emerging issues.
When necessary, the Bank explored with the GoDR ways to maintain momentum in the reforms sought
by the program, adapting policy actions in subsequent operations to changes that came up during
implementation. One good example was introducing a new policy action in PASS3, not originally
foreseen, aimed at improving targeting in Solidaridad and other social programs. Another area that
needed close attention during supervision was the systematic verification of co-responsibilities that
needed interim measures to cover the delays that occurred in the implementation of new M&E systems in
Solidaridad and in the ministries of health and education.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

68.     The overall Bank performance is considered satisfactory, since both quality at entry and quality
of supervision are considered satisfactory with minor shortcomings, and contributed to the Satisfactory
outcome of the program.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

69.      Government ownership and commitment was strong from the outset. When the 2008
international crisis threatened to seriously affect the development agenda, the GoDR sought Bank
assistance to define a program that could help protect social programs. Overall, good progress was made
in carrying out policy actions that enabled the implementation of the program. The only major hurdle that
the DPL program faced was that related to the implementation of the comprehensive M&E system. In
spite of the delays faced, the GoDR continued to show its strong commitment to maintain the program on
track and seek interim solutions that would enable achieving the targets set. The GoDR performed well in
the timely adoption of policy actions that played an important role for improving the performance and
accountability of social sectors. In particular, it was very effective at enhancing the coordination role of
the Social Cabinet with social sector ministries and agencies and for improving the systems for budget
allocation and control.

6.      Lessons Learned

70.     The programmatic development policy approach proved to be a suitable instrument for this
intervention. The DPL program proved suitable to support reform processes and to ensure policy
continuity in the social sectors in a period of considerable threat to social programs. It combines
continuity and flexibility (that a multi-tranche or single operations might not provide). This instrument is
highly suitable for providing adequate flexibility for implementing a series of policy actions over a three
year period. It proved very adequate for dealing with issues and adapting to changes during the second
and third operation. Looking at the evolution of the policy matrix during the three operations, it can be
highlighted that the overall content of the program remained basically the same with improvements that
strengthened critical areas and adjustments that helped to face difficulties that arose during
implementation and some changes in the social and economic climate.

71.       The process for transforming a system of subsidy transfers into a proper CCT is complex
and it needs careful design and planning. The gradual transformation needed by Solidaridad to become
a full-fledged CCT program proved to be more difficult than originally envisaged. The effort needed for
setting up information systems for verifying compliance with co-responsibilities for an ongoing program,
(initially covering 350,000 families and now reaching over 650,000 families), proved to be far beyond
what was originally envisaged. It needed to develop a careful planning process setting up special
coordination effort with the decentralized structures of the two ministries involved. The structure relied
too much on the implementation of new information systems in both ministries (Education and Health)
that took longer than anticipated. In retrospect, a simpler interim system could have been planned from
the outset to start producing result at a much earlier stage.

72.    Implementation of an M&E system, covering a decentralized system of service providers, is
very complex, takes time, and needs a strong managerial leadership. The design and implementation

                                                    24
of information systems for the various elements of the social protection system, which involves a series of
actors and sectors, proved to be more complex than anticipated. Building systems takes time, and their
implementation is likely to be very progressive (even if design is complete upfront). To support such the
construction and implementation of information systems, the combination of the DPL series with
technical assistance (both through a NLTA and through investment operations) was critical. DPLs alone
are likely not sufficient to promote the development of strong systems, at least not in the Dominican
Republic, and a strong technical assistance would have helped further strengthen this aspect. Also, the
DPL series could have focused more strongly on the intermediate steps that are required to build these
systems to ensure the adequate focus on each of these steps. Similarly, the reforms that promoted a shift
in budget management are likely to continue requiring support for years to come, as these changes are
likely to be gradual, requiring significant cultural changes to take place.

73.      Reducing the number of policy actions agreed in each operation was useful to have a more
manageable program. PASS1 included 18 policy actions. These original policy actions had been well
studied based on preparation work done specifically for the DPL program and related ongoing projects
and analytical work. During the first year of implementation and while preparing the second operation, it
became apparent that the program needed to be more selective and better focused on fewer policy actions.
A special effort was needed to revise and adjust the policy actions originally planned for PASS2.
Eventually, the number was reduced considerably and this proved to be a wise decision that allowed a
more focused policy dialogue and supervision effort during the subsequent operations. It should be noted
however that, at times, this reduction posed a threat in the dialogue with key actors who saw the DPL
series as a good opportunity to introduce changes and improvements in their sectors by introducing more
explicit policy actions. In particular, actions that support the development of the systems would have been
useful.

74.      Having a multi-sectoral team was critical to achieving synergies; working across sectors can
reinforce results. The team for the DPL series was built from a multitude of sectors – social protection,
health, education, public sector management, economic management, and social development. Similarly,
on the Government side, the team comprised key members of the social cabinet (and its associated
institutions including the SIUBEN and ADESS), social ministries (health and education), as well as the
ministry of finance and the ministry of the economy. Bringing to the table both sectoral and central
agencies was paramount to some of the structural reforms supported by the PASS program – changes in
the way budgets are prepared (pluri-annual, on basis of results), changes in the way information is
managed (timely disclosure of plans and execution, role of citizens in monitoring services), changes in the
way budgets are allocated (giving priority to specific areas/sectors where analysis shows gaps). Having
the ministries of finance and economy onboard meant that the policy reforms could be supported
(budgeted), providing incentives and rewards to the changes. For the central ministries, working with the
line agencies was also a way to translate their vision, guidance and methodology to practical applications.
The readiness of the social sectors to adopt some of this new results-culture was critical, and is paving the
way for other sectors to also work in this direction.

75.     A real programmatic approach that builds on complementarities with other Bank
simultaneous interventions was highly helpful. It is particularly important to note that the reforms
supported by this operation were based on a broad range of instruments, highlighting the potential
synergies between instruments and across sectors. These instruments combined a multitude of types of
instruments – investment operations, development policies loans, analytical pieces, non-lending technical
assistance, Trust Fund, and partnerships with other donors. This breadth of support was critical in
ensuring the successful implementation of an ambitious set of reforms and in ensuring that the Bank was
able to effectively monitor progress and provide technical assistance as required. The Social Protection
investment operations provided critical support for targeting, identification of potential beneficiaries, and
social accountability mechanisms. The Health Sector Adaptable Program Loan contributed to

                                                     25
improvements on the delivery of basic health services by introducing, among other things, results-based
financing mechanisms. The Early Childhood Education Project contributed to achieve important increases
in access to early childhood education services, and the Youth Development Project helped to enable that
poor and vulnerable youth had a second chance to complete their secondary education. Additionally, a
series of technical assistance activities made important contributions to policy actions in the broader area
of public expenditure management. Overall, the approach chosen by the Bank in the social sectors – truly
a programmatic approach – was essential to leverage the various instruments and jointly achieve results
that went beyond what could have been achieved in isolation.

76.       A combination of an impending crisis, relevant analytical work, and political leadership
provided strong entry points to define an ambitious reform agenda. As a backdrop to the preparation
of this DPL series, the 2009 crisis provided a strong motivation for some of the most ambitious reforms of
the PASS program. In particular, the fear of imminent budgetary contraction and expenditure cuts was
critical in the decision to clearly target programs to those areas that needed it most (e.g. the program to
close gaps in the supply of basic services), to restructure the CCT program to ensure its greater efficiency,
and to keep strengthening the targeting system. But the pressure that the crisis applied to the Government
would not have been sufficient to design these policies, were it not for the availability of strong analytical
work that shaped the policy recommendations. Because the team invested in analyzing gaps and
identifying potential efficiency gains, the team was able to propose a set of evidence-based policy
recommendations. Another critical element for the development of the reform agenda was the high-level
political will to take advantage of the crisis situation to address structural issues. In particular the
leadership of the Vice-Presidency was instrumental to the success of the PASS program. Finally, at the
time of the design of the initial operation, as well as throughout the preparation and supervision of the
following ones, the team had a close dialogue with the IMF, whose encouragements with respect to
strengthening social safety nets in a time of crisis were instrumental to the reforms.

77.      The extra effort demanded by the implementation of a complex DPL program was more
than compensated by achieving a wide range of reforms in a short period of time. It is important to
note that the Social Cabinet showed a strong commitment for substantially improving interaction among
social sector ministries and agencies and with ministries of finance and economic development. The
management team was extremely dedicated to ensure that the policy actions were implemented following
the overall directions established at the outset. In particular, they were effective for generating
improvements related to the reform of the governance and operative system of Solidaridad, a better
articulation with health and education actions, and to the gradual introduction of performance-informed
budgeting, and improvements in transparency and accountability to users. These were impressive reforms
achieved during the three years that took to implement the DPL program of reforms.

Subject: Implementation Completion and Results Report – PASS operations – Dominican Republic
Dear Ms. Coudouel,
We have reviewed with care the Implementation Completion and Results Report for the Performance and
Accountability in the Social Sectors (PASS) operations in the Dominican Republic. Regarding this report,
we are happy to inform you that:
      1.   We validate the content of the report; we understand that it presents the development of the
           operations, the processes that these operations put in motion, and the results that arose from these
           processes with objectivity and wisdom.
      2.   These three operations clearly supported complex management reforms focused on results, which
           successful implementation resulted from intelligent leadership and a very close, at times tense but
           always productive, collaboration between the World Bank and the Government of Dominican
           Republic teams. The frequent and long coordination meetings also strengthened the Government’s
           capacity, which is critical for improved performance in the management of social programs.
      3.   We understand that the good development and results of the operations covered by the
           Implementation Completion and Results Report represent a good reference for potential and future
           operations that the Dominican Government could be interested in implementing to strengthen the
           reform processes in this important sector of public policies.
      4.   We reiterate our gratitude to the World Bank team for the knowledge it brought to the Dominican
           Government counterpart in the development and management of the reform processes.
I take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate our best considerations and send our greetings,
Sincerely,
Ing. Juan Temistocles Montas, Minister
