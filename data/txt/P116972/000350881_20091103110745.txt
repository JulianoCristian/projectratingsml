                         percent (0.25%) of the loan amount payable from the loan proceeds (capitalized).
Operation Type           First operation of a series of three proposed Programmatic Development Policy Loans.
Main Policy Areas        1. Social Protection
                         2. Health (Primary Healthcare) and Education Policy
                         3. Quality and Efficiency of Public Spending
Key Outcome Indicators   1. Enhanced performance of social sectors to promote human capital for the poor
                         (*) By end of 2012, the CCT Program (Solidaridad) verifies timely compliance with co-
                         responsibilities in health, nutrition and education for 90 percent of household beneficiaries.
                         (*) Increased compliance by Regional Health Services to objectives on improving
                         maternal/infant care and vaccination rates at the first level of care.
                         (*) By end of 2012, 80 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied with the overall quality of
                         attention and service by Solidaridad.

                         2. Improved budget management for enhanced performance of the social sectors linked to
                         the CCT Solidaridad. Specifically:
                         (*) The difference between the allocated budget and the actual budget to cover the supply
                         gaps in health, nutrition, and education services within Solidaridad will be less than the
                         difference between the approved overall national budget and the actual budget in relative
                         terms.
                         (*) The difference between the quarterly agreed disbursement schedule (Scheduled Quota) to
                         cover the supply gaps in health, education and nutrition, and the actual funds that are
                         received by the social sectors on a quarterly basis will be reduced.

                         3. Gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social sectors
                         (*) Increase in the number of priority programs in health, nutrition, and education related to
                         Solidaridad (including Solidaridad) that have strategic plans that include multi-year
                         objectives and projections of expenditures, budget structures, goals, and monitoring
                         indicators

                         4. Enhanced transparency and civil society oversight
                         (*) An increase in the number of registered users (100 by end of 2012) and annual hits to the
                         online information search program for the national budget, Consulta Amigable (2,500 by end
                         of 2012).
                         (*) By end of 2012, 70 percent of the community reports produced based on the community
                         scorecards receive follow-up.


                                                        1
                       5. (Overall PASS result): Increased share of extremely poor households who invest in
                      human capital formation, as measured by:
                      (*) An increase in CCT Solidaridad beneficiary households who comply with health and
                      nutrition co-responsibilities.
                      (*) An increase in the share of students from Solidaridad beneficiary households who are
                      enrolled in, attending and completing basic and secondary education, and/or who are
                      enrolled in and attending pre-primary education.
Program Development   The PASS has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of social sectors
Objective(s) and      to promote human capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a
Contribution to CAS   fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program,
                      Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; (ii) to improve
                      budget management to support the performance of these social sectors within the CCT
                      program; (iii) to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social
                      sectors; and (iv) to enhance transparency and accountability to users by strengthening the
                      enabling environment for a better informed demand for improved public sector performance
                      in the social domain.

                      The PASS is consistent with the central pillar of the new CPS which calls for "reducing
                      vulnerability while producing results for all." Specifically, it will help preserve and enhance
                      the human assets of the poor (health and education) by supporting a meaningful shift in
                      social policy from social assistance to the protection and promotion of human capital. It will
                      also enhance accountability both within government agencies, and between government
                      agencies and the public.
Risks and Risk        Economic: The current global financial crisis and economic downturn are expected to
Mitigation            reduce the DR's main exports of services and goods and its remittances. It is also increasing
                      the government's cost of rolling over existing debt and servicing variable-rate debt. These
                      exogenous developments will likely reduce economic growth, strain government finances,
                      and put pressure on the exchange rate, and the risk is that these developments might stall or
                      reverse the reform momentum. Mitigation: While the current economic risks are
                      substantial, mitigating factors include reduced oil and food prices, which should reduce
                      external financing requirements. Declining inflation should help limit the negative impact of
                      slower growth on the poor. The financial resources provided by this loan, and other IFI
                      financing are expected to mitigate the debt-management risk in 2009.The ongoing macro-
                      monitoring and country dialogue will offer a source of advice for the authorities on policies
                      to deal with other potential issues as they may emerge.

                      Risk of possible shift in institutional priorities over time, exacerbated by intersectoral
                      coordination challenges within the Government.
                      Mitigation:
                      -The policy actions were selected on the basis of strong Government ownership and the
                      existence of broad consensus outside the Government, as demonstrated by consultations
                      described in the document (Reform goals with the National Development Strategy and the
                      conclusions of last National Civil Society Summit).
                      -Civil society oversight will be ensured through regular dialogue and information-sharing,
                      and DPL supported actions (Enhanced access to budget information and results of social
                      auditing mechanisms).
                      - PASS supports the formalization and institutionalization of the major committees that will
                      oversee the implementation of the redesigned CCT, including the CCT Intersectoral
                      Committee, bringing together Education and Health Ministries with the CCT Program.
                      -PASS measures to improve budget management reform to support the joint performance of


                                                      2
               social sectors within the CCT will align incentives for social agencies to jointly deliver the
               agreed-upon performance targets for the CCT program.
               - The PASS program is strongly aligned with that of other donors (e.g. IADB, EU).

               Institutional and administrative capacity and financial constraints to implement the
               targeted reforms.
               Mitigation:
               -Technical assistance, grant financing and capacity-building will be provided by the Bank
               (through NLTA and synergies with other Bank operations), IADB, and other donors to
               support the PASS.
               -PASS will support institutional reforms that will strengthen the mechanisms of targeting
               and verification of co-responsibilities, ensuring that payments of transfers will progressively
               be based on certification of responsibilities.
               -CSOs will closely monitor the redesigned CCT program performance. Data will be
               available through the development of an integral system of monitoring and evaluation.
               -A multi-donor committee for the CCT Solidaridad Program will be set up, assess progress
               and address any issues of concern at least on a biannual basis.

               Vulnerability to multiple natural disaster risks--particularly floods and hurricanes.
               Mitigation: Damages to the major private sector enterprises are partly covered by their own
               insurance. There is current World Bank assistance in natural disaster risk mitigation with
               the US$80 million Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Loan. The Dominican
               Government has also expressed interest in negotiating a loan with the IADB to get financial
               help in case of natural disasters. The strengthening of the CCT Solidaridad, Program
               through this loan, can also help to mitigate the impact of disasters on the poorest.

1.       This document describes the proposed program for a Development Policy Loan
(DPL) aimed at improving Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS) in the
Dominican Republic (DR). This operation is being proposed as the first of a series of three
sequential programmatic operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve results in
social sectors (mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in the short term, and
enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the poorest citizens. Consistent with this
vision, the PASS has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of social
sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a
fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program,
Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; (ii) to improve
budget management to support the joint performance of the social sector within the CCT
program, as part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending and support
the required improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services; (iii) to
support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in key social sector agencies; and
(iv) to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors.

2.     The proposed PASS DPL program is integrated into the new CPS, which was approved
by the Board of Directors on September 17th, 2009.

3.      This document is structured as follows: (i) country context (Section II); (ii) Government's
program and operation rationale, discussing the outlook and policy challenges for enhancing the
performance and accountability of social sectors, as well as the participatory processes that
inform these challenges (Section III); (iii) brief description of Bank support to the Government
program targeted by the PASS (Section IV); (iv) the proposed operation, overall approach and
specific areas of policy actions (Section V); and (v) implementation aspects, including poverty,
social and environment aspects, risks and risk mitigation (Section VI). Annex 1 describes the
matrix of policy actions and indicators.


                                  II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

II.1 MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

4.         In the two years prior to the current international crisis, the DR had growth well
above the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) regional average (Table 1)--10.7 percent
in 2006 and 8.5 percent in 2007. For 2008, growth was about 5.3 percent, still above the
regional average of 4.6 percent. Internal and external factors supported this economic expansion.
Internally, the government implemented reforms to enhance fiscal sustainability, including:
rationalization of spending, improvements in revenue collection and debt management,
institutionalization of the budgetary process, and strengthening of the financial system. Fueled by
strong private consumption and investment demand, the manufacturing and service sectors ­
communication, commerce, and tourism ­ grew strongly. External contributing factors included
strong global growth and ample foreign exchange inflows from tourism, remittances, and foreign
direct investment.


                                                4
5.        During 2005-2007, the DR achieved positive results in terms of fiscal balances,
debt and international reserve ratios, and inflation. The primary fiscal surplus reached 1.7
percent of GDP in 2007, up from 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively
(Table 1). This improvement was primarily due to increased revenues, boosted by tax reforms
and better revenue administration, as well as increased exports of nickel in 2007. Nonetheless,
the tax base remained narrow, and public expenditures have been slowly rising as a percentage of
GDP since 2005. Large and poorly targeted subsidy programs (for electricity and liquefied gas)
were among the main causes of increased spending.
6.        For 2008, the overall deficit was 3.2 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit was
estimated at about 1.5 percent of GDP. These deficits were mainly due to increased
spending in the run-up to the May Presidential elections and increased subsidies starting in
early 2008. To avoid the full pass-through of rising international prices to consumers, the
Government introduced subsidies to reduce: (a) domestic prices of food items (bread, milk, rice,
beans, eggs, and poultry); (b) domestic prices of fuel for the transport sector; and (c) labor costs
for the free trade zones producers. These measures had high fiscal costs and undermined
macroeconomic stability. The cost of energy subsidies more than doubled from 1.2 percent of
GDP in 2007 to an estimated 2.7 percent in 2008, primarily as a result of the spike in
international oil prices. Although no precise incidence analyses are available, energy transfers
have been regressive with fewer benefits for and the most vulnerable groups, as wealthier people
use more fuel. About 80 percent of residential consumers receive subsidized tariffs (up to
700kWh/month), and there is no income differentiation in the Programa de Reducción de
Apagones (PRA) subsidy scheme, originally aimed at disadvantaged geographical areas. At 2.7
percent of GDP in 2008, electricity transfers outweigh public health expenditures (1.6 percent of
GDP in 2008) almost two to one.
7.         The public-debt-to-GDP ratio has declined substantially since reaching a high of
47.4 percent in 2004, following the banking crisis. By 2008, it was down to 34 percent,
because of the restructuring in 2005 of sovereign external debt, rapid GDP growth, falling real
interest rates, and real exchange rate appreciation. Better fiscal management played a modest
role only. In addition to a lower debt level, the structure of public debt has improved with
lengthening maturities (especially for the certificates of the Central Bank) and a higher share of
fixed interest rate debt. The government's target for the debt to GDP ratio was to achieve the
target of 25 percent by 2015, but this had to be revised upwards due to the global economic crisis
(see below).
8.         Inflation declined from 51.5 percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2007 and 10.6
percent in 2008. In the aftermath of the 2003 banking crisis, inflation was driven by excess
liquidity following the banking collapse and subsequent bailout, and it was exacerbated by the
depreciation of the peso due to currency substitution. Prudent monetary policy brought a rapid
return to single-digit inflation. External conditions have been more important for recent inflation
rates. Since late 2007, when international price inflation accelerated, prices in the DR increased
more rapidly than the regional average. In January 2007, the DR's inflation was 4.5 percent (year
on year) but, by October 2007 it climbed to over 7 percent, and in August 2008 it peaked at
almost 15 percent. For 2008 as a whole, inflation averaged 10.6 percent.1 Given their expenditure
1
  This high inflation during this period is attributable to the pass-through from international prices and the increase
in domestic food prices was also related to the Tropical Storms Noel and Olga that hit the country at the end of
2007.

                                                            5
patterns, poor people were severely affected by the food-related inflationary pressure in 2008.
Recent estimates2 show inflation reached 16 percent in August 2008 for the CPI calculated for
poor people. This is more than one percentage point higher than the average CPI inflation figure,
but has likely subsided with the decline of world food prices.
9.         Capital markets inflows between 2003 and mid 2008 were sufficient to finance the
current account deficit, even as it expanded recently. International reserve ratios have
improved relative to the period of the banking crisis and the exchange rate has been a
fairly stable since early 2005. The current account deficit widened considerably since 2006
because of the combination of slowing export growth and rising import bills. Real export growth
averaged only around 3 percent between 2003 and 2008, mainly due to declining net exports of
the Free Trade Zones (FTZ). Other exports flows have become more diversified, as non-
traditional products and tourism services have substituted for textiles and other traditional
exports. Imports grew rapidly from 2006 to early 2008, due to booming investment and
consumption demand, along with high international prices. The DR remains heavily dependent
on energy imports: oil imports represented about ten percent of GDP in 2007. Assuming fixed
imported quantities, a decline of US$10 in the average price of a barrel of oil results in savings
of nearly US$480 million in the import bill.3

  Assuming the poor do not receive any compensation for the rising living costs they face and that the proportion of
income spent on food is equal to 48 percent.

  The total amount of barrels of oil and derived products has been of about 48 million for 2007 and a similar amount
for 2008.

10.        After the domestic financial crisis in 2003, foreign direct investment (FDI) made a
robust recovery. Inflows went primarily to tourism, communications, commercial sectors and
real estate. FDI was the most significant component of the capital account in 2008, reaching
US$2.9 billion and covering about three-quarters of the current account deficit. FDI and other
capital inflows compensated for a larger current account deficit, and foreign exchange reserve
levels did not suffer. Strong remittance flows (estimated at around ten percent of GDP in recent
years) have also been an important source of foreign exchange; although they contracted in late
2008 (see below).

the first half of 2009 show growth of 1.4 percent. This growth was supported by the expansion of
agriculture, which rebounded from a weather-related shock and low growth of the previous year,
and by the good performance of non tradable services. However non-tradable production has
reached capacity constraints and, unless the slowdown in investment activity is reversed, may
not sustain growth going forward. Conditional on an improved external environment and on the
successful implementation of a fiscal countercyclical stimulus supported by an IMF program in
the last part of 2009 and the first half of 2010 growth is estimated to be 2.0-3.0 percent for 2010
and to gradually return to its long term potential rate of 5.0-6.0 percent in the medium term,
12.       Inflation is expected to remain subdued in the medium run. Due to the decline in
international prices of oil and other commodities, and in contrast with the inflation spike
observed during the first half of 2008, inflation in the DR is projected to: (a) be 0.9 percent in
2009; (b) rebound to 5.4 percent in 2010; and (c) to gradually reach 3.0 percent in the medium
term. These levels are well within the targets established by the Central Bank.
13.       Domestic and external factors underpin the medium term growth prospects.
Among the domestic factors the macroeconomic policy responses described in more detail
below will play an important role. The prompt loosening of monetary policy ­ since the
beginning of 2009, the policy interest rate has been lowered by 550 basis points to stand
currently at 4 percent ­ helped avoid a more severe contraction of growth. Credit has begun to
expand in the second quarter of 2009 ­ which could facilitate expansion in the construction and
other investment sectors. Going forward, the monetary authorities are expected to maintain an
accommodative stance which will accompany the countercyclical fiscal expansion but, as
conditions may change, they have announced their commitment to contain inflationary pressures
and preserve macro stability. With the support of an IMF program and other IFI financing, fiscal
policy ­ which has been restrictive in the first half of 2009 ­ will be geared towards a
countercyclical stimulus in the last part of 2009 and first half of 2010. In particular, the
government's capital and social expenditures, restricted in the first part of 2009 due to falling
fiscal revenues and limited external financing, will be accelerated. In the medium term, fiscal
consolidation ­ a clear objective supported by the IMF program ­ will aim at a gradual return to
a primary surplus of about 2 percent in 2012 so that, in the medium term, the debt-to-GDP ratio
could return to the 2008 levels.
14.      Improvements in the USA and global economic conditions will support growth
recovery in the DR. The country is highly dependent on external developments given its high

                                                8
trade openness4 and its large imports of food and energy. The DR economy is particularly
sensitive to developments in the USA. The USA is its most important trading partner, its main
source of FDI (accounting for a third of the total), the predominant origin of remittances, and a
major source of tourism revenues. Consequently, the Dominican Republic growth cycle is
strongly correlated to that of the USA. World Bank staff estimate that a 1 percent change in US
growth leads on average to a 0.25 percentage point change in the DR's growth, with a delay of
about three quarters.5

15.       In the short run, the external environment is expected to have mixed effects on the
DR's external balances. During the first part of 2009, declining international commodity prices
have relieved pressure on import costs, but the global economic slowdown and lower demand
from North America and Europe have reduced revenues from exports, remittances, and tourism.
Merchandise exports decreased by about 2.9 percent in 2008. Table 2 shows the monthly
evolution of the external transactions data through the second quarter of 2009. A clear reduction
of international transactions, begun in the fourth quarter of 2008, continued in the first quarter of
2009 and does not show much improvement in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction of
import flows in the first quarter of 2009 shown in the table results from a contraction of
international commodity prices, notably oil, but also from slowing economic activity in the
country.
16.        A recovery in exports and tourism receipts is expected for 2010. In terms of
external balances, these increasing receipts will be partly compensated by larger outlays due to
higher import demand which is related, in turn, to the expected increased levels of domestic
activity (especially investment). Overall these trends are estimated to result in a current account
deficit of around 6.0 percent for 2009-2010. Over the medium term ­ as external condition
improve and exports recover (including new investments in the mining sector) ­ the current
account deficit is projected to narrow to about 4.0-5.0 percent of GDP. The current account
balance is very sensitive to changes in oil prices (see paragraph 9). Notwithstanding increased
inflows of foreign capital in the last few months, lower global growth, tighter international
liquidity conditions, and greater risk aversion of investors are expected to limit private
financing inflows in the near future. However, foreign direct investments in specific sectors
4
  Calculated with data for 2007, trade openness (imports plus exports) was at 87 percent of GDP.
5
  It should be noticed that this ratio of four to one estimated with a VAR model for the DR, is actually lower than the
ratio of one to one reported by Osterholm and Zettelmeyer (2007) in a study based on 6 Latin American countries.

                                                               9
may offset these negative trends. According to official sources, a large investment project in the
mining sector is in the pipeline for 2009 and 2010. The degree of uncertainty around this
investment is limited given that expected 2009 inflows are part of a larger investment plan across
several years. This planned investment amounts to about US$3.6 billion of which US$700
million have been invested in 2008 already.
17.       While the external financing needs for 2009 and future years are substantial, they
are attainable with the assistance of the IMF and other IFIs. In the short run, the situation
remains delicate: international liquidity is scarce and borrowing costs for the DR are high; the
country is vulnerable to external price shocks and fiscal expenditures in excess of what can be
securely financed can create additional pressures. Given the restricted amount of reserves and the
current loose monetary policy (adequate to counter the slowdown of the economy), authorities
are aware of the limits of their current macroeconomic policy stance and are following events
closely. However, in the medium run, improvements in economic activity, fiscal consolidation
and a reduced risk aversion of international investors should translate in increased access to
international financing at lower interest rates.
18.       Monetary and exchange rate policies. During the first months of 2009, the Central
Bank reduced policy rates five times. The policy rate (overnight rate) stands at four percent--
down from 9.5 percent at the end of 2008. Additional measures to increase liquidity in the
economy have included the reduction of the legal reserves for the banks. These changes are
providing some countercyclical stimulus, but the effects of a looser monetary policy come with a
lag. Private credit has just recently (July 2009) shown signs of expansion. Another direct
consequence of the monetary policy stance has been the reduction of market interest rates. Inter-
banking rates decreased from around 15 percent at the end of 2008 to about 7 percent by end of
September 2009. Further reductions may be possible but external conditions may limit the policy
of reducing interest rates, especially given the commitment of the Central Bank to stability of the
peso and to low inflation (see also paragraphs 13-17). The recently recovered macro-stability has
helped maintain confidence in the economy and its currency: sovereign spreads, although still
quite high, have decreased from a peak of about 1800 basis points in December 2008 to 600
basis points in September 2009. Going forward the Central Bank is expected to maintain a
managed floating exchange rate regime. In accordance with the signed Letter of Intent for the
IMF program, international reserves "will be replenished gradually and by end-2010, they are
expected to recover to the level of 2007".
19.        Fiscal policy. The budget for 2009 was initially designed to be consistent with: (a)
slower economic activity causing lower tax revenues; (b) forecasted lower international
commodity prices; (c) forthcoming debt servicing; and (d) limited financing available from
international financial organizations. The underlying quantitative assumptions were as follows
(annual rates for 2009): (a) real GDP growth of 2.5 percent; (b) inflation of 5 to 6 percent; (c) oil
price of US$69.8 per barrel; and (d) USA GDP growth of negative 0.6 percent. Under these
assumptions the overall deficit was projected at 1.7 percent of GDP. However, the situation has
deteriorated and some of these assumptions will not be met. In the first half of 2009, fiscal
revenues have decreased at a faster pace than projected and the electricity sector is projected to
have a larger than budgeted deficit. If the current trends continue for the rest of the year, the gap
in total revenues is estimated to reach about US$ 600 million (see Table 3). On the expenditures
side the downside scenario has a larger deficit of the electricity sector. The government budget
for the electricity sector in 2009 included about US$ 350 million for current expenditures and

                                                 10
US$70 million for investment expenditures, totaling about US$420 million. However, the latest
estimates put the electricity sector deficit in the range of US$550 to 700 million.
20.       In the first part of 2009, lower revenues and the need to finance a higher deficit of
the energy sector have been partially counterbalanced by reductions in expenditures,
notably in goods and services and public investments. This reduction in expenditures has
helped avoid a cash flow problem; however, it has also acted as a pro-cyclical fiscal cut which,
in turn, has further decelerated economic growth. Furthermore, the external financing from
Venezuela through PetroCaribe is likely to have a shortfall of about US$65 million.6
21.       In the medium run, fiscal policy is expected to change from its recent restrictive
stance to become countercyclical in the last months of 2009 and first half of 2010 and will
return, gradually, to a balanced stance during the period 2011-2012. This multi-year fiscal
stance is needed to provide support to the short term recovery of growth and to guarantee fiscal
sustainability and a return to declining debt ratios in the medium run. The financing of this fiscal
policy for 2009 and 2010 is detailed in Table 3 and paragraphs 22-24 and its viability for the
medium term is ensured by the implementation of a series of structural reforms some of which
are supported by the PFSS DPL loan and some other complementary ones supported by the IMF
program.
22.       The re-estimated fiscal deficit projected for 2009 is 3.2 percent of GDP and its
financing has been secured. Given the changes described above and the fiscal expansion
planned for the last part of 2009, the public sector will require about US$2.8 billion in financing
(around 6 percent of GDP), US$700 million above the requirements in the initial budget. Table 3
shows in detail the differences between the initial 2009 budget and the revised one. It also
presents the differences in the composition and size of the financing sources. The government
has devised a multi-frontal strategy to meet its financing requirements. The government's plan
consists of: (a) implementation of all the electricity reforms supported by this loan; the
government estimates to contain the additional electricity sector deficit within US$150 million;
(b) additional multilateral financing including an IADB emergency loan; (c) expansion of
domestic bank loans and domestic bond market; and (d) IMF financing.
23.       Public sector borrowing requirements will remain high in 2010, but adequate
financing has been identified. According to the latest estimates (see Table 3), an important
source will be project financing, closely linked to public investment; additional funding will be
provided by the IFIs, PetroCaribe and from sales of public assets. Borrowing in the domestic
market will also continue. Finally, the government plans to place a bond in international capital
market for US$500-600 million in 2010 when it expects international liquidity conditions to
further improve and DR spreads to decrease.7

  The external financing from Petro Caribe is linked to the oil price level and, with a lower than anticipated (at the
time of the drafting of the 2010 budget) oil price, there may be a decline in the Petro Caribe financing.
7
  Authorities have indicated that they will consider maturity of 5 to 10 years. The current yield for Dominican
sovereign bonds is 10 percent, a substantial improvement from the near 20 percent yield recorded at end of 2008, but
still high.

the Government remains committed to recapitalize the Central bank; however it plans to submit to the Congress a limited set of
amendments to the BCRD Capitalization Law including technical adjustments and the lengthening of the period of
recapitalization from 10 to 15 years. This should allow for a less onerous schedule of transfers, while respecting the spirit of the
original legislation.




                                                                 12
24.       In terms of medium term sustainability (2010-2012) the IMF program supports a
policy of gradual return to balanced fiscal accounts. The speed of adjustment is expected
to depend, among other things, on: (a) future growth; (b) further improvements in the
quality and control of public spending; and (c) implementation of a multi-year budget and
macroeconomic framework. Debt sustainability would not be seriously compromised by the
issuing of US$500-600 billion bonds (roughly 1.2 percent of GDP), as long as public finances go
back to generating a reasonable primary surplus (see paragraph 30). Due to increases in future
interest payments, the further reduction of poorly targeted subsidies would become even more
important. To sustain its social and development program under these circumstances, the
government is taking appropriate steps to improve the quality of public expenditures (see
paragraphs 25 to 27). The adoption of a multi-year formulation of monetary and fiscal policy is
also being pursued as required by the National Development Strategy.
25.       In summary, declining revenues, higher energy sector deficits, and reduction of
financing sources (PetroCaribe) created a risky situation. By requesting the expected IMF
support, the Government seems to have secured sufficient additional financing and
signaled its commitment to macroeconomic stability ­ recognizing that continuing and
accelerating key structural policies is required for long term sustainability. In particular,
controlling and improving the quality of public spending are key tools to limit the damage
(especially to the poor) from the international crisis and to create the conditions for a recovery.
26.        Improving the quality of public spending remains the more substantial challenge.
The following are the four main categories of non-interest spending: Current Transfers (7.1
percent of GDP in 2008), Capital Expenditure (5.0 percent), Wages and Salaries (3.8 percent),
and Goods and Services (2.3 percent). The latter two categories have been stable or declining for
the past few years and are low by international standards. To avoid a potential pro-cyclical fiscal
cut, public investments will be accelerated in the near future.
27.        Transfers are the largest and most volatile part of current expenditure. The largest
transfer is for the electricity sector. It should be noted that: (a) every basis point increase in the
Cost Recovery Index (CRI) translates into US$15 million additional revenues per year; in fact, if
authorities were able to increase 15 basis points in CRI cumulatively during the next three years
­ a reasonable challenge ­ the medium term electricity sector deficit would be reduced by about
US$225 million per year; and (b) other measures to reduce costs in operational and
administrative processes could save an additional US$25 million. Accordingly and if the CRI
continues improving, tariffs keep reflecting changes in input costs, and there is a cost control
plan in place, the medium term deficit could be reduced from the current levels of US$700 ­ 800
million to US$330-430 million by 2013. The second largest current transfer was a subsidy for
liquefied gas from petroleum. This transfer aimed both to benefit the poor, who use LGP for
cooking, and to protect the environment by discouraging the use of wood as fuel. Until October
2008 this was a general subsidy for LGP ­ thus inefficient in helping the poor ­ and its cost
increased considerably in line with the rise of world fuel prices. The government recently
transformed this general subsidy to a targeted subsidy, thus saving fiscal resources (see below
the section on the government program). The third main transfer is a Conditional Cash Transfer
program for low-income households, called Solidaridad (Solidarity). The government has
embarked the overhaul of this program to increase its overall effectiveness (see section III.2).

28.        The fourth main transfer is to the Central Bank for its recapitalization. These
capital transfers8 to the Central Bank do not add to the overall public sector debt, as long as the
Central bank does not use them to expand its outlays. Rather, they shift total public sector
indebtedness from the Central Bank to the central government, as intended. The Central Bank
Recapitalization law of 2006 requires the government to transfer a share of GDP each year to the
Central Bank ­ starting at 0.5 percent in 2007 and rising by 0.1 percent each year until it reaches
1.4 percent of GDP in 2014. The intent is to cover 85 percent of the Central Bank's interest
costs via transfers, while seignorage would cover the rest plus some profit, which would go to
capital. In 2008 the government only transferred only 0.3 percent of GDP to the Central Bank,
under half of the legal target. In the second half of 2008, the Central Bank issued bonds with a
very high yield at 24 percent in order to cover its capital needs.

29.       Debt management represents another challenge. The DR has not developed a strong
reputation with the private credit market. There is not an established market for domestic
government debt. For these reasons, the Central Bank holds most of peso-denominated
government debt and in turn issues interest-bearing liabilities, most of which are held at the
government-owned Reservas Bank, whose deposit base is mostly small depositors. These small
depositors provide most of the domestic financing to the government. This financing is attractive
for its low cost and predictability for roll-over financing, but it does not offer much financial
space for the government to increase its borrowing domestically. As long as the external
financing is concerned, there are very few bonds on the international market and these are
seldom traded. As of September 2009, the external debt faces spreads of 600 basis points, up
from 300 basis points in mid 2008. More recently the DR has obtained loans mostly from
international agencies (WB, IDB, CAF, PetroCaribe) and bilateral aid agencies; however these
sources of funding are limited (see Table 5).

  These transfers are accounted for as interest payments on bonds issued by the government (Ministry of Finance) to
recognize a debt with the Central Bank.

30.        Debt Sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the DR public debt appears to be
on a sustainable path. At about 34 percent at the end of 2008, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio was
not high by regional standards. Nonetheless, the government aims to bring debt back to pre-2003
crisis levels in the medium run. The DSA assumes that the public debt to GDP ratio will not be
reduced in 2009, a year during which the fiscal stance will be counterbalancing, in a measured
manner, the global slowdown. After 2010, however, when global external conditions are
projected to improve, the government would continue reducing the debt ratio by generating
primary surpluses of 1.5 to 2.2 percent of GDP.
31.        In the medium term, the external debt of the overall economy is expected to
decline as a share of GDP, because the current account is assumed to improve as described
above. Financing from international financial organizations and foreign direct investment should
be sufficient to cover the forecasted current account deficit in the next few years.
32.        The domestic financial system is vulnerable to the possibility of further
deterioration in the domestic and/or international environment. The financial sector was
resilient in 2008, in the face of rising interest rates from a restrictive monetary policy. With low
international reserves, a large fiscal deficit and very high peso interest rates, however, the
authorities have little room to dampen the impact of the crisis on the country's productive and
financial sectors.


                                                             15
33.        The banking system's low-cost funding base does not face a significant threat of
sudden deposit withdrawals, because deposits are mostly small and domestic. However, if
the central bank were forced to raise interest rates dramatically in response to an unexpected
deterioration in the balance of payments, the banking system could experience major credit
losses and capital flight that would make its position unsustainable. Although there is no real
policy remedy or Central Bank management decision that could significantly change this
outcome, improving the monitoring and regulation of banks could reduce the likelihood of
financial sector problems and would give the authorities time to prepare and react.
34.       Even though the economy is experiencing a downturn and there are significant
risks to the short-term outlook associated with the difficult global environment, the
macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for Bank development policy lending to
support the implementation of the government program ­ provided that this program is
effectively implemented.


         III. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

35.     Despite recent improvements in this decade, the Dominican Republic still faces
challenges in ensuring access to quality education and health for most of its population,
especially its poorest citizens. This section focuses on human capital for the poor. It first
outlines basic facts and issues and assesses the impact of the current financial crisis (III.1). It
then identifies three of the government's social and public policy reform areas that can enhance
the performance and accountability of key public sector agencies and improve investment in
health, nutrition and education by poor families, while ensuring that public resources are more
effectively and efficiently managed to provide for these entitlements. These policy reform areas
are as follows: first, a shift from the current social assistance model of the CCT Government
flagship program to full-fledged CCTs focused on the promotion of human capital (III.2);
second, the enhancement of the quality, accountability and efficiency of overall public spending,
specifically through the piloting of performance-informed social sector budgeting and
management (III.3); and third, the enhancement of transparency and oversight by creating a
better informed demand for improved public sector performance in the social domain (III.4).
Finally, the section documents the participatory processes that inform the reforms targeted by
this operation (III.5).

III.1 HUMAN CAPITAL, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND POVERTY: KEY FACTS AND ISSUES

36.        Despite almost universal coverage in basic education (94 percent), access to pre-
school and secondary school is limited (31 and 53 percent, respectively) and unequal. The
DR's enrollment performance reflects sustained improvements since the 1990s. There are
almost no differences in net enrollment related to gender or rural-urban disparities (Figure 1).
However, differences persist in net enrollments between richer and poorer children in pre-school
(7 percentage points) and secondary school (6 percentage points) (Table 6). A substantial gap
equal to more than three years of schooling emerges between the poorest and richest families.
More substantial differences are observed both in pre-school and secondary school level data
between the poorest and richest quintiles (World Bank Poverty Assessment, 2006). Also, urban-
rural differences are observed both for pre-school and secondary attendance (Figure 2). While, in

                                                16
both cases the urban-rural gaps displayed are not large, it should be noted that in both cases
children exhibit lower enrollment levels in rural areas, where the poor are disproportionately
located. This pattern of inequality in years of schooling between urban and rural areas, and
across income quintiles was observed in other Latin American countries, as noted by the 2004
World Development Report.

Note:
Pre-school (Initial Education) serves children ages 4-5. Only grade 3 in Initial Education is mandatory.
Basic Education comprises grades 1 through 8, divided in two cycles of 4 grades each (1st cycle: 1st -4th; 2nd cycle: 5th - 8th).
Secondary Education comprises grades 9 - 12, divided in two cycles of 2 grades each (1st cycle: 9th -10th; 2nd cycle: 10th - 11th).

37.       Inequities in attendance and schooling are particularly pervasive for children and
youth of the poorest households. Student and household characteristics such as parental
education achievement or family income have a determinant effect on household decisions to
send and keep children in school (Figure 3). Participation in the labor market is another factor
that takes children out of school, especially among the poorer households. In the DR, an
alarming 26 percent of the children in the lowest quintile work, either inside or outside their
homes. In this scenario, boys are disproportionately and negatively affected. Dominican boys are
more likely to participate in child labor than girls (20.1 and 6.6 percent, respectively), especially
as they age. The increasingly higher opportunity cost of schooling for poor, secondary school-
age boys may explain why they are the least likely to complete secondary school. Households
with mothers with no education showed higher rates of children working, at 20.3 percent,
compared to 6.9 percent among mothers with university education; in addition, 20.4 percent of
the children in the bottom income quintile self-reported as actively working versus 8.4 percent of
the children in the top quintile. Household characteristics, coupled with system inefficiencies
such as chronic repetition, resilient student overage, limited supply of secondary schools, and
low student progression, gradually increase the opportunity cost of schooling and reduce the
probability that disadvantaged students will continue in school (Figure 3).

38.     In addition, there are serious issues in student retention and completion rates.
Factors hindering student progression and completion include repetition, and significant
percentages of overage students (40 percent as early as in 3rd grade), and student drop-outs
(especially among students 12 years of age and older). Additionally, there are severe supply
constraints in upper middle school and lower secondary levels. These issues contribute to low
educational efficiency, which becomes increasingly evident as children age. The 2006 Poverty
Assessment Report shows that by age 9, Dominican children have spent an average of 3.71 years
in school but have only attained an average of 2.17 years of schooling. By age 18, 11.5 years in
school render 8.41 years of schooling, instead of 12.9 With an average excess of 3.5 years spent
in school, the DR is one of the worst performers in Latin America, ranked only above Brazil,
Belize, and Nicaragua.

39.      Primary health services at the first level of care need strengthening. Although data
show no major access barriers to public sector health services, significant obstacles remain at the
first level of care. The number of hospital births is over 95 percent for the poorest quintile and 98
percent for the second-poorest quintile. Yet maternal mortality rates are stubbornly high,
estimated at 150 per 100,000 deliveries for 2007. Countries with comparable or lower levels of
development and health care coverage have better health outcomes. The disparity between high
levels of service coverage and high levels of mortality suggest substantial shortcomings in the
quality of delivery for key primary health services, in particular at the first level of care. Lack of

staffing continuity (particularly physicians), medicines, and other medical inputs are also among
key contributing factors to reduced access to the first level of care by the poor. For instance, 94
percent of women in rural areas have on average more than 4 prenatal visits. However, high-risk
pregnancies are not identified in a timely fashion and lack adequate follow-up. Similarly,
immunization relies more on vaccination campaigns and less on continuous implementation of
mother and child health care protocols at the first level of care. Although important progress has
been achieved in the overall nutrition of the population, preventive nutritional interventions are
yet to reach all of the poor and most vulnerable groups of the population. For instance,
preventive interventions such as ensuring access to micronutrients for mothers and children
remain an important challenge, particularly for the poorest groups.

40.     The below average indicators of human capital are partly a product of scarce public
resources allocated to the crucial social sectors of health and education. Public expenditure
in education amounts to only 2.1 percent of GDP (average for 2004-2006), which is the lowest
share of GDP across the LAC region. Public expenditures in health are also among the lowest in
the region, barely reaching 1.4 percent of GDP (average for 2004-2006). Moreover, fiscal
resources to improve or even maintain recent social gains are expected to be impeded by the
current global recession.

41.    The economic crisis may dramatically increase poverty and unemployment, as
history shows from recent experiences. The last economic recession in DR, between 2003 and
2004, increased unemployment rates by 4 percentage points (from 16 to 20 percent). Among the
most affected groups were youth (unemployment for the 10-19 years-old cohort reached 39
percent in 2004, up from 30 percent in 2002) and women (female unemployment increased from
26 percent to 32 percent between 2002 and 2004). The 2003-4 crises also pushed 1.3 million
people into poverty, which rose by 15 percentage points between 2002 and 2004 (from 28
percent to 43 percent).

42.    Indeed, the crisis is already negatively affecting the creation of formal employment.
The growth rate in the number of social security contributors, a proxy for formal employment,
has been declining dramatically since mid-2008. Some sectors are already experiencing drastic
formal employment declines, notably in mining, but also in manufacturing industries,
construction and hotels and restaurants. These sectors altogether represent 40 percent of private
formal employment in the country.

43.    The fall in fiscal revenues (as discussed in Section II.B) and the limited access to
external financial markets in midst of a global economic crisis could endanger the planned
budget execution, in particular those which correspond to social sectors. During the 2003-
2004 recession, public expenditures in education as a percent of GDP declined by half, from 3.4
percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.7 percent in 2004. Health expenditures also declined substantially,
from 1.9 percent of GDP to 1.2 percent in the same period. Since then, public expenditures in
education and health have not yet been able to recover their pre-crisis shares of income.

44.     A further decline in social public expenditures would halt any efforts to improve
equitable access to quality education and health services. This would undermine the
capacity of the social protection system to serve as a buffer for the poor in this time of
crisis. In addition to the fact that the DR has the lowest public expenditures in LAC, the
Government informed the Bank in May that the level of investment in education has now
declined further to 1.9 percent of GDP. So far, cuts in social assistance seem to have affected
universal benefits such as the school breakfast program. But they could affect the cash transfers,
which reach 463,516 families through the current CCT program Solidaridad, for the remainder
of 2009. It is noteworthy that in the period of April and October 2008, extreme poverty remained
stable at around 11 percent according to the Secretary of Economy, Planning and Development
(SEEPyD), while moderate poverty increased 2.6 percentage points (from 35.2 to 37.8 percent),
possibly owing to the rise in food and fuel prices. SEEPyD attributes the relative stability in
extreme poverty to the buffer effect of the CCT Solidaridad program (the food component
amount of the cash transfer was increased last summer to respond to the increase in food prices).
Cuts in social transfers could therefore contribute to a deterioration of extreme poverty figures
this year.

45.     In this context, there is a large consensus in the DR that three major social policy
challenges are emerging. First, it is urgent to preserve the human capital of the poor in the
short term, especially through the protection of the CCTs, social transfers, education and primary
health care services. Compared to 2003, the DR now has a social protection mechanism to
protect the extreme poor through the CCT program, Solidaridad, which can be used to provide
an income protection floor to maintain consumption levels. This program already covers about
two million people. Second, an adequate supply-side response to the increased demands of new
CCT program beneficiaries requires an expansion of supportive health and education services.
Third, the crisis also presents an opportunity to improve the impact of public services in the
social sectors over the medium term, through social and public sector policy reforms that should

                                                                    23
not be postponed due to the adverse macroeconomic context. These reforms are at the center of
this proposed DPL program and are discussed further in the sections below.

III.2 HUMAN CAPITAL PROMOTION FOR THE POOREST

46.     Compared to the 2003-2004 crisis, the DR is better equipped now with a social
safety net for the protection of its poorest citizens from the effects of a major crisis. First,
the government launched the CCT program Solidaridad (Solidarity) in September 2005, by
combining two existing programs: Comer es Primero (Eating Comes First) and Incentivo a la
Asistencia Escolar (School Attendance Incentive). Second, the country has been moving away
from a traditional clientelistic model of social policy by developing and institutionalizing the
targeting system, Sistema Único de Beneficiarios (Single Beneficiary Selection System or
SIUBEN). SIUBEN takes into account geographic and household variables to specifically
identify and include the extreme poor. SIUBEN started with an initial survey of 1.2 million
households, which was conducted in late 2004 and early 2005. At the time, SIUBEN identified
approximately 700,000 poor households, 112,000 of which were extremely poor. In this context,
the SIUBEN survey corresponded to the Bank's 2005 Poverty Assessment, which calculated the
poverty rate at 34 percent (about 700,000 households).

47.    But there is an emerging consensus within the Government that an overhaul of the
CCT Solidaridad program is needed, to enable the safety net to increase its performance,
enhance the human capital of the poorest citizens and break the intergenerational cycle of
poverty. Specifically:
   · The Government recognizes that the CCT Solidaridad program needs to become truly
   conditional so that it can have a greater impact on the human capital of its beneficiaries.
   Despite its categorization as a Conditional Cash Transfers Program at the time of its creation,
   Solidaridad has de facto operated as an unconditional cash transfers program. There have
   been serious gaps in the verification of beneficiaries' compliance with co-responsibilities, i.e.
   households' required investments in health (e.g. timely vaccinations for children) and
   education (school enrollment and attendance) (See Annex 3). These gaps have been largely
   due to the lack of intersectoral coordination and collaboration (weak involvement of the
   ministries of health and education) for the verification of co-responsibilities and to some
   extent to the hesitancy to verify conditions when the actual supply of inputs and services was
   not available in some parts of the country. For instance, the Program recently started to verify
   compliance with vaccinations but is not yet able to verify their timeliness according to
   national health protocols. In addition, the Program has not verified compliance with weight
   and height controls. The weak intersectoral coordination has also been reflected in the
   absence of co-responsibilities around key elements of human capital among the poorest, such
   as attendance to secondary school (education co-responsibilities were limited to basic
   education while Section III above has shown that most access gaps occur at the pre-primary
   and secondary levels).
   · To meet the standards of other countries with successful CCT programs such as Mexico
   and Colombia, the Government is keen on developing new institutional arrangements,
   ensuring new accountability relationships and incentive alignment between the key agencies
   involved. There is a growing understanding that the delivery of human capital to the poorest
   citizens in the DR should involve shared accountability. Three main levels of shared


                                                24
     accountability are being considered. The first level of accountability is among the three
     agencies of the Social Cabinet involved with the targeting process and identification of
     beneficiaries (using SIUBEN), the actual CCT (Solidaridad), and the payment of transfers
     (the ADESS, or Administrator of Social Subsidies). The second level of accountability is
     among the three social "sectors" or institutions that are critical to the performance of a full-
     fledged CCT program: the CCT program (Solidaridad), overseen by the Social Cabinet, the
     Secretariat of Education and the Secretariat of Health. The third level of accountability is
     between these three social sectors/institutions, and the Planning Ministry (SEEPyD) and the
     Finance Ministry. This will ensure alignment with national development plans (e.g.,
     Estrategia Nacional de Desarrollo) and most importantly ensure available resources to
     sustain the State's commitments associated with the program.
     · The Government also recognizes the need to base the redesigned CCT on a fully
     developed results framework shared by the three social sectors. This results framework
     would be accompanied by a comprehensive system of monitoring and evaluation, including
     baselines, process and impact indicators that will be used to constantly improve the quality of
     the program based on collected data. Unlike advanced CCT programs in the region,
     Solidaridad has not yet developed such a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system.
     For example, no basic baselines are available on the number of Solidaridad students
     attending basic education 80 percent of the time. Now that the Government developed new
     co-responsibilities altogether, both in terms of the type of co-responsibility and target groups
     under consideration, even more baselines are missing (See Annex 3 on new co-
     responsibilities and Annex 2, Introductory Note to Select Monitoring Indicators for the PASS
     DPL).
     · The Government also recognizes that attention to the CCT program beneficiaries and
     overall quality of service should be a higher priority. This is a cross-cutting area that can be
     improved on several fronts. One area relates to the provision of transfers. This is operated
     through a Solidaridad debit card that beneficiaries can use in neighborhood shops called
     colmados, which form part of a network of institutions affiliated to the program called "Red
     de Abasto Social." The Government intends to expand this network as part of a broader plan
     to enhance competition among the affiliated institutions and consequently improve the
     quality, service, prices, and variety of the products offered and eligible for purchase with the
     Solidaridad Card (e.g. school supplies, food, etc.).10 Another area is the de-concentration of
     the program, which is currently very centralized. This process, which is to be financed by a
     forthcoming IADB investment loan, will help improve the speed and quality of service.
     · Finally, the Government has set out to update the SIUBEN beneficiary database to
     reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion, as the last data collection through a major census
     took place in 2004. While households have been incorporated on demand since the 2005
     census, the database is now outdated and some geographic zones of the country have never
     been surveyed. Furthermore, the Government is also discussing the need to clarify the role of
     SIUBEN as the only responsible agency for maintaining and updating the registry of the CCT
     beneficiaries. At present, both SIUBEN and the CCT program currently maintain the list of

  In a 2008 report on Solidaridad, the local Chapter of Transparency International also pointed to the lack of
objective criteria for selecting neighborhood stores (colmados) "Informe Monitoreo Ciudadano al Programa
Solidaridad", Participacion Ciudadana, Capitulo Dominicano de Transparency International, Distrito Nacional,
October 2008, available at www.solidaridad.gov.do.

                                                        25
      eligible beneficiaries (SIUBEN for household heads, and the CCT Solidaridad considering
      all household members).

48.     The Government has already been taking promising steps towards a redesign of the
CCT program. This February, it published a decree that distinguishes the program of
conditional cash transfers from other, non-conditional transfers (e.g., gas subsidies). It also
created an Intersectoral Committee which brings together the Solidaridad program with Health
and Education Ministries. This (still informal) Committee has already started to estimate supply-
side gaps, identify performance indicators linked to sectoral strategies, agreed on the redesigned
program's co-responsibilities and ways to verify compliance. It has also set out to develop a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, which will include the gathering of key
baselines and monitoring indicators. In brief, the Committee has been working on an entirely
new manual of operations that should increase the effectiveness of the program. As described
further in section V, this proposed programmatic DPL will assist the Government in the
consolidation of these efforts and increase pressure for greater transparency, quality of service to
beneficiaries, and performance-based management. Annex 3 summarizes the main elements of
the CCT overhaul in greater detail.

49.     The shift of the social assistance model towards human capital promotion for the
poor raises implications for the priorities of the health and education sectors. Both the
health and education sectors are expected to play a major role in ensuring that a growing demand
for education and health services spurred by the redesigned CCT can be met.

50.    In health, a central objective is the strengthening of the first level of care to enhance
access by the poor to basic health services with improved quality. The Secretariat of Health
(SESPAS) has been working on a plan to strengthen the infrastructure, equipment, human
resources, medicines and other inputs at the first and second levels of care. The National Health
Insurance (SENASA) already has a large number of CCT beneficiaries, but gaps in health
insurance coverage remain. From the total number of Solidaridad beneficiaries (463,516
households), 23.5 percent of the households (represented by the household head) are not covered
by SENASA. Part of this effort is the introduction of new monitoring instruments and the
enforcement of protocols. In this context, there is a strong need to enhance coordination among
public agencies to strengthen the quality of the supply of basic health services ensuring
coordination of poverty reduction interventions to better improve the well-being of the poor.

51.     In education, specific actions to enhance synergies with a redesigned CCT are in-line
with the country's 2007, 10-year strategic plan (Plan Decenal de la Educación). The Plan
outlines ten policy areas addressing equity in access, education quality, and the reorganization of
the education system. Each of these areas requires a sustainable increase in the level and
efficiency of public expenditures on primary and secondary education. Specifically, the
Government has set out to work on four main challenge areas for integrated action between
education and the redesigned CCT Solidaridad program.

52.    First, the Government wants to improve institutional capacity and cross-sectoral
collaboration between the Secretariat of Education and Solidaridad so as to monitor beneficiary
compliance with program co-responsibilities and education outcomes. This objective is well
served by the recent development of a school-based management information system (Sistema de

                                                26
Gestión de Centro Escolar, SGCE) by the Secretariat. The SGCE is an integrated information
management system that will allow the Secretariat to collect, monitor and update student, teacher
and school data at the school-level (see Box 1). The system developers are currently working
with the other agencies in the Social Cabinet to advance interconnectivity between this system,
SIUBEN, and Solidaridad to track administrative, socioeconomic and education performance
data of Solidaridad beneficiaries in the education system.

  Box 1: Improving Coordination between Solidaridad and the Education Secretariat through a New MIS

 The Secretariat of Education (SEE) has made important efforts to develop the Sistema de Información de la
 Secretaría de Estado de Educación (SI-SEE), a nation-wide, Management Information System (MIS) based on
 the development and full implementation of the school-based management information system SGCE (Sistema
 de Gestión de Centro Escolar, SGCE). The SGCE will store information on infrastructure needs, facility
 utilization, student administrative and academic records, human resources management and other school-level
 processes. It will rely on school-level information collected through student and family formats (fichas) that are
 fed directly into the SGCE.

 Once the system is in place, SGCE developers will develop an interface to connect SGCE to the
 SIUBEN/Solidaridad beneficiary registry. Using the beneficiary code (código de beneficiario) included in the
 CCT Program's debit card (tarjeta Solidaridad) as the beneficiary identifier for SEE administrative and
 academic records, SGCE will be able to cross-verify beneficiary compliance with program co-responsibilities
 (e.g. enrollment and attendance of children), as well as their academic performance. In the future, the SGCE
 could also be upgraded to consolidate a geo-referenced system of educational statistics.

 In this context, the SGCE will be used to: (i) keep school administrative records on Solidaridad beneficiaries;
 (ii) monitor beneficiary performance in terms of enrollment, attendance, promotion and completion indicators;
 and (iii) improve targeting of Solidaridad, through the integration and cross-verification of information on the
 student, his/her family and the school he/she goes to. Moreover, the SGCE will inform budget investment
 allocations and regular spending for infrastructure maintenance related to the expansion of school
 infrastructure. This will be instrumental for the Secretariat of Education preparation of its multi-annual public
 investment plan and its efforts to enhance the performance orientation of this plan.

53.    Second, the Government has started to calculate supply gaps in education services and is
dedicated to progressively reduce these gaps through a targeted approach. At a general level,
government estimates on existing and potential demand for education services reveal serious
supply constraints in the system (See Box 2). Data from the SEE shows that 70 percent of the
student population is clustered in 30 percent of the existing public schools. Supply-side
constraints directly affect Solidaridad beneficiaries as all beneficiaries enroll and attend classes
offered in public schools. The Secretariat of Education and the Social Cabinet responsible for
Solidaridad have started to work collaboratively on identifying and estimating key supply-side
gaps that would need to be bridged to respond to the demand of CCT beneficiaries. Supply-gaps
may range from teaching materials, school rehabilitation, classroom construction and/or
conversion.

54.     Investments to ease these supply gaps will demand a sustained increase in both the level
and efficiency of public expenditures on primary and secondary education. Given the scarcity of
public resources, the Government is considering reduction in these supply constraints through a
targeted, step-by-step approach. Three areas of intervention, with significant gains for
disadvantaged groups, are being considered: (i) increasing pre-school access among the poorest

                                                         27
segments of the population; (ii) increasing access to the second cycle of basic education (5th to
8th grades) especially in rural areas; and (iii) expanding access to secondary education,
particularly (9th and 10th grades). The Secretariat of Education would also seek to prioritize
infrastructure investments in schools located in regions with high poverty rates and
concentrations of Solidaridad households, where under-provision and crowding are most
prevalent.
                                   Box 2: Bridging Supply-Side Gaps in Education
The Secretariat of Education has identified three priority areas to reduce supply-side constraints in basic and
secondary education:
 ·        Improve access to pre-school by disadvantaged groups. Pre-school education is known to be strongly
 linked to children's readiness to start first grade, their timely enrollment in the educational system, a lower
 probability of drop-out and repetition, and improved academic performance in the first grades. 2004 ENCOVI data
 shows coverage of pre-school education is still low especially among the poorest, where only 16.1 percent of
 children between 3 and 5 years of age receive any pre-school attention, compared to 75 percent of those in the
 highest decile of income.
·         Expand enrollment for the second cycle of basic education in rural areas. About 44 percent of rural
schools in basic education do not offer more than 4 grades and more than 50 percent of them are multi-grade
(Alvarez, 2004). Increasing physical access in these grades will address demand from students that have successfully
passed across grades, and will ease demand pressure on urban and peri-urban schools currently absorbing students
from neighboring rural areas. Better supply will also contribute to reduce urban/rural disparities on transition rates:
in rural areas, transition from grade 8 to grade 9 shows the largest gap observed where enrollment in the 9th grade is
about 60 percent of that in the 8th grade.
·         Expand access to secondary schools with a view to gradually reduce the number of shifts and
student/teacher ratios. Currently, 95 percent of urban secondary schools run two or more shifts, while 42 percent run
three. The increased availability of evening shifts has encouraged teenagers who had dropped out of school to
reenter in large numbers, often on a part-time basis while they continue working during the day. However, while
having multiple shifts may be an optimal use of scarce infrastructure, this raises serious issues on the quality of
instruction. In addition, class sizes in basic and secondary schools are the highest in Latin America (ECLAC, 2004).
Half of secondary schools have class sizes above thirty-five, and 25 percent have class sizes above seventy (Alvarez,
2004). With such crowding, many students have difficulty learning and are held back. In fact, 9th grade in urban
areas has the highest repetition rate of any grade in the educational system, reaching almost 28 percent in urban
areas (Cabrol, 2002).

55.        Third, the Government is interested in gaining a greater understanding of the potential
impact of a differentiated vs. fixed-amount incentive to support student attendance and grade
promotion among students of different ages. Existing evidence suggests the opportunity costs to
schooling gradually increase as students grow older and transition from lower to upper levels. To
date, the government has used fixed-amount incentives but is interested in assessing the extent to
which a scheme of differentiated education incentives could offset opportunity costs among
Solidaridad beneficiaries. The institutional feasibility of such scheme, which is very common in
advanced CCT programs like Mexico, Colombia or Jamaica, would also need to be assessed.

56.    Finally, the Government recognizes the need to start collecting data on student learning
outcomes and socioeconomic characteristics to assess differences in academic achievement
between disadvantaged and wealthier groups. The National 10-Year Education Plan (Plan
Decenal de Educación 2008-2018) includes the institutionalization of Basic student competences
as one of its key priority actions to reform the national student learning achievement assessment

                                                          28
to be administered in both basic and secondary education. In 1996, 4th grade tests in basic
education were eliminated, leaving the system with no tools to measure student achievements in
the first critical grades of basic education, where delays on educational achievements start to
accumulate. To date, the Secretariat of Education and the National Education Council (Consejo
Nacional de Educación) have already made significant progress in establishing basic competence
standards in reading, writing, mathematics and science for students in Basic and Secondary
education. These standards would serve as the basis for the development of a national student
evaluation system, measuring student learning outcomes at Basic (at 4th and 8th grades) and
Secondary (at 2nd and 4th grades) education levels. Test results at grades 4 and 8 (Basic) and 2
(Secondary) would help monitor student performance before they finish compulsory education.
Results from tests administered at 4th grade (Secondary) would serve as exit examinations.
Systematic results from these newly proposed student-learning outcomes tests (Pruebas
Nacionales) would inform teachers and policymakers about what students are learning and not
learning. In addition this would provide information on how learning is (or is not) changing over
time. Additionally, results from these tests could inform government actions to take corrective
measures at early stages.

57.     The collection of data on student learning outcomes is consistent with the evolving nature
of CCT programs in the region. The first-generation of CCT programs (Solidaridad is currently
first-generation) focus policy actions to increase access to education and to increase the use of
education and health services by poor households. Second-generation programs seek to confront
more complex issues such as the quality of services provided (current approach of Mexico
Oportunidades, for example). In other words, data on education outcomes will serve the need to
confront quality issues, help government to better identify where limited resources should be
targeted to achieve maximum effect, and help prepare the redesigned CCT for its next phase of
challenges.

III.3 IMPROVING EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOCIAL SECTORS

58.    Following the discussion on the Government's social policy shift toward human capital
formation, this section turns to the second reform area targeted by this DPL program: the
enhancement of the quality, accountability and efficiency of overall public spending, specifically
through short-term improvements in the budget process and the institutionalization of a
performance orientation in the social sectors with the gradual introduction of performance
agreements. In light of the financial crisis and the time span required for the introduction of
medium-term instruments such as Performance Agreements (the Dominican key instrument for
performance-informed budgeting), the section points to the need for interim measures to improve
budget management to protect social spending and support desired improvements in the CCT
program and the related supply of education, health and nutrition services.




                                               29
Government Medium-Term Instruments and the Piloting of Performance Agreements

59.     In recent years, the Dominican Republic has redefined its legal and institutional
frameworks for planning, budgeting and public investment.11 The legislation creates new
rules and institutions for planning, budgeting, and public investment including: the National
Development Strategy, the Multi-annual Public Investment Plan and the Multi-annual Fiscal
Budget. The National Development Strategy defines a long-term vision for the country and states
the strategic objectives for public action. The Multi-annual Public Investment Plan selects
programs and projects, according to the objectives of the Development Strategy, which can be
implemented within the subsequent four years. These two elements, the Strategy and the Plan,
are being formulated by the Ministry of Economy after a series of public consultations and the
preparation of a macro fiscal framework that projects the funds that will be available. Finally, the
Ministry of Finance is putting together the Multi-annual Fiscal Budget which will provide
detailed estimates of fiscal revenue, expenditures, (including the Investment Plan) and financing.
These medium-term instruments are designed to improve the quality of both planning and budget
execution by providing greater transparency, certainty and predictability in government policies
and the allocation of resources for investment and service delivery.12

60.     Another important innovation is the development of Performance Agreements to
encourage a performance orientation in budget management and accountability. These
Performance Agreements ("Contratos por Resultados y Desempeño") are intended to provide a
flexible managerial link between the budget resources provided and the desired improvements in
the social sector's performance. As stated in the 2006 Budget Act, these agreements are to be
signed between the Secretary of Finance (SEH), the Secretary of Economy, Planning and
Development (SEEPyD), the Secretary of Public Administration (SEAP), and implementing
agencies. The process for the development and implementation of the Performance Agreements
is summarized in the following table13. These agreements will include commitments regarding
the following:
      (i) Compliance with policies, goals and objectives verifiable by performance indicators, by
      the highest executive authority of the agency and the Secretaries of State concerned;
      (ii) Greater management flexibility--for that executing agency--on the application of rules
      regarding execution of the budget, human resources and procurement; and
      (iii) Budgetary incentives to agencies and/or cash incentives to officials and employees
      during the duration of the agreement.

11
   Legislation approved in recent years includes: 2006 Budget Act (Ley 423-06 Orgánica de Presupuesto para el
Sector Público), 2006 Planning Law (Ley 498-06 del Sistema Nacional de Planificación). The creation of the
Secretary of Economy, Planning and Development (Ley No. 496-06) and the Secretary of Finance (Ley No. 494-06)
is designed to produce an orderly and transparent budget process.
12
   According to the new legislation, SEEPyD is expected to submit the Strategy to the Dominican Congress by the
end of June 2009; and the Multi-Annual Public Investment Plan and the Multi-Annual Public Sector Budget are to
be submitted to the Government Council for approval during the last quarter of year 2009. However, the authorities
noted that the global economic crisis had significantly increased the level of uncertainty and complexity in
formulating credible medium-term projections, which may delay implementation.

                                        · Evaluation and identification of lessons learned for
      Phase VI. Evaluation
                                        improving future Performance Agreements.

61.     The Ministers of Education and Health have committed to this process, which builds
on their efforts to improve the quality of public expenditure management in these sectors.
In October 2008, the Secretaries of Education, Health, Agriculture, and Labor initiated the
process with the signing of "Acta Acuerdo" (Phase I). The diagnostic of basic conditions for the
implementation of Performance Agreements (Phase II) is currently being finalized. The
diagnostics examine the preparedness and capacity needs in relation to the following public
management areas: (i) strategic and operational planning; (ii) budget process, including planning;
(iii) administrative systems; and (iv) monitoring information systems.

62.     However, critical challenges need to be addressed for the introduction of
Performance Agreements in the social sectors. In the case of the education sector, the main
challenge will be to strengthen the information management system in order to develop
performance indicators and monitor compliance. In the health sector, the monitoring and
evaluation systems are quite strong and the sector is already developing internal "management
agreements" to be signed by the Secretariat of Health and Regional Health Services. This is part
of the decentralization process and transfer of responsibilities from the center to the local level
and will include commitments to achieve certain performance standards. The main challenge in
this sector will be to align the Performance Agreements to the restructuring process that the

                                                    31
sector is undertaking. Furthermore, there is a need to develop instruments that strengthen
accountability for results within the new sector framework and include the National Health
Insurance. Although there has not been any "formal" attempt to develop Performance
Agreements in the Social Cabinet and CCT Program (Solidaridad), the program has all the
elements in place for a contractual relationship among the parties involved: performance
indicators, information about the supply gaps required to meet the performance targets that are
being used for budget discussions, and institutional arrangements have been established to
monitor compliance. The overall approach of the proposed PASS (Section V) tries to formalize
this contractual relationship, in line with the Government's reform program.

63.      Thus, support will be needed to overcome the challenges at the sector level, to assist
SEEPyD to tailor the Performance Agreements to each sector/program and to help the
central budget agencies to manage the complex reforms. Based on the diagnostics,
institutional strengthening plans will be prepared to assist the Secretary of Health and Education
to improve planning and management systems for the implementation of performance contracts.
In addition, the diagnostics will shed light on priority programs that are better suited for
implementing Performance Agreements at this stage. Support will also be required to assist
SEEPyD to select priority programs and design the agreements, and for the sectors in order to
build the institutional capacity identified in the plans. In addition, other technical challenges at
the central level need to be addressed in order to move toward the signing of Performance
Agreements. Among the most important challenges are to: (i) review the structure of the budget
and move toward a program structure; (ii) revise the budget process to allow for the gradual
delegation of authority and control to enable program managers to better manage their resources
to achieve stated performance objectives; and (iii) align the Performance Contracts with the
multi-annual planning instruments, while adopting a medium-term expenditure framework that
provides the budget envelope for the Performance Agreements. Non-lending technical assistance
will be provided to assist the country to address some of these gaps as part of the PASS
"package."

The Need for Short-term, Interim Measures

64.     The reform process discussed above will take some time so there is a pressing need
to protect social spending while continuing to support the strengthening of planning and
budgeting processes and the development of a performance-orientated budget. As
highlighted above, previous economic downturns have resulted in harmful reductions in social
sector spending and social outcomes. Typically, budget cuts affect critical inputs for education
services such as didactic materials, and health services such as medicines and micronutrients.
The government may also find it even more difficult to address ongoing supply shortages at the
secondary level. The Government could also feel forced to stop financing health insurance
premiums for the poor (subsidized regime managed by the National Health Insurance SENASA).

65.     These past harmful reductions in social sector spending have partly resulted from
the failure to adequately prioritize and plan social sector spending, due to the weak budget
processes (including financial management systems and lack of planning systems) and the lack
of a clear focus (and accountability) on results. A particular case in point is the CCT Solidaridad
program. The Dominican Government neither developed an integrated framework of
performance targets in health and education nor ensured proper budget arrangements to

                                                32
effectively prioritize budget allocations to the health and education services to ensure that such
funds are disbursed in a timely fashion to cover identified gaps in provision.

66.     While the medium-term reforms described above should help to address these
problems, the reform process will take some time. In the interim, and prior to the introduction
of the Performance Agreements, to bolster social services, the Government is planning to take
the following actions:
        (i)     The development of basic management agreements that set out the key
        performance targets, activities and responsibilities of the main public agencies involved
        in delivering social services and building human capacity. These agreements would be
        between the Secretary of Economy, Planning and Development (SEEPyD), Secretary of
        Finance (SEH), and the Secretary of Public Administration (SEAP) with each sector
        agency and the Social Cabinet. (See management agreements as proposed approach of
        the DPL, Section V).
        (ii)    As an interim measure, and as set out in the management agreements, the
        Government will also develop new budget procedures that effectively prioritize budget
        allocation to the health, education and nutrition services, to ensure that such funds are
        disbursed in a timely fashion to cover the identified gaps in provision. These are
        discussed in Section V and as part of second row of the Policy Action Matrix in Annex 1.
        The management agreements will therefore provide a flexible managerial link between
        the budget resources provided and the desired improvements in the social sector's
        performance.

III.4 TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT IN SOCIAL SECTORS

67.    This section addresses the third area of reform targeted by the DPL program, the
enhancement of transparency and oversight by enabling the creation of a more informed
demand for improved public sector performance in the social domain. In recent years, the
Government has taken steps to improve transparency and civil society oversight in social sectors.
This section summarizes advances and limitations at two levels: (i) overall transparency of the
public budget, with additional insights on the public information law; and (ii) social service
delivery, with a focus on the CCT program, health and education services.

National Public Budget Transparency

68.     Several advances indicate increasing public access to budget information. The new
public finance management framework that emerged in 2006-200714 created the basic conditions
for guaranteeing a transparent and accountable public budget process. Specifically:
        ·       The new legislation explicitly recognizes the objective of increasing budget
        transparency and ensuring public access to budget-related information. The State
        Integrated Financial Management System Law (5-07) mandates that all systems maintain
        a "methodological and conceptual unity in regards to registries, processing and
        presentation of financial information." The law also states that the overall system must
14
  Among others with the passing of the new Budget Law (423-06), the Public Planning and Investment Law (498-
06) and the Integrated Financial Management System Law (5-07).

                                                     33
         comply with the objective of "improving transparency of public accounts and its
         dissemination" (Article 5 h).
         ·       In order to facilitate compliance with this mandate above, the Financial
         Management Information System (SIGEF) has been established. 15
         ·       The Public Planning and Investment Law (498-06) recognizes the principle of
         "citizen participation" and mandates the creation of specific procedures that guarantee
         this participation during the processes of planning. This law also creates several public
         planning committees at the regional and municipal level which must include the
         participation of relevant local organizations, including non-governmental organizations.

69.     In addition, the country passed a Free Access to Public Information Law in 2004,
recognizing citizens' rights to request and receive complete, accurate, adequate and timely
information from the state. This law mandates the state to proactively publish information
concerning all of its acts and activities, through an "updated and permanent information service"
that includes the duty to publish a list of items therein specified (Article 3). The first item refers
to "budgets and calculations of resources and approved expenditures, their evolution and
execution status."16 The law also requires all public agencies, including centralized and
decentralized, the National District and the municipalities to be included in the internet
communication system (Article 5). In the past two years, and with the support of the Bank, the
Secretariat of Health was the first of the line ministries in implementing this new policy and
setting up the office of Free Access to Public Information at the Ministry.

70.     Despite these advances, the 2008 Open Budget Index placed the Dominican
Republic amongst the lowest performing countries in the world, scoring 11 out of 100
points, regarding the public availability of budget information.17 The Government has made
progress by making available an increasing amount of disclosed information related to budget
execution. Recent improvements can be observed since the implementation of the last Open
Budget Survey in September 2007.18 The Directorates for General Customs and General Taxes
now also publish more detailed information on revenue collections.19 Even with this progress, a
series of limitations and implementation gaps constrain the potential for increasing public access
to budget information in the DR:

         ·      The creation of a publicly available financial information system is not complete.
         Currently, the Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) is only available to
         authorized users. External users may only access documents that are in pdf or excel

15
   Law 5-07, Title II, Article 9 f). This information system is required to function as a "modular automated tool", in
accordance with several principles, among which is that of "transparency" whereby the system "offers information
about the government's financial management in a clear, uniform and public manner..."

         format and most of the information is aggregated and unclear. For the general public, this
         makes the data difficult to access and understand.
         ·       Compliance with the Free Access to Public Information Law has improved, albeit
         with limitations in terms of publication of timely and comprehensive budget information.
         A quick review of central level line ministries in the economic and social sectors
         indicates a high level of compliance with the publicity and duty to publish legal
         mandates, but with shortcomings in the availability of budget execution information,
         including outdated, aggregated data and non-user friendly presentation of the
         information.20
         ·       Overall, the budget formulation process is developed in a closed manner,
         therefore making access difficult for the general public and the media, but also
         importantly for Congress. First, although the budget law mandates the President to
         submit a budget proposal to Congress during the second legislature (August 16th ­
         November 13th), in practice, it usually arrives in December, leaving Congress with little
         time to review it by year end. In 2005, 2006, and 2007 the budget was approved later than
         the December 31st deadline, as required by law.21 Second, although the President issues a
         pre-budget statement, published in the Official Gazette, this document is only generated
         for internal purposes.22 Finally, although audit reports are publicly available, follow-up
         reports by the Executive and the Legislative branches as regards the implementation of
         audit recommendations are not available.23

Increasing Transparency and Accountability in Social Service Delivery through Participation

71.     As outlined above, social services often fall short of citizens' needs in the DR, especially
for the poorest citizens. Reasons for service delivery failure are complex and wide-ranging,
including fiscal and policy constraints. Nevertheless, there is worldwide research that meaningful
and effective civic inputs around service delivery can contribute to improved performance by
service providers.24 This section reviews the Government's program and its achievements as well

20
   Currently there is no permanent mechanism in place for monitoring mandated institutions' compliance with the
Free Access to Public Information Law. Part of the reason is the absence of an "órgano rector" or autonomous
oversight entity for ensuring effective compliance. In practice, the National Commission for State Reform
(CONARE) has taken on this function. According to CONARE's 2004-2008 Management Report, the Commission
has overseen the implementation of several actions aimed at implementing the ATI Law, including setting up 23
ATI offices in state agencies, developing a training program for public officials, installing a web-based network for
linking access to information officers, and elaborating a draft law that was submitted to Congress for the creation of
an "órgano rector". See CONARE, "Informe de Gestión 2004-2008", Santo Domingo, August 2008.

   DR Questionnaire, OBS, op. cit. The Executive practice of late presentation of the budget proposal has also been
considered for reform in the policy proposals matrix elaborated at the National Summit convened by the Fernandez
Administration, see Mesa de Consolidación Institucional, Informe de Relatoría, 19 de Febrero de 2009.
22
   According to article 30 of the Budget Law, the Executive must release the rules for the preparation of preliminary
proposals of institutional budgets on July 15th, and the Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank,
must submit the macroeconomic projections to the National Development Council by March 15th (public planning
and investment law). None of this information is made publicly available during the legislative stage. Public
hearings are not held as a common practice of consultation with external interest groups. Meetings between
legislators and civil society organizations are held on an ad hoc basis in some cases.

as the challenges it faces. It focuses on the scope of this DPL, namely the CCT Solidaridad
program and the related supply of health (primary health care) and education services (mainly
basic and secondary education).

72.      The country has made significant progress in building an enabling environment for
civic voice and participation in social sectors in recent years, both at policy and service
delivery levels. At a policy level, the previous Fernandez administration opened and
institutionalized spaces for civil society participation in social policy-making and monitoring
through the creation of the Civil Society Consultative Council (Consejo Consultivo de la
Sociedad Civil, CCSC) in 2001 and its subsequent integration into the Social Cabinet in 2004.25
According to Presidential decree, the Civil Society Council aims at advising the Social Cabinet
on the definition, formulation, execution and monitoring of social programs in the DR.26 The
Social Cabinet is responsible for the coordination of social policies across sectors. The Council is
made up of 32 civil society organizations (CSOs), including networks and umbrella
organizations that represent diverse sectors (religious, academic, NGOs, health, etc.) The overall
executive coordination and seven-member Executive Committee (EC) are renewed every two
years, as per Council decision.27 Notwithstanding its institutionalized character, observers tend to
agree that the Council has effectively functioned as an independent body. At present, it is
coordinated by Montalvo Center, a qualified and respected voice in social policy in the country.

73.     At local, service-delivery level, the Government has created instances for formal
public participation in health, education, and under the CCT program, Solidaridad. In
health, the reform and decentralization approach have fostered public participation, including
civic engagement in monitoring activities through Local Health Committees and in the
monitoring of local health expenditures at the Primary Attention Units (Unidades de Atención
Primaria, UNAPs).28 In education, the Government has worked on the strengthening of parent-
teacher associations (Asociación de Padres, Madres y Amigos de la Escuela, APMAEs). Using a
participatory planning process, the Government elaborated a new 2008-2012 Participation
Strategy, which builds on the Education Law and the Education Decennial Plan. This strategy is
currently being implemented. Key actions include: transparent election of APMAEs, open
forums for identifying quality, management and resource problems at the local level, training of
APMAEs for improved budget management,29 and development of complaint-handling

   The Consultative Council was created in 2001 and effectively integrated into the Social Cabinet in 2004.

   Presidential Decree 1251-04. The CCSC Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 1 states that the Council is "a civil society body,
ratified by Decree 1251/04 with the mission of contributing to the Social Policy Cabinet in the definition and
formulation of social policies implemented throughout the national territory, as well as assessing and monitoring
plans and programs for implementation."
27
   The Executive Committee meets every two weeks, and participates in the meetings organized by the GCPS, as
well as by the Director of Solidaridad.

   Education District Organizations or Juntas also benefit from such training. These organizations are the main
coordination instance for the education sector at the district level. Regulated by Ordinance 02-2008, there are 106
District Juntas in the DR. They include the District Director, Public and Private schools' directors, APMAEs,
teachers' representatives, students, churches, productive sector, Municipal "chapters," cultural institutions.

mechanisms.30 Finally, the Government recently created a "social network" (Red Social) of
community-based organizations in order to enhance community participation in the program. At
present, the Social Network covers a wide range of location organizations (3,500 in total), such
as mothers' associations, small producers, religious organizations, parent-teacher associations
and neighborhood associations, among others. The Social Network has a twofold mandate. First,
it monitors the CCT program implementation, principally by receiving and channeling claims
about the network of institutions affiliated to the program (commercial providers), targeting
errors, and monitoring behaviors of field officials. Second, it seeks to improve communication
between the program and its beneficiaries. The members of Social Network work as community
focal points and are unpaid volunteers.

74.    Other notable advances include an increased disclosure of program/sectoral
information and the existence of a functioning complaint system for the CCT program.
Evidence suggests that the Solidaridad CCT has achieved considerable progress in complying
with the Access to Information Law. The Social Cabinet's Solidaridad program maintains an
updated website with extensive information about the program's management, including a search
engine for locating beneficiaries by name, ID and district, for locating stores where the
Solidaridad debit card may be used, and for locating gas providers.

75.     These advances provide real opportunities for enhanced civil society oversight in
social sectors. However, improvements are needed if the social auditing mechanisms are to
be more inclusive of the poorest citizens and effective in strengthening accountability in
social service delivery. A 2008 evaluation report of Solidaridad by the local chapter of
Transparency International, Participación Ciudadana, found that community participation is still
weak at the local level, although it acknowledged that the Social Network plays a role in
supporting outreach activities to beneficiaries. The report recommended strengthening
community participation beyond this support role to include participation in regional program
planning, monitoring and evaluation of the program's activities and outcomes. The report also
stressed the lack of a "social auditing" mechanism, which is addressed below.31

76.    Overall, improvements are needed to increase the inclusiveness and effectiveness of
participation mechanisms within Solidaridad. First, in order to improve inclusiveness, the
Government should verify the extent to which the voice of the poorest families is adequately
represented in current participation vehicles. In the education field, for example, experience from
the region has shown a relatively weak participation of poor families in parent-teacher
associations. Looking at the CCT reform, the Government has started stimulating participation of
the very beneficiary families by supporting their organization in nuclei, as successfully done in
other countries such as Mexico and Colombia ("Familias en Acción").

77.    A major challenge to the effectiveness of Solidaridad's participation strategy is
enhancing the receptivity of decision-makers and service providers to the voice of CCT
beneficiaries who are also users of health and education services. Individual complaints and

active participation of community organizations should be complemented by mechanisms that
would allow for systematic and quantified feedback from users to be gathered, and for the
creation of an adequate feedback loop to follow-up and act upon this feedback. Subject to Bank
technical assistance, the social sector agencies (Social Cabinet, Education and Health Ministries)
have expressed their willingness to strengthen the social auditing process along these lines and
develop a system of community scorecards for improving the service delivery and accountability
chain. Current discussions with the Government involve filling out scorecards by the nuclei of
CCT beneficiary families. In the short term, these community scorecards would mainly focus on
the scoring of the presence of inputs: for example, CCT transfers paid on time, teachers present
in school and the availability of basic health inputs, including medicine. This focus could be
powerful in the current crisis as the first budget cuts tend to include inputs in health/education
sectors as the Government prioritizes teacher and health personnel salaries. Analytical work to be
conducted during the first year of the DPL will help assess the political and institutional
feasibility of increasing the scope of the community scorecards so as to include performance
assessments of service providers.

78.     Other challenges include the need for social sector agencies to further enhance the
disclosure of key information and ensure an integrated complaint system for the redesigned
CCT. The Solidaridad website does not yet publish a complete, easy to access list of
beneficiaries. Such publication has proved very effective in countries like Mexico to prevent
risks of political clientelism and abuse. Finally, although a complaint system currently exists for
the CCT program, it does not allow complaints related to education and health services to be
handled. The CCT reform demands a full alignment with the supply of health and education
services lined to co-responsibilities. This issue should therefore be solved.

III.5 PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

79.     The reforms targeted by the PASS address the main concerns expressed by civil
society organizations in the context of both Government- and Bank-led consultations, as
summarized below. As described in Section VI, the PASS itself will promote reforms that foster
citizens' participation in and oversight on social programs.

Government-led participatory processes

80.    The most recent and relevant participatory process is the National Summit that was
conducted in December 2008. This Summit included a wide-range of Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs), including political parties, grassroots organizations, unions, NGOs,
small producer associations, private sector representatives, think tanks and universities. At the
Summit, 32 social policy proposals were agreed upon:

·       Among sectors, education and health received the most attention. All organizations
participating in the National Development consultation presented at least one education-related
proposal. The main concerns centered on the level and quality of public spending in social
sectors, with a special emphasis on the need to avoid a cyclical public expenditure approach.
Proposals also centered on strengthening supply-side health and education interventions for the



                                                38
CCT, increasing the community participation in the program and improving its mechanisms of
targeting and accountability.
·       Participants also put forward several proposals for increasing transparency and
accountability of the budget process. Institutional strengthening and transparency were cross-
cutting issues that emerged as central concerns in all the roundtables, as indicated by the final
Rapporteur's summary. Particularly, think tanks stressed the need for easier access to budget
information, so as to enhance independent budgetary analysis and monitoring.

81.     The advisory work by the Civil Society Advisory Council is aligned with the PASS.
(See description in Section III.4). The Council has demanded the protection of social
expenditures and called for an increase in their funding. Through the release of periodic
analytical reports and letters addressed to the President and to Parliament, the Council has
focused on the low levels of public spending in the social sectors. The council argues that this
"social investment paralysis" endangers the sustainability of public policies underway. These
policies include the decennial plans in health and education, the implementation of the social
security law and its regimes, and the expansion of the "seguro familiar de salud" ("family health
insurance").32

Bank- managed processes: New CPS consultations

82.     The consultations for the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) took place in four regions,
involving grassroots organizations, small producer associations, think tanks, unions and NGOs.
In the social policy area, participants made recommendations that are similar to those discussed
in the National Summit.

83.     The PASS Bank team also initiated informal technical consultations with experts from
CSOs and academia in the social policy field. Once again, these organizations reiterated the need
to protect and increase critical social spending, particularly in times of financial crisis. Critical to
the success of large policy-lending loans, they argued, is an enabling environment to support
both the supply and the demand for easy-to-understand budgetary information.


                  IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

IV.1 LINK TO THE CPS

84.     The PASS is consistent with the new CPS. The CPS calls for "reducing vulnerability
while producing results for all." The PASS will help preserve and enhance the human assets of
the poor (health, education) by supporting a meaningful shift in social policy from social
assistance to the protection and promotion of human capital. It will enhance accountability both
within government agencies, and between government agencies and the public.

85.     Specifically, the reforms targeted by the PASS are in line with the following pillars:
32
 "The Civil Society Advisory Council for the Social Policy Cabinet calls the attention of the Government to the
"paralysis in social investment". http://www.centrojuanmontalvo.org.do/spip/spip.php?article627 (accessed May
25th, 2009).

                                                        39
       ·       The reform of the safety net framework is in line with the pillar on Social
       Cohesion and Services, which calls for producing better results in education, health and
       social protection. The CPS points out the need to (i)"maintain or increase social
       expenditures targeted to poor and vulnerable households so as to mitigate the negative
       impacts of the food and financial crisis"; and (ii) "improve impact, coverage, targeting
       efficiency, and transparency of social safety net programs, especially the CCT program
       Solidaridad".
       ·       The pillar on the Quality of Public Expenditures and Institutional Development
       will benefit from the contributions of the PASS through: (i) measures to improve budget
       management to support the joint performance of social sectors in delivering the CCT
       performance targets; and (ii) its overall approach to performance orientation. The latter
       involves the introduction of basic management agreements in the short term and the
       support to a gradual movement toward a performance-informed budgeting framework in
       the medium-term, with the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements (See Section
       III.3 and V). Management agreements will start to establish an overarching framework
       that focuses public policy, budget and management issues around performance. These
       basic management agreements will include the key policy actions and intermediate
       outcomes that are contained in the PASS matrix. The agreements will be between the
       SEEPyD, SEH, and SEAP with each sector agency and the Social Cabinet. A gradual
       movement toward a performance-informed budgeting framework will support better
       decision making, transparency and accountability for public spending, highlighting the
       need for more resources and better programs to achieve critical results in the social
       sectors.
       ·       Finally, the pillar on Capacity-building of Non-traditional Actors (including civil
       society) will benefit from a better informed demand for improved public sector
       performance in the social domain.

IV.2 COLLABORATION WITH IMF

86.        The DR benefited from strong support by the IMF during its Stand-By
Arrangement over the period 2005-2008. Under this arrangement, the IMF provided financing
of US$695.1 million. The final review of the Stand-By Agreement stated that the DR authorities
managed a strong recovery after the 2003 crisis. In addition the statement added that prudent
macroeconomic policies in a favorable external environment have restored confidence and
delivered strong macroeconomic performance, with rapid GDP growth and single-digit inflation.
Monetary policy has been skillfully managed and structural reforms have strengthened the policy
framework. During the arrangement, DR authorities have strengthened fiscal and financial sector
institutions,   improving      monetary        policy     management        and    communication.
A comprehensive strategy to recapitalize the central bank has been developed, aimed at gradually
reducing the bank's quasi-fiscal deficit. It should also be noted that the IMF board approved five
waivers of nonobservance of performance criteria: (a) the non-financial public sector overall
surplus; (b) the accumulation of external arrears; (c) the consolidated public-sector primary
surplus for 2008; (d) congressional approval of monetary and financial law amendments; and (e)
implementation of the treasury single account.



                                               40
87.       On October 6, 2009, the DR government requested, via a Letter of Intent (LOI)
accompanied by a Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), a new 28-
month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) through February 2012 in an amount equivalent to
SDR 1,095 million or 500 percent of quota (about US$1,700 million). This new IMF program
is expected to be approved by the IMF board by the end of October or beginning of November.
According to the LOI the main objective of the program is to "boost economic recovery in an
environment of macroeconomic stability and strengthen [DR's] growth prospects by conducting
a counter-cyclical policy in the short-run, while achieving sustainability over the medium-term".
The MEFP describes in detail the medium-term macro-framework for 2009-12, the
macroeconomic policies and the main components of the structural reform agenda that will be
supported by the IMF SBA.
88.       Fiscal policy is expected to be counter-cyclical for the rest of 2009 and first half of
2010 with an acceleration of expenditures, in particular for capital and social spending.
This should provide a fiscal impulse of about 0.9 percent of GDP for 2009 compared to the fiscal
stance of 2008. A gradual consolidation of the fiscal position will begin in mid 2010 which
should bring the consolidated primary fiscal balance to zero. This consolidation is initially
supported by improvements in tax administration and recovery of tax revenues due to higher
growth. Going forward, increasing revenues from a series of proposed structural reforms and
moderate restraint on expenditures (especially through a reduction of the electricity sector
deficit) will bring a gradual increase in the primary surplus with medium-term positive effects on
debt dynamics.
89.        Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative in the short run to
maximize the positive effects of the fiscal stimulus. As economic growth returns, the Central
Bank will revise its monetary and exchange rate policies to respond to new developments with
the aim to control inflationary pressure and preserve macroeconomic stability. International
reserves will be progressively increased and, by end of 2010, are expected to reach their peak
pre-crisis levels. Other monetary and financial sector reforms include: (a) Technical adjustments
to the recapitalization of the Central Bank; (b) improvements in banking supervision, as
recommended in the recent update to the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP); and (c)
implementation of an inflation targeting framework.
90.        Additional Structural Policies include: (a) Institutional reforms aimed at consolidating
public finance management; (b) adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework; (c) reforms
in the electricity sector; (d) development of a strategy to strengthen public debt management and
to improve the local debt markets (the final objective is to improve the government's
creditworthiness and the credit rating of its sovereign bonds so that financing costs for the DR
are lowered); and (e) increase social spending through expansions of the social safety net
(conditional cash transfers, health and education).
91.       In part due to a successful coordination between the WB and IMF teams, there
are significant synergies between the policies supported by the IMF SBA and those
supported by this PASS program and the other WB DPL, the Public Finance and Social
Sector (PFSS) loan. In terms of tax administration both the IMF and WB promote the
rationalization of tax administration (mainly through a higher level of integration between the
two tax collection institutions) and tax exemptions. On fiscal expenditures, the IMF program
reinforces the same reforms supported by the PFSS and the PASS DPLs, namely an


                                                41
improvement in budgetary procedure and expenditure controls, a reduction in the electricity
sector deficit, an increase in social spending and its better focalization towards the poor.

IV.3 COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

92.     The PASS will be well aligned with donor coordination efforts that are taking place
in the Dominican Republic. For this specific program, both the European Union (EU) and the
International Development Agency of Spain (AECI) have agreed to explore ways to (i) align
their budget support with some of the policy actions and/or outcomes identified in the matrix;
and (ii) join efforts in terms of technical assistance for the Ministries of Health and Education.33
The Bank is in continuous dialogue with the IADB on the reform of the CCT program,
Solidaridad. The IADB also provides technical assistance for the Ministries of Economy,
Finance and Education, with a view to support the Government's performance agenda. Finally,
UNICEF efforts on the congressional budget oversight office will complement the performance
and accountability approach of the PASS, through a strengthening of the legislative function.

IV.4 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

93.     The DPL's contribution to the revamp of the new CCT Solidaridad program
complements the activities undertaken by the Social Protection Investment project (SPIL)
(under implementation) and its corresponding Additional Financing (AF, recently approved
by the Board on September 17th, 2009). The SPIL does not currently finance the Solidaridad
program as such but it aims at providing poor undocumented Dominicans with national identity
documents, which will give them access to social protection programs such as Solidaridad. It
also focuses on improving the coverage and effectiveness of the targeting instrument SIUBEN
through institutional strengthening. Prepared in close coordination with the IADB, the AF to the
SPIL will provide technical assistance and capacity-building to the redesigned CCT Solidaridad
program. Specifically, it will align the CCT managerial and staff capacity to the new operational
rules of the redesigned CCT and support the development of a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation system. Neither the SPIL nor the AF finances the payment of transfers to households.

94.     This DPL would complement the second phase of the Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) for the support to the Health Sector Reform (PARSS2). Specifically, it would provide
a framework for exploiting synergies regarding better intersectoral coordination for human
capital investment and advancing the improved accountability framework for the social sector.
PARSS2 focuses on improving the delivery of health services at the first level of care by
introducing results-adjusted financing mechanisms (capitations) for the first level of care and
improvements in the quality of spending in the health sector. The first level of care is where the
supply of services for the health­related co-responsibilities takes place.

95.   The education actions supported by the PASS will complement the sector initiatives
that are being addressed by the implementation of the Dominican Republic Early
Childhood Education Project, which increases access to Early Childhood Education (DO-


33
  The EU committed 38.5 million for budgetary support, conditioned to enhanced performance in health and
education. The EU is also offering 1 million in TA for the Health sector.

                                                     42
7144), and the Dominican Republic Youth Development Project, which provides poor and
vulnerable youth with a second chance to complete their secondary education.

96.     Finally, there are strong complementarities between the proposed PASS DPL and
the Public Finance and Social Sector (PFSS) DPL, which is scheduled to be presented to the
Board on the same date. The stand alone PFSS DPL supports Government measures aimed at
improving the quality and efficiency of public spending, especially in sectors that matter for
poverty reduction and human development. The DPL supports improvements in the targeting of
spending with the reform of the energy subsidy (Bonoluz, to be implemented by the Social
Cabinet), which will now be targeted based on the targeting instrument SIUBEN. Errors of
exclusion in the targeting system SIUBEN will also be reduced through a strengthened
collaboration and systematic exchange of information and verification between the SIUBEN and
the National Civil Registry, leading to an increased number of poor Dominicans with appropriate
documentation and therefore, eligibility for social programs. The quality of health sector
spending will also be improved through two main lines of Government actions: (i) Protection of
the fiscal resources that cover the current 1.2 million individuals of the fully subsidized regime,
especially during the current economic crisis; and (ii) a plan to promote efficiency improvements
in the procurement and distribution of medicines.

97.       Moreover, the PFSS DPL will strengthen overall fiscal sustainability (i.e. improvement
of cost recovery in the energy sector and effectiveness of revenue collection). Overall, the set of
measures supported by the PFSS DPL will help mitigate the impact of the ongoing present global
economic crisis on DR's public finances and reduce vulnerability to future shocks.

IV.5 LESSONS LEARNED

98.     Lessons learned from the DR Social Crisis Response Adjustment Loan (SCRAL, 2006)
are relevant to the PASS. The Implementation Completion Report for the SCRAL showed that
"Bank lending can effectively achieve short-term crisis alleviation along with modest advances
on medium-term policy actions." The PASS has followed some of the major ICR
recommendations including: careful selection of policy actions; consensus with Government on
these actions; and inter-sectoral and donor coordination.
99.     The experience with Peru's Programmatic DPL Series on social sectors (REACT), also
offers interesting insights, particularly: (i) the need to fully involve social sector ministries in the
gradual implementation of performance-informed budgeting; (ii) the value of centering on a few
critical policy reforms and related results; (iii) the benefit of synergies with other Bank
operations in social sectors; and (iv) the value of supporting an enabling environment for a better
informed demand for enhanced performance in the social domain. The REACT DPL supported
the enhancement of budget transparency and popularized parental understanding of education
standards and performance.

IV.6 ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

100.    As detailed in Annex 4 and reflected in Section III, the PASS DPL builds on a series of
analytical and advisory reports from within and outside the Bank. In addition, and consistent
with the CPS approach, two strategic, programmatic Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA)


                                                  43
products will support participating government agencies in achieving policy commitments and
outcomes included in this proposed Programmatic PASS DPL series. The first NLTA product
will cover human development issues. The NLTA will support just-in-time advice to support
Government's actions in the overhaul of the CCT program, while addressing knowledge and
advisory gaps in areas that cannot be addressed by the CCT. The NLTA will generate a
diagnostic on the factors behind low student attainment in Basic and Secondary Education,
which will serve as an important input to inform policies to improve education attainment and
student learning outcomes in the DR. The NLTA will also address issues and options for the
Government to strengthen the effectiveness of its labor and social protection instruments in the
context of the crisis. A second NLTA product will concentrate on public sector performance,
focusing on the improvement of the quality of public expenditures, as explained in more detailed
in Box 3.
                Box 3: Bank AAA on Public Sector Performance: A Strategic Approach
The Dominican Government (GoDR) is making a bold move to improving the overall performance of the public sector
and the next big challenge is to improve the quality of public expenditure (See Section III.3). In this context, key
strategic objectives of the new CPS (FY09-FY13) include enhancing the quality and efficiency of public expenditures
and promoting institutional development of the Dominican public administration, using a strategic approach: CPS.
These objectives are aligned with the GoDR National Development Strategy (NDS), which calls for strengthening
national and local institutions, improving the quality of public expenditures, good governance, and promoting the
development of a results culture within the public administration. Key associated outcomes include improved budget
management and a gradual implementation of performance-informed budgeting. In collaboration with other donors such
as USAID and the Spanish Agency for Cooperation, the Bank has set out to support the strengthening of public
institutions' accountability and their capacity to plan and deliver results, and more specifically the implementation of
sound public financial management systems, the consolidation of transparent and efficient procurement mechanisms, the
strengthening of audit schemes, and the implementation of results-based management techniques.
Bank support for the governance and public sector reform agenda is crystallized in an array of inter-connected
instruments that include lending and non-lending instruments. Lending instruments include: (i) the proposed PASS DPL
series, which includes a component to support a series of reforms to build a culture of results in public administration;
(ii) the Municipal Development Investment Loan, which will include institutional development activities to strengthen
the capacity of local Governments; and (iii) the second Health Sector Reform Loan (PARSS2), which includes a series of
actions to support performance based management within the health sector. Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NLTA)
instruments include: (i) the Institutional and Governance Review (IGR), which will focus on underlying political
economy and governance issues that prevent the country from addressing fundamental development challenges in key
sectors like education, health, and energy; and (ii) a programmatic NLTA on public financial management, procurement
and performance management and budgeting. This NLTA will cover, among others: support to the National
Procurement Strategic Plan; application of the OECD Procurement Indicators; support to the implementation of the
Single Treasury Account (STA) and stronger robust public accounting standards; support to improve the internal and
external audit functions; action plans toward stronger institutional performance; support to achieve better monitoring of
physical and financial progress, and the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
Finally, additional capacity-building and technical assistance will be provided through a number of grants focusing on
governance, transparency, public management and budgeting reforms including: "Improving performance accountability
in the DR by strengthening Congressional oversight", "Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability",
"Access to Information and Downward Accountability in the Dominican Republic" and "Improving Performance
Accountability by Strengthening Chamber of Accounts' Capacity to Fulfill its Mandate as a Supreme Audit Institution
(SAI)". Most of these activities rely on previous analytic work that include the Country Fiduciary Assessment (including
the CFAA and CPPR), the Public Expenditure Review, and more recently the Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes - (ROSC) and Accounting & Auditing, and the Policy Note "Hacia un sistema de rendición de cuentas y
desempeño en la República Dominicana".

                                    V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

101.     The proposed operation is the first of a programmatic series of three DPLs, envisaged to
span over three years. This programmatic approach is mainly due to the gradual nature of the
targeted social policy and public sector reforms. Consistent with the policy context analyzed
above, this section describes the overall approach of the proposed PASS program and the
different policy actions summarized in the matrix (Annex 1). The ten prior actions considered
for this first proposed operation are summarized in Box 4.

Overall vision and approach of the program

102.    Strategic Vision. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve results in social sectors
(mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in the short term and enhancing in
the medium term the human capital of the poorest citizens. Regarding the medium term, the
social and public sector policy reforms supported by the PASS are consistent with the
Government's long term goal of improving major human development indicators in education
and health, especially for the poorest citizens. Specific long term results extending beyond the
time span of the PASS in education include an increase in the share of extremely poor children
who have completed at least one year of Early Childhood Development (ECD) (children 4-6
years old); who are enrolled in, attending and completing basic education; and who are enrolled
in secondary school. In health, key long term results include increased Government performance
in the delivery of critical nutrition, child and prenatal health care services for the poorest citizens.

103.    Preserving human capital in the short term is an equally important part of the PASS,
given the likely negative impact of the financial crisis on the poor and vulnerable, and on the
fiscal resources assigned to social sectors. As described below and in the section on the
operation's social impacts, the PASS will support a better targeting of fiscal resources dedicated
to social transfers for extremely poor families and also to supply-gaps34 in education, health and
nutrition by improving budget management in this area.

104.    Objectives. In line with this strategic vision and the Government's program, the PASS
has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote
human capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a fundamental
redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its
articulation with critical actions in health and education [Row 1 in the Annex 1 matrix]; (ii) to
improve budget management to support the joint performance of social sector agencies within
the CCT program, as part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending
and support the required improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services
[Row 2]; (iii) to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in the key social
sector agencies [Row 3]; and (iv) to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors [Row
4]. These are summarized below and in the Annex 1 matrix.

105.   Overall approach to institutionalizing a performance orientation. In line with the
vision of the CPS, the PASS DPL program will support the reform process the country is

34
  Personnel, infrastructure but also key inputs including medicine, didactic materials or micronutrients that tend to
suffer from budget cuts in times of crisis.

                                                          45
implementing to institutionalize a performance focus in the public sector. In particular, the DPL
will support the formulation of basic management agreements between the Ministries of Finance,
Planning and Administration and the three main social agencies considered under the DPL: the
Education and Health Ministries and the Social Cabinet. The responsibilities for meeting the
selected performance objectives and triggers (activities) will be defined in these agreements.
These management agreements to be signed annually between the agencies will be a prior action
for the DPL. It is expected that as the challenges mentioned in section III are addressed, they will
evolve naturally into the Performance Agreements envisioned in the Dominican legal
framework.

106.    Also in line with the new CPS, DPL actions described in the PASS will be supported,
when needed, by programmatic NLTA. The Dominican Republic is undertaking an ambitious
and comprehensive range of reforms which will require an active program of institutional
strengthening and policy support. As envisaged under the CPS, the Bank will support these
reforms through a program of supportive NLTA (Section IV.6).

                                                       47
     Detailed Description of Areas of Policy Actions- as per the Policy Action Matrix in Annex 1.

V.1 POLICY AREA I. ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL SECTOR AGENCIES TO
PROMOTE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HUMAN CAPITAL

107.    This first area of institutional and policy reform supports the shift of the current social
assistance model of the Government's CCT flagship program to a full-fledged CCT focused on
the promotion of human capital (I.1); related critical actions in health and education (I.2 and I.3);
select actions to enhance the overall quality of service to CCT beneficiaries (I.4), and the
performance of the social policy targeting system SIUBEN, used to determine the eligibility of
CCT beneficiaries, but also of other transfers (I.4).

I.1 Conceptual, institutional and operative revamp of the CCT.
108.    This line of reform addresses the need for: (i) the CCT to be exclusively dedicated to cash
transfers conditioned to the investment in health and education by poor families; (ii) a clear
division of responsibilities among, and shared accountability within, the Social Cabinet's key
agencies to ensure the quality of the registry of active CCT families; (iii) a clear division of
responsibilities among, and shared accountability between, the CCT program and the Education
and Health Ministries, to ensure the compliance of beneficiaries with co-responsibilities in
health, nutrition and education and its verification at national and regional level; and (iv) a
shared results framework, with an integral system of monitoring and evaluation shared by all
agencies within the Social Cabinet and with Education and Health. Specifically, the PASS will:

          ·        Recognize the Government's efforts to establish a clear conceptual and
          institutional distinction between non-conditional cash transfers and conditional cash
          transfers, the latter being exclusively assigned to the redesigned CCT program
          Solidaridad through the Presidential Decree of February 2009 (DPL1).
          ·        Support the revamp of the institutional framework and operative rules of the CCT
          ensuring compliance with, and verification of, co-responsibilities. The PASS will start
          with the institutionalization of the recently created (informal) Interagency Committee35,
          and Intersectoral Committee (bringing together CCT, Education and Health) and the
          development of their operative rules (DPL1). Subsequently, the PASS will consolidate
          and deepen advances by supporting the approval of the regulations governing the
          operation of these agencies (DPL2), with a view to ensure the quality of the registry of
          active CCT beneficiaries (eligible as per targeting instrument and receiving payments
          based on compliance with co-responsibilities) and the intersectoral coordination at both
          national and regional levels. These regulations should be accompanied by the
          development of the system of monitoring and evaluation, including the calculation of
          basic baselines. By DPL3, the PASS would support the actual use of
          procedures/mechanisms by the CCT, the education and health agencies to allow for the
          verification of co-responsibilities of at least 80 percent of CCT families. Beyond
          regulations, the actual establishment of CCT Regional Intersectoral Committees would be
          considered.

35
  This will bring together the agencies responsible for administrating the transfers (ADESS), the targeting
(SIUBEN), and the actual CCT program management (CCT Solidaridad), as described in III.3.

                                                         48
       ·       Support the development of an integral results framework for the redesigned
       CCT, starting with the inclusion of management and impact indicators in the CCT
       operative rules (DPL 1) to a full Integral System of Monitoring and Evaluation
       effectively used and shared by the CCT, Education, Health and the three Social Cabinet
       agencies (ADESS, SIUBEN and Solidaridad) (DPL3).

I.2 Additional Health actions
109.   This line of action addresses the problem of the low quality of mother and child health
care services at the first level of care (See III.1). This leads to poor health outcomes including
high rates of maternal and child mortality and lack of protection against immune-preventable
diseases. In response, the PASS will support:

       ·       The design (DPL2) and implementation (DPL3) of a Government's four-year
       action plan to improve prenatal control and quality of delivery services, including early
       identification of high-risk pregnancies and definition of delivery criteria.
       ·       The design (DPL2) and implementation (DPL3) of a Government's action plan to
       improve vaccination rates for children under five at the first level of care, according to
       national protocols.

I.3 Education actions
110.     In line with the Government's program and the scope of the PASS, education policy
actions will not support broader education reforms. Rather, they will focus on ways to enhance
the articulation between the revamped CCT program Solidaridad and the supply of education
services. In this context, three critical problems (as described in Section III) will be addressed: (i)
the lack of an information system, owned by the Secretariat of Education, to verify the
compliance of co-responsibilities; (ii) the lack of differentiated financial incentives in
educational programs offsetting opportunity costs within the CCT Program; and (iii) the inability
of the Secretariat of Education to monitor student learning outcomes, including students from
CCT families (the challenge of supply-side gaps in education and health is addressed in row 2 of
the DPL matrix in Annex 1). In response, the PASS will:

       (i)      Support the implementation of the School Management System (Sistema de
       Gestión de Centro) by the Secretariat of Education (DPL2), allowing for the systematic
       verification of education co-responsibilities and the monitoring of targeted schools in
       priority districts. Doing so will also allow for more efficient use of limited resources, thus
       strengthening the foundation for future improvements in CCT education service delivery.
       (ii)     Support the definition of a new structure and amounts of transfers within the CCT
       Program to improve the educational indicators of access, retention, promotion and
       completion rates by education level (DPL3). These will be based on the results of a pilot
       test to be implemented in 2010 with financing from the new IADB multiphase investment
       loan supporting Solidaridad (DPL2). The Government will take the opportunity of the
       pilot to assess its institutional capacity to handle differentiated education incentives and
       make follow-up recommendations.
       (iii) Help lay out the foundation for a second-generation of the CCT Program by
       supporting the improvement of the Secretariat of Education's ability to monitor student
       learning outcomes, specifically supporting: (a) the validation of student evaluation

                                                  49
       standards for the initial and first cycle of Basic Education (DPL1); (b) the administration
       of student learning outcome tests for the first cycle of Basic Education (4th grade) and
       the validation of student evaluation standards for the second cycle of Basic Education
       (DPL2); and (c) the administration of the adjusted student learning outcome tests for the
       second cycle of Basic Education (8th grade) and the validation of student evaluation
       standards for secondary education (DPL3).

111.    As described above, this proposed PASS Program will be complemented by NLTA on
the education sector in the DR, which will strengthen the existing body of knowledge in the
sector. This NLTA will include a diagnostic on the factors behind low student attainment in
Basic and Secondary Education, which will serve as an important input step to inform policy
interventions and programs to improve educational attainment and student learning outcomes in
the DR. The PASS will also benefit from an analysis of the political economy in regards to
reform in education, to be financed by a Governance and Partnership Facility Grant. This
analysis will help identify possible resistance to reform by key stakeholders, including teachers'
unions, and present common points for a platform of reform.

I.4 Enhanced quality of service to CCT beneficiaries

112.   Quality of service is a crosscutting issue that will be greatly enhanced by the operational
overhaul of the Solidaridad Program. This improvement will consist of the deconcentration of
the Solidaridad Program to regional levels, as well as the development of a comprehensive
system of monitoring and evaluation, which will include beneficiaries' assessments. Given the
challenges described in Section III.2, the PASS will focus on critical actions related to the
mechanism of payment for the transfers. Specifically, the PASS will support:

       ·       The design of a plan (DPL1) for and the gradual expansion of the network of
       shops (Colmados) affiliated with the Solidaridad Program (DPL2 and 3). This is
       expected to result in lower priced products and a wider variety of products available for
       purchase by beneficiaries with their Solidaridad Card.
       ·       The design, approval and implementation of a plan (DPL 2 and 3) to improve the
       information of beneficiaries on the exact amount of transfers to which they are entitled
       and on the balance of resources available on their card. Currently, beneficiaries do not
       benefit from this type of critical information.

I.5 Improved targeting performance
113.     This line action addresses the need to reduce targeting errors of inclusion and exclusion
in the list of eligible CCT beneficiaries. Major problems include: (i) an outdated database due to
the fact that the SIUBEN census was carried out in 2004-2005; and (ii) the weak quality of the
list of eligible CCT beneficiaries, due to the fact that both SIUBEN and the CCT program
currently maintain the list of eligible beneficiaries (SIUBEN for household heads, and the CTT
Solidaridad considering all household members). In response, the PASS will support:

       ·       The implementation of a new census for SIUBEN and the subsequent updating of
       its database. This will ensure that CCT beneficiaries currently comply with eligibility


                                               50
       criteria and will expand identification efforts into new geographic zones with high
       poverty that were not considered in the 2004-2005 census (DPL 3).
       ·       The clarification of roles and responsibilities, with SIUBEN as the only
       responsible agency for maintaining and updating the registry of the CCT beneficiaries
       (DPL 2).

V.2 POLICY AREA II. IMPROVING BUDGET MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT THE PERFORMANCE OF
THE CCT PROGRAM

114.   This line addresses the need to both increase budget allocations to meet the entitlements
envisioned under the CCT program and other social programs, and to ensure that the budget for
CCT is executed as programmed. As a consequence of the lack of resources and the
unpredictable nature of budget execution, the ability of the CCT program to plan and deliver is
severely undermined. The PASS will help increase the predictability and efficiency of financial
management and budget processes that support the delivery of the CCT, including the associated
education and health sectors, through:

       (i)     The development of rolling multi-annual projections of entitlements, supply gaps
       (in health, nutrition and education) and budget resources.
       (ii)   Ensuring the consistency between the CCT entitlements and annual budget
       outturns, and ensuring that the annual budget is firmly linked to the rolling multi-year
       CCT projections.

V.3 POLICY AREA III. SUPPORTING THE GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF PERFORMANCE
AGREEMENTS IN THE SOCIAL SECTORS

115.    This line of action addresses the need to enhance the performance orientation of the
budget and management processes. Budget management is currently largely focused on the
control of financial and human inputs. This hinders the prioritization of the programs based on
their outputs and outcomes, particularly the critical social programs and has reduced the
flexibility of management arrangements (also impacting on efficiency). A very gradual
movement toward a flexible performance-informed budgeting framework would help to support
better decision making, including managerial flexibility, transparency and accountability for
public spending, as well as highlighting the need for more resources and better programs to
achieve results in the social sectors. This gradual, flexible approach builds on international
experience that recognizes both the technical challenges in generating performance information
and that it is generally one of a number of elements that is used to better inform, rather than
dictate, budget decision making.

116.  Under this policy area, the PASS will support the gradual introduction of Performance
Agreements in the social sectors as envisioned in the Dominican law, by:

       (i)    Ensuring that the reform toward the implementation of performance contracts
       advances according to the gradual process envisioned in the law within the sector
       agencies and the central agencies, with no major setbacks.


                                              51
       (ii)    Consolidating the advances made by some sectors in the implementation of
       internal management agreements (i.e. health) and formalizing the "quasi-contractual"
       nature of the CCT program with the signing of a management agreement between the
       Social Cabinet and SEEPyD, SEH and SEAP.

V.4 POLICY AREA IV. IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT

117.     This last area of reform addresses some of the most critical challenges hindering a more
informed demand for improved public sector performance in social sectors. At budget level, the
Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) is only accessible by authorized users
hindering public access to timely and comprehensive budget information. At the CCT program
level, there is no effective social auditing scheme with verifiable and quantifiable feedback and
no adequate feedback loop. The complaint system also needs to be broadened. In response, the
PASS will support the improvement of transparency and downward accountability at two levels:
that of the CCT program and of the government budget.

118.   At the level of Government budget, the PASS will promote a full disclosure of budget
information to improve public access and understanding of the budget. A user-friendly, easy-to-
understand, web-based tool ("Consulta Amigable") will be developed as an interface of the
Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) (DPL2 and DPL3-launching). This
automated interface will be linked to performance indicators.

119.   At the CCT program level, the PASS will:

       i)       Promote the public disclosure of all critical information including list of
       beneficiaries and the results-based assessment of the supply-gaps in education and health
       (DPL1).
       ii)      Support the Government's approval, pilot initiation (DPL2) and scale-up (DPL3)
       of a social auditing scheme by the CCT Intersectoral Committee for the redesigned CCT
       and corresponding health and education services, including the use of community
       scorecards for monitoring health and education inputs. This will include the rolling out of
       an improved accountability chain involving direct providers and users, on district,
       regional and national management levels.
       iii)     Support the enhancement of the complaint system of the CCT program so that it
       can also include complaints associated with the provision of service in schools and health
       facilities.

120.   Subject to NLTA findings, further actions to enhance the effectiveness of formal spaces
of civic monitoring in health and education (Health Committees and Parent-Teacher
Associations) may be included for DPL2 and DPL3. Following the gradual validation of
education standards (Policy Action I) and the Grant implementation, the PASS could also
support the popularization of parental understanding of what good performance means for each
child. Finally, the PASS may look to support the development of the DR's external audit
function, particularly the publication and follow-up of recommendations in relevant areas.




                                               52
                                VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


VI.1 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS, POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

121.    Environmental aspects. The actions supported by PASS are not expected to generate
significant effects on environment, forests, and other natural resources. However, minor
environmental impacts could result from policy areas supported by the DPL. These potential
impacts are noted below, with proposed measures under the DPL to fill potential gaps in the
country system to mitigate those effects:

         ·       Policy Area 1 focuses on the institutional revamping of the CCT program and a
         better articulation with education and health services. Policy Area 1.2 includes the design
         and implementation of an action plan for DPL2 and DPL3 of the series that will improve
         health services for mothers and children, specifically vaccination rates. This could
         potentially generate environmental effects in terms of biomedical waste management,
         which is known to be relatively weak in the DR. Fortunately, the country recently passed
         legislation to improve biomedical waste management. Following a country strategic
         approach, the Bank will support Government efforts to strengthen waste handling
         procedures, under the forthcoming second phase of the Bank Health project, PARSS2.
         During the new CPS period, the Bank will also explore opportunities to support capacity
         building to implement these new procedures, train personnel, and establish stronger
         coordination with the Secretariat for the Environment for waste and occupational safety
         issues.
         ·       Policy Area 2 focuses on improved budget management to support the enhanced
         performance of social sectors, including the estimation of supply-gaps to meet the
         demand of CCT beneficiaries for health and education services, and the write-up of a
         Government Policy paper and strategy on the CCT program, associated entitlements and
         revenue projections. Policy changes supported by the DPL1 do not require expansion or
         new constructions of schools, health care facilities or network of shops.
         ·       Policy Areas 3 and 4 focus on improving the quality of public expenditures
         through Performance Agreements and enhancing transparency and oversight in social
         sectors respectively. Therefore, neither of these policy areas will generate significant
         environmental effects.

122.     Poverty and Social Impacts. The team is planning to use the Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment (PSIA) as an iterative process and overall approach to identify and monitor the
social benefits and potential risks of the reforms supported by the PASS. A range of methods
(literature review, quantitative and qualitative analysis) will be used, subject to the area of
inquiry and data availability.36 The team has already started to conduct a social impact analysis
through: (i) interviews with key Dominican experts in the social sectors, outside and inside the
Government; and (ii) a review of available data and literature on poverty, social policy

36
  At present, there are serious data constraints since the CCT Solidaridad program has not yet established a rigorous
system of monitoring and evaluation, with a baseline and performance targets. This system will start to be
established towards the end of 2009, when a forthcoming IADB investment loan and the Additional Financing of the
Bank to the existing Social Protection Investment project become effective.

challenges, the CCT Solidaridad program, transparency and levels of social spending in the DR.
This analysis suggests that the proposed PASS program is expected to have significant,
positive social impacts. Specific preliminary conclusions are summarized below.

123.    First, the fundamental redesign of the CCT program Solidaridad will emphasize human
capital promotion and increase incentives for eligible, extremely-poor families to keep children
in school longer and improve health care behaviors (through regular health visits and
sensitization training on select health issues).37 The PASS-supported reforms will make payment
of transfers conditional on households' compliance with health and education co-responsibilities
(Row 1 of the matrix), and also improve budget management so as to support the availability of
health, nutrition and education inputs (Row 2). The PSIA will assess the size of these expected
positive impacts on the CCT target population and identify any potential risks. In particular, it
will look at barriers to the compliance by poor families with health and education co-
responsibilities that will be enforced for the first time with the revamping of the CCT program.
Barriers include the relationship between program eligibility and access to the national identity
document and the potential exclusion from the program of eligible households who could not
meet the conditions because of supply gaps. Mitigation measures to remedy these risks will be
developed. The documentation risk mitigation measure is already in place: the WB Social
Protection Investment project under implementation supports the Government's efforts to reduce
the number of undocumented, poor Dominican households.

124.    Second, in the context of the financial crisis, these reforms will help improve the safety
net response of the Government, preventing harmful coping strategies that can have negative and
sometimes permanent effects on the human capital and welfare of household members (e.g. early
school leaving, malnutrition). The budget management reform (Row 2) is also expected to help
protect some of the critical health and education inputs that tend to suffer from budget cuts in
times of crisis.

125.    Third, specific complementary actions in health and education will yield additional
benefits, even if the specific outcomes of these actions will be difficult to observe by the end of
the three-year program duration. For example, PASS support of improvements in prenatal
control and quality of delivery services will contribute to better health outcomes in the long-run
(Row I.2 of the matrix). Similarly, the change in the amount and structure of education transfers
under the CCT program will affect the opportunity costs of education (Row 1.3 of the matrix).

126.  Finally, the PASS reforms are expected to have positive externalities beyond the CCT
program and target population:

     · Support for the improvement of the targeting system administered by SIUBEN (Row 1.5)
     will improve the quality of the Government's overall safety net response. The proxy-means
     test used by SIUBEN is also used to target the fuel subsidy (Bonogas) and is expected to be
     used for the electricity subsidy (Bonoluz) a reform supported by the DR Fiscal DPL to be
     submitted to the Board in coming months.

  Health sensitization sessions typically range from improved nutrition to the prevention of early pregnancy for
adolescent girls.

                                                         54
     · Social policy and budget measures that support improvements in the supply of health,
     nutrition and education services will target priority regions that include both CCT and non-
     eligible CCT beneficiaries. Subject to data availability, the PSIA will look at the expected
     change in the coverage of health and education services for both Solidaridad beneficiaries
     and non-beneficiaries.
     · The PASS public sector reforms will contribute to the development of a culture of results
     in social sectors, by enhancing performance orientation in social sectors (through
     management agreements in the short term and gradual implementation of performance-
     informed budgeting in the medium term with Performance Agreements).
     · The measures to enhance transparency in the budget should contribute to a more
     informed and vocal demand by constituents and other stakeholders for preserving critical
     elements of social spending (Policy area 4). The implementation of community scorecards
     will cover not only the CCT program's quality of customer service, but also the availability
     of critical health, education and nutrition inputs to enable compliance with co-
     responsibilities.

VI.2 IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

127.    The implementation of the loan(s) will require close coordination among the Bank and
the respective institutions responsible for implementation. These include the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Economy, the Social Cabinet, the Secretariat of Health and the Secretariat of
Education, all of which will provide the requisite baseline data, when available, from which to
measure outcomes by the end of the program38 (See Annex 2, Select Monitoring Indicators).
The Social Cabinet, through the Intersectoral Committee, will assist in the coordination of
information reporting on the program's monitoring indicators related to Policy Area 1 on the
shift toward human capital promotion and to some extent on Policy Area 4 on transparency and
civic oversight for the CCT program. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy and
Planning, will report progress monitoring indicators for Policy Area 2 on improved budget
management and Policy 3 on the gradual implementation of Performance Agreements.

VI.3 FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

128.    The fiduciary risk related to the Public Financial Management (PFM) environment
in the Dominican Republic is considered moderately high. The Bank has noted a renewed
commitment to PFM reform by government officials in the institutions that are responsible for
the implementation of PFM reform. At the center of this commitment is the need to modernize
the country's systems and to address the need for a more efficient management of public
resources. The current reforms have largely been designed and supported by high level technical
officials, particularly those within the relatively new Secretaría de Estado de Hacienda,
Secretaría de Estado de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo (SEEPyD) and the Secretaría de
Administración Pública. In the last few years, the government undertook a substantial reform of
the legal framework for PFM in order to align it with international best practices and modern
standards. Most major laws have now been revised, but their implementation has been slow. In
38
  Data is available for most of the indicators described in the matrix. The main exception relates to the current lack
of beneficiary's assessment for the CCT. The latter will be financed by an additional financing to the Bank's social
investment project, which is currently under preparation.

                                                          55
addition, the government introduced an integrated financial management system known as
SIGEF. Its equivalent at the local level, SIFMUN, has been implemented in nearly half of all
municipalities. It is expected that once existing effectiveness issues are addressed, the system
will help strengthen internal controls, improve the recording of accounting transactions and
enhance quality and timeliness of financial reporting.

129.     The Contraloría General de la República (Comptroller General, CGR) and the Cámara
de Cuentas (Chamber of Accounts, CdC) are responsible for internal and external oversight of
PFM in the DR. Both these institutions continue to implement measures to enhance their
capacity and staff skills. Furthermore, a tangible demonstration of the CdC's determination to
address the low public trust in the organization and enhance its effectiveness is its recent
commissioning of an international consultancy firm to conduct a diagnostic study of its current
institutional arrangements. The CdC has adopted the resultant comprehensive plan of action that
seeks to strengthen the capacity of the organization to conduct its external audit mandate. In
addition, through an Institutional Development Facility Grant for Public Management and
Financial Accountability, the Bank is supporting the institutional strengthening of the
government's anti-corruption unit, the Dirección de Prevención de la Corrupción Administrativa
(DPCA). The Bank has also sought to augment the demand for increased accountability and
transparency in the management of public funds by strengthening the role that civil society
organizations play in this respect.

130.    Central Bank of the Dominican Republic. The IMF carried out a Safeguards
Assessment of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) in 2003. The report notes
that an independent external auditor had been engaged for the first time in 2000 and that there
had been progress towards the implementation of International Accounting Standards. According
to the report, one weakness of the BCRD is the framework for institutional oversight of the
external and internal audit functions at the level of the Board. A detailed Action Plan was agreed
to between the IMF and the Government to address these issues, including the establishment of
an oversight body to supervise the newly redefined internal audit function and to ensure follow-
up of external audit recommendations. The 2008 audited financial statements contain an
unqualified audit opinion with a note of emphasis with respect to accounting policies. The
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices for
Central Banks and contain notes that detail where and how the policies differ from International
Financial Reporting Standards.

131.    The disbursement rate for the Bank portfolio is extremely slow, and most of the
issues are procurement related. The flow of funds of the DR portfolio from the Designated
Account denominated in US$ to the Operating Account denominated in DOP continues to
improve. During the last Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in February 2009 the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) reported the cycle took from 5 to 7 days. The country shows
a more efficient release of allocated funds via the Treasury with positive impacts in the budget
execution. The new legislation requires a Single Treasury Account (STA) and is pending
implementation.

VI.4 DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

132.    The administration of this loan will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
loans/credits. The untied balance of payments/budget support will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the development policy program, including compliance with
tranche release conditions and the maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic policy
framework, and not tied to any specific purchases. Furthermore, no procurement requirements
will be needed. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the borrower may
submit a withdrawal application requesting the Bank deposit the proceeds of the loan into a
dedicated account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of
Dominican Republic at the request of the Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit
of the Loan into the account, an equivalent amount shall be credited in the Borrower's budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank
on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget management
system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Development Policy Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to promptly, upon notice
from IBRD, refund an amount equal to the amount of the payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded
to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The Bank will retain the option to request an
audit of the dedicated account.

estimated in the hundreds of millions US$. Natural
disasters have the potential to derail economic
growth and poverty reduction. They also pose a
heavy fiscal burden, increasing indebtedness and
redirecting public resources away from long-run
development plans

                             Overall approach: Strengthening the performance orientation of the social sectors
Consistent with the government reform program, the DPL series will support the implementation of basic policy actions to strengthen planning,
monitoring and budget processes in the social sectors. The DPL will be structured around annual management agreements that will start to
establish an overarching framework that focuses public policy, budget and management issues around performance. These basic management
agreements will include the key policy actions and outcomes that are contained in this matrix and will be signed between the SEEPyD, SEH, and
SEAP with each sector agency and the Social Cabinet. It is expected that these management agreements will be superseded by the Performance
Agreements envisioned in the Dominican law over the medium-term.

                 Annex 2: Select Monitoring Indicators for the PASS DPL Series

Introductory Note: The table below provides a selection of key monitoring indicators, baselines
(when available) and targets for the three-loan PASS series. As presented in the table, the
reforms supported by the PASS Program are expected to generate improvements at four main
levels:

   i) Institutional and policy improvements (changes in institutional rules and behaviors)
        mainly related to: (a) the reform of the governance and operative system of Solidaridad
        towards an effective Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, including improved
        verification of co-responsibilities and a better articulation with health and education
        actions (Policy Area 1); and (b) the gradual introduction of performance-informed
        budgeting (Gradual move towards performance agreements in social sectors) and a
        stronger emphasis on results (Internal management agreements between the Secretariat
        of Health and Regional Health Services, focused on improved results at the first level of
        care) (Policy Area 3).
   ii) Improved budget management and execution with a view to progressively reduce supply-
        gaps in health, nutrition, and education services linked to the newly defined co
        responsibilities of the redesigned CCT Program (Policy Area 2).
   iii) Improvements in transparency and accountability to users, with respect to the national
        budget and the redesigned CCT Program (Policy Area 4)
   iv) Improvements in human development outcomes, focusing on the share of CCT
        beneficiaries who actually comply with the newly defined co-responsibilities in the
        Program Operations Manual and thereby invest in education, nutrition and health
        (Overall PASS Program's result).

Unlike other CCT programs in the region, the Solidaridad Program has not yet developed a
permanent, integral monitoring and evaluation system (Section III.2). Furthermore, the
Government, in the process of redesigning the CCT program, developed new co-responsibilities
in health and education. As a result, key baseline data for the newly defined co-responsibilities
has not been collected yet and it was impossible to collect it by the time of Board submission for
the first loan of the PASS DPL series. However, it was agreed with the GoDR that a trigger for
DPL2 would be the compilation of key missing baselines along with the targets (when
applicable) for each indicator (Section V.1).

Primary outcomes of Policy Area 1 (Enhanced Performance of Social Sectors to Promote Human Capital for the Poor)
Improvements in governance and operative rules of the CCT program so that: the payments of transfers are effectively made
conditional to compliance with co-responsibilities; intersectoral coordination functions at national and local levels, with
sound articulation of the CCTs with health and education actions; stronger emphasis is placed on results and improved
quality of service delivered by the CCT Program.

This refers to the access and use of health, nutrition, and education services by the beneficiary households of the
Solidaridad program.
Larger share of extremely poor families that invest in their human capital development, measured by:
(*) an increase in CCT beneficiary households who comply with health and nutrition co-responsibilities as defined in the
CCT Operations Manual (timeliness, consistency with Basic Healthcare Plan and national health protocols).
(*) an increase in the share of students from CCT beneficiary families who are enrolled in, attending and completing basic
education/enrolled in and attending secondary school.

The goal for the end of DPL1 in October 2010 is an indicator of 0.50, for the end of DPL2 en October
2011 an indicator of 0.65 and for the end of DPL3 in October 2012 an indicator of 0.85.

Since there are four quotas or disbursements per year, this could also be framed as follows:
The goal for the end of DPL1 in October 2010 is a simple average of the indicators for the four quotas of
0.50 by the end of DPL2 in October 2011, an average of 0.65 and for the end of DPL3 in October 2012 an
average of 0.85.

overburden households. Second, the documentation process largely escapes the room of maneuver of Solidaridad and households, since the ultimate decision to
provide legal documents lies with the National Registry Service or Junta Central Electoral.

  iniciado en el 2006. En este senti do, este prestamo programatico basado en Polfticas de Desarrollo sobre
  Desempefio y Rendici6n de Cuentas para los Sectores Sociales nos apoyara en implementar aspectos
  c1aves de estas prioridades.

  La significativa magnitud de la crisis intemacional y la incertidumbre de su extensi6n en el tiempo, ha
  quedado ya c1aramente de manifiesto en la cafda de los ingresos fisca les para el primer semestre de 2009,

 EI Gobiemo Dominicano se encuentra ejecutando la agenda de reformas institucionales del sistema
 financiero estatal mas profunda de los ultimos cincuenta anos. Estas reformas han impactado el area de
 contro l intemo, de presupuesto, tesorerfa y credito publico e incorpora la planeaci6n a mediano plazo del
 gasto publico. Este proceso iniciado en 2006 incluye cambios en el Sistema Nacional de Planificaci6n e
 Inversi6n Publica, Secretarfa de Estado de Economfa, Planificaci6n y Desarrollo, Secretarfa de Estado de
 Hacienda y Ley Organica de Presupuesto. Asf mismo, ha implicado cambios sustanciales a los regfmenes
 de Crectito PUblico, Compras y Contrataciones, Tesorerfa y Control Intemo.

 Fmto de este proceso de reformas surge un nuevo Sistema Nacional de Planificaci6n dentro del cual se
 enmarca la Estrategia Nacional de Desarrollo (END) actualmente en proceso de elaboraci6n para
 consolidar una visi6n de largo plazo. De los cinco ejes estrategicos principales ya identificados en la
 (END), este prestamo perrnitira apoyar de manera concreta los relacionados a 1) Desarrollo Social, 2)
 Crecimiento Econ6mico y Sostenibi lidad, y 3) Desarrollo Institucional.

 En consonancia con los ejes estrategicos mencionados se esta implementando una agenda de acciones en
 el perfodo 2008-12, que se centran en estos tres pi lares: (a) mejorar la eficiencia del gasto publico
 fortaleciendo las instituciones del sector publico que se ocupan del presupuesto y de la gerencia de las
 finanzas publicas y focalizar los gastos destinados a la reducci6n de los niveles de pobreza y mejora del
 desarrollo; (b) promover la sostenibilidad fiscal mitigando el impacto inter-temporal de la cris is global en
 las finanzas publicas y reduciendo su vulnerabilidad a los shocks futuros; y (c) mejorar el ambiente para
 el crecimiento y la creaci6n de trabajo conducido por el sector privado asegurando la estabilidad del
 sector financiero y aumentando la competiti vidad internacional.

 II. Conduccion Macroeconomica
 La Republica Dominicana ha sido una de las economfas latinoamericanas mas dina micas en las ultimas
 dos decadas. Durante el perfodo 1991-2008 la economfa dominicana creci6 a una tasa promedio de
 6.02%, la segunda mas alta de Latinoamerica, despues de Chile. Estas tasas de crecimiento han estado
 fundamentadas en las exportaciones, el incremento de las actividades del sector turismo y, mas
 recientemente, en los sectores de bienes no transables.

 Este escenario de alto crecimiento fue interrumpido por la crisis financiera de 2002-2003, la cual afecta
 varios bancos comerciales privados. Esa crisis genera fuertes consecuencias en terminos de intlacian,
 devaluaci6n y deterioro fiscal y del sector extemo. Para recuperar la estabilidad macroecon6mica, el
 Gobiemo tom6 acciones importantes en terminos fiscales y monetarios, coordinando la actividad del
 Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana y de las autoridades fiscales, que Ie permiti6 contener la crisis
 y revertir la contracci6n econ6mica en corto tiempo. Esta crisis financiera permiti6 que se realizaran las
 reformas reglamentarias y tecnicas necesarias en el sistema financiero dominicano que generaron una
 evaluaci6n del Financial Sector Assesment Program favorable.

 Luego de ese perfodo de fuerte inestabilidad, eI crecimiento ha sido muy elevado, alcanzando, en
 promedio 9.5%, en el perfodo 2005-2008. No obstante, y a pesar de haber crecido 7.5% en el primer
 semestre de 2008, el crecimiento empez6 a desacelerar a partir del tercer trimestre debido al impacto de la

 crisis intemacional y parcial mente por los efectos de una politica monetaria restrictiva enfocada a
 contener bajo estricto control las fluctuaciones de precios generados por el incremenlo generalizado de los
 hidrocarburos en los mercados internacionales en el 2008. AI cierre de ese ullimo ano el crecimiento fue
 de5.3%.

 Duranle el 2005-2007. la Republica Dominicana logro resultados positivos en lermino de sus balances
 fiscales. razones de deuda y reservas inlernacionales. e inflaci6n. EI supenivit fiscal primario alcanzo
 1.3% del PIB en 2007. un incremento desde 0.6% y 0.4% en 2006 y 2005 respeclivamente. Esla mejoria
 fue . principalmente. por incremento en ingresos. impulsados por reformas imposilivas y mejor
 administracion de dichos ingresos. asf como por un incremento en exportaciones de nfquel en 2007.

 La crisis de Iiquidez 2008-2009: EI drastico cambio del contexto intemacional en 2008 tuvo efectos
 adversos sobre la economfa dominicana. EI deterioro de la situacion economica mundial ha reducido
 fuertemente la demanda por servicios de turismo. las exportaciones. la inversion extranjera y las remesas.
 Adicionalmente. los ajustes de riesgo y Iiquidez en los mercados financieros internacionales y el aumento
 en las tasas de interes de referencia han aumentado el costo del crectito para el pafs y ha hecho mas diffcil
 acceso al financiamiento exlemo.


 Los avances logrados en la eSlabilizacion fiscal se revirtieron con el aumento de los precios del petroleo y
 el inicio de la crisis mundial. Gran parte del desequilibrio se debio al aumento del gasto. particularmente
 de las transferencias al sector electrico. el subsidio al gas licuado de petroleo (GLP) y el subsidio a
 algunos alimentos de la canasta basica de consumo popular. EI alza de los precios inlernacionales de los
 hidrocarburos y el subsecuente aumento en los costos de generacion de energra electrica fueron
 absorbidos por el Gobiemo en lugar de ser transmitidos a los consumidores vra el aumento de las larifas.
 Solamente el costo total de los subsidios energeticos en 2008 ascendi6 a 3.2% del PIB.


 AI mismo tiempo. Republica Dominicana alcanzo en 2008 un deficit de cuenta corriente cercano al 10%
 del PIB. que fue financiado por excepcionales flujos de lED. ingresos de credito bilateral y la reduccion
 de las reservas internacionales. Ante la contracci6n de los flujos de lED en 2009. el alto deficit de cuenta
 corriente presenta un riesgo imp0l1ante para la politica economica. EI deterioro del balance del sector
 externo refleja el modesto crecimiento de las exportaciones. el aumento de los precios internacionales de
 los alimentos. el auge en las importaciones de bienes de consumo y el incremento en los precios
 internacionales de los energeticos. de los cuales Republica Dominicana es importador nelo. En particular.
 la factura petrolera en 2008 represento el 26% de las importaciones totales y el 46% del deficit comercial.


  EI desequilibrio extemo lambien impact6 en el deficit del Sector Publico Consolidado (SPC) para el
  ejercicio fiscal de 2008 que alcanzo 4.6% del PIB. mientras que el ano anterior fue de 1.7%. A su vez. el
  deficit del Sector PUblico No Financiero (SPNF) lIeg6 al 3.4% del PIB en 2008. EI Gobiemo ha hecho un
  significati vo esfuerzo por mantener unas finanzas public as sanas mediante la reduccion de la deuda
  publica consolidada. la cual paso de 51.1 % del PIB en 2004 a 35.1 % en 2008. Aproximadamente la mitad

 de dicha deuda se encontraba denominada en moneda extranjera, por 10 que el Banco Central refinanci6
 una fracci6n importante de tftulos de deuda a principios de 2008 y extendi6 su perfodo de vencimiento.
 En adici6n, el Gobierno Central ha iniciado el program a de subastas de titulos en el mercado local que
 permitiria reducir aun mas el riesgo cambia rio. Todo esto, combinado con un adecuado plan de gastos de
 mediano plaza y la conduce ion de la politica fiscal y monetaria en un marco coherente son claves para
 preservar la solvencia del Estado, asf como la estabilidad economica y financiera del pafs.


 III. Programa de Gobierno Macroeconomico

 Ante el continuo deterioro del entomo econ6mico mundial, el Gobierno de Republica Dominicana
 pretende aplicar una politica anti-cielica a traves de la adopci6n de una posici6n fiscal expansiva y de un
 esfuerza gradual de consolidacion fiscal a mediano plazo. Sin embargo, para mantener un ni vel adecuado
 de gasto primario que permit a la reactivaci6n de la economfa requerira de financiamiento fiscal
 extraordinario en 2009-2010, en presencia de una contracci6n de los ingresos corrientes.


 Ratificando su comprom iso con la sostenibilidad fiscal , las autoridades del pafs han solicitado un
 Programa Stand-By al FM!, el cual se encuentra en etapa de negociaci6n y se espera sea aprobado por el
 Directorio del FM! y entre en vigor antes de que finalice el afio 2009. Con este marco, el Gobiemo refleja
 su compromiso con la estabi lidad macroecon6mica, el avance en las reformas sectoriales estructurales, y
 en particular en el sector electrico y la protecci6n del bienestar de los grupos menos favorecidos.



 IV. Programa de Gobierno para los Sectores Sociales. Reformas asociadas al Prestamo
 Programatico.

 A la fecha, la Republica Dominicana esta mejor equipada para proteger a sus ciudadanos mas pobres de
 los efectos de la crisis. EI gobierno ha estado desarrollando e institucionalizando un sistema focalizado
 de proteccion social, que permite al tiempo de proteger los segmentos de poblaci6n de menores ingresos,
 forta lecer los lineamientos de politica de educaci6n, salud y nutrici6n, asf como focalizar las politicas de
 subsidios energeticos. Este modelo recae sobre tres instancias que funcionan bajo la responsabi lidad del
 Gabinete de Coordinacion de Politica Social (GCPS), cuyo coordinador es el Vicepresidente de la
 Republica, con funciones especificas e interrelacionadas:
  i)   Sistema Voico de Beneficiarios (SIUBEN). En [uncionamiento desde 2004, el SIUBEN es un
       instrumento que promueve la focalizacion transparente y objetiva de los programas sociales, a traves
       de la identificaci6n y evaluaci6n socioeconomica de potenciales beneficiarios. Actualmente su base
       de datos cuenta con informaci6n sobre 1.5 rni1l6n de hogares (casi 60% de los hogares dominicanos),
       de los cuales aproximadamente 625 mil clasifican como pobres moderados e indigentes. Con apoyo
       financiero del Banco Mundial, existe un fuerte compromiso de la Direccion del SIUBEN de continuar
       su plan de fortalecimiento, con miras a realizar un nuevo ejercicio de relevamiento censal de
       informaci6n en 2010.

 ii) Programa Solidaridad. Creado a fines de 2005, este programa representa un cambio de enfoque en
     materia de asistencia social, al orientar de manera explfcita la entrega de transferencias a la inversi6n
     en capital humane por parte de los beneficiarios. Tiene como objetivo promover la ruptura de la
     transmisi6n intergeneracional de la pobreza, mejorando la inversi6n que las familias pobres realizan
     en educaci6n, salud y nutrici6n. EI programa cuenta con tres componentes principales: i) "Comer es
     Primero" (CEP), entrega RD$700 mensuales (US$19,5) por familia que haya cumplido como
     corresponsabilidades de asistencia a eventos de capacitacion y de salud para menores de entre 0 y 5
     afios; ii) EI "Incentivo a la Asistencia Escolar" (ILAE), entrega RD$150 mensuales (US$4.2) a las
     familias que tengan hijos entre 6 y 16 afios, inscritos entre el primer y octavo grado de educaci6n
     basica, siempre que asistan al menos 85% de las c1ases efectivas, y iii) "Dominican as y Dominicanos
     con Nombre y Apellido" que coordina con las instituciones responsables del registro civil, el tnimite
     preferencial y gratuito de los miembros indocumentados de familias beneficiarias. EI presupuesto
     anualizado de Solidaridad para transferencias (CEP e ILAE) es aproximadamente US$150 millones
     (alrededor de 0,3% del PIB de 2008 a precios constantes).
 iii) Administradora de Subsidios Sociales (ADESS) A fin de separar la funcion de pago de la de
      identificacion y seleccion de beneficiarios, se estableci6 esta instancia con la responsabilidad de
      gerenciar el medio de pago uti Iizado para e l pago de las transferencias, es decir, la tarjeta Solidaridad.
      Esta tarjeta de debito que funciona en la plataforma del sistema financiero nacional es utilizada en los
      establecimientos de la Red de Abasto Social (RAS), constituida principal mente par almacenes de
      abastos minoristas, conocidos como "colmados".


 Por otra parte, el Gobiemo ha previsto que frente a la situaci6n economica adversa, donde los mas pobres
 tienden a desinvertir en su capital humane y por tanto a reducir sus posibilidades de superar la pobreza
 por medios propios, se registre un incremento de la demanda por intervenciones que protejan el bienestar
                       0
 de la poblacion. Por 1 que, el actual contexto economico incrementa la necesidad de asignar el gasto en
 proteccion social de una manera mas efectiva y eficiente.

 La priori dad del Gobiemo, por tanto en materia social, es proteger a los segmentos de poblacion pobre, al
 tiempo que mejora el desempeiio de las instituciones y la transparencia en la asignacion y uso de los
 recursos destinados a los sectores sociales. Los principales avances registrados en la implementacion del

 Un componente importante de este primer pilar consiste en usar recursos publicos para alcanzar una
 distribuci6n de opOltunidades mas equitativa. La Republica Dominicana ha estado mejorando y continua
 mejorando sus redes sociales para proteger a los pobres contra los efectos de recientes choques exogenos,
 incluyendo las crisis de alimentos y de combustible de mediados del 2008 y la financiera y econ6mica
 global en curso.
 Con objetivos similares a otros programas de la regi6n, Solidaridad promueve la inversion en salud,
 nutrici6n y educaci6n (en capita l humano) de los mas pobres mediante un incentivo mensual en efectivo.
 Los logros en este sentido no han side despreciables: i) el Gobiemo se ha alejado del modele c1ientelista
 tradicional del pais en materias de politicas sociales, desarrollando e instituc ionalizando el Sistema Unico
 de Beneficiarios (SIUBEN) como mecanismo de foca lizacion de los elegibles ii) las autoridades han
 logrado una asignaci6n mas eficiente de las transferencias y subsidios sociales iii) este nuevo esquema de
 intervenci6n social ha elevado la transparencia en la asignaci6n y uso de los recursos publicos al estar
 c1aramente identificados los beneficiarios y los montos asignados por cada transferencia 0 subsidio a cad a
 hogar elegib le, iv) se ha fortalecido la capacidad de respuesta oportuna del Gobierno ante eventualidades
 naturales 0 economicas como las alzas de los precios de los alimentos y de los combustibles, y v) este
 mecanisme ha conducido a importantes ahorros fiscales, como los obtenidos por la focalizacion del
 subsidio al gas licuado de petr61eo (GLP) y los que se espera obtener con el des monte del subsidio
 geognifico (PRA) y la implementaci6n del subsidio a la demanda BonoLUZ a traves de la Tarjeta y el
 Programa Solidaridad.

 No obstante 1 anterior, el Gobiemo ha decidido como 1 refleja el decreta 118-09 reordenar y fortalecer
                                                        0
 el Sistema de Protecci6n Social, y las entidades que los integran con el prop6sito de incrementar su
 eficiencia, transparencia y coordinaci6n. Como forma de operacionalizar este mandato el Gabinete de
 Coordinacion de Politica Social estableci6 el Comire Tecnico Interinstitucional como un espacio de
 coordinaci6n de las tres entidades Solidaridad, SIUBEN y ADESS, que ha facilitado el estab lecimiento
 del Manual de Procesos Transversales para el Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas.(PTC). Es claro
 que en este proceso, queda por c1arificar conceptual mente la funci6n de Solidaridad como programa de
 protecci6n social, paulatinamente confusa con la inclusi6n a su ambito operativo de transferencias no
 condicionadas, como BonoGas.


  Restructuracion del Programa Solidaridad. EI Gobiemo inici6 en febrero de 2009 un proceso de
  consolidaci6n fundamental del program a de transferencias condicionadas Solidaridad a fin de fortalecer
  su capacidad de promoci6n del capital humane e incrementar su eficiencia, al reconocer que el esquema
  de corresponsabilidades no podia implementarse por debilidades en la oferta de servicios sociales 0 de las
  coordinaciones intersectoriales. En este sentido, el Gabinete de Coordinaci6n de Politica Social estableci6
  el Comire Tecnico Intersectorial de Solidaridad con la finalidad de incrementar su coordinaci6n operativa
  con los sectores sociales (Educaci6n y Salud), y con los responsables de la asignaci6n de recursos
  (Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda), y evitar la duplicaci6n de funciones y de sistemas, de forma tal que se
  pueda fortalecer el proceso de verificaci6n comprensivo y sistematico de las corresponsabilidades
  exigidas por dicho programa entre la poblacion beneficiaria objetivo.  fi

 Lo anterior ha permitido ajustar el esquema de transferencias, corresponsabilidades y capacitaci6n a
 beneficiarios de manera que esten mas alineadas con las prioridades, program as y estandares sectoriales, y
 tambien para que promuevan cambios de comportamiento que se correspondan con las causas de la
                                0
 problematica sectorial, todo 1 cual ha quedado plasmado en el Manual del Programa de Transferencias
 Condicionadas de Solidaridad. De esta manera, en salud el programa se alinea con la aplicaci6n del
 componente de promoci6n y prevenci6n del Plan Basico de Salud a la poblaci6n pobre que se encuentra
 en su mayorfa afi liada al Regimen Subsidiado de Salud, en tanto que en educaci6n, se incluye en el
 rediseno de Solidaridad, la educaci6n inicial y el primer cicio de educaci6n media, ambos objetivos de
 los Planes del sector educati yo.
 Asimismo, y en aras de asegurar la transparencia del Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas de
 Solidaridad, el Gobiemo ha decidido implementar un plan de expansi6n de los establecimientos de la Red
 de Abastos Sociales (RAS) en los cuales los beneficiarios hacen efectivo, mediante sus compras, las
 transferencias sociales. Este plan tiene como finalidad i) promover la competencia entre comercios
 adherentes, ii) ampli ar la oferta de productos en los establecimientos, y iii) reducir el tiempo de
 transacci6n de los beneficiarios y en consecuencia los costos transaccionales. Existe el compromiso del
 Gobiemo de evaluar el impacto de este plan y de aplicar las recomendaciones que surjan de la dicha
 evaluaci6n.
 Otros objetivos de la reestructuraci6n del program a de transferencias condicionadas de Solidaridad son: i)
 la desconcentraci6n y automatizac i6n de su cicio operativo y el fortalecimiento de la estructura
 organizativa comunitaria, con el fin de reducir costos y mejorar la atenci6n a beneficiarios; ii) la
 sistematizaci6n del monitoreo y evaluaci6n, a fin de fortalecer la gesti6n y la rendici6n de cuentas. En
 ambos casos, el gobiemo cuenta con el apoyo financiero del Banco Mundial, mediante la ampliaci6n del
 PIPS y del Banco Interamericano de Desarro llo mediante la operaci6n Apoyo al Programa de Protecci6n
 Social (primera fase) (DR-Ll039).
 Alineacion y sinergias con las politicas de educacion y salud.
 En Educacion. Dentro de las metas del Plan Decenal de Educaci6n para el perfodo 2008-20 18 que se
 alinean con el fomento del capital humane de los pobre estan: i) movilizar las voluntades publicas y
 privadas con el objetivo de asegurar que la poblaci6n de 5 anos reciba un ano de Educaci6n Inicial y 8
 anos de Educaci6n Basica inclusiva y de calidad, ii) consoli dar, expandir y diversificar el Nivel de
 Educaci6n Media y la modalidad de Educaci6n de Adultos de calidad, con el objetivo de crear ciudadanfa
 y como paso al mercado laboral y/o a la educaci6n superior, iii) establecer claros estandares de calidad y
 un sistema de evaluaci6n que permita monitorear el desempeno del sistema educati vo, que estimu le la
 movilizaci6n de la escuela, la familia y la comunidad en favor de una mejor educaci6n y garantice al pafs
 que certificados y (ftulos otorgados esten avalados por los aprendizajes previstos; y iv) promover la
 equidad educativa con apoyo a las estudiantes provenientes de los sectores sociales mas vulnerables.
  En este sentido, y como fonna de garantizar que la poblaci6n, a partir de los 5 anos, alcance al menos 9
  anos de educaci6n inicial y basica y de evaluar la calidad de los conocimientos adquiridos, la Secretarfa
  de Estado de Educaci6n ha establecido la vigencia de la definici6n de los estandares de evaluaci6n de
  estudiantes para los niveles de educaci6n inicial y el primer cicio de educaci6n basica.

  para verificar y mon itorear e l cumpli miento por parte de los beneficiarios de las corresponsabilidades del
  program a y los resultados de educaci6n , se manifiesta en el desarrollo reciente de un Sistema de Gesti6n
  de Centro Escolar "SGCE" por la Secretaria de Estado de Educacion.

 En Salud el objetivo central es forta lecer el primer nivel de cuidado para mejorar el acceso por parte de
 los pobres a servicios basicos de salud con calidad mejorada. La Secretaria de Estado de Salud Pub lica y
 Asistencia Social (SESPAS) ha estado trabajando en un plan para fortalecer infraestructura, equ ipos,
 recursos humanos, medicinas y otros inputs al nivel primario y secundario de cuidado. Parte de todo este
 esfuerzo es la introducci6n de un nuevo sistema de monitoreo de instrumentos y protocolos de
 cumplimiento.

 ii) Mejora del manejo presupues/al en apoyo a la gestion conjunta de los Sec/ores Sociales en el marco
 del Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas Rediseiiado
 Las reformas de las politicas en este primer pi lar trabajan sobre medidas anteriores que sirvieron para
 fortalecer a las instituciones de l sector publico del area de presupuesto y manejo de las finanzas, iniciadas
 desde el 2006. Una innovacion introducida por las leyes mencionadas es el presupuesto pluri-anual del
 sector pub lico, que define las condiciones financieras de gastos publicos en general y del plan de la
 inversi6n publica en particu lar.
 En el proceso de coordinacion con las sectoriales y para superar los deficits de oferta que no permitieron
 que el programa Solidaridad se desalToli ara a plenitud, el Gobierno ha identificado las brechas de oferta
 para cubrir la demanda adicional generada por el nuevo esquema de transferencias disefiado. De esta
 manera, con un horizonte de Ires afios se han cuantificado conjuntamente con las sectoriales las
 necesidades de inversi6n que se requiere para alinear la oferta de servicios con la demanda.
 A fin de transparentar el uso y destino de los fondos publicos, en el mismo Comite Tecnico Intersectorial,
 del cual la Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda forma parte, a traves de la Direccion General de Presupuesto,
 establecio de manera consensuada un mecanismo por el cual los recursos asignados en el presupuesto del
 2010 - 2012 destinados a cubrir las brechas de ofel1a no puedan ser uti lizados para otros fines que los
 estab lecidos en la cuantificacion y cronograma de ejecuci6n trienal presentada por el Coordinador del
 Gabinete de Politicas Sociales a la Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda para la reduce ion progresiva de,las
 brechas. En este mismo tenor, a nive l operativo se plantea que el Sistema de Gesti6n Financiera (SIGEF)
 pueda generar reportes de alerta para facil itar el seguimiento y monitoreo por parte del Comite
 intersectorial.


  iii) Aplicacion gradual de acuerdos de desempeiio entre Organos Rec/ores y los Sec/ores Sociales

  Una iI1I1ovaci6n reciente importante es el desarrollo de Acuerdo por Desempefio para reforzar la
  orientaci6n por resultados en la administraci6n presupuestaria y rendicion de cuentas. Estos contratos por
  resultados y desempefio estan disefiados para proveer un enlace gerencial flexib le entre las fuentes de
  presupuestos provistos y las mejoras deseadas en el desempefio del sector social. Los mismos incluiran
  compromisos con referencia a: (i) cumpl imiento de politicas, metas y objetivos verificables con
  indicadores de desempefio, por las autoridades de mayor jerarquia de las agencias y Secretarfas de Estado
  involucradas establecidos en los acuerdos por desempefio con los organos rectores; (ii) Mayor flexibilidad

 Este pn!stamo programatico de tres anos para politicas de desarrollo sobre desempeno y rendici6n de
 cuentas en los sectores sociales se enmarca dentro de la nueva ali anza estrategica del Banco Mundial con
 la Republica Domini cana de proteger a los pobres al tiempo que se fortalecen las instituciones y la
 rendici6n de cuentas sobre el desempeno del sector publico en el pafs, mejorando la transparencia en la
 asignaci6n y uso de los fond as publicos. Esta primera operaci6n permitir;! apuntalar varios de los
 objeti vos estrategicos de dicha alianza: a) fortalecer la cohesi6n social y mejorar el acceso y la calidad de
 los servicios sociales; b) ampliar la calidad del gasto publico y e l desarrollo institucional y c) fortalecer la
 capacidad institucional y generar alianzas para promover reformas.

 En este senti do, la Secretarfa de Estado de Administraci6n Publica ha realizado un diagn6stico
 institucional que ha permitido evaluar de manera pre liminar el ni ve l de preparaci6n y las necesidades de
 capacitaci6n para la int roducci6n de acuerdos de desempeno en los sectores de educaci6n y sa Iud. EI
 referido informe preliminar sera revisado por los 6rganos rectores con las respecti vas Secretarias
 Sectoriales para la formulaci6n de un informe final de Evaluaci6n de Condiciones de cada lIna de elias
 suscrito por los 6rganos rectores. Como parte de este proceso se encuentra en vfas de ejecuci6n lin
 trabaj o de acompanamiento tecnico de la Secretarfa de Economfa con las Secretarfas de Estado de
 Educaci6n y Salud con el objetivo de realizar un primer ejercicio para la fir ma de contratos; y a la vez
 establecer un acuerdo de evaluaci6n y asistencia tecnica al fortalecimiento institucional en los pr6x imos
 tres anos con miras a la aplicaci6n gradual de los contratos par resultados y desempenos.

 Convenios Internos de Gestion en Salud. En adici6n, en el caso de salud, se han establecido dos
 convenios de gesti6n entre la Secretarfa de Estado de Salud y Asistencia Social (SESPAS) y las
 direcciones regionales de salud de l Cibao Central y del Valle, en los cuales dicha Secretarfa promueve
 dentro de sus funciones de rectorfa la desconcentraci6n y descentralizaci6n de los servicios sanitarios. En
 dichos convenios se establecen los compromisos y objetivos que han de orientar las intervenciones en 1    0

  ivl Mayor transparencia elt el presupuesto nacional y supervisi6n de la Sociedad Civil en los seclOres
  sociales

  EI Gobiemo sigue comprometido con la implementaci6n de ley de acceso a la informaci6n vigente en
  nuestro pais. En relaci6n con este Prestamo Programatico de tres afios en particular, el Gobiemo esta
  comprometido en el fortalecimiento del acceso a la informaci6n acerca del presupuesto nacional.
  Especfficamente, la Secretaria de Estado de Hacienda tiene previsto el desarrollo e implementaci6n de un
  sistema de "consulta amigable" - proveniente de la info rmaci6n adecuada del SIGEF.

  Ademas, con la finalidad de hacer transparentes las acciones del Gabinete de Politica Social, las entidades
  que forman parte del Sistema de Proteccion Social han propiciado la publicaci6n de los elegibles,
  beneficiarios, asi como de los montos transados por e l Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas de
  Solidaridad, los cuales pueden ser consultados en las paginas web de cualquiera de estas entidades.
  Asimismo, mas recientemente y como apoyo a la transparencia del gasto publico se han publicado el
  monto de las brechas de oferta de los servicios de salud, nutricion y educacion, que alcanzan para el
  trienio 2010-20 12 a US$323.7 millones. Asimismo, ha sido un compromiso del gobiemo que la sociedad
  civil no s610 tenga acceso a la informacion, si no que participe de la evaluaci6n de los actuaciones de los
  sectores sociales. En este marco, el Gobierno estara trabaj ando para fortalecer el sistema de participacion
  comunitari a y de veeduria social del Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas.

  V isto estas acciones del program a de Gobiemo, este primer prestamo programatico de tres afios por valor
  de ciento cincuenta millones de dolares de Estados de Unidos de America (USD$ 150.0MM) para
  Desempeiio y Rendicion de Cuentas para los Sectores Sociales por parte de l Banco Mundial toma
  particular relevancia, y se enmarca dentro de la nueva estrategia conjunta del pais y dicha institucion

Mr. Robert Zoellick
President
World Bank
Washington D.C.
United States of America

Reference: Letter of Development Policy for a Programmatic Loan on Performance and
Accountability in the Social Sector

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

I am pleased to convey to you, in the name of the Dominican Republic, the interest and
commitment of the Dominican Government to prioritize and accelerate public sector reforms,
thereby improving the performance of the social sectors, promoting actions to strengthen the
human capital of the poorest citizens and continuing the improvements to public finance
administration begun in 2006. This programmatic loan, based on development policies for
performance and accountability in the social sectors, will help us implement key aspects of these
priorities.

The magnitude of the international crisis and uncertainty about its duration has had a clear
negative impact on fiscal income in the first half of 2009, making it opportune to access this
source of financing to better face the problems generated by this global economic crisis and
adequately focus resources for the social sectors.

In the face of the current international situation, the Dominican Republic and multilateral
organizations have reinvigorated their work agenda for 2009 to confront the external difficulties,
improve the efficiency and quality of public services, reduce vulnerabilities for those at the base
of the social pyramid and prioritize and accelerate public sector reforms with the objective of
creating sufficient fiscal space to fund priority social programs and investments essential to
continue the development of our economy.

I. Government Vision

The Dominican Government is undertaking the deepest agenda of institutional reforms of the last
50 years to the state's financial system. These reforms have impacted areas of internal oversight,
budgeting, treasury, accounting and public credit, and incorporate medium-term public
expenditure planning. This process, which began in 2006, includes changes in the National


                                                92
System of Planning and Public Investment, the Economy Secretariat, the Finance Secretariat and
the Budget Law. At the same time, it involves substantial changes to the public credit,
procurement, treasury and internal oversight regimes.

A result of this reform process is the new National Planning System, within which is the
National Development Strategy (Estrategia Nacional de Desarrollo--END), now being
designed to consolidate the long-term vision. Of the five main axes identified in the END, this
loan will specifically support those related to: 1) Social Development; 2) Sustainable Economic
Growth; and 3) Institutional Development.

In consonance with the strategic axes, an agenda of actions are being implemented during the
2008-2012 period which orient around three pillars: a) improve the efficiency of public spending
by strengthening the budgetary function, the administration of public spending and focusing
spending aimed at reducing poverty and improving development; b) promote fiscal sustainability
by mitigating the inter-temporal impact of the global crisis on public finances and reducing
vulnerability to future shocks; and c) improve the climate for growth and private sector job
creation by assuring financial sector stability and increasing international competitiveness.

II. Macroeconomic Management

The Dominican Republic has been one the most dynamic economies in Latin America in the past
two decades. During 1991-2008, the Dominican economy grew 6.02 percent on average
annually, the second highest in Latin America after Chile. These growth rates have been based
on exports, increased activity in the tourism sector, and more recently, the non-tradable goods
sectors.

This scenario of high growth was interrupted by the financial crisis of 2002-2003, which affected
several private commercial banks. The crisis generated significant consequences in terms of
inflation, devaluation and a deterioration of the fiscal and external accounts. To recover
macroeconomic stability, the Government took important actions in fiscal and monetary policy,
in coordination with the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic and fiscal authorities, which
contained the crisis and reversed the economic contraction in a short time. This financial crisis
led to needed regulatory and technical reforms to the Dominican financial system, such that the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) evaluation has been very favourable.

Following the period of instability, growth has been very high, achieving 9.5 percent annually in
2005-2008. Nonetheless, and despite growth of 7.5 percent in the first half of 2008, growth
started to decelerate in the third quarter of 2008 due to the impact of the international crisis and
partially due to the effects of restrictive monetary policy, implemented to contain price
fluctuations generated by the generalized increase in hydrocarbon prices on international markets
in 2008. At the close of 2008, growth was 5.3 percent.

During 2005-2007, the Dominican Republic achieved positive results in terms of fiscal balances,
debt levels, international reserves and inflation. The primary fiscal surplus reached 1.3 percent of
GDP in 2007, up from 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent in 2006 and 2005, respectively. This



                                                93
improvement was principally due to higher revenue due to tax reforms and better administration
of that income, as well as an increase in nickel exports in 2007.


The Liquidity Crisis of 2008-2009: The drastic change in the international environment in 2008
had adverse effects on the Dominican economy. The deteriorating global economic situation has
strongly reduced tourism services demand, exports, foreign investment and remittances.
Additionally, the risk and liquidity adjustments of international financial markets and the rise in
the reference interest rate has increased the cost of credit for the country and made it more
difficult to access external financing.

The advances achieved in fiscal stabilization were reversed with the increase in petroleum prices
and the start of the global crisis. A large part of the disequilibrium was due to rising spending,
particularly in transfers to the electricity sector, subsidies to liquid propane gas (LPG) and
subsidies to foodstuffs in the basic consumption basket. Higher international hydrocarbon prices
and the subsequent higher cost of electricity generation was absorbed by the Government instead
of being transferred to consumers via higher tariffs. The cost of energy subsidies alone rose to
3.2 percent of GDP in 2008.

At the same time, the Dominican Republic posted a current account deficit in 2008 of close to 10
percent of GDP, which was financed by exceptional foreign direct investment flows, bilateral
credit and drawing down international reserves. In the face of contracting foreign direct
investment flows in 2009, the high current account deficit represents an important risk for
economic policy. The deteriorating external sector balance reflects a modest increase in exports,
rising international food prices, rising imports of consumption goods and increasing international
energy prices, of which the Dominican Republic is a net importer. The petroleum bill in 2008
represented 26 percent of total imports and 46 percent of the trade deficit.

External imbalances also impacted the consolidated public sector deficit for fiscal year 2008,
which reached 4.6 percent of GDP compared to 1.7 percent the year before. The non-financial
public sector deficit was 3.4 percent of GDP in 2008. The Government has made significant
efforts to maintain healthy public finances via the reduction of consolidated public debt, which
fell from 51.1 percent of GDP in 2004 to 35.1 percent in 2008. Approximately half of public debt
is denominated in foreign currency, of which the Central Bank refinanced and extended the
maturity of an important share at the start of 2008. In addition, the Government has initiated a
program of bond auctions on the local market, which will further reduce exchange rate risk. All
this, combined with an adequate medium-term spending plan and the conduction of fiscal and
monetary policy within a more coherent framework, are key to preserve the solvency of the state
as well as the economic and financial stability of the country.

III. Government Macroeconomic Program

Faced with the continued deterioration of the world economy, the Government of the Dominican
Republic intends to apply an anti-cyclical policy through the adoption of an expansive fiscal
policy and a gradual effort at fiscal consolidation in the medium term. Nonetheless, maintaining



                                                94
an adequate level of primary spending that permits economic reactivation will require
extraordinary fiscal financing in 2009-2010, due to a contraction in current revenue.

Ratifying its commitment to fiscal sustainability, the authorities have requested a Stand-By
Agreement with the IMF, which is now in negotiations and is expected to be approved by the
IMF board and enter into effect before the end of 2009. With this, the Government reflects its
commitment to macroeconomic stability, the advance of structural sectoral reforms, in particular
in the electricity sector, and protecting the welfare of less advantaged groups.

IV. Government Program for the Social Sectors. Reforms Associated with the
Programmatic Loan.

The Dominican Republic is now better equipped to protect its poorest citizens from the effects of
the crisis. The Government has been developing and institutionalizing a focalized system of
social protection that permits at the same time protecting the lowest-income members of the
population, strengthening education, health and nutrition policies, and focusing energy subsidies.
This model depends upon three components with specific, inter-related functions that operate
under the responsibility of the Social Policy Coordination Cabinet, the coordinator of which is
the national vice-president:
    1) Unified System of Beneficiaries (Sistema Único de Beneficiarios--SIUBEN). In
        operation since 2004, SIUBEN is an instrument that promotes the transparent and
        objective focalization of social programs via the socioeconomic identification and
        evaluation of potential beneficiaries. Currently its database has information on more than
        1.5 million households (almost 60 percent of Dominican households), of which
        approximately 625,000 are classified as moderately or extremely poor. With the financial
        support of the World Bank, the leadership of the SIUBEN is strongly committed to
        continuing its plan of improvement, with the intention of undertaking a new information
        census in 2010.
    2) Solidarity Program. Created at the end of 2005, this program represents a change in
        social assistance focus, orienting transfers directly toward investments in human capital
        on the part of the beneficiaries. Its objective is to help break the inter-generational
        transmission of poverty, improving the investments that poor families make in education,
        health and nutrition. The program has three main components: i) "Eating is First" (Comer
        es Primero--CEP), which offers RD$700 (US$19.50) per month to each family who has
        attended specialized training and health events for children between 0 and 5 years; ii)
        Incentive for School Attendence (Incentivo a la Asistencia Escolar--ILAE), which
        provides RD$150 (US$4.20) each month to families with children between 6 and 16
        years old enrolled in primary school and attending at least 85 percent of classes; and iii)
        Dominicans with a Name (Dominicanas y Dominicanos con Nombre y Apellido), which
        coordinates the institutions responsible for the civil registry and offers preferential and
        free treatment to undocumented members of beneficiary families. The annual transfer
        budget for the Solidarity program (CEP and ILAE) is approximately US$150 million
        (about 0.3 percent of 2008 GDP at constant prices).
    3) Social Subsidy Administrator (Administradora de Subsidios Sociales--ADESS). With
        the aim of separating the functions of payment from the identification and selection of
        beneficiaries, an authority was created with the responsibility for administering the


                                                95
       payment method utilized for transfers, the Solidarity card. This debit card, which
       functions on the national financial platform, is used in the Social Supply Network (Red
       de Abasto Social--RAS), made up principally of retail supply stores known as colmados.

The Government has expects that, in the face of an adverse economic situation in which the
poorest tend to disinvest in their human capital and thus reduce their ability to overcome poverty
by their own means, demand will rise for interventions to protect the wellbeing of the population.
Thus the current economic context increases the need to assign spending to social protection in a
more efficient and effective manner.

The Government's priority in social policy is to protect the poorest members of society while at
the same time improving institutional performance and the transparency in the assignment and
use of resources destined for the social sectors. The main advances registered in the
implementation of the Government program intrinsically related to the objectives of the
programmatic loan are: i) improved productivity in the social sectors with the objective of
promoting human capital development among the poorest; ii) better budget administration in
support of the joint management of the social sectors within the framework of the redesigned
conditional transfer program; iii) gradual application of performance agreements in the social
sectors; and iv) increased transparency in the national budget, with a special focus on social
programs such as Solidarity, and greater civil society oversight of the social sectors.

i) Improved productivity in the social sectors with the objective of promoting human capital
development among the poorest

An important component of this first pillar consists in using public resources to achieve a more
equitable distribution of opportunities. The Dominican Republic continues to improve its social
networks to protect the poorest against the effects of recent exogenous shocks, including the food
and fuel crisis starting in mid-2008 and the ongoing global economic crisis.

Solidarity is similar to other programs in the region in that it promotes investments in education
and health (human capital development) of the poorest via a monthly cash incentive.
Achievements thus far are non-negligible: i) the Government has moved away from the
country's traditional clientelist model of social policies, developing and institutionalizing the
SIUBEN as a mechanism for selecting eligible beneficiaries; ii) authorities have achieved a more
efficient assignation of transfers and social subsidies; iii) this new scheme of social intervention
has increased the transparency in assigning and using public resources, with beneficiaries and the
amounts of each transfer or subsidy to each eligible household clearly identified; iv) the
Government's capacity to respond promptly to natural or economic events such as increases in
food and fuel prices has improved; and v) these mechanisms have led to important fiscal savings,
such as those obtained by focusing the LPG subsidy and those expected to be achieved with the
dismantling of the geographic electricity subsidy (PRA) and the implementation of the BonoLuz
subsidy using the Solidarity card.

Despite these success, the Government has decided--as reflected in Decree 118-09--to reorder
and strengthen the social protection system and the organizations that integrate it with the aim of
increasing its efficiency, transparency and coordination. To operationalize this mandate, the


                                                96
Social Policy Coordination Cabinet established the Inter-Institutional Technical Committee as a
coordination space for Solidarity, SIUBEN and ADESS, which has facilitated the creation of the
Transversal Process Manual for the conditional transfer program. As part of this process, the
conceptual role of Solidarity as a social protection program needs to be clarified, as non-
conditional transfers such as BonoGas are incorporated into its operational mandate.

Restructuring the Solidarity Program. In February 2009 the Government launched a
consolidation of the conditional transfer program Solidarity, with the aim of strengthening its
capacity to promote human capital and increase its efficiency, in recognition of the fact that the
co-responsibility scheme could not be fully implemented due to weaknesses in the supply of
social services and of inter-sectoral coordination. The Social Policy Coordination Cabinet
established the Solidarity Inter-Sectoral Technical Committee with the aim of increasing
operational coordination in the social sectors (education and health) and avoiding duplication of
functions and systems, and in this way strengthen the comprehensive and systematic verification
of the co-responsibility activities required of the target population by the program.

The above actions have led to the adjustment of the transfer, co-responsibility and beneficiary
training schemes such that they are more closely aligned with sectoral priorities, programs and
standards, and also so that they promote behavioural changes that correspond to the causes of the
sectoral challenges, all of which is incorporated in the Solidarity program manual. In health, the
program is aligned with the promotion and prevention component of the Basic Health Plan for
the poor, who are mostly affiliated with the Subsidized Health Regimen. In education, both pre-
school and the first cycle of middle school are included in the Solidarity redesign, both of which
are objectives of education sector plans.

With the aim of ensuring the transparency of Solidarity, the Government has decided to
implement an extension plan for the Social Supply Network (Red de Abasto Social--RAS)
establishments, where beneficiaries use program transfers to make purchases. This plan has the
aim of: i) promoting competition among participating business; ii) broadening the offer of
products in the establishments; and iii) reducing the transaction time and cost to the
beneficiaries. The Government is committed to evaluate the impact of this plan and apply
recommendations coming out of the evaluation.

Other objectives of the Solidarity restructuring include: i) deconcentrating and automating its
operating cycle and strengthening the community organization structure, with the aim of
reducing costs and improving beneficiary service; and ii) systematizing monitoring and
evaluation, to strengthen management and accountability. In both cases, the Government relies
on financial support from the World Bank, via the increase of PIPS, and the Inter-American
Development Bank via its operation, Support to the Social Protection Program (first phase) (DR-
L1039).

Alignment and synergies of education and health policies

In Education. Among the goals of the 10-year Education Program for 2008-2018 which are
aligned with human capital promotion for the poor are: i) mobilize public and private efforts to
ensure that children receive one year of primary school and eight years of basic education that is


                                               97
inclusive and high quality; ii) consolidate, expand and diversify middle school and adult
education, with the objective of promoting citizenship and as a stepping stone to the labor market
and/or higher education; iii) establish clear quality standards and an evaluation system that
permits the monitoring of education system performance, that motivates the school, family and
community to support a better education system and guarantees that awarded certificates and
titles are backed by the required learning; and iv) promote education quality with support for
students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds.

As a means of ensuring that children above the age of five complete at least nine years of pre-
school and primary education and to evaluate the learning acquired, the Education Secretariat
has put into effect student evaluation standards for pre-school and the first cycle of primary
school.

The recently developed School Administration System (Sistema de Gestión de Centro Escolar--
SGCE) by the Education Secretariat is being put into place. It will help improve inter-
institutional capacity and inter-sectoral collaboration between the Education Secretariat and
Solidarity to verify and monitor the completion of program co-responsibilities on the part of
beneficiaries and its education results, in alignment with the objectives of the redesigned
Solidarity program.

In Health. The central objective is to strengthen the first level of health care to improve access
by the poor to better-quality basic health services. The Public Health and Social Assistance
Secretariat has been working on a plan to strengthen infrastructure, equipment, human resources,
medicines and other inputs at the primary and secondary care levels. Part of this effort is the
introduction of a new system to monitor completion protocols and mechanisms.

ii) Better budget administration in support of the joint management of the social sectors within
the framework of the redesigned conditional transfer program

The policy reforms in this pillar focus on continuing actions underway since 2006 that have
helped strengthen public sector institutions in the area of budget and finance management. One
innovation introduced by law is the multi-year public sector budget, which defines the financial
conditions of public spending in general and public investment in particular.

In the process of sectoral coordination and to overcome the service supply deficits that impeded
Solidarity's implementation, the Government has identified service gaps in the coverage of
additional demand generated by the new transfer scheme. The investments required to align
service supply with demand were quantified jointly with the sectors over a three-year time
horizon.

With the goal of making the use and destination of public funds more transparent, the Inter-
Sectoral Technical Committee, of which the Finance Secretariat forms a part through the General
Directorate of the Budget, established by consensus a mechanism to ensure that the resources
assigned to the 2010-2012 budget to cover the service supply gaps are not put to uses other than
those established in the three-year plan presented by the Social Policy Coordination Cabinet to
the Finance Secretariat. At the operational level, it is proposed that the Financial Administration


                                                98
System (Sistema de Gestión Financiera--SIGEF) generate alerts to facilitate the oversight and
monitoring on the part of the Inter-Sectoral Committee.

iii) Gradual application of performance agreements in the social sectors

A recent important innovation is the development of performance agreements to strengthen the
results orientation in budget administration and accountability. These results and performance
contracts are designed to provide a flexible management link between budgeted resources and
desired improvements in social sector performance. They will include commitments related to: i)
completion of policies, goals and objectives with performance indicators verifiable by higher-
level authorities and state secretariats; ii) greater management flexibility by executing agencies
in the application of rules related to implementation, human resources and supply; and iii)
budgetary incentives for agencies and/or cash incentives for officials and employees for the
duration of the contract. An agreement was signed establishing the conditions for implementing
results and performance agreements between the authorities of the secretariats of Finance,
Economy, Public Adminstration, Education and Health.

This three-year programmatic loan for development policies on performance and accountability
in the social sectors is part of a new strategic alliance between the World Bank and the
Dominican Republic to protect the poor while strengthening the country's institutions and
accountability mechanisms for public sector performance and improving transparency in
assigning and using public funds. This first operation will support several of the strategic
objectives of this alliance: a) strengthen social cohesion and improve access to and quality of
social services; b) broaden the quality of public spending and institutional development; and c)
strengthen institutional capacity and generate alliances to promote reforms.

The Public Administration Secretariat has undertaken an institutional diagnostic giving a
preliminary evaluation of the level of skills and need for training to introduce performance
agreements in the education and health sectors. This preliminary report will be reviewed by the
leadership of the respective secretariats to formulate a final report evaluating the conditions of
each one of the sectors. As part of this process, technical assistance work is under way by the
Economy Secretariat with the Education and Health Secretariats with the aim of completing a
first round of contracts, as well as establishing an evaluation and technical assistence agreement
for institutional strengthening over the next three years with a view to the gradual application of
results and performance contracts.

Internal Management Agreements in Health. In addition, in the case of health, two
management agreements have been established between the Health and Social Assistance
Secretariat and the regional health offices of Cibao Central and Valle, which promote the
deconcentration and decentralization of medical services. These agreements establish
commitments and objectives that orient interventions related to developing service provision to
priority populations, within the legal framework governing the separation of functions and the
composition of the health service network.

As well, the Social Policy Coordination Cabinet and oversight institutions (the secretariats of
Economy, Finance and Public Administration) have signed an agreement committing to: i)


                                                99
initiate the gradual application of results and performance contracts; ii) evaluate the existing
level of institutional capacity development in the social secretariats, a necessary step to make
commitments within the framework of results-oriented management; iii) finalize a technical
assistance framework agreement to develop institutional capacities for results-oriented
management, or a results and performance contract, as relevant; and iv) implement policy actions
and institutional strengthening to improve the performance and accountability of the Solidarity
conditional transfer program.

iv) Greater transparency in the national budget and civil society supervision in the social sectors

The Government remains committed to implementing existing national laws on the access to
information. Regarding this three-year programmatic loan in particular, the Government is
committed to strengthening access to information on the national budget. In particular, the
Finance Secretariat plans to develop and implement a "friendly consultation" system for
information from the SIGEF.

As well, with the aim of making the activities of the social secretariats more transparent, the
institutions forming part of the social protection system have published information on
eligibility, beneficiaries and amounts of the Solidarity conditional transfer program, which can
be consulted on the web page of any one of these entities. More recently, and in support of the
transparency of public spending, the amount of the shortfall in health, nutrition and education
service provision--which amounts to US$323.7 million for 2010-2012--has been published.
The Government is committed that civil society not only has access to information, but also
participates in the evaluation of the actions of the social sectors. Accordingly, the Government
will be working to strengthen the community participation and social oversight systems for the
conditional transfer program.

In light of these actions by the Government, this first three-year programmatic loan in the
amount of one hundred and fifty million United States dollars (US$150 million) for the
Performance and Accountability in the Social Sectors on the part of the World Bank is
particularly relevant, and is part of the new joint strategy between the country and the financial
institution, approved on 17 September 2009.

I thank the World Bank for its continued support, and express my high regard for you and your
staff.

                                       (October 23, 2009)

 This letter updates the assessment by the L\1F Executive Board at the time oftheftrst Past-
 Program Monitoring Review (see the Public Information Notice 09106 ofJanuary 12, 2009,
 available at http://www.imforglexternal/nplseclpnl2009/pn0906.htm).Sincethen.anIivlF
 mission visited Santo Domingo twice to carry out the 2009 Article IV consultation and
 negotiate a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The authorities signed the Letter 0/Intent and
 Memorandum o/Economic and Financial Policies outlining their program and requesting
'lMF support in the form of a 28-month SEA for 500 percent ofquota (approximately
US$1.7 billion/on October 6,2009. A meeting of the L\1F Executive Board to discuss the
program and conclude the 2009 Article IV consultation is tentatively scheduled/or early-
November 2009.                            .

 1.       The economy has felt the effects of the global crisis. Growth has decelerated
 rapidly from over 5 percent in 2008 to an expected Yz to 1Yz percent in 2009, a sizable output
 gap is emerging and headline inflation has also fallen rapidly to -1 Yz percent yoy in
 September, 2009. A large decline in exports, tourism and remittances has been more than
 offset by falling imports (partially due to the decline in the international price of oil and
 food), leading to a reduction in the external current account deficit from around 10 percent of
 GDP in 2008 to an expected 6 percent ofGDP in 2009. The banking system remains well-
 capitalized and has not been directly affected by the global crisis, but non-performing loans
 are rising slightly and profitability is beginning to decline.

  2.      The authorities have reacted to the crisis with available policy instruments, but
  fiscal policy has been constrained by tight external financing. Monetary policy was
  loosened throughout 2009, with the policy interest rate lowered 550 basis points to 4 percent,
  and reserve requirements also lowered considerably. Fiscal policy was tight in the first half
  of the year as a decline in tax revenue of 12 percent to August (with respect to 2008) was met
. with a similar decline in expenditure. A passive scenario suggests that without additional
  financing the deficit of the consolidated public sector could end the year at 2Yz percent of
  GDP, an adjustment of2 percentage points ofGDP with respect to 2008 and one percentage
  point of GDP with respect to the 200? budget.

  3.      The authorities' program aims to limit the effects ofthe globaJ slowdown on the
  economy while establishing the conditions for robust and sustainable growth. The short-
  term program is expected to catalyze fmancing for the conduct of a counter-cyclical fiscal
  policy. Additional expenditures in public investment and social programs would bring the
  consolidated public sector deficit to 4Yz percent of GDP for 2009 and 4 percent of GDP in
  2010, imparting a fiscal impulse in the last quarter of2009 and the first half of201 O.
  Monetary policy will remain accommodative to support the fiscal expansion. From mid·20 10
  onward the program calls for a gradual fiscal consolidation which will lead to a primary
  surplus ofthe combined public sector of2 percent ofGDP by 2012 and thereafter, a level
. which will bring the publi<; debt-to-GDP ratioback to its 2008 level (35 percent) by 2014.

 This wil.l be accompanied by stnictural reforms including in tax administration, the electricity
 sector, financial supervision, the conduct of monetary policy and the management of public
 debt, which will help the economy achieve rapid and sustainable gwwth in the medium-term.

  4.      The active role of the Multilateral Development Banks will be key to the success
  of the program. In particular, World Bank resources will finance an important part of the
  fiscal impulse in 2009-10. It is also expected that the authorities tap the expertise of the
. World Bank in several reform areas, especially the challenging energy reform, where past
  reform efforts have fallen short of expectation.
