                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         This is the first in a planned series of three Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to support the strengthening of the Performance and Accountability of Social
                         Sectors (PASS) in the DR. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve results in social sectors (mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in
                         the short term, and enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the poorest citizens. Consistent with this vision, the PASS DPLs have four inter-related
                         objectives: (a) to enhance the performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens, through a
                         fundamental redesign of the Government#s CCT program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education; (b) to improve budget
                         management to support the performance of the social sector within the CCT program; (c) to support the gradual implementation of Performance Agreements in
                         social sectors; and (d) to enhance transparency and accountability to users in social sectors by strengthening the enabling environment for a better informed
                         demand for improved public sector performance in the social domain.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved on November 17, 2009. The Loan Agreement was signed right after Board approval on November 18, 2009. Effectiveness was met on December 1, 2009
                         with single-tranche disbursement having taken place shortly thereafter in December 2009.
                         The Government has achieved all of the prior actions defined in this first DPL of the series and remains highly committed to the reform agenda supported by the PASS series.
                         Successful outcomes and outputs of the Government actions to date include: (i) restructured legal and regulatory framework to strengthen the Borrower's social protection system; (ii)
                         revamped institutional framework and operative rules of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, Solidaridad, including the creation of the CCT Intersectoral and
                         Interinstitutional Committees to verify compliance with CCT co-responsibilities; (iii) validation of student evaluation standards for pre-primary education and the first cycle of Basic
                         Education leading to enhance Ministry of Education capacity to assess learning outcomes at these grade levels; (iv) development of a plan to expand the network of payment-
