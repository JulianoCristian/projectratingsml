of Social Sectors (PASS) in\n            the Dominican Republic (DR). This operation is being\n            proposed as the first of a series of three sequential\n            programmatic operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is\n            to improve results in social sectors (mainly social\n            protection, education and health), preserving in the short\n            term, and enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of\n            the poorest citizens. Consistent with this vision, the PASS\n            has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the\n            performance of social sectors to promote human capital\n            (health, nutrition, education) for the poorest citizens,\n            through a fundamental redesign of the Government's\n            Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program, and its\n            articulation with critical actions in health and education;\n            (ii) to improve budget management to support the joint\n            performance of the social sector within the CCT program, as\n            part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of\n            social spending and support the required improvements in the\n            supply of health, nutrition and education services; (iii) to\n            support the gradual introduction of performance agreements\n            in key social sector agencies; and (iv) to enhance\n            transparency and oversight in social sectors. This document\n            is structured as follows: (a) country context (section two);\n            (b) government's program and operation rationale,\n            discussing the outlook and policy challenges for enhancing\n            the performance and accountability of social sectors, as\n            well as the participatory processes that inform these\n            challenges (section three); (c) brief description of Bank\n            support to the Government program targeted by the PASS\n            (section four); (d) the operation, overall approach and\n            specific areas of policy actions (section five); and (e)\n            implementation aspects, including poverty, social and\n            environment aspects, risks and risk mitigation (section\n            six). Annex one describes the matrix of policy actions and indicators."}, "docdt": "2009-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
