   F. Results Framework Analysis

   Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

  Enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability. The loan supports measures to reduce Jamaica's
  high level of debt and improve fiscal sustainability, which have constrained the country's
  growth potential and crowded out productive investment. The loan includes fiscal and
  institutional reforms to reduce financing vulnerabilities, improve public spending
  effectiveness and improve the country's ability to cope with the adverse consequences of
  the on-going global economic downturn.

 Increasing the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes. The
 public sector modernization efforts supported by the ,loan are expected to improve the
 efficiency of public expenditures and investment, strengthen the control of public
 finances, and enhance the effectiveness of government budgeting practices. Given the
 potential for decreased fiscal revenues under the current global environment, these efforts
 are particularly important as a means to improve fiscal discipline and help foster growth
 in the medium term through a better allocation of scarce public resources.

 1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

 1.1 Context at Appraisal

 A key miderIying problem of the Jamaican economy has been low growth,
 averaging about 1 % per annum in the last 30 years. Much of the weak growth and
 periodic economic problems arose from various combinations of oil price shocks,
 declining export prices, natural disasters, financial crisis, domestic insecurity associated
 with high crime, as well as political unrest. As a result, policies were often focused on
 short term stabilization rather than long-term development and growth objectives. While
 performance improved somewhat in 1999-2008, it was well below other lower middle
 income countries.
 Jamaica's economic performance was severely constrained also by its high level of
 debt, which reached 113.5% of GDP in 2007/08 (revised from the estimated 123.1 %
 of GDP at time of appraisal). The high level of debt and the resulting cost of servicing
 debt (interest payments reached 11.6% of GDP and absorbed more than one-half of
 government revenues) constrained social spending and investment. The large debt and
 limited fiscal space resulted also in the economy's vulnerability to external shocks,
 including those originating from global financial conditions, commodities prices, and
 natural disasters.
After 18 years in the opposition, the Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) won the 2007
general election, albeit with only a small majority in Parliament. The new
administration campaigned on a platform of jump-starting the economy, combating crime
and violence, and reducing poverty. Thus, reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities and
providing effective social and investment programs were essential to addressing
Jamaica's development challenges. These priorities became even more pertinent in the
context of the global financial market crisis and economic slowdown the new government
faced immediately after taking office.
The international financial crisis hit Jamaica hard in the last quarter of 2008. GDP
declined by 1.6% in 2008/09 and by an estimated 2.5% in 200911 O. Bauxite and
Aluminum exports declined by about 60%, and remittances dropped by one-third, leading
to a 25% depreciation of the exchange rate. EMBI Global Sovereign spreads tripled to
nearly 1000 basis points. Moody's and Fitch downgraded Jamaica with a negative
outlook due to the deteriorating external environment and weak domestic fundamentals.
The consolidated fiscal deficit surpassed 8% of GDP in 2007/08, the current account
deficit widened to 18% of GDP, while the rate of inflation rose from 7% in September
2007 to 21 % in September 2008 due to rising food and fuel prices. GDP growth slowed
down to 0.6% from 3.2% a year earlier, and the projection was for negative growth of
0.5% in 2008/09.
The Government took several steps to address the crisis, but its weak fiscal position
and high level of debt constrained its options. It introduced a temporary reduction in
the General Consumption Tax to offset losses of the tourism industry, and increased the
benefit and coverage of the conditional cash transfer program (PATH) to mitigate the
impact of the crisis on the poor. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Jamaica provided an
emergency credit .line to financial firms that were suffering dollar liquidity constraints
due to a drop in the value of collateral, and sold foreign exchange to ease pressures on the
exchange rate.
While the stabilization measures dealt with the immediate . problems, the
Government designed a structural reform program as part of its medium-term
socio-economic policy framework. The framework sets out' the broad package of
policies, strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over
the period 2009-2012. It recognizes that reducing debt and controlling the debt generating
process were necessary conditions for achieving its economic and social objectives, such
as improving health, education and addressing crime and violence. The government
outlined a set of policy measures to lower debt,. including rationalization of public
enterprises, improving public sector efficiency, comprehensive tax reform, and improving
the business climate as a means for placing the country on a more sustainable fiscal and
growth path. Those objectives were fully consistent with the CAS FY06-09 and the CAS
Progress Report approved by the Board of Executive Directors in July 2007 (para 3.1).

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDQ) and Key Indicators (as approved)


The Fiscal and Debt Su:stainability DPL was designed to support the Government's
reform program. Initially, it was conceived as a programmatic operation consisting of a
series of loans, but due to the high risk and uncertainty, it was approved as a free standing
operation. However, the medium term reform program prepared for this operation was
the basis for the programmatic DPL that followed one year later, as well as a reference
for the financial support provided by the CDB, ED and IDB (Annex 1).

The key Program Development Objectives were the following:

  (i)   Enhancing fiscal and debt sustain ability. The loan supported measures to
        reduce Jamaica's high level of debt and improve fiscal sustainability, which had
        constrained the country's growth potential and crowded out productive investment.
        The loan included fiscal and institutional reforms to reduce financing
        vulnerabilities, improve public spending effectiveness and improve the country's
        ability to cope with the adverse consequences of the on-going global economic
        downturn; and

  (ii) Increasing the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting
       processes. The public sector modernization efforts supported by the loan were
       expected to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and investment,
       strengthen the control of public finances, and enhance the effectiveness of
       government budgeting practices. Given the likelihood of lower fiscal revenues
       under the deteriorating global environment, these efforts were to be
       complemented by improving tax policy and administration.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The main objective of the program was to address the huge debt of the public sector
by attacking the debt generating sources. In practical terms, the emphasis was on
consolidating overall public sector balances, including divestment of selected state owned
enterprises (Public Bodies), improving the efficiency of financial management and
budget processes, and increasing the efficiency of revenue collection. In particular, the
program called for:

        First, consolidating public sector balances to adequately control the spending
        and debt generation by the Public Bodies (PBs). PBs generated about as much
       revenue and expenditure as the central government, and accounted for the
       majority of capital spending and debt creation, but was outside the normal
       budgeting process. In the medium term, the objective was to rationalize activities
       of the PBs to focus on activities with a social or regulatory function, and .divest
       those operating in commercial areas.

       Second, improving transparency and efficiency of financial management and
       budget processes. The existing legal framework was lacking and not always in
       use. A forward looking process for budget and prioritization of expenditures in
       the Central Government and Public Bodies was needed, together with timely
       accounting, and improved monitoring and evaluation of expenditures.

        And third, reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax
      . system. To expand the tax base and improve equity, the government plan called
                                           3
        for reducing exemptions, special regimes, and zero-rating, which reduced tax
        revenue by an estimated 30 percent. In addition, tax administration and collection
        were to be improved. The government was also taking actions to directly reduce
        the tax burden on the poor, by adjusting the income tax threshold for inflation.

1.4.1 Promoting Fiscal Sustainability through the Control of Overall Public
Sector Balances and Debt

Reducing Overall Public Sector Debt

Jamaica had a high burden of public sector debt (113 percent of GDP in net terms
in 2008) that was about US$S,OOO per person. Roughly 50 percent of the debt was
indexed to or denominated in foreign exchange. Interest payments were absorbing over
one half of government revenues, crowding out other public expenditures such as
education and infrastructure. Since most debt, including debt issued abroad and
denominated in foreign currency, was held within the country, it was not a problem
between Jamaica and the rest ofthe world but rather a problem within the country. More
specifically, it was a huge transfer of income from tax payers to bond holders. In
addition, government borrowing crowded out credit for the private sector, thereby
undermining the engine of economic ,growth.
In order to start addressing this problem, the Government planned to implement a
Fiscal Transparency and Responsibility Framework. A key element of it would be to
control the consolidated balances of the entire public sector, including the Public Bodies.
In addition, the Central Government would stop using deferred financing, which in the
past led to significant expenditures outside the normal budgetary process.

Rationalizing Public Bodies

Public Bodies generated about as much revenue and expenditure as the central
government, and accounted for the majority of public capital spending. They also
contributed substantially to debt creation. For example, Air Jamaica was losing about
US$150 million per year, making a huge drain on public resources. Historically, it was a
one way street, where the Central Government assumed losses of PBs when they couldn't
service their debt, but it did not receive transfers from profit making PBs.        The
Government program called for divesting PBs doing commercial activities, and
improving the management and performance of PBs remaining in the public domain.
Also, their capital expenditures should be within a coherent public sector investment
program, which also includes the investments carried out by the central government. The
assets and liabilities of the Public Bodies that remain in the public sector would be
centrally coordinated and managed using a single-treasury account.
The anticipated fiscal impact from rationalizirigPublic Bodies was large, but not
immediate, because of substantial up-front costs related to restructuring, preparing
for sale and assuming unguaranteed debt (including pensions). Thus, receipts from
privatizations were not expected to be significant, especially during the crisis. However,
in the medium and longer term, the public sector would get rid of major loss and debt

                                            4
 generating enterprises. With the full set of reforms, the expectations were that annual
 fiscal deficits would be reduced by over 3 percent of GDP in 2011112 and thereafter.
 The public sector wage bill and compensation strategy was another key area in the
 reform agenda. Since the early 1990s, the wage· bill had fluctuated in the range of 10-
  12% of GDP.         Starting in 2004, the government signed three Memoranda of
 Understanding (MOUs) with civil servants' unions, each MOU covering two years. The
 MOU instrument is credited with bringing the overall wage bill down by roughly one
 percentage point of GDP since the early 2000s. However, it left out teachers, nurses and
 police (a big portion of public servants), which received salary increases above the MOU.
 The government envisioned a medium term strategy, based on two key principles: (i)
 tying public sector wages to performance; and (ii) adjusting salaries to levels that would
 retain qualified personnel in key groups of employees who are critical to public sector
 performance. However, since there was no information on public employment, it was
 necessary first to survey public sector employment, compensation and incentives. The
 education sector, which represents over 25 percent of the public sector workforce, was
 chosen as the pilot for such survey.

 1.4.2 Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Management and Budget Processes
 Public Financial Management (PFM) and public procurement processes were not
 sufficiently transparent and manageable in practice. The most important challenges
included: (i) need for a forward looking process for budget and prioritization of
expenditures, within the Central Government and especially PBs, and for a solid public
sector investment program; (ii) better budgetary control for Public Bodies, as elaborated
above; (iii) reducing the divergence between the originally approved budget and what
was actually spent; (iv) reducing delays in reporting of the accounting, auditing and
publication of results; (v) making the public procurement system more efficient and
transparent by improving procurement performance and monitoring; and (vi) expanding
the scope of the Internal Control Units to procurement activities carried out by public
agencies and project implementing units.
 Accounting, recording and reporting standards were in place but they were not in
 line with international standards. Relatively good institutions, like the Auditor
 General Office, were thwarted in the execution of their duties by delays in submission of
 financial statements and the absence of a timely follow-up of audit reports. In order to
 enhance financial management and budget processes, the Government plan called for: (i)
enhancing the methodology to evaluate, compare and prioritize projects in line ministries;
(ii) introducing multi-year fiscal and expenditure frameworks, enforcing spending
envelopes, eliminating ad-hoc allocation through supplementary budgets, and presenting
a plan for reduction of arrears; (iii) implementing the Performance Management and
Evaluation Framework; (iv) implementing systems for integrated financial management
information and accrual accounting; and (v) strengthening auditing within the
government and at the Auditor General level. The Auditor General would timely review
financial statements and expand the scope of audits to include performance audits.

1.4.3. Reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system
Highly variable tax rates with many exemptions, special regimes, and zero-rating reduced
tax revenue by an estimated 30 percent and also distorted allocation of resources in the
economy. On top of that, tax administrators faced barriers to getting information and
pressing enforcement, making tax evasion arid avoidance relatively easy. For taxpayers
who wanted to comply, the complexity of the system made it difficult to do so.
The Government had already taken measures -to increase uniformity of indirect tax
rates. In 2006, it converted several GCT zero-rating into exemptions, and in 2008, it
raised tax rates (and fees) on tobacco, guns and cars. The Government plan called for
continuing expanding the tax base by eliminating exemptions and phasing out special
sector incentives. Also, individual income tax threshold would be adjusted for inflation,
to reduce the tax burden on the lower income segments of the population.
In addition, a comprehensive reform of tax administration would: (i) facilitate
compliance by consolidating payroll tax and reduce filing requirements; (ii) strengthen
enforcement, as a follow-up to the amnesty; (iii) add 4,000 non-PA YE taxpayers to the
roll of taxpayers each year; (iv) increase tax authority's ability to verify financial
information (credit cards, bank accounts,etc) and cross check to fight fraud; and (v)
improve collection of property tax, including enforcement of confiscation for tax liens.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

While the government stayed the course in its reform program, implementation was
slower than expected, as shown in Table 1. The international financial crisis was far
deeper, and its impact on the Jamaican economy much stronger, than expected at the time
of appraisal, which resulted in a slowdown in implementation of the program. All the
refon:.ns supported by this DPL were conditions for Board presentation, and thus were
met prior to approval of the Loan. However,Table 1 reports also on the status of the
Expected Outcomes by December 2009, as originally set in the DPL Results Framework,
and as of September 2010, when the ICR mission visited Jamaica. It is necessary to
assess developments to date since there were delays in implementation, and in order to
have a broader perspective when evaluating achievement of the PDOs. This DPL
program was the basis for the First Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL approved in
February 2010, about the same time when the IMP approved a Stand-by arrangement
with Jamaica.

   2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

   A major factor affecting implementation was the deeper than expected recession, as
   GDP growth in 2008/09 was -1.7% instead of the projected -0.5% (growth in 200911 0
   is estimated at -2.5%, compared to a projection of 0 growth at time of appraisal). In
   addition, the government had only a small majority in Parliament, which complicated
   passage of reforms, .and escalation of the fight against crime affected daily life in the
   spring of2010. On the other hand, the program was underpinned by a substantial body of
   analytical work carried out by the Bank in conjunction with the Government of Jamaica
   (Annex 2), and it was designed to address highly relevant problems affecting the country.

   The Program was endorsed by other donors, including the Caribbean Deveiopment
   Bank (CDB), which incorporated an earlier version of the DPL matrix to its own
   operation, and by the European Union. Donor coordination added weight to the Program.

 Further, one year after this DPL was approved, the Bank approved the First
 Programmatic Fiscal Sustainahility DPL forUS$200million, and the IMF approved a 27-
 month Stand-by arrangement with Jamaica in an amount of SDR 820.5 million (300
 percent of quota). In parallel, the government was able to engineer a successful debt
 exchange, which reduced interest payments by over about 5% of GDP, and led to a
 substantial drop in interest rates (Box 1). While in various aspects implementation was
 slower than expected, all these factors helped maintain the momentum of the reform
 process.

                               Box 1: Jamaica Debt Exchan~e Offer
   The Government of Jamaica (GoJ) on January 14, 2010 announced a domestic debt exchange
   (JDX) initiative with the primary objectives of: (i) improving the maturity profile of domestic debt, of
   which 40.0 percent was due to mature in less than 24 months thereby presenting high levels of roll-over
   risk and vulnerabilities to adverse shifts in market sentiment; (ii) reducing the interest expense associated
   with debt, which at end-2009 represented 15.9 percent of GDP and accounted for an average of 60.0
   percent of Gol's revenues annually; and (iii) reducing the variable portion of domestic debt.
   The JDX, which closed on February 24, 2010, involved the consolidation of 345 securities into 25
   new benchmark bonds and offered bondholders the opportunity to surrender old bond for new
   bonds with longer maturity and lower coupons. The exchange was fully voluntary and included all
   domestically issued bonds (excluding Treasury Bills) scheduled to mature on or after 16 February 2010
   and issued on or prior to 31 December 2009. The total value of the offer was J$700.0 billion or 65.0
   percent of GDP. The offer was executed as a par-for-par exchange of principal amounts and non-
   participating securities were called. In an attempt to improve the predictability of interest payments the
   variable rate, the variable rate (VR) bonds were reissued for fixed rate CFR), VR and inflation (CPI)
   linked bonds. FR bonds were reissued as fixed bonds, while US dollar and US dollar-linked instruments
   were reissued in US dollar. The GoJ also offered several short-term FR instruments ranging from 3
   months to 1 year to maintain adequate liquidity in the domestic market.
  The JDX recorded a participation rate of 99.2 percent and resulted in notable change in the
  matu rity profile of the domestic debt. The average maturity of the domestic debt after the JDX
  increased to 8.9 years from 4.5 years, lowering pressures on interest rates and improving the
  Government's ability to respond to shocks. The share of domestic bonds attributable to FR instruments
  increased to 38.0 percent from 34.0 percent, while the newly introduced CPI-linked bonds accounted for
  3 percent. The JDX was also successful in lowering the VR portion of the domestic debt by 6.0
  percentage points to 48 percent and the share of domestic debt priced in US dollars fell to 11 percent
  from 12 percent. The average coupon on outstanding Jamaica and US dollar domestic debts declined by
  650 basis points (bps) and 200bps to average 12.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
  The JDX eased both the rollover and refinancing risks in the government's debt portfolio. The JDX
  is estimated to have generated annualized interest savings for the government of J$41.0 billion (5 percent
  of GDP) in FY201 0111, representing a decline of 34 percent in first year of implementation. This
  contributed to the significant contraction in the budgeted fiscal deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP for
  FY20 I 011 1 from 9.4 percent and 7.3 percent in FY2009/10 and FY2008/09, respectively. The portion of
  domestic debt due in FY20 10111 was also reduced from 28.0 percent to 5.0 percent.
  The exchange was broadly endorsed by the multilateral agencies, including theIMF, IADB, the
  CDB, and the Bank, who combined committed financing ofUS$2.4 billion to the Government's reform
  program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implem~ntation and Utilization:

Design
The Bank and the Ministry of Finance and the Public' Service (MFPS) agreed ,that
the MFPS will play the primary role in coordinating monitoring and evaluation of
program implementation. The Government and the Bank agreed to Jake advantage of
several local data sources to assess progress of the DPL, including the Statistical Institute
of Jamaica, Central Bank of Jamaica reports and analysis, PIOJ and the Auditor General.
Implementation
Information from those, sources, however, 'was not always available in a timely
fashion. That was compensated by Bank, CDB, IDB and IMF supervision missions and
reports, which helped monitor and evaluate implementation of the program. In particular,
Jamaica was under intensified surveilh:mce from the Fund, which produced a bi-annual
staff report ·assessing its economic and fmancial stability.     In early 2010, the IMF
approved a Stand-by arrangement in early 2010, which implies a much closer monitoring
of the Government's reforin program. The World Bank has been coordinating with the
Fund' on its monitoring of the economic and financial situation.

Utilization

In mid 2009, the Bank started preparation of the First Programmatic Fiscal.
Susfainability DPL.      Monitoring of the performance of the Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability DPL was an important input for, and it became an integral part of,
preparation of the neW operation. '

2.4 Expected Next PhaselFoliow-up Operation (if any):

This DPL was initially envisioned as a Programmatic operation - the first in a series of
loans. As such, the team worked with Government on a medium term program with three
phases of reforms. That matrix became the basis for the second operation - the First
Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL, approved about one year later. ,A Second
Programmatic DPL (third in the seri€s) is currently under preparation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives of the DPL program were· highly releva~twhen the operation was
appraised and they remain relevant to date. The very high level of public sector debt
and the huge burden of servicing that debt were and stiU are a major impediment for
economic growth and poverty reductiori: it crowds out social spending as well as lending
to the private sector. The perpetual demand for funds by the public sector wa~ supplied
by the financial sector at interest rates of about'18%. In that environment, there was lio
incentive whatsoever for banks to lend to the private sector for productive undertakings.
The objectives of the program were fully consistent with the government's fiscal and
debt sustain ability reform program,which was part of its medium-term socio-
                                             12
 economic policy framework. The framework sets out the broad package of policies,
 strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over the period
 2009-2012. It supports the overall vision, goals and outcomes of Jamaica's long term
 development plan, Vision 2030.
 The objectives of theDPL were also in line with the Country Assistance Strategy
 FY06-09, which was approved by the Board of Directors in April 2005 and updated
 in July 2007. The amount of this DPL, however, is higher than envisioned in the CAS
 (US$75 million) or in the CAS Progress Report (US$50 million). The increase in the size
 of budgetary support reflects the priorities of the new Government of Jamaica, which
 wanted to focus Bank's support on fiscal and debt sustainability issues, given the
 country's vulnerabilities and the looming international financial crisis. That emphasis
 was reflected in the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FYlO-13 approved by the
 Board of Directors in March 2010.

 3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

 As mentioned above, the Fiscal and Debt Sustain ability DPL was originally
 conceived as a programmatic operation, with a Policy Matrix and Results Framework
 that included three phases of short term as well as medium term reforms. While this DPL
 was eventually approved as a self standing operation, its Policy Matrix was the basis for
 the First Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL approved one year later. Thus, in order
 to evaluate the achievement of this DPL's PDOs, it's not sufficient to look at what
 happened through the end of 2009 only, but it's necessary to have a broader perspective
 and assess developments to date.

3.2.1   Enhancing Fiscal and Debt Sustainability - Moderately Satisfactory

  The international financial crisis hit Jamaica hard. As mentioned above, GDP
  declined by 1.6% in 2008/09 and by an estimated 2.5% in 2009110, while exports and
  remittances dropped sharply. The recession led to lower tax revenues and the global
 crisis led to higher interest rates and currency depreciation. Due to lower tax revenues as
 well as higher expenditure, the primary surplus declined from 7.8% ofGDP in 2007/08 to
 4.9% of GDP in 2008/09, but it bounced back to 6.1 % of GDP in 200911 O. Interest
 payments shot up from nearly 13% of GDP in 2008/09 to 17% of GDP in 200911 0 due to
 the steep increase in interest rates and the depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, and the
 consolidated net public debt rose from 126% of GDP in 2008/09 to 140% of GDP in
 200911 O. At the time of the preparation it was recognized that selecting debt to GDP
 ratio as PDO indicator could be risky since there are many factors affecting it, while the
 ability of the DPL program to influence its course could be limited. Nonetheless, it was
 selected on the basis of its importance as a focal point to the whole DPL program and in
the dialogue with the government. The Bank program in Jamaica has continued· to
emphasize the criticality of reducing debt to GDP ratio in order to improve fiscal and
debt sustainability. On the other hand, the slowdown in economic activity eased
inflationary pressures, and the consumer prices index dropped from nearly 20% in 2007/8
to 12.4% in 2008/09, and to 9.7% the following year (Table 2).


                                            13
 Notwithstanding those· shocks, government remained committed to its reform
 program. In particular, in April 2009, it froze public sector wages for one year (later
 extended for two additional year), and in early 2010 it announced a domestic debt
 exchange program, involving about one half of its. total debt, which resulted in a
 reduction of interest payment of about 5% of GDP andJonger maturities. As a result of
 that exchange, interest rates dropped to 8% in September 2010, the lowest level in 30
 years.

  In parallel, Government reached agreement with the IMF on a 27-month Stand-by
  Arrangement in an amount of SDR 820.5 million. The SBA was approved on
  February4, 2010, and two reviews of the program were satisfactorily completed in June
  and in September 2010. The program with the IMF calls for the virtual elimination of the
. public sector deficit within 3 years.

  The Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) would· be a central instrument for
  achieving that objective. It would establish an institutional framework such that the
  Government is accountable for applying principles of prudent fiscal management to
  achieve medium-term fiscal targets established by in law. Accountability would be
  ensured through the presentation of a Fiscal Policy Paper (FPP) to Parliament and
  requirements to submit the budgets of all public entities to Parliament. However, there
  were delays in the preparation process, and Parliament approved the amendments to the
  Financial Administration and Audit Act and Public Bodies Management and
. Accountability Act to establish an FRF only in March 2010. Government is working now
  on the regulations to implement it, and expects to make it operational in the last quarter
  of calendar 2010.

Employment surveys of the Central Government were completed early this year,
and they are now being conducted in all Public Bodies either fully or partially
financed by the budget. As of September .2010,66 out of a total 129 had been
completed. These surveys are expected to be reconciled with the census and payroll

                                                                  15
information collected by the Public· Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU) as part of a
future payroll audit. The government is committed to maintain the wage freeze (at the
April 2009 level of Jam$27 billion - 11.8% of GDP) through 2013. This freeze excludes
retroactive payments owed to teachers and nurses as part of previously agreed increases,
which are being paid in annual installments'. However, pressures for salary increases are
brewing in various sectors of the public service, and the question is how the government
will deal with those pressures when the freeze ends. The government's plan calls for
reducing the wage bill to 9.5% of GDP by 2014 and to 9% of GDP by 2016. This
reduction would be achieved through implementation of the public sector master
rationalization plan prepared by the Public Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU), which
was tabled in Parliament in July 2010.

There was progress in the rationalization of Public Bodies (PB), albeit slower than
expected. This involves divesting PBs doing commercial activities,. and improving the
performance 0 those staying in the public sector. Air Jamaica, which was losing about
US$150 million per year, was sold to Caribbean Airlines in March 2010, and divestment
of the sugar industry was completed shortly thereafter. On the other hand,.divestment of
several PBs included in the government's program have not been completed yet (Table 1).
In parallel, PSTU's master rationalization plan mentioned above calls for full devolution
of authority to 12 PBs by April 2011, including enhanced powers and accountability of
management through management contracts. Devolution would be granted only upon
accreditation by these 12 PBs.

As part of public sector reform, and given the huge size of Jamaica's public sector
debt, government is putting special emphasis on improving the capacity and
performance of the Debt Management Unit (DMU). In consultation with relevant
players, it is preparing new legislation to modernize debt management practices,
including management of government guarantees and contingent liabilities, and it plans
to restructure the DMU and establish front, middle and back offices by December 2010.
In addition, the authorities are in the process of establishing a Debt Management
Committee comprising high-level staff from ·MFPS, the Bank of Jamaica and the AG's
Office. This Committee, which will evaluate. alternative medium~term debt management
strategies. and make recommendations on the strategy to follow, is expected to be in place
by year's end.

3.2.2   Increasing the EfficiencYQf Public Financial Management and Budgeting
        Process - Moderately Satisfactory

There was progress in this area, but slower than expected. In particular, while the
accounts of the Public Bodies were presented to Parliament together with the budget for
FY2010111, they were not fully consolidated· with the accounts of the Central
Government. In addition, the new methodology for putting together the Public
Investment Program is not in place yet. On the other hand, government is procuring
software for integrating the financial management system, and is establishing a Central
Treasury Management System. At the same time, the office· of the Auditor General is
making strides in modernizing its structure and building its HR capacity.

                                           16
  Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The Ministry of Finance and Public
  Service is putting together a MTEF consistent with the Macro Fiscal Framework. The
  MTEF would establish expenditure ceilings for each ministry for 3 years on a rolling
  basis. As a pilot, it will be implemented in 6 ministries which constitute 70% of total
  expenditures (MFPS, Public Works, Education, Health, Agriculture and Fisheries, and
  National Security). Expenditure reviews will be conducted in each ministry as inputs to
  theMTEF.                        .
  Public Investment Program. Currently, the Planning Institute of 1amaica (PIOl)
  conducts a technical evaluation of projects presented by Ministries, and the Infrastructure
 Committee of Cabinet decides' which would be implemented. The Program calls for a
 new methodology for the evaluation of capital investment, but it is not in place yet. A
 new software for project evaluation, used by the US Environmental Protection Agency, is
 currently being customized for this purpose, .and government plans to begin
 implementation in 6 key ministries. The new methodology should resolve the ongoing
 problem of excessive project commitments, leading to delays and postponements due to
 insufficient funds, and inefficient use of resources. The new methodology would be
 accompanied by a set of clear decision processes which would allow a transparent and
 cost effective selection of investment projects, including the closing of unviable or low
 return projects under execution.
 The government is working on strengthening th'e technical basis of budgeting and
 financial management through: (i) introducing an Integrated Financial Management
 Information System (IFMIS); (ii) strengthening internal control and internal audit·
 systems; and (iii) enhancing external audit by improving the capacity of the office of the
 Auditor General.     .

  Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). The government is
  in the process of procuring off the shelf software for integrating the PFM information
  system, which is also known as the Enterprise Resour-ce Management System. As part of
  computerization of the PFM system, the government is establishing a central treasury
  management system (CTMS) to bring responsibility for treasury management functions
  under one agency. The CTMS wil1 establish a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to improve
. cash management, to consolidate all general government cash resources, and close the
  individual bank accounts of government entities. The new system would also help
  moving from cash to an accrual basis.

Internal audit. Jamaica has about 200 internal auditors in all ministries. However, the
majority of these are internal controllers, concerned mostly with checking transactions
rather than internal audit per se. While internal audit should be the responsibility of each
ministry, the Ministry of Finance sets the audit guidelines· and procedures for all, to
ensure consistency and uniformity across the Central Government.

External Audit. The Auditor General (AG) is an inQependent fin:l,ction, reporting
directly to Parliament. The AG is implementing an action plan for institutional and
professional capacity building, with the assistance of the UK Audit General Office, which
includes IT as well as human resources. Training programs include not only senior

                                            17
auditors but all personnel. That build up is essential to increase performance auditing
from 5% to 50% of its activities, and.to meet new·requirements derived from the Fiscal
Responsibility Framework. The AG is also one of the agencies targeted by the Public
Sector Transformation Unit for devolutiori, to provide it with more control over [mancial
and HR management. Under the revised structure, the Public Accounts· Committee of the
Parliament will have oversight of the AG'g office.

3.2.3 Reducing Distortions and Enhancing the Efficiency of the Tax System:
Moderately Satisfactory         .

Tax issues were included in the second PD~, but they are discussed in the Program.
Document· as a third area supported by the Program, so they are reviewed here
separately. FUrther, tax policy and tax administration reforms performed differently, and
are thus discussed and rated separately too.

Tax Policy:· Moderately Ullsatisfactory

In 2009, facing a deepening crisis, Government introduced 3 tax packages mostly to
boost revenues rather than to improve the tax system. The first one, in April,
increased the income taxtlu:eshold from J$196,872 to J$270,504. It also removed some
tax preferences, expanded the GCT tax base, imposed tax on dividends, and increased the
specific tax on petrol and petroleum products. However, in May, government revised this
package by reintroducing some GCT exemptions, offsetting the loss in revenue by
increasing taxes on cigru:ettes and alcohol. In September, it announced the second tax
package, which increased the departure tax for tourists and the GCT rate on telephone
calls and equipment. The third package, announced in December, increased several GCT
and SCT rates,· included electricity supply in the GCT base, increased income tax rates on
high earners, and hiked license fees and custom duties on selected luxury items; including
vehicles.

Following those increases, the authorities implemented some additional revenue
measures in 2010, but their impact is likely to be limited. The· payroll tax rate was
temporarily increased (until March 31, 201 I) from 25% to 27.5% and to 35% for incomes
above J$5 million and J$10 million respectively. This departure from a flat rate could
complicate administration and compliance. In addition, the authorities have made
progress in reducing the use of tax incentives and waivers. A July 26, 2010, Cabinet
decision forbids the issuance of any new incentives or waivers as of August I, 2010. The
authorities' plan calls for a new waiver policy which would establish. the specific criteria
governing and/or limiting the discretion of the Minister in granting waivers, but
implementing such policy would be a challenge.
Tax reform has not been comprehensive but rather bits by bits, resulting mostly
from the need to ~nhance revenues to deal with the crisis. In particular, little has been
done to improve the uniformity of the tax code. A proposal to lower the corporate income
tax from 33.33 percent t6 25 percent (in line with the current 25 percent tax rate on
personal income tax) has been postponed due to the potential negative revenue

                                            18
 implications. Amalgamation of statutory payrolL deductions has not been made
 operational yet. The authorities have, however, signaled their intention to address
 distortions in the local alcoholic beverage regime by reforming the way the consumption
 of alcohol is taxed, although a timeline for implementation is yet to be determined.

 Strengthening Tax Administration: Satisfactory

 The number of corporate and individual tax payers in the tax roll has increased by
 nearly 25% in 2 years (by 12.3% in 2008/09, and by 10.8% in 2009110). While this is
 slower than projected, it's still quite an achievement given the slowdown of economic
 activity in those years.

  Reorganization of the tax office started in April 2009, to be done in 4 stages over a
 period of 3 years. The authorities have issued a Cabinet decision to consolidate Inland
 Revenue, Taxpayer Audit, and Assessment and the Tax Administration Services
 Departments into a single Jamaica Tax Administration UTA) led by a Commissioner
 General. Under the reorganized structure, the existing departments will be consolidated
 into one unit with the responsibility for administering domestic taxes. The authorities
 have also completed the preparation and costing of the Tax Restructuring Plan. The
 preparation of the plan,. funded by USAID, was completed in August 2010. Its
 implementation is expected to substantially reduce overhead costs and improve efficiency.

In October 2008, the authorities introduced online filing and payment of GCT and
SCT. One year later, they broadened the scope to the filing and payment of payroll
deductions. In March 2010, the authorities made further advances by allowing online
filing and payment of individual and corporate income tax, education tax for the self-
employed, and NIS. Currently, however, on line filing is done only by 1% of tax 'payers,
who pay 2-3% of all taxes.

3.4 Justification ofOveralJ Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 Although there were delays in implementation of the program, the overall outcome
 of this operation is rated moderately satisfactory because: (a) the Bank responded to
 the new Government of Jamaica's commitment to reform, helped the Government to .
 spell out its reform program, and reengaged Jamaica in policy based lending after many
years; (b) the issues addressed in the program, particularly the focus on debt generating
sources and on fiscal management and transparency, were highly relevant; and (c) the
Bank took the risk in an environment of high uncertainty, paving the way for other IFIs
and dollor agencies. That risk was eventually justified by Government's continuous
commitment to the reform program, which was supported by a Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability DPL, an IDB PBL, and by a new 27-month Stand-by arrangement with the
IMF.                                              .

3;5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes arid Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There were no gender aspects to this operation, and with the international crisis
gathering steam in the background and the short period of implementation, it's not
possible to attribute any specific impact on poverty to this DPL. Likewise with
regard to social development. At the sametime, the DPL triggered additional support for
Jamaica by other multilateral and bilateral donors during a difficult period for the country,
and as such it helped mitigate the impact on the international crisis on its citizens.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

This DPL, together with other operations supported by multilateral and bilateral
donors, contributed to the strengthening of institutions in Jamaica. In particular, the
focus on the Fiscal Responsibility Framework and improving fiscal management in
general and the transparency of Public Bodies' accounts in particular, is essential for
improved fiscal performance and accountability. In addition, the DPL supported the
adoption of a modem methodology for evaluating public investment projects and
consolidating the Public Investment Program, it supported restructuring and capacity
building in the General Auditor's office, as well as improvements in tax administration.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The risks that development outcomes will not. be maintained are rated moderate
because of the commitment by Government to its reform program, the ong~ing
Programmatic DPL, and the Stand-by arrangement with the IMF. This risk could
become significant, however, in the medium term due to factors identified when the DPL
was approved, namely: economic, political,and natural disasters. The economic risks are·
due to the global financial crisis and the resulting economic downturn, which indeed
reduced demand for Jamaica's key exports of goods and services, and slowed remittances
from the US and Europe.. Those risks are partly mitigated by the successful debt
exchange in early 2010 and by the subsequent large drop in domestic interest rates, which
saves the government about 5 percentage points of GDP in interest payments, and by the
increased support by the IFIs. Still, with debt of 140% of GDP and interest payments
absorbing nearly one half of government revenues, Jamaica is very vulnerable to external
shocks. The Political risk is due to the small majority that the Government has in
Parliament, which complicates approval of reforms. That risk is augmented by recent
                                             20
 discussion in the press of the possibility ofeatly parliamentary elections. Finally, the risk
 of naturaldisasters is a permanent feature, as the September 2010 floods show. Jamaica
 mitigates. this risk by its participation in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
 Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a major disaster,
 and by programs wjth donors aimed at addressing natural disasters when they happen.

 5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

 5.1 Bank Performance -

 (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at En.try

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 Bank performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on
 two seemingly contradicting elements: on the one hand, the remarkable work by the
DPL team to help the government formulate a strong medium-term -reform
program, and on the other hand, decisions at the institutional I~vel to minimize risks,
which forced a reformulatjon of the program into a one-shot stand alone operation
at the last minute. The work by the DPL team was particularly challenging due to: (i)
the difficult conditions under which the operation was prepared, including a fragile and
deteriorating macroeconomic environment, a civil service that was not on board with the
reforms, local distrust of IFIs, etc.; (ii) the thorough work of the team helping the new
government to spell out its medium term reforni program; and (iii) the fOCliS on difficult
issues, such as divestment and reform of Public Bodies, in particular the divestment of
Air Jamaica and the sugar industry. The back and forth withgovemment resulted in
higher than expected preparation costs, but the program contributed to nailing down
important and long overdue structural" reforms in Jamaica, and it led the way to wider
support by the CDB, IDB, the IMF and bilateral donors. It has also set the foundations for
further operations in Jamaica to advance the reform programs.

 Due to the high risk and uncertainty prev.ailing at the time of the preparation,the
 Bank decided to make this DPL a self standing operation, instead of the first phase
 of a programmatic DPL, as it was originally conceived. That change required
 formulating short term outcome indicators which did not do justice to,and were not
consistent with, the longer term PDOs (1.2 above). In particular, the debtlGDP ratio was
not directly affected by this operation nor was it fully under government control,
strengthening the AG office, while important per se, was not the best indicator of
effiCiency of public financing management and the budgeting process, and the number of
tax payers does not reflect the efficiency and fairness of the tax system.

(b) Quality of Supervision

   Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory. The new Bank team
:which took over supervision of the DPL visited Jamaica three times in 2009, and in

                                            21
between visits it held several VCs to follow up on implementation 'of the· program. In
early 2010, that follow up (overlapping with supervision of the First Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability DPL) was greatly enhanced by the recruitment of a local economist in the
Country Office, who wrote monthly progress reports on implementation of the policy
matrix. TheM&E arrangements, however; were useful but not sufficient. Initially there
was no point person on the government side to coordinate the follow up with the various
ministries and agencies that were implementing reforms. That was an important void
since~e composition of the Bank team that supervised the DPLwas quite different from
the team that prepared the operation. Eventually, a coordinator was appointed at the
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), which was very helpful both for supervising the
DPL as well as for preparation of the following operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisf~ctory

Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The program, while tentative in
parts, addressed critic;:t1. issues that constrained Jamaica's perspectives for fiscal
sustainability and economic growth. After many years, the Bank responded to the
opportunity of reengaging with Jamaica in policy based lending, and it took a calculated
risk that with hindsight was fully justified~ As mentioned' above, preparation of this
operation was negatively affected by the decision to convert it to a self standing DPL
instead of the first phase of a programmatic DPL. However, while this DPL was a self
standing operation, its policy matrix contains a medium term reform program, which
provided a medium term framework to the policy actions included in this operation as
well as a solid basis for the programmatic DPLapproved one year later.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The new government that took office in 2007 campaigned on a platform of reforms
to put Jamaica on a higher and sustainable growth path. Further, iminediately after
taking office, the new authorities sought support from the IFIs to spell out a coherent
reform program. and implement it. Bowever, within government there were different
views about what the components of that program should be, its majority in Parliament
was slim, and it faced parts.ofthe civil service which were not on board with the reforms.
In addition, several. local agencies had good professionals· at the top but weaker capacity
at lower levels. Therefore, there were delays in implementation of various policy
measures. Notwithstanding those difficulties and the international financial crisis,
government maintained its commitment with the program, implemented a successful debt
exchange and signed a Stand-by arrangement with the IMF, all of which make Jamaica's
situation substantially better today than when it took office three years ago.



                                            22
Justification of Rating for OverallBorrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government committed to the reform ,program and maintained its commitment
under difficult conditions, both external and internal. That is evidenced by its
agreement on a follow up programmatic DPL. However, overall performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory due to partial impl~mentation of several policies as well as delays
in implementation of parts of the Program supported by this DPL.

6.,Lessons Learned

   1. The Timing of Engagement is Crucial. Since the early 2000s, Jamaica shunned
       contacts with the IFIs, particularly on policy based lending. In 2007, after nearly
       20 years is the opposition, the Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) won the elections on a
     . platform of structural reforms. The new government requested support from the
       IFIs to implement those reforms. Risks were high, and Jamaica's recorq of.
       reform implementation was poor, but it was also a moment of opportunity for the
       Bank and other IFIs. The main lesson of this DPL is that the Bank should be '
       aware of these moments of opportunity, and should be willing to take risks. With
       hindsight, that decision was well justified by the results.

   2. Using the Programmatic Approach. The programmatic approach to policy
      based lending has two main advantages: it provides a medium term perspective to
      a reform program, coupled with more flexibility than a conventional multi-tranche
      loan. It is particularly suitable when the agenda includes difficult reforms, which
      cannot be implemented all at once. But even in cases, such as this DPL, where
      for various reasons the Bank decides to go with a self standing operation, the
      policy matrix should have a longer term horizon and be designed as if it were a
      programmatic DPL, as in this operation. Such a matrix provides a context to the
      prior actions of a DPL, and it would be the basis for following operations if and
      when they materialize.

  3. Technical Assistance (TA) and capacity building. Implementation of the DPL
     could have been helped by a better synchronization' and coordination of Technical
     Assistance provided by donors: Given the weaknesses in the local civil service,
     TA should focus on capacity' building and public sector modernization in
     accordance with the timing of implementation of the DPL program. Since Jamaica
     has been over studied, what is needed is strengthening the local capacity to
     implement policies in timely manner. A combination of longer term presence of
    'experts in the country coupled with on the job training of local staff in donor
     countries would help achieve the Government's development objectives.           '
