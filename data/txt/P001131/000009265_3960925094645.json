The project achieved many of its objectives,\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, approaches to extension\n            and land management now give full credit to pilot projects\n            that start with selected zones and gradually involve more\n            farmers and village groups in managing resources. Second,\n            the objectives and scope of integrated rural development\n            projects should be kept at an optimally manageable level.\n            Finally, it is important to have a participative approach to\n            land tenure administration."}, "docdt": "1993-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
