physical\n            constraints in feeder road infrastructure, reducing rural\n            transport costs of goods and passengers, and supporting farm\n            production and marketing. The four year project includes the\n            following main components: (a) a feeder road rehabilitation\n            program to be executed by contract; (b) a feeder road\n            periodic maintenance program to be implemented by contract,\n            and the establishment of a sustainable maintenance\n            management system; (c) an institutional strengthening and\n            support program for feeder road planning, design,\n            supervision and quality control; (d) a rural mobility and\n            environmental program; and (e) support to the Department of\n            Feeder Roads to assist in its decentralization.  The project\n            will support the goals of the Government's Economic\n            Recovery Program and the Medium Term Agricultural\n            Development Strategy and will complement the trunk and cocoa\n            road rehabilitation programs currently underway with IDA financing."}, "docdt": "1991-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
