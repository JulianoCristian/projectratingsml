In\n            terms of sustainability the outcome is rated as uncertain.\n            The key lesson learned is the importance of the government\n            having a clear strategy on maintenance funding, in\n            particular for feeder roads, and demonstrating the\n            effectiveness of funding by adequate and timely release of\n            required funds. A corollary to this is that a clear\n            implementation strategy is equally important, especially in\n            light of the current decentralization process. Other lessons\n            learned are: involve stakeholders in decisionmaking earlier\n            and more directly; simplify economic evaluation and\n            selection methods; address high design standards and\n            resulting problem of over-investment, particularly because\n            traffic volumes remain very low even after rehabilitation;\n            pursue labor-based construction; rehabilitate feeder roads\n            using a network approach; and set up a road fund with a\n            clear mechanism for raising revenue and an autonomous board\n            to enhance the stability of maintenance funding."}, "docdt": "1998-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
