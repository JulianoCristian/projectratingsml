"Ratings for the Public Service\n            Management Program Support Project for Zambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory and borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the Bank must\n            tread carefully when getting into government-led,\n            multi-donor pooled funding arrangements. Government\n            ownership needs to be carefully assessed in terms of\n            potential for political change and risk mitigation measures\n            put in place to offset its effects. Projects involving\n            far-reaching institutional and behavioral change need to be\n            more realistic in setting objectives, targets and\n            timeframes. To ensure effective project management, there\n            must be a rigorous recruitment process for key positions.\n            TTLs need better support when managing such complex projects\n            and should be made more aware of the resources and support\n            available to them within the Bank. The achievements under\n            the Service Delivery Improvement Facility (SDIF) program\n            raise a fundamental question about the relative merits of\n            different approaches to institutional reform/change."}, "docdt": "2013-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
