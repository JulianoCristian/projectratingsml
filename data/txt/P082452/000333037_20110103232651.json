The\n            extension is necessary to allow the recipient to complete\n            the implementation of activities that will ensure the\n            achievement of the project objectives. The government has\n            reaffirmed its commitment to these objectives and its\n            willingness to continue the implementation of activities\n            under the project. The recipient has shown new appetite for\n            reform by ensuring that these reforms are part of the high\n            level policy dialogue on budget support and are monitored\n            through the newly introduced monetary and evaluation\n            (M&E) department which reports on progress to cabinet,\n            this is different from before where implementation was left\n            to the technocrats with ineffective accountability\n            mechanisms. The performance of the borrower is now\n            satisfactory with senior management now focusing on\n            providing oversight to and demanding accountability from the\n            implementing component managers. The recipient has submitted\n            the work plan, procurement plan and performance assessment\n            criteria that covers the entire period of project extension\n            to International Development Association (IDA). With this\n            extension, the total life of this project will be 6 years 6\n            months. This will be the first extension of the project\n            closing date. The recipient proposed a 24 month extension in\n            its letter of request for extension of closing date; however\n            the project task team is of the view that an extension for a\n            period of 18 months will be sufficient to complete the\n            implementation of the remaining project activities. In\n            addition, this shorter timeframe will help to impose time\n            and budget constraints on the implementing agencies, thereby\n            forcing them to implement activities in a focused manner and\n            to remove any complacency that may arise from a longer\n            extension period."}, "docdt": "2010-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
