Transparency and\n            accountability will be further increased in the budget, and\n            procurement systems, payments and incentive systems will be\n            improved, and, ministry structures and management incentives\n            will be realigned so as to increase performance and public\n            service delivery. The project components are summarized as\n            follows. Payment Reform component: given that full\n            consolidation of allowances could not be achieved due to its\n            effect on the government pension liabilities, the project\n            will assist in the process of reforming the pension scheme,\n            and revising the Pensions Act, and the approved Medium Term\n            Pay Reform Strategy (MTPRS). Establishment and Payroll\n            Control: implementation of the computer-based Payroll\n            Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system, to help,\n            and ensure actual establishment is reflected in the payroll\n            data. Financial and Policy Management: the Medium Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF) ensures the basis for\n            disbursements, including that of the Activity Based\n            Budgeting System, ensuring the requirement of Cabinet\n            Memoranda that have financial implications to be cleared by\n            the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP), prior\n            to Cabinet approval. Financial Management and\n            Accountability: will ensure auditing through the Auditor\n            General's report of government accounts, as per\n            regulations of the 2002 government financial statements."}, "docdt": "2005-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
