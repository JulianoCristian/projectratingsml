                                               Restructuring Paper

1. This restructuring paper seeks your approval for the extension of closing date for Zambia Public
   Sector Management Program Support Project (4140ZA) (P082452) from December 31, 2010 to June 30,
   2012. With this extension, the total life of this project will be 6years 6 months. This will be the first
   extension of the project closing date. Please note that the Recipient proposed a 24 month extension in its
   letter of request for extension of closing date, however the project task team is of the view that an extension
   for a period of 18 months will be sufficient to complete the implementation of the remaining project
   activities. In addition, this shorter timeframe will help to impose time and budget constraints on the
   implementing agencies, thereby forcing them to implement activities in a focused manner and to remove
   any complacency that may arise from a longer extension period.

2. Overall, the performance ratings of the project have been Moderately Satisfactory (MS), both in terms of
   probability of achieving Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Progress (IP). As at November
   30, 2010, the project has disbursed USD 25.34 million, about 84 percent of the original amount of credit
   approved by the Board. The progress towards reaching the targets set for the key performance indicators has
   been relatively modest, due to delays in the following areas: (i) implementation of the Integrated Financial
   Management Information System (IFMIS); (ii) implementation of procurement reforms; and (iii)
   implementation of the revised pay policy. Despite these challenges, PSMP-SP has made very useful
   contributions to improvements recorded in the overall Public Financial Management (PFM) system in
   Zambia. Some of the key results were achieved in the following specific areas: (a) improved budget
   credibility with the changed budget cycle in 2009 (b) development of a macro economic model (c)
   development and implementation of a Single Treasury Account (d) development and approval of the new
   public procurement law which promotes decentralization of procurement and greater transparency; and (e)
   improved internal audit, and implementation of the integrated financial management information system
   (IFMIS) in the Ministry of Finance, with plans to roll out to seven additional sites in January 2011. Also,
   external audit has continued to improve as a result of the strengthening of the Office of the Auditor General
   (OAG) and Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC)1.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to allow the recipient to complete the implementation of activities that
   will ensure the achievement of the project objectives. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to
   these objectives and its willingness to continue the implementation of activities under the project. The
   recipient has shown new appetite for reform by ensuring that these reforms are part of the high level policy
   dialogue on budget support and are monitored through the newly introduced M&E department which
   reports on progress to Cabinet, this is different from before where implementation was left to the
   technocrats with ineffective accountability mechanisms. The performance of the borrower is now
   satisfactory with senior management now focusing on providing oversight to and demanding accountability
   from the implementing component managers. The recipient has submitted the work plan, procurement plan
   and performance assessment criteria that covers the entire period of project extension to IDA. These
   documents have been reviewed by IDA and assessed to be satisfactory.

4. The implementing entities are compliant with the Bank's financial management requirements; and there are
   no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports from these entities. The proposed extension is in
   compliance with all requirements under Operation policy and bank policy 13.30.
