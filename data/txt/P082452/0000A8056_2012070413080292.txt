                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Government, with support from cooperating Partners, has been implementing the PSMP-SP project for over six years. This projects closes on June 30, 2012. In December 2010, the
                         Government had requested and was granted an extension of the project which was approved so that they could focus on fewer components. The government focused on fewer
                         components in an attempt to improve development outcomes. It is unlikely that the project will meet it's full development objectives and has been rated moderately unsatisfactory.

                         Under the PEMFA component, significant progress has been made with the implementation and roll out of the Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS) which
                         has now been rolled out to 28 sites. Moderate progress has been achieved in the implementation of procurement reforms with the approval of the revised legislation and publication
                         of the regulations. Progress with reforms of internal audit is also moderate as activities under this component hinge of the recommendations of the consultancy that will review the

                         The midterm review carried out in 2010 recommended an integrated approach that would utilize the tools and skills developed during implementation of the PSM program through
                         piloting an integrated approach in three pilot ministries. In support of the decentralization agenda, cabinet office developed structures for local authorities in a devolved environment.
                         Implementation of the public service pay policy approved by cabinet in 2009 has continued after completion of detailed job evaluation and salary rationalization process for the core
                         civil service. The Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system was upgraded as planned and decentralization to nine provinces has been achieved.

                         Payments to all eligible staff in the water and roads sector were completed. A challenge emerged with some road sector staff who were deemed to have reentered the public service
                         by virtue of their employment in the roads agencies that were created when the transport sector was reformed. Cabinet Office indicated has presented an updated schedule of
                         eligible staff who will be paid before closure of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Government, with support from cooperating Partners, has been implementing the PSMP-SP project for over six years. This projects closes on June 30, 2012. In December 2010, the
                         Government had requested and was granted an extension of the project which was approved so that they could focus on fewer components. The government focused on fewer
                         components in an attempt to improve development outcomes. It is unlikely that the project will meet it's full development objectives and has been rated moderately unsatisfactory.
