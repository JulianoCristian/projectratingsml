Some of\n            the lessons learned include: Good analytical work is an\n            important underpinning for program design, but it is not\n            sufficient. Program design must be strategic, practical,\n            prioritized, and take into account the implementation and\n            absorptive capacity of the borrower.Project design based on\n            a complex institutional reform agenda and its implementation\n            would benefit from explicitly recognizing the iterative\n            nature of the reform process. There should be provisions for\n            frequent, in-depth supervision to inform periodically on\n            critical intervention areas that may need to be adjusted and\n            prioritized. Financing retrenchment of government employees\n            can be deeply unpopular andcarries a significant\n            reputational risk for the Bank. Unless retrenchment\n            reformsare accompanied with complementary reforms and\n            progress is closely monitoredto avoid reentry of civil\n            servants the intervention is unlikely to be effective. The\n            Bank has a rich history in retrenchment reforms and design\n            of interventionsshould carefully draw on previous\n            experience. Merit based recruitment of senior civil servants\n            is a critical aspect to performancemanagement. Performance\n            contracts are of limited value if senior civil servantsare\n            politically appointed and can be dismissed arbitrarily as\n            was the case in Zambia.Consolidating fragmented bank\n            accounts takes significant political will and maybe given\n            low priority during a time of economic growth and fiscal\n            expansion. Idle balances should be of particular concern to\n            countries prone to external shocks,  as the lack of a\n            treasury single account means that these funds cannot be\n            drawn on tocushion against unanticipated financing gaps. A\n            contractual and implementation arrangement for IFMIS that\n            assumes that acomprehensive off-the-shelf enterprise\n            resource planning package wouldcorrespond to actual\n            government and user requirements is not realistic.\n            Significant configuration and parametrization will still be\n            necessary. The Zambia case shows that the simultaneous\n            implementation of all Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System (IFMIS)modules is difficult and rarely\n            feasible. Instead a sequenced roll-out approach,prioritizing\n            core treasury reforms, can reap important low-hanging fruit\n            and ensure that client capacity is not overburdened. The\n            Bank may consider an approach where it supports training and\n            technicalsupport, leaving the financing of system\n            implementation to the client. When an implementation\n            strategy involves an interim basic custom system, it is\n            important that it is based on ex ante control of\n            transactions. In Zambia the Financial management system\n            (FMS) cannot be used to implement commitment or even basic\n            budget or cash control.The introduction of advanced\n            budgeting techniques, such as program / activity based\n            budgeting, should be introduced only after a fully\n            functioning IFMIS is in place."}, "docdt": "2016-06-28T03:41:05Z"}
