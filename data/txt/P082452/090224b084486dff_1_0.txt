      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers bot h rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the Public Sector
Management Program Support Project to Zambia, which was approved by the Board on
May 1, 2006, for US$100 million, with a closing date of December 31, 2010. The project
was financed through a US$30 million International Development Association (IDA)
credit and US$70 million co-financing from various other development partners. In
December 2010 the closing date was extended to June 30, 2012.

The program’s objective was to “make public service delivery institutions and processes
more effective and efficient by enhancing the efficiency and accountability of the
management of public expenditures and the public service in line with the GRZ strategies
to support poverty reduction and promote economic growth.” In keeping with the results
framework, the objective relating to phase II of the program is “to improve the quality of
public expenditure management and public service effectiveness in Zambia.” The lending
instrument used was an Adaptable Program Loan (APL), and the operation was the
second in a series of three. The series was subsequently terminated.

This report presents findings based on a review of the project appraisal documents, the
Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Implementation Completion and
Results Review, aide-memoires, IMF and World Bank reports, and other relevant
materials, including a number of publically available studies by various donors. An
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited Lusaka during June 20–28, 2015, to
interview government officials, the staff of the World Bank, staff of the IMF, and other
development partners and stakeholders. Bank staff members, donor representatives, and
other information providers were also interviewed at the Washington, DC, headquarters
and by telephone (see appendix H for the complete list of persons interviewed).

The assessment aims to review whether and how the operation achieved its intended
objectives. The report provides additional evidence and analysis of relevant and
comparative data for a more complete picture of the outcomes and the factors that
influenced them. By covering the period between 2013 and 2016, it offers an opportunity
for broader lessons and a longer time perspective, as well as reflection on the
sustainability of policy reforms and long-term factors that facilitated outcomes.

This assessment is part of a larger body of public sector/governance evaluations in Africa
and East Asia that will feed into a synthesis report to draw lessons on cross-country
experience. The reports provide a dedicated appendix on the design, implementation, and
utilization of Financial Management Information Systems, which have been at the core of
the reform programs.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft report was circulated in parallel
to the relevant government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. No
comments were received.

Summary
This PPAR evaluates the World Bank’s Public Sector Management Program Support
Project (PSMP-SP) for the second phase of the public service reform program in Zambia.
The project was approved on May 1, 2006, and closed on June 30, 2012, 18 months
behind schedule. The World Bank, through the International Development Association
(IDA), provided a credit of US$30 million. Additional parallel financing of US$70
million was provided for the program via a sector wide approach from a number of other
development partners.

Zambia is a landlocked country that is generously endowed with natural resources and
has benefitted from rapid economic growth since the early 2000s. Benefits of growth
were however narrowly distributed with poverty remaining widespread and many service
delivery indicators lagging behind expectations, in part due to ineffective government
intervention. With the economic position deteriorating in more recent years following the
collapse of the copper price (which halved between 2011 and 2016), the government’s
fiscal space narrowed making the effective use of public resources all the more important.
In this environment, the project’s overarching objective of making public service delivery
institutions and processes more effective and efficient was critical. To that end, the
project supported two government programs: (1) the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Program (PFMAP) aimed at strengthening the mobilization and utilization
of public finances; and (2) the Public Service Management Program (PSM) supporting
various dimensions of civil service reform. The strategic relevance of the project was
substantial, even if objectives were too ambitious. The program disbursement figures and
respective IDA contributions are outlined in table I.

Project design was however not conducive for effective implementation. The project
attempted to address an excessively wide range of system ailments with insufficient
regard to prioritization or client capacity. Sub-components ranged from macro-fiscal
modelling, budget management and execution, to beekeeping and mushroom farm
harvesting pilots. Support to a treasury single account was however not within scope,
despite its critical importance. The APL as an instrument of choice was adequate, but
would have allowed for a more phased approach than was de facto taken. Design is rated
modest.

The project contributed to some important outputs with regards to the objective of
improved public expenditure management, which was considered substantial. A macro-
fiscal forecasting and debt management system was set up and successfully implemented.

An Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) was rolled out across
government providing much needed checks and balances, and increasing the speed of
transactions. Investments in budgeting and planning have institutionalized a Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and helped the implementation of activity based
budgeting. Perhaps most notably, the effectiveness of oversight institutions has improved
with comprehensive audits now being conducted routinely, and published within a
reasonable time lag. However, these achievements have only translated into better
outcomes at the margins. Despite better macro-fiscal forecasting, fiscal discipline has
suffered from political volatility leading to large deviations in budget performance and a
fiscal deficit exceeding targets. The IFMIS was implemented but at the point of service
delivery, the legacy Financial Management System (FMS) prevails, which undermines
the effectiveness of the IFMIS as it does not have any ex-ante control mechanisms in
place. Further, large amounts of idle balances outside the purview of the treasury and
IFMIS are an efficiency concern and undermine the systems functionality as a
comprehensive expenditure management tool. Arrears also remain a concern, partly
driven by the rapid depreciation of the kwacha, and partly by disregard to commitment
control systems in place. Finally, the legal framework for public financial management
remains fragmented and mostly outdated, despite considerable technical assistance.

Similarly, the effectiveness of the public service has benefited from investments in
upstream systems leading to improved payment and establishment control, which
contributed to strengthening the transparency and accountability of payroll management.
Further an important pay policy was developed and approved. Efforts to introduce
performance-based pay have however not been fruitful, and Permanent Secretaries
continue to be political appointees, rather than being selected on merit. There remains
evidence of poor staff qualification, staff shortages, and moonlighting in critical service
delivery sectors, as well as positions remaining unfilled. Further, an unsustainable
increase in wages put stress on an already fragile fiscal situation without clear evidence
of how this would act as an impetus to improved civil servants’ motivation or
performance. Consequently, the objective of improved public service effectiveness was
rated modest.

With regards to the overarching project and program objective, the project failed to
plausibly link investments in key upstream reform areas (as discussed above) to improved
efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery institutions. There is a general lack
of evidence on how, and to what extent, service delivery institutions benefited from these
interventions and were able to deliver services more effectively and efficiently as a result.
There was some progress in pilots pertaining to the service delivery fund, but these were
isolated efforts, with no provisions for scaling up. Improvements in services delivery
across the country have been modest, and it is unlikely that this is attributable to project
interventions.

The project contributed to some positive returns, most notably through setting up
systems. However, there were a number of concerns about the efficient use of project
resources. Complex project design and donor coordination mechanisms led to
disbursement delays and inefficient implementation and supervision arrangements. The
project included subcomponents with questionable relevance to this project, such as
beekeeping and mushroom farming pilots. Further, there were a number of inefficiencies
                                            xiii


with regards to IFMIS implementation, including legal disputes, extensive
parameterization, and frequent turnover of staff. Finally, undocumented and illegible
expenditures constitutes an inefficient use of project funds. On balance, efficiency was
rated modest.

The overall project outcome was rated moderately unsatisfactory, which is a composite
rating of substantial relevance of objectives and modest relevance of design, mixed
efficacy with major reservations, and modest efficiency.

Despite an effort to sustain and deepen some of the activities through the support of a
follow up operation (PFMRP Phase I) there remain significant risks with regards to
project achievements:

      The continued use of the legacy Financial Management System (FMS), which
       does not have ex ante transaction control (or even basic budget or cash control),
       undermines budget management and jeopardizes the integrity of budget execution
       reports. Donors continue to push for the continued use of the FMS to support
       sector specific interventions. This cannot yield results and instead props up a
       system that should be abandoned.

      There remain important gaps with core IFMIS functionality and coverage, which
       are insufficiently addressed in the current reform program. Instead ongoing
       investments are centered on items of lower priority including technical aspects
       and non-core IFMIS functionality.

      There remain risks with regards to mainstreaming IFMIS project staff back into
       government operations. Further, there is a growing interest for sector specific
       information systems, which would fragment the systems architecture and dilute
       capacity.

      Progress with regards to the treasury single account has been slow, and the current
       reform approach is based only linked accounts. It does not require balances to be
       swept into the central bank unconditionally, nor does it require that accounts
       operate on a zero balance basis. While linking accounts means that balances
       would be known, the central bank will not be able to draw on them for investment
       (or fund requests from other spending units), nor do they extend its overdraft
       limit. Further adherence to the annual budget law cannot be strictly enforced for
       these balances under such an arrangement.

      The premature roll out of advanced budgeting techniques has become a risk to
       budget management and execution, causing a proliferation of transactions that has
       become unmanageable.

Overall bank and borrower performance was rated unsatisfactory and moderately
unsatisfactory respectively. Bank performance suffered from poor quality at entry,
especially due to excessive complexity that made the project difficult to implement and
manage. Analytical underpinnings were adequate, although the Bank did not draw
sufficient lessons from the first phase of the APL or IFMIS implementation experience
                                              xiv


from other countries. Borrower performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory
reflecting poor government ownership of various reforms, but compensated by
implementing agencies’ commitment to critical components.

The project offers a number of important lessons, some specific to Zambia and others that
are broader and generalizable. These are summarized below:

      Good analytical work is an important underpinning for program design, but it is
       not sufficient. Program design must be strategic, practical, prioritized, and take
       into account the implementation and absorptive capacity of the borrower.

      Project design based on a complex institutional reform agenda and its
       implementation would benefit from explicitly recognizing the iterative nature of
       the reform process. There should be provisions for frequent, in-depth supervision
       to inform periodically on critical intervention areas that may need to be adjusted
       and prioritized.

      Donor coordination modalities should be carefully considered prior to project
       inception and should be designed to reduce transaction costs to the government
       without making implementation arrangements excessively complex.

      Financing retrenchment of government employees can be deeply unpopular and
       carries a significant reputational risk for the Bank. Unless retrenchment reforms
       are accompanied with complementary reforms and progress is closely monitored
       to avoid reentry of civil servants the intervention is unlikely to be effective. The
       Bank has a rich history in retrenchment reforms and design of interventions
       should carefully draw on previous experience.

      Merit based recruitment of senior civil servants is a critical aspect to performance
       management. Performance contracts are of limited value if senior civil servants
       are politically appointed and can be dismissed arbitrarily as was the case in
       Zambia.

      Consolidating fragmented bank accounts takes significant political will and may
       be given low priority during a time of economic growth and fiscal expansion. Idle
       balances should be of particular concern to countries prone to external shocks, as
       the lack of a treasury single account means that these funds cannot be drawn on to
       cushion against unanticipated financing gaps. Linking accounts (such that
       balances are known) may be politically more feasible, but does not address the
       main problem that these funds are not within the purview of the treasury. Budget
       support operations may provide leverage for accelerating such reforms.

      A contractual and implementation arrangement for IFMIS that assumes that a
       comprehensive off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning package would
       correspond to actual government and user requirements is not realistic. Significant
       configuration and parametrization will still be necessary. If this is not understood
       at the outset this can lead to repeated configuration exercises, and additional costs
       in the form of variation orders to the contract as was the case in Zambia.
                                         xv


   The Zambia case shows that the simultaneous implementation of all IFMIS
    modules is difficult and rarely feasible. Instead a sequenced roll-out approach,
    prioritizing core treasury reforms, can reap important low-hanging fruit and
    ensure that client capacity is not overburdened.

   The Bank may consider an approach where it supports training and technical
    support, leaving the financing of system implementation to the client. This may
    bring in realism, strengthen commitment, and avoid undue engagement in non-
    core modules. Comparing the PMEC and IFMIS experience makes for such a
    case. Government financed essential incremental improvements in PMEC. In
    contrast, the donor financed IFMIS included many non-core modules that were
    not necessary and diluted implementation capacity.

   When an implementation strategy involves an interim basic custom system, it is
    important that it is based on ex ante control of transactions. In Zambia the FMS
    cannot be used to implement commitment or even basic budget or cash control.
    Combining FMS data—which has no controls, and therefore cannot guarantee
    completeness or authenticity—with IFMIS data—which does have ex ante
    transaction control—jeopardizes the integrity of the IFMIS data and the resulting
    combined budget execution reports.

   The introduction of advanced budgeting techniques, such as program / activity
    based budgeting, should be introduced only after a fully functioning IFMIS is in
    place.

1. Background and Context
1.1     This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the World Bank’s
Public Sector Management Program Support Project for the second phase of the public
service reform program in Zambia. The project was approved on May 1, 2006, and closed on
June 30, 2012, 18 months behind schedule. The World Bank, through the International
Development Association (IDA), provided a credit of US$30 million, and additional parallel
financing of US$70 million was provided for the program by the African Development Bank,
the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), the Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Irish Aid, the European Commission, the
Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the U.K.’s Department for
International Development (DFID), and the Finnish International Development Agency
(FINNIDA).

1.2     Zambia has been a peaceful and politically stable country for most of its post-
independence history, as evidenced in the peaceful transfer of power in the 2011 presidential
election and subsequent transition in 2014 following the President’s death. It is generously
endowed with natural resources, but relies most heavily on copper, which exposes the
country to fluctuations in global demand, and being landlocked it faces long supply chains.
The economic and fiscal outlook in the 2000s has been generally positive, driven by high
copper prices and underpinned by a stable macroeconomic environment. In the mid-2000s,
Zambia benefitted considerably from debt relief initiatives1 amounting to the clearance of
about US$6.5 billion in debt service obligations, which improved the country’s external
position, allowed the build-up of much-needed foreign exchange reserves, and created
additional fiscal space. Zambia’s revenue performance has been around 20 percent of GDP
and above regional peers, also driven by the favorable external position. As a result of stable
growth and sufficient revenue performance, the nominal fiscal space has grown by an
average of 20 percent since 2004 (IMF 2015; World Bank 2016).

1.3     Copper prices have however halved since 20112 contributing to a current account
deficit and decline in mining related investments. Expenditure adjustments have not been
commensurate with reduction in revenue, and the fiscal balance deteriorated from a 1.8
percent deficit in 2010 to 7.7 percent in 20153, and GDP growth fell to 3 percent. The
expansionary budget was insufficiently investment oriented and driven by subsidy overruns
and wage increases. It did not stimulate the economy as was hoped. At the same time, there
has been a steady reduction in foreign aid, including both budget support and project grants,
especially since the country is classified as a lower-middle-income country4 and started
issuing Eurobonds.

1.4     The deficit was financed by an increased issuance of treasury bills and by using part
of the 2012 Eurobond proceeds (US$750 million) that had not yet been spent, but were
intended for investments of state-owned enterprises. Eurobonds totaling US$1 billion were
issued again in April 2014 to offset the current account deficit. While debt risk is considered
moderate, debt to GDP doubled between 2010 and 2014, and the increased debt service ratio
(driven largely by non-concessional debt) has increased debt vulnerability (IMF 2015). Select
economic indicators are provided in table 1.1.

1.5     Corruption remains a serious issue and Zambia was ranked 83 out of 177 countries in
the 2013 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. According to the World
Bank’s governance indicators, Zambia scores high on political stability, but only fair on
voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and rule of law. Regarding control of corruption
and government effectiveness, Zambia scored very low and below peers such as Malawi,
Rwanda, South African, Tanzania, and Uganda. The Zambian Auditor General’s reports have
indicated misuse and misappropriation of public resources.

1.6     Despite rapid economic growth, the benefits of growth were narrowly distributed and
poverty remains widespread. According to the latest (albeit dated) Living Conditions
Monitoring Survey (GoZ 2010a), the national poverty rate was about 60 percent, and had
thus not improved significantly from the 62.8 percent estimated in 2006. Extreme poverty
was estimated at 42 percent of the population, with insufficient consumption of calories to
meet daily minimum food requirements. Further, there is growing rural-urban divide. With a
majority of the rural population dependent on subsistence agriculture, rural poverty remains
at 78 percent -- similar to the 80 percent recorded in 2006. Some service delivery indicators
improved, though levels attained were not commensurate with the economic performance of
the country, and Human Development Indicators remain well below low- and middle-income
country averages. As a proxy, the under-five mortality rate of 64.0 per 1,000 is considerably
higher than the low- and middle-income average of 47.3 in 2015.5 Zambia was ranked 163
out of 187 countries on the Human Development Indicators. Rapid population growth of

about 3 percent further strains the limited capacity of institutions. Appendix G provides an
overview of economic and social data between 2006 and 2014.

1.7      Against this background, the project aimed to contribute to making public service
delivery institutions more effective and efficient through strengthening public financial
management and reforming the civil service. The operation was designed to address
shortcomings in the public finance environment as identified in the 2003 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (World Bank 2003b). In particular, it noted that there were
considerable weaknesses in the areas of budget management, financial reporting and audit,
internal control, human resource management, and procurement, and that many public
finance laws and regulations were insufficiently enforced. This led to a breakdown of
administrative systems and procedures for the control of expenditure. Audit systems that
were in place to detect instances of poor financial governance were ineffective due to the
lack of follow-up and enforcement of the auditor general’s recommendations. Lack of
sanctions may only have served to embolden those who have been engaged in improper
activities (World Bank 2003b). The project was implemented in parallel with a series of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits, which included a number of public finance management
(PFM)-related policy actions in an effort to leverage upstream policy dialogue. These are
detailed in appendix B.

1.8     Project implementation coincided with the time of the fifth and sixth National
Development Plan, which made explicit reference to the importance of public sector reform
as an impetus to promoting growth in labour intensive sectors and make service delivery
more effective. The present government recognized the need to continue with PFM reform
and has developed a three-year (2013–2015) PFM reform strategy focusing on improving
efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and transparency in the use of public resources.

2. Objectives, Design, and Relevance
2.1     This operation was the second phase of a three-tiered APL program, with an overall
program objective of making “public service delivery processes more effective and efficient
in order to facilitate economic growth and reduce poverty” (World Bank 2000, p. 3). The
objective of the first phase (the Public Sector Capacity Building Project, or PSCAP) was “to
design and begin to implement the critical system-wide reforms that will support improved
service delivery in the sectors.” The first phase would put in place the basic financial
management, accountability, transparency, and personnel systems and begin to reform wages
to attract and retain staff. Performance rating are provided in appendix B. Phase 2—the
project to which this PPAR pertains—was intended to roll out the systems developed and
piloted under phase 1 throughout the public service, and the third phase would then be a
consolidation phase, during which the benefits of the two previous phases would be
monitored and evaluated, and appropriate adjustments made to make them more effective.
Triggers and progress against triggers are outlined in appendix B.

Objectives
2.2    The project development objective (PDO) of this operation (the second phase,
according to the project appraisal document [PAD]) was similar to that of the overall
                                                   4


program: “to make public service delivery institutions and processes more effective and
efficient by enhancing the efficiency and accountability of the management of public
expenditures and the public service in line with the GRZ [Government of the Republic of
Zambia] strategies to support poverty reduction and promote economic growth” (World
Bank 2005b, p. 2). The PDO, in accordance with the financing agreement, schedule 1, was:
“to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its [the Recipient’s] public service delivery
institutions, through enhanced accountability of the management of public expenditure and
public service in line with its [the Recipient’s] strategies for poverty reduction and
promotion of its [the Recipient’s] economic growth” (World Bank 2006, p. 5).

2.3     The results framework in the PAD, annex 3, however, used a somewhat different
PDO: “to improve the quality of public expenditure management and public service
effectiveness in Zambia as a means to achieve: (1) economic growth and poverty reduction;
(2) a more efficient public service; and (3) the adoption of direct budgetary support as the
principal mechanism for development aid in Zambia” (World Bank 2005b, p. 32).

2.4     This assessment uses the results framework in the PAD because it best reflects the
intent of the operation.6 To that end, there is a separate discussion of (1) improved quality of
public expenditure management and (2) improved public service effectiveness. Efficacy as
per PDO in the financing agreement is discussed as a higher level objective.7

Design
2.5     The Public Sector Management Program Support Project was a World Bank project
in support of the broader governmental Public Sector Management Program, which had three
components: (i) public expenditure management and financial accountability (PEMFA); (ii)
public service management (PSM); and (iii) supporting retrenchments. The World Bank
committed US$30.0 million as part of a sector-wide approach (SWAP) arrangement; other
donors pledged US$78.8 million in parallel financing. Because individual contributions are
indistinguishable from one another, this evaluation assesses the program as a whole,
considering the World Bank as an important contributing agency.

2.6     Component 1: Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
(budget, US$72.6 million; actual, US$85.1 million). This component was intended to
strengthen the legal, accounting, and administrative frameworks for public expenditure
management through 13 interrelated subcomponents. Subcomponents included strengthening
the commitment control system through support of the financial management system (FMS)
and developing, piloting, and rolling out an integrated financial management information
system (IFMIS), where the bulk of project resources were allocated (about 39 percent). Other
subcomponents encompassed strengthening fiscal policy and economic planning through the
development of a macroeconomic budget model, strengthening activity-based budgeting
(ABB), and improving budget presentation. Further, there were subcomponents relating to a

    As per IEG procedures, this redefinition of PDO was approved in writing by its management.
7
  It should be noted that the second parts of the PDO statements starting with “in line with..,”
“through…” or “as a means to achieve…” should be considered as expected contributions to higher
level objectives.

better cash-release system, improvement of the debt management strategy and systems,
strengthening of internal and external audit functions and oversight of parliamentary
committees, and reform of the public procurement system.

2.7     Component 2: Public Service Management (budget, US$25.0 million; actual,
US$25.7 million). This component aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of public service
management. Activities included rightsizing the public service—focusing mainly on
provincial and district administration—to more sustainable and efficient levels. This also
included the development and financing of a social protection strategy, given the likely
adverse consequences. Second, it included a comprehensive pay reform, from developing a
comprehensive pay policy, to designing a salary scheme including a performance-related pay
structure, to an action plan for the Medium-Term Pay Reform Strategy (MTPRS). The third
element was closely related and supported performance management, and finally to
establishing effective payroll and establishment controls.

2.8     Component 3: Supporting Retrenchments (budget, US$9.7 million; actual, US$9.4
million). This component provided resources to pay separation packages, implement a
comprehensive social safety net program to cushion the impact of unemployment on those
retrenched as a consequence of the rightsizing efforts, implementation of the Payroll
Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system, and the operationalization of
restructured ministries.

2.9    An overview of planned and actual expenditures by component is provided in table
2.1. The PEMFA budged was exceeded significantly, in part due to greater than expected
government contributions stemming from increased investment costs pertaining to the
IFMIS. The IDA contribution was a relatively small share of expenditures under this
component. Expenditures closely matched IDA allocations in the case of PSM and
retrenchment components, the latter of which was funded entirely from IDA resources.

Implementation
2.10 As outlined above, the program was designed as a SWAP arrangement, with an IDA
contribution of US$30.0 million. The breakdown of other partners’ contributions to the
various components is provided in table 2.2. The project was approved by the Board on
January 5, 2006, and became effective on May 10, 2006. The project was designed to be
completed within 5 years, but was restructured on December 30, 2010, to extend the closing
date for 18 months, from December 31, 2010, to June 30, 2012, to allow the completion of a
number of activities, including work on the IFMIS, the procurement reform, and
implementation of the revised pay policy.

2.11 Project implementation and supervision arrangements were subject to a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) signed by all contributing partners and the government for the
PEMFA and PSA components of the program (GoZ 2004). While this largely governed the
execution of the various subcomponents, these were not legally binding contracts, and
bilateral agreements between the various partners and the government took precedence in
case of disputes.

2.12 The principal MOU guiding the PEMFA component was signed in December 2004
(17 months prior to project effectiveness). It outlines the various project components and
stresses that partners would “strive for the highest degree of alignment with the budgetary
and accountability system” (GoZ 2004, p. 2). It provides details on implementation
arrangements and makes provisions for a number of steering committees, working groups,
and secretariats that would oversee the process (see GoZ 2004, p. 5). The PEMFA program
underwent a number of important changes during implementation, outside regular Bank
procedures (that is, restructuring papers). These were captured by a follow-up MOU on July
11, 2008, which extended the program until December 31, 2010 (the original closing date of
the Bank’s project), and streamlined the number of components: (i) IFMIS; (ii) budget
                                                7


preparation and execution; (iii) debt management; (iv) internal audit and control; (v) legal
and regulatory framework; (vi) accounting, training, and regulation; and (vii) public
procurement reforms. The MOU was amended for a second time on June 30, 2011, to extend
the program until December 31, 2012, and to further streamline activities to: (i) IFMIS; (ii)
internal audit and control; and (iii) procurement reforms. Revenue administration was added
as a subcomponent that was previously not included in the program. (see ICR, World Bank
2014)

2.13 Similarly, the PSM program was supported by an MOU signed in November 2005,
which outlined the roles and responsibilities of the various contributing partners. It contains
details on the various implementing arrangements, and also makes provisions for oversight,
advisory, and coordination bodies. This MOU covers the subcomponents of (i) rightsizing;
(ii) pay reform; (iii) service delivery improvement; and (iv) payroll management and
establishment control. Following recommendations from the mid-term review, an addendum
to the MOU was issued on January 16, 2009, changing the “rightsizing” component to
“institutional appraisal and organizational development,” and “payroll management and
establishment control” and “payroll reform” were streamlined into “payroll and human
resource management.” Despite these efforts, however, the activities remained much the
same. No subsequent amendments or additions were issued. Retrenchment was handled
directly by IDA and was not subject to the agreement.

2.14 The MOUs dealing with donor coordination described a complicated decision and
coordination structure in which overall oversight and policy guidance for both components
were to be provided by a Public Service Reform Program (PSRP) Steering Committee,
chaired by the secretary to the cabinet, and assisted by a secretariat. The PEMFA Steering
Committee and the Office of the Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, Finance and Economic
Development were responsible for monitoring project implementation, control of financing,
and provision of policy guidelines. The PSM Steering Committee provided high-level
oversight and back-stopping, and was intended to work closely with the permanent
secretaries in the Management Development Division and the Public Service Management
Division (PSMD), both in the Cabinet Office. Both steering committees reported to the PSRP
Steering Committee to ensure compliance with PSMP program and policy guidelines, each
assisted by a project secretariat staffed by a director and appropriate specialists (for example,
finance, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation). There were separate joint technical
working groups where donors and government officials met to take stock of progress and
discuss the technical aspects of program implementation, and committees where cooperating
partners alone met to review progress. A lead donor was identified for each subcomponent of
the project, based on interest and competitive advantage. A diagram showing key
implementation arrangements can be found in the PAD, p.52 (World Bank 2006).

2.15 However, some dissatisfaction with the SWAP pooled funding arrangements was
voiced by several donors, in particular pertaining to the coordination of the release of funds.
Timely releases were difficult to coordinate across multiple donors, which slowed down
implementation and led to frustration in implementing agencies and government. The
European Commission was unable to pool funds, despite being a signatory to the MOU, and
instead provided notional budget support.
                                               8


2.16 Implementation in the early years was slow, in part due to frequent staff changes in
government as well as the complex implementation arrangements of the SWAP, which
delayed decision making and created difficulty in coordinating disbursements across
partners. A mid-term review was undertaken in August 2008 rating the project moderately
unsatisfactory and providing a number of recommendations to streamline implementation
procedures,8 after which progress improved somewhat, especially with regard to the IFMIS.

IFMIS Implementation Experience
2.17 IFMIS implementation started in the early years of PEMFA, and a contract for
systems implementation was awarded to an international firm, Soluziona S.A. of Spain, after
an international competitive bidding (ICB) of approximately US$23.5 million in November
2006. The contract called for the implementation of an off-the-shelf package to address
financial management and budget execution issues in Zambia. The firm offered SAP as its
application software choice in its bid.

2.18 It was agreed between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the contractor that the
system would be implemented at eight pilot sites, including the MOF, and in two provinces.
The objective of the pilot was to confirm the proof of concept. The sites had been selected so
that they represented the whole cross-section of functional requirements and types of
transactions that are generated across government. The piloting in eight sites was supposed to
commence in April 2008. However, implementation soon ran into trouble for the following
reasons:

       Frequent changes in the team of officers responsible for the program, which also
        indicated a lack of senior management ownership of the IFMIS program.

       The contractor’s firm was bought out by another firm, INDIRA. This required that
        government clarify the legal status of the contract in order to conduct due diligence
        before proceeding with implementation. It took seven months for the Ministry of
        Legal affairs to give clearance to proceed, causing a delay in the schedule.

       Loss of confidence by the government in the IFMIS management team required that
        they be replaced.

2.19 In order to address the above concerns, government management, including the
secretary to the treasury; the secretary to the cabinet; the permanent secretary of planning,
and the permanent secretary of budget, decided to focus on the challenges facing IFMIS
implementation and initiated a review of the system. It was decided that the piloting of the
IFMIS would be restricted to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOF), which
should be able to have a technical “go live” date in November 2008. After this, there could
be a more realistic and well-coordinated rollout of the IFMIS. A new IFMIS management
team made up of senior public servants from the accountant general’s office was put in place.
8
 After MTR “Rightsizing” was mapped to “Institutional Appraisal and Organizational
Development,” and “Payroll Management and Establishment Control”, and “Pay Reform” was
combined into one component called “Payroll and Human Resources Management,” to complete the
pay policy reform and manage the payroll.
                                                      9


The government staff seconded to the IFMIS project was to be reassessed and retained on
merit. A team that included legal experts was put in place to carry out due diligence of the
IFMIS solution provider and sort out issues related to the contract.

2.20 The implementation arrangements—in which multiple donors were able to voice
requirements and there was no single, direct line of communication and control with the
contractor—affected the ability of the government to manage the contractor. In response to
the changes proposed by government, the contractor put forward a payment request of
US$6.0 million9 and convinced the government to pay for these and similar modifications,
without consulting donors. This matter only came to the attention of the Bank when the
government asked for a reimbursement of the amount from the pooled funds, which was
denied, because procurement staff and advisers found that these items were not eligible under
the original contract. After additional requests from the contractor for further payments were
denied by the government, there was a breakdown of relations. As a result government was
left with one pilot site only partially implemented, and the contractor refused to do more
work without further payments.

2.21 This situation brought out the weaknesses in the donor supervision arrangements for
this component. In theory, DFID was the lead donor for this subcomponent, but it did not
have the necessary capacity on the ground to carry out the task. The Bank was in a better
position to oversee IFMIS implementation but was not directly responsible according to
division of labor in the MOU signed by all donors before the start of the project.
Nevertheless, the Bank started taking a more proactive role after the rejection of payments
halted progress in order to help put implementation on track. It helped prevent further
financial costs and strengthened the government’s position with the contractor.

2.22 In the meantime, the government requested that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) review the pilot implementation and advice on the future course of action. The IMF
adopted a cautious approach and various options for the way forward. The IMF mission in
September 2010 noted that the selection of SAP as the platform for implementation might not
have been the most suitable choice for the GoZ, and simpler and more contextually
appropriate application software arrangements would have been better. It was also
recommended that all activities related to rollout be stopped until a formal review of the
existing pilot was carried out and the project rescoped (Klimavics and Murphy 2010).

2.23 The Bank also fielded a mission to review the implementation status at about the
same time and noted that at the MOF pilot site, the system had been made operational, and
the transaction-processing layer for budget execution had been implemented. All departments
in the MOF were using the system. Budget preparation was still on activity-based budgeting
(ABB), and approved budget appropriations were loaded into the new system by the Budget
Department, which also carried out budget releases on the new system. The MOF used the
system for processing all expenditure transactions. Procurement requests, purchase orders
(PO), goods received notes (GRN), and invoices were processed and checks printed through
the system. There was also a working interface with the payroll system. Altogether, there
were about 50 users at the MOF and there was no evidence that a parallel second set of books

9
    Charges for a new set of servers and a charge for delaying the pilot implementation at all sites.
                                               10


was maintained on another system. Thus, the Bank mission recommended—contrary to the
IMF recommendations—that the IFMIS setup could be used for further rollouts without
significant risks (with some clean-up for more efficient processing). Recommendations made
at the time are outlined in appendix D.

2.24 The Bank was of the view that while the government should address the core issues
related to the technology infrastructure to ensure that the system can operate, it need not wait
for a fully functional system at one pilot site that is complete in all its aspects before
proceeding further with the other pilot sites. The Bank also noted that the government was
willing to proceed with rolling out to other sites on its own with the SAP expertise it had
acquired. This political support was critical to making progress with the IFMIS and that a
hiatus at that point could lead to a waning of this support. Further, the government had
already acquired 1,500 licenses through an ICB process and built internal capacity, and
starting the process afresh would be costly and delay implementation further.

2.25 Once the government decided to follow Bank advice, the Bank took a more active
role in monitoring the process and placed a lead financial management specialist in-country.
The implementation process improved significantly, and the team was indeed able to deliver
on the promised additional pilot sites. Parallel to the rollout, reviews of the system
configuration were done and issues related to configurations corrected. Steady progress
continued on this component, and the 28 sites were delivered at the close of the project. The
quality of supervision and borrower performance both improved significantly after 2010, and
this continued to the end of the project.

2.26 Overall, the Bank intervention was critical in keeping work on the IFMIS on track.
Continuation of the rollout and embarking on a parallel effort to correct the configuration and
resolve other problems retained momentum, which was crucial to advancement of system
implementation. This was confirmed to the present assessment mission by the government
team. The Bank continues to support IFMIS implementation through a follow-up operation,
which has also corrected some of the design deficiencies of the earlier interventions. A total
of 43 out of 50 ministries, provinces, and spending agencies (MPSAs) have now been
implemented. A much more detailed review of IFMIS design, implementation, and utilization
is provided in appendix D.

Fiduciary Issues and Safeguards
2.27 A number of fiduciary issues were correctly identified in the ICR. These are reiterated
and elaborated as follows:

      Reporting: While the annual audited financial statements were submitted on time, the
       unaudited interim financial reports were generally submitted late. Although these
       reports included statements of expenditure comparing actual expenditure against the
       budget line item, there were no explanations of variances, rendering the analysis
       inadequate, as most of these variances were substantial. The project typically
       exceeded operating costs, while underspending or failing to use funds budgeted for
       core activities, such as consultancies and equipment.
                                               11


      Internal controls: In internal control, weaknesses appeared during external audits by
       the Office of the Auditor General. These included ineligible expenditures, the manual
       accounting system not interfacing with FMS, weak internal audit control checks, and
       failure to follow up retirement of imprest.

      Contract management: Under the IFMIS subcomponent, change orders were signed
       with the contractor, INDRA, and payments made before seeking Bank non-objection.
       When the non-objection was eventually sought, the changes were found to be
       unjustified, and the Bank declined to give the non-objection and asked that the funds
       be repaid into the pool. Though this did not affect solely IDA funds, IDA funds were
       included in the pooled funds. The government had to make provisions to repay the
       funds into the common pool.

      Disbursements: Funds disbursed slowly during the project’s life. The project was not
       proactive in submitting withdrawal applications for either replenishment of the
       designated account or documentation of expenditure. When the PSM component of
       the project closed in June 2012, it had used only 91 percent of the credit.

      Undocumented/ineligible expenditure: Nearly US$800,000 remained undocumented
       at project close. Ineligible expenses amounting to about US$100,000 were
       subsequently reimbursed proportionally to the respective donors by the government.

      Safeguards: The project made provisions for minor civil works and triggered an
       environmental assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01). No expected negative impacts were
       expected as only renovations of existing structures were planned. During
       implementation, the project funded the construction of procurement office buildings.
       No updated environmental assessment was shared with IEG, and it remains unclear
       whether it was conducted. The PAD also states (para 68) that a social impact
       assessment would be conducted prior to effectiveness in response to the retrenchment
       component, which was also not shared with the team. This was however not included
       as a formal effectiveness condition.

Relevance of Objectives
2.28 Improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery institutions
was substantially relevant at the time of the design and implementation, and it remained
critical at project closure, and remains so today. With the substantial increase in discretionary
financing, increased access to private markets, and debt relief, the cost of ineffective use of
resources was—and remains—particularly high, and interventions aimed at strengthening the
underlying public finance system that facilitate the delivery of services are critically
important.

2.29 Public expenditure management. At the time of project approval, public
expenditure management was beset by (i) an inadequate PFM legal system that was also
insufficiently enforced; (ii) budgets that were neither comprehensive nor credible; (iii) a
proliferation of supplementary budget appropriations used to reallocate as well as increase
expenditure allocations; (iv) a lack of transparency in budget management caused in part by
                                                  12


weak financial reporting; (v) a weak internal control environment; (vi) an accumulation of
significant expenditure arrears (estimated at the time at 12 percent of total expenditure, or 3.7
percent of GDP); and (vii) insufficient capacity, independence, and credibility of the
oversight institutions (World Bank 2004). Strengthening public expenditure management
with regard to all of the above was an important though ambitious objective.

2.30 Public service effectiveness. In addition to sound financial management, the
effective delivery of services also hinges on effective public services. At the time, low pay
undermined recruitment, retention, motivation, and productivity of staff. Added to this was a
poorly constructed internal grading structure and an incremental system based on length of
service, not performance, thus stifling initiative. Further, the fragmentation of job grades and
the dependence on allowances to enhance compensation meant at times conflicting incentives
and ran contrary to good practice and had conflicting

2.31 Relevance to country strategy. The project was originally designed to support the
Zambia Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper on improving public service management capacity
in the leadership and management of Poverty Reduction Strategy programs. The reform
program is especially important for Zambia in light of its need to manage resource revenues,
and it is closely aligned with Zambia’s long-term development strategy, Vision 2030, as well
as the fifth and sixth National Development Plans (NDPs). The sixth NDP notes that “good
governance remains the cornerstone for prudent management of public affairs and ensuring
that development outcomes benefit the people of Zambia” (GoZ 2011c, p. 24). Further, the
program continues to be closely aligned with the government’s 2013–15 PFM reform
strategy, which maintains critical reform components, including planning and budgeting,
IFMIS and cash management, internal controls, public procurement reform, and domestic
revenues.

2.32 Relevance to World Bank strategy. The main focus of Bank Group country
strategies in Zambia during the past decade has been to align lending and non-lending
activities with Zambia’s transition from a low-income to a lower-middle-income country10.
The heavy debt burden, weak institutional capacity, ineffective spending, and the HIV/AIDS
epidemics were among the main challenges identified in the country assistance strategy
(CAS) for fiscal years 2004-07. Public expenditure management and public service
management remained high priorities in the Bank’s CAS at closing (FY08-FY1111), with an
associated outcome of "strengthened public financial management, procurement and
oversight capacity," which incorporated project elements, including the IFMIS, procurement
reform, strengthening of the audit capacity, and improved public service management. The
CAS and government also emphasized the importance of harmonizing donor financing flows,
which underpinned project design. Further importance of PFM is reflected in the fact it was a
PRSC pillar.

2.33 However, while these objectives were important and aligned with government and
Bank strategy, public service institutions remained undefined, making the objective statement

10
     Zambia attained lower-middle income country status in 2012.
11
     CAS was extended to 2012.
                                                 13


vague. Further, objectives were excessively ambitious, covering the entirety of the public
sector, which was not commensurate with government reform implementation capacity. An
objective statement based on a sequenced reform agenda (such as under Adaptable Program
Loan 1) would have been more suitable, and political capital could have been more focused
and utilized more effectively. On balance, relevance of objectives is rated substantial.

Relevance of Design
2.34 The chain of logic for improved quality of public expenditure management was
uneven. The project addressed an exhaustive list of interventions (12 interrelated technical
subcomponents) as identified by analytical work done prior to project preparation, including
the design, procurement, and rollout of an IFMIS, development of a macroeconomic budget
model, improvement of budget presentation, a better cash-release system, improvement of
the debt management strategy and systems, strengthening of internal and external audit
functions and oversight of parliamentary committees, and reform of the public procurement
system. However, there were far too many subcomponents and the project was excessively
complex. Conversely, the project did not address issues pertaining to the Treasury Single
Account (TSA), which is a critical enabling condition for the functioning of the IFMIS, even
though an attempt to introduce the TSA had been unsuccessfully a few years earlier under the
2000 Fiscal Sustainability Adjustment Credit. Another issue is whether the project should
have also focused more explicitly on public expenditure allocation policy. Public service
management was credibly supported by rightsizing the civil service, retrenchment, pay
reform, and payroll management and establishment control. It is unclear why retrenchment
was viewed as a stand-alone component rather than subsumed in the overall public service
management effort (as also presented in interim performance reports).

2.35 Further, there is a conceptual gap between supporting expenditure management and
the civil service, and the overarching objective of improved efficiency and effectiveness of
public service delivery institutions. While upstream expenditure management reforms are
important for the financial management processes at the service-delivery level, this linkage
should have been made more explicit. Similarly, the results framework for civil service
reform (as discussed in more depth in chapter 9) lacked legitimate outcome indicators. There
was only one peripheral subcomponent that explicitly addressed service delivery
improvement, which financed various service delivery pilots,12 but did not establish the link
to efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery institutions. Further, these pilots were
unrelated to the upstream interventions. While these may have been important in their own
right, integrating them in this project unnecessarily complicated an already excessively
complex project design and made supervision difficult. For instance, the same task team
leader who supervised IFMIS implementation would also be responsible for monitoring
progress in, for example, the beekeeping pilot.

2.36 Objectives lacked clear metrics and observable outcome targets to show the levels of
ambition and the desired progress being sought. The causal chains linking the activities

12
  These include a community-based beekeeping project, a mushroom spawn production pilot, a
smallholder milk-processing extension project, and the establishment of a mobile local court system
pilot.
                                               14


supported by the project to the intermediate and final outcomes were reasonably clear in
principle, but without specific and attributable outcome targets, it was not possible to monitor
progress adequately or to ascertain whether the outcomes were achievable within the
resource envelope of this operation. For example, the indicator referring to the ratio of the
total public wage bill to the public service head count is unclear and provides no meaningful
information regarding the effectiveness of the civil service; indicators regarding public
expenditure management are process-oriented and are insufficient for measuring the strategic
allocation of resources, operational efficiency, or effectiveness of oversight institutions.
None of them are an adequate reflection of the effectiveness of public service delivery
institutions.

2.37 While project design was based on sound analytical underpinnings, the project was
made excessively complex by attempting to address too many system ailments without
regard to prioritization or client capacity. With regard to expenditure management, reforms
encompassed the entirety of the budget cycle, involving a large range of departments and
agencies with interrelated functions. The project may have benefited from focusing instead
on budget execution, which in and of itself is sufficiently complex. Similarly, comprehensive
civil service reform may have been overly ambitious and complex, and the project may have
been more effective in focusing only on payroll management and establishment control.
Complexity together with complicated coordination mechanisms turned out to be a critical
implementation constraint. Project components were subsequently streamlined during two
amendments to the original MOU (in 2008 and in 2011), after which the project focused
more explicitly on support to the IFMIS, internal audit, procurement, and revenue
administration (see subsection on implementation above).

2.38 Notwithstanding the above, a three-tiered APL was likely to have been the
appropriate choice of instrument. Reflecting on progress from the APL 1, and given that most
reforms in the program were first-generation reforms, the APL, an instrument that allows a
more phased approach, was not utilized to its full potential by ignoring lessons learnt during
the first phase, instead overburdening country capacity with excessive complexity.

2.39   Reflecting the above, relevance of design is rated modest.

3. Achievement of the Objectives
3.1     The operation under review is a hybrid—it falls between a traditional project in terms
of how the financing is provided, and a SWAP from the standpoint of supporting a coherent
program owned by government and supported in parallel by development partners. This
review treats the operation as a SWAP, because individual contributions to the various
components are indistinguishable from one another, and the Bank project contributed to the
entire program.

3.2     This chapter evaluates progress against the two objectives as per PAD results
framework, which are (1) improved quality of public expenditure management; and (2)
improved public service effectiveness. The overarching program objective of “improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery institutions” is discussed at the end of
the chapter.

Improved Quality of Public Expenditure Management
3.3    The overall intervention logic used for assessing improved quality of public
expenditure management is summarized in figure 3.1. Project inputs are reflected in
contributing factors that affect respective stages in the budget cycle. PFM outcomes
considered are fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and operational efficiency,
though these are not directly reflected in the project’s outcome indicators which were
centered on the MTEF.

3.4      An overview of progress in the budget cycle according to PEFA indicators is
provided in table 3.1 and a detailed breakdown in appendix C, which clusters dimensions by
(i) strategic budgeting; (ii) budget preparation; (iii) resource management; (iv) internal
control and management; (v) accounting and reporting; and (vi) external evaluation
(following Andrews 2010). Numerals are used to allow averaging out across dimensions.13
There is some overlap across dimensions, because some dimensions contribute across
clusters. The table shows that progress has been achieved in most dimensions since 2005, but
has become stagnant since 2008. 2012 PEFA data are largely based on 2009-2011 data and
thus don’t fully reflect progress at project closure, which was in 2012. As IFMIS was only
fully implemented at the later stage of the project benefits from the system would not be
adequately captured in the 2012 assessment.




13
  Numerical scores are applied to allow for averaging. The PEFA score “A” is given the highest
value of “4,” and the PEFA score “D” is given the lowest value of “1.”

3.5     Public financial management was perceived as a major bottleneck for the effective
delivery of services. It was also seen as carrying significant fiduciary risks. The 2003 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) (World Bank 2004) noted a
number of major shortcomings, including the strength of existing regulations; compliance
with regulations; poor budgetary allocations, including an insufficient link between policy,
planning, and budget; poor budget execution and reporting; and insufficient internal controls
and audits. This cumulated in poor allocative and operational efficiency, as evidenced by the
PEFA indicators at the time. The dimensions concerning control over spending; control over
taxes, accounting, and reporting; and internal as well as external control procedures were
seen as important shortcomings, with the majority of indicators scoring C or below.

3.6     The intervention logic conceptualized for assessing efficacy stipulates that numerous
inputs (including support to the legislative, human, and organizational capacity and the
IFMIS) contribute to the various stages in the budget cycle, which subsequently impacts
fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and operational efficiency. Progress in the
budget cycle and final outcomes are measured in keeping with project indicators or other
sources, including PEFA indicators. The latter are clustered around the various stages of the
budget cycle, in accordance with Schiavo-Campo and Tommasi (1999) and Andrews (2010),
and are enumerated to allow for averaging across dimensions (summarized in appendix C).
This section first summarizes the World Bank and development partners’ contribution to the
PFM reform program, gives an overview of various outputs that support has contributed to,
and infers potential impact on the more medium/long-term PFM outcomes.

Project Inputs to the PFM Reform Program
3.7   The operation made provisions through 12 interrelated technical sub-components (see
“Design,” chapter 2) intended to strengthen and increase efficiencies in legal, accounting,
and administrative frameworks for public expenditure management, primarily through the
                                                17


rollout of an IFMIS, the development of a macroeconomic budget model, improvement of
budget presentation, a better cash-release system, improvement of the debt management
strategy and systems, strengthening of internal and external audit functions and oversight of
parliamentary committees, and reform of the public procurement system. The details of
project contributions are discussed below. The key message that emerges from the analysis is
that various instruments have been developed but most are not utilized effectively.

Project Contribution
3.8    Legal framework. PFM-related laws and regulations (Public Finance Act 2004,
Public Procurement Act 2008, and National Payment Systems Act 2007, Public Audit Act
1980) were updated in minor ways in 2009. This brought forward the timing of the budget
cycle and made provisions for budgeting and planning legislation. The current Finance Act
does not, however, provide sufficient guidance on planning issues and on integrating
planning and budgeting activities, as the follow-up project (Public Financial Reform Program
[PFMRP] Phase I) acknowledges. The IMF (2015b) notes that “Zambia’s legal framework
for Public Finance Management is fragmented, and much of it is outdated.”14 Because
progress was insufficient, the PFMRP makes a renewed effort at strengthening the legal
framework. In this light, the indicator of “consistent modernized and harmonized legal
framework for public expenditure management” cannot be considered as met.

3.9     Macro management, debt forecasting, and external finance coordination. The
project invested in macroeconomic management, debt modeling, and donor coordination. In
2008 a macroeconomic database and model called ZAMMOD was developed, and has since
been used for analysis of the economy, forecasts for the budget, and scenario-building such
as how to realize growth and exchange rate scenarios given variations in the variables. A
government report (GoZ 2013b) notes that improved data analysis and planning has led to
improved quality of macroeconomic and fiscal frameworks used in the preparation of the
annual budgets and medium-term planning documents (see box 1.1). However, in practice
the growing and unsustainable deficit suggests that the macro model is either ignored or does
not provide a sufficiently robust instrument – evidence, say from the political decision to
rapidly increase wages suggests the former, while the latter may be reflected in inadequate
consideration of declining commodity prices. Progress with regard to debt management and
external finance, however, was less obvious. Engagement in debt management has delivered
few results, and important legislative gaps remain, such as a law on state-owned enterprises;
However, a debt management policy was developed and approved and is used for planning
tools. A database is being maintained for foreign debt and a spreadsheet is used for domestic
debt. (GoZ 2010; AFRODAD 2011; World Bank 2014) Despite this, the country has
exceeded repeatedly deficit targets by large margins, and taken-on commercial debt,
increasing the debt service to pre-HIPC/MDRI levels. With regard to enhanced coordination
of external finance, some tools and processes were set up, but accurate information on total
donor inflows was reported to remain weak. This undermines the comprehensiveness of the
budget and the ability of the government to carry out an adequate stewardship function and
improve its allocative efficiency of expenditures (GoZ 2010). The two indicators of

  The report makes 29 recommendations, which is indicative for slow progress under the project and
for how much remains to be done.
                                                18


development and implementation of a domestic debt management policy and a multi-year
planning framework and macroeconomic model are in place, but not utilized properly. The
intended results can be considered as partially met.

 Box 3.1. The Introduction of a Macroeconomic Database and Forecasting Model
 ZAMMOD provides an example of a macroeconomic database and forecasting model that
 was well delivered. This was due to a department in the MOF that was highly committed
 to develop and deliver the product as well as partake in capacity building for final
 recipients. Further, an international team of experts was recruited to facilitate the collation
 of data, construct the model, and facilitate the relevant coaching and training. The
 recruitment process was led by the MOF and in itself was reported to have produced a
 committed team that was also subsequently actively engaged in the process.

 There was also a great deal of emphasis on inclusion of a wide group of stakeholders, with
 participation of the central statistical office and the Bank of Zambia, as well as staff from
 the MOF.

 The preparation of a student version of the model for a local university has generated
 continued interest and facilitated long term capacity building.
 However, the growing and unsustainable deficit suggests that the macro model is either ignored or
 does not provide a sufficiently robust instrument – evidence, say from the political decision to
 rapidly increase wages suggests the former, while the latter may be reflected in inadequate
 consideration of declining commodity prices.

3.10 Budgeting and planning. The project invested in advanced budgeting and planning
methods. The MTEF is now fully institutionalized and adapted in all ministries, departments,
and parastatals, and the associated indicator is considered as met in terms of process.
However, the effectiveness of the MTEF as a realistic budgeting tool was questioned by
stakeholders, who cited significant variations between budgets, releases, and actuals. This
implies that the MTEF has not resulted in significant improvements in PFM.

3.11 ABB was piloted and implemented in 9 provinces, 20 districts, and 5 large spending
agencies. Without sufficient ex ante internal controls (as is not the case for transactions
utilizing the FMS), improvements in budgeting and planning can, at best, be of limited
benefit, since there would be no mechanism in place to control expenditures by
program/activity and to report on actuals against these programs and activities. The FMS,
which was essentially the system of record in Zambia during 2000–12, only recorded
transactions after they occurred and could not be relied upon as an accurate record of actuals,
and it has no way of doing ex ante budget control.

3.12 Further, ABB as done in Zambia has however led to a proliferation of transactions
that has become unmanageable and a risk to budget management and execution. This is so
because of a breakdown of programs and sub-programs into a very large number of activities
and budgetary controls have been placed at the activity level (rather than sub-program level),
                                                  19


meaning that budgetary allocations and spending have to be made at this level. This is
unmanageable, even with a functioning IFMIS.

3.13 There were a number of related outcome indicators including (i) public expenditure
management framework characterized by full MTEF structure adopted in all ministries,
departments and institutions and major parastatals;(ii) MTEF based on central government-
wide IFMIS; and Iii) Strategic planning, business planning and performance planning,
hierarchy and processes aligned with and linked to the MTEF process. In the light of the
discussion above, these can be considered as partially met.

3.14 FMS and IFMIS. The project supported an advanced IFMIS, to be piloted and
implemented at the central level, and FMS at the district level is considered an interim step
toward the eventual implementation of a fully functioning IFMIS (see chapter 2 under
implementation). Starting off with this interim, basic, custom-developed system seems
practical and reasonable, and follows the example of other Bank public expenditure
management projects, such as those in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. The FMS was
successfully implemented and rolled out in Zambia. The FMS and the commitment control
system, however, are both based on an ex post recording of expenditure transactions after
they have been paid. Under this mode of operation, the system cannot be used to implement
commitment or even basic budget or cash control. A system based on ex post recording of
transactions does not have the capacity to enforce/implement budget, cash, or commitment
control, and its implementation only gives the illusion that such control is being practiced.
The FMS would just be providing information on the budget and commitment ceilings, but
not enforcing them. Thus, while the system has been rolled out, it is of limited benefit.

3.15 The implementation of the IFMIS was intended to be limited to the Central and
Provincial levels of Government. The FMS was supposed to continue to be used at the
district levels even after the IFMIS becomes available. Data from FMS was subsequently
supposed to be uploaded into IFMIS to produce Government wide budget execution reports.
Combining FMS data with IFMIS’ therefore cannot guarantee completeness and jeopardizes
the integrity of the IFMIS data and the accuracy of the resulting combined Budget Execution
Reports.15

3.16 Progress in implementing the IFMIS was substantial, especially after the Bank
intervened in 2010 (see chapter 2, “Implementation” and appendix D for more detail). At
project end, the IFMIS was fully implemented in five key ministries and piloted in two
district agencies. At the time of the mission (June 2015), 43 of 50 MPSAs had been
implemented and all 10 provincial headquarters had been connected to IFMIS for their
expenditure processing. A back-up and disaster recovery site with a duplicate platform has

15
  Other countries with separate systems at district level are making significant inroads at rolling out
the central systems to districts, including Ghana and Malawi. If there is insistence that a simpler
system is needed and only such a system can be implemented, then at least it must be assured that this
system encompasses the core functional processes of budget execution and practices ex-ante control
of transactions. A good example is the use of the Serenic Navigator system used at the district level in
Malawi.
                                                 20


been completed, and is connected and operational at a separate location. MPSAs in Lusaka
have been connected via a WAN. The budget is prepared by the legacy ABB system and is
loaded into the IFMIS at the start of the year by the budget department. All in-year changes
to the budget are entered directly into the system. Cash releases are also recorded by the
MOF in the system. System implementation at the line ministry level covers the complete
P2P cycle (Procure to Purchase) with all stages of the transactions recorded directly in the
system. This includes the request for procurement. The purchase order (LPO) is produced
directly by the system and commits funds at the time it is raised by the system. The goods
received note (GRN) and invoice are recorded on receipt and the payment order is produced
directly by the system against the line ministry bank account at the commercial bank. Some
concerns remain with regards to inadequate MOF engagement, unresolved functionality
issues, and insufficient operational support. Further IFMIS could better be supported through
audit trails of any interventions to over-ride the commitment controls.

3.17 The line ministry departments at the provincial headquarters operate through a central
accounting unit that is connected directly to the system. However, the Ministries of Health,
Education, and Agriculture have their own accounting units at the provincial level, and these
units are not connected, nor are the spending units such as hospitals that are subordinate to
these ministries. These units use the FMS system for recording their transactions on an ex
post basis, as do the offices at the district levels. These are posted back into the IFMIS
periodically.

3.18 The review mission met with the chief accountant of the Ministry of Health and was
informed that all transactions at the HQ of the line ministry are processed through the system,
and no transaction is processed outside the system. The chief accountant was in a position to
produce a report at any point that gave the budgeted amounts, the revised budget, the funds
released, the commitments, and the expenditures to date by line item for cost centers
reporting to her. She showed the mission the report for June 24, 2015, the day of the visit.
The chief accountant informed the mission that such a report was possible for every ministry
where IFMIS has been implemented. A summary report by line ministry was also produced
by the staff of the Office of the Accountant General for three line ministries as a sample to
verify this statement. It is noted from these reports that between 75 and 90 percent of the
expenditure at the line ministries is processed through the system.16

3.19 However, there is a need to complete the coverage to large spending units of key
ministries in Lusaka—such as hospitals—and provincial-level deconcentrated ministry
offices—for education, health, agriculture, home affairs, and community development—and
donor-funded projects and the district-level spending units, even though the expenditure as a
percentage of the total budget for the line ministry is not very high, since this will enable the
active use of the system for the actual management of work programs.

3.20 The 2012 PEFA report for Zambia (GoZ 2012) was done when only 28 MPSAs were
connected. It states that “Expenditure commitment controls (PI-20, dimension (i)) have
strengthened through the advent of IFMIS, which blocks any proposed commitment not

16
  Much of donor financing is still managed outside the system, which BERs partial. This is especially
a problem for the health sectors, which receives support from a multitude of sources.
                                                   21


supported by the approved budget and the quarterly allocation ceilings.” The PEFA report
also states “Under the cash-based commitment control system, arrears to suppliers tend to be
paid off eventually during the year, though this is more the case for those MPSAs on IFMIS”
(GoZ 2012, pp. 73–75) With the extension of the system to the additional MPSAs and all
provinces, this situation will have improved further in terms of the coverage of the control
functionality provided by the IFMIS.

3.21 The two indicators of (1) IFMIS fully implemented in 5 key ministries and piloted in
2 district agencies; and (2) full implementation of FMS with Activity based Budgeting
(ABB) in all districts and 10 spending offices can be considered as fully achieved, though the
continued use of FMS undermines the effectiveness of the IFMIS.

3.22 Internal audit and control. A number of activities were undertaken to strengthen
internal audits, including an institutional and functional review of the Internal Audit
Department, audit committees were established, and training requirements were identified.
Trainings for specialized audits (such as forensic audits, risk-based audits, and performance
audits) were completed. The indicator of internal audit capacity developed can be considered
as achieved. The effectiveness of the internal audit at project-end, however, remained
constrained by limited follow-up by the permanent secretaries (who are designated as
controlling officers of the MPSAs), which is another example of apparent success but with
limited impact on outcomes.

3.23 Procurement. Under the project, standard bidding documents were developed, the
web-presence was strengthened, capacity was built, an office building was constructed, and
procurement entities established a monitoring system. Under the project, the public
procurement act was enacted through a statutory instrument in December 2008, and the
Zambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA) was established. Further, the indicator
“transformation of the ZNTB [Zambia National Tender Board] oversight body for
government procurement” can be considered as met. However, the above have do not appear
to have translated into improved procurement practices. While no data on price differentials
compared to private sector procurement were available (and this was not measured under the
project) informants suggested that there remains a sizable gap.17 Over the project lifecycle,
PEFA indicators deteriorated scoring a D in the 2012 assessment, in part due to insufficient
use of competitive procurement methods (GoZ 2012). Further, civil society raised concerns
regarding the capacity, integrity, and enforcement of regulations in the procurement system.
In the health sector they cite political interference in procurement practices, and a
compromised oversight function of the ZPPA and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG).
In the education sector they point to inadequate procurement record management. (CSPRZ
2012) Such claims were partially confirmed by annual audit reports by the OAG that point to
lack of compliance, and failure to obtain value for money in procurements.18 Speaking at the
state house in 2015, the president pointed to unethical practices such as corruption and

 Another measure is percentage of procurement not tendered competitively, as was used in

bribery in the public procurement system.19 Recognizing major shortcomings20, the follow-up
operation dedicated (again) a component to strengthen procurement systems, which suggests
the target was not met in substance.

3.24 Oversight institutions. Oversight institutions, including the OAG and the legislature
were supported through capacity building. Further, five provincial audit offices were
constructed and staffed with at least one qualified auditor. Audits are routinely conducted and
published on the OAG website. They include annual general audits, parastatal audits, special
audits, and administrative audits. Audits cover about 80 percent of total expenditures, and
follow high risk items as per recommendations from the internal audit office. Nearly all
INTOSAI standards are complied with. Value for money audits are increasingly conducted,
as confirmed by the 2012 PEFA assessment and also evidenced by the annual audit reports
that report on wasteful expenditures and overpayments (see table 3.2). The OAG concludes
that “these issues, among others, arise as a result of the failure to adhere to regulations, poor
financial management and weaknesses in the implementation of internal control systems”
(GOZ 2015, p.iv). Further, recommendations are consolidated and contained in a treasury
minute provided to parliament by the MOF. The legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law
is considered similarly strong. Overall good progress has been made since 2006 and the
indicator of “Development of the capacity of OAG to substantially execute the accountability
role required of Supreme Audit Institution” can be considered as substantially met.

3.25 Further, the timeliness of submission of financial statements to the OAG and then to
Parliament was within what is considered good practice, and the 2012 PEFA scores both
dimensions B for timeliness (see table 3.3 for dates). While the 2012 PEFA raises the

  The appraisal document (p.14) refers to the following issues: (i) records of procurements are not
collated systematically and the ZPPA appears not to have firm assurance that competitive tendering
procedures are always followed; (ii) procurement audits show lack of compliance of procurement
rules and procedures; and (iii) there appears inadequate institutional capacity of ZIPS to regulate the
procurement profession and deliver training. Reference documents for PFMRP Phase I can be

completeness of financial statements as an area of concern, this has improved since the
rollout of the IFMIS.

Outcomes
3.26 Fiscal discipline. The last three years of the project saw aggregate actual expenditure
significantly higher than the approved budget. While revenues were also above target, this is
an indication of poor macro management, budget implementation, and forecasting. The
budget deficit and actual deviation from the planned deficit gives an indication of overall
fiscal discipline. The deficit as a share of GDP has been growing steadily since 2010, and
was persistently (and significantly) higher than the planned deficit. This is a reflection on one
hand of the macro-fiscal environment, but also of the program’s inability to translate outputs
into improved fiscal discipline. Growing debt and a deficit of close to 8 percent have put the
country at considerable distress in recent years also crowding-out much needed pro-poor
expenditures at a time per-capita growth hovers around zero. Figure 4.1 and 4.2 summarize
recent deficit developments.

3.27 Total interest payments on both domestic and external debt at K3.71 billion were
above the target of K3.04 billion by 22.0 percent. This outturn was largely on account of
higher interest payments on Government Securities.

3.28 Strategic allocation of resources. Integrated policy, planning, and budgeting is
fundamentally about having expenditure programs that are driven by policy priorities and
disciplined by budget realities. An indication of whether resources are allocated strategically
is whether budgets according to the annual budget law are reflected in actual outturns. At the
time of the PEFA (2009-2011) the composition variance was considerate ranging from 10
percent to 30 percent. While this evaluation could not replicate this assessment for 2012-
2015, budget execution rates have continued to be poor at the vote level. Table 3.4 lists a
select number of votes sorted by budget performance in 2014. While the total expenditure
performance was moderately below budgeted amounts (92 percent), within vote variation
was quite considerable ranging from the Office of the President (224.8 percent) to the
Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (37.8 percent). Budgets for large ministries have
been relatively protected (for example Education, Health, and Agriculture), which has been
so in part due to their larger share of non-discretionary financing.

3.29 Under the program, considerable investments in policy, planning, and budgeting have
been made, and ABB is widely applied today. However, undermining the entire process is
the continued use of the FMS, which does not have sufficient expenditure control. The
accurate information from IFMIS is being distorted with information from the FMS, making
overall reporting unreliable (see discussion above). If the use of a simpler system at the
district level is needed because of capacity constraints, it is necessary to select a system with
adequate controls. A 2016 IMF technical note makes this especially clear in the opening
remarks, noting that “fiscal rules, medium-term budget plans, and annual budgets are
meaningless if expenditure cannot be controlled during execution” (Pattanayak 2016, p. 1).21

3.30 Another issue is that the budget is not sufficiently comprehensive. In particular, there
are large extra budgetary funds, internally generated funds, and donor funds that do not pass
through regular budget mechanisms, which compromises the governments’ stewardship
function and ability to allocate funds strategically.22 Precise figures were not made available
to the evaluation team.

3.31 Operational efficiency. The major concern regarding operational efficiency pertains
to an ineffective TSA. Comparing Zambia to other countries (figure 4.3), shows that
Zambia’s TSA is considerably less developed than that of comparator countries, which tend
to implement the TSA in parallel with or prior to the IFMIS.

Source: IEG. The TSA index (as developed by IEG) scores countries on a scale from 0-10. Any given country with a TSA
was given a base score of 10, and marks were subsequently deducted if large projects and program advances, extra-
budgetary funds, internally generated funds, and donor funds were banked outside the system.

3.32 Following the decentralization of the banking arrangements without adhering to the
basic prerequisites of Treasury management, there was a proliferation of commercial bank
accounts. In 2015 there were over 10,000 bank accounts in commercial banks, which were
not under the control of the Treasury. Significant idle balances have built up in these
accounts. Donors contributed to the inefficient management of cash when they required
deposit of aid in a commercial bank account. The IMF (2012) has reported significant
balances in these accounts in 2009 and 2010. Short-term domestic borrowing for the
government at the time was around US$2.0 billion, meaning that about 25 percent could have
been cut had balances been swept into a TSA and made available to government for cash
management purposes. The cost of borrowing was about 15 percent, meaning that this came
at a cost to government of about US$300 million for those two years alone.



22
  While donor funds are not part of the TSA, a substantial amount are however channeled through the
IFMIS.
                                              26


3.33 This problem has been recognized, and the follow-up Bank operation now addresses
some of these issues. There is also high-level government support, as evidenced by the 2015
budget speech. A TSA has been piloted in the MOF, and the entire MOF currently routes its
finances through it. While a rollout to line ministries is planned, none has been connected
thus far. And concerns remain about the implementation modality (linking accounts), as
discussed in more detail in chapter 5, under “Risks.” The status of bank accounts by 2015 is
shown in table 3.5. An in-depth discussion of the TSA is provided in appendix D.

3.34 Secondly, there has been a considerable accumulation of arrears, which drive up
average prices of government purchases, are a source for operational inefficiencies, and
generally reflect poor fiscal management. Expenditure payment arrears in Zambia are defined
by convention as payments more than 30 days overdue.

3.35 The stock of expenditure payment arrears as a percentage of actual total expenditures
in 2011 was 4.3 percent (about 1% of GDP). The data show that this represented an increase
in the share over the previous two years. The main reasons for the arrears were under-
budgeting for personnel and utilities; underfunding due to insufficient cash availability
relative to the approved budget; MPSAs entering into expenditure commitments not covered
by approved budgets; and in-year budgetary shortages leading MPSAs to prioritize other
categories of spending over utilities (GoZ 2012). Since then, arrears have continued to be a
problem. The government accumulated domestic arrears equal to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2014
(an increase from about 0.8 percentage point in from 2013), including arrears to the public
pension system, contractors for road projects, and obligations associated with agricultural
subsidies (IMF 2015). Additionally, the depreciating exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar led to
arrears, especially in the health sector where the government was committed to procuring US
dollar denominated drugs.

3.36 A well-functioning procurement system should ensure that money is used effectively
for achieving efficiency in acquiring inputs and value for money in delivery of programs and
services by the government. However, as discussed above and recently confirmed by the
Zambian President, procurement continues to be insufficiently competitive.

3.37 This objective is rated substantial as the project contributed to some important
milestones that lay the foundation for better public expenditure management in the future.
However, this assessment maintains major reservations, as considerable risks remain and
outputs have thus far only translated into better outcomes at the margins.

Improved Public Service Effectiveness
3.38 The intervention logic pertaining to part of the project is that the public service would
have been strengthened through rightsizing the civil service, including offering severance
packages to retrenched public servants; drafting, designing, and implementing a pay policy;
and setting up a payroll management and establishment control system. In parallel with this
operation, a number of development policies supported this function. Relevant policy actions
are outlined in appendix B, table B.2.

3.39 However, clearly improved service delivery has many other dimensions not covered
by the operation, including defining service standards, better prioritization of expenditures
towards the poor, decentralization, reorganization of institutional setups etc. Project activities
therefore would at best have made partial contributions to any improvements in service
delivery. It is beyond the scope of this report to assess whether public services have
improved and by how much, even though reasonable proxies such as poverty rates and
MDGs suggest that achievement levels remain below that of most middle-income countries.

Project Contribution

3.40 Rightsizing the civil service. All government ministries and institutions are expected
to have staffing complements that are appropriate to their agreed mandates and are affordable
in relation to their respective budget ceilings. Organizational structures were developed,
central government ministries and institutions had their strategic plans revised, and
considerable retrenchment packages were paid (830 employees in the water sector, and 400
employees in the road sector). An institutional assessment and organizational development
approach for restructuring the public service was piloted in the Ministries of Education,
Mines, Energy, and Water Development, and Labor and Social Security. Retrenchments had
become unpopular at the time, and this was perceived as dis-incentivizing performance.
During a sensitization meeting, the deputy minister of Labor and Social Security said “I
assure all public workers that this new approach to enhance performance in the public service
does not mean that the infamous retrenchments are back” (UNPAN 2011). Further, under this
component, work was done toward a gender framework and HIV/AIDS strategy for the
public service, which was developed and adopted.

3.41 Payroll management and establishment control. The development and
implementation of PMEC was supported originally by DFID, and later by the Bank. It was
designed to put in place an effective service-wide system to improve and rationalize
administration of the payroll and establishment control. At the start of the government PSM
program, all payrolls managed by the Ministry of Finance and Cabinet Office were migrated
to PMEC, which established a firm foundation on which future payroll and establishment
control interventions could be built.

3.42 The system entails an effective service-wide payroll management and establishment
control system. The system now covers the entire Zambian civil service and produces the
payroll of all government employees (numbering about 179,000), ensuring that they occupy
duly authorized positons and that payments are made to their bank accounts in the
commercial banks. The offices in the provincial headquarters enter the payroll transactions
for staff under their purview, and transactions related to adjoining districts are brought to the
                                                28


provincial HQ for entry. The mission was informed that six districts have also been directly
connected to the system to enable transaction entry. The PSMD staff ensures that payroll
costs are within the authorized budget limits, even though the system has not yet been
integrated with the IFMIS, where these authorizations are maintained. The functionality of
the system is restricted to an establishment register and a payroll module. Other modules of
the Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) software suite have not
been implemented.

3.43 The 2012 PEFA assessment (GoZ 2012) noted that “the payroll control system
appears to be operating reasonably well. A major improvement has been the decentralization
of PMEC, which has significantly shortened the time between changes to personnel
records/personnel data base and changes to the payroll. The payroll audit function has been
strengthened and the chances of “ghost” workers appear to have fallen as a result.” Further,
evidence of functionality of the system is that the speed of transactions (such as staff
introductions, promotions, and separations) has improved from about three months to one
month, the PSMD reported that it has resulted into the reduction of personnel expenditure
arrears (though volume could not be verified by the mission), data integrity benefits from
regular payroll audits (96 percent in 2012), and ghost workers were reported to be less than 1
percent of the workforce. A more detailed discussion on PMEC and integration into the
IFMIS can be found in appendix D.

3.44 Pay policy. With support from the program, a pay policy was designed. This was
approved by the cabinet in 2009, but implementation did not start until 2011 because of
political sensitivities. Underpinning the pay policy were a number of technical papers,
including topics such as attrition, employee perception, and comparative remuneration. An
implementation plan was developed with the help of the project and subsequently updated
and currently being executed. Further, an interim secretariat to implement the pay policy was
appointed, and a job evaluation exercise commissioned and recommendations presented.

Outcomes
3.45 Significant inroads were made with regard to PMEC, and it is consequently plausible
that the civil service is more effective and efficient than it was at project inception in 2006. It
was noted that staff are employed against authorized positions, making it unlikely that the
retrenched positions (severance packages have been paid and staff have retired) would
reenter the system. In that sense, these components were complementary. Physical audits are
reportedly conducted quarterly, though these were not made available to the mission. It
remains unclear to what extent redundant and idle staff remain in the system. It is also
unclear what the ideal civil service size would be, and costing scenarios have not been
undertaken. Remuneration remains based on years of experience and grade, with no
performance elements in place, despite some efforts and the introduction of tools. This
assessment recognizes that this may have been desirable, though it is likely to be more
relevant for the medium-to-long-term reform agenda. Further, performance elements of
senior civil servants are undermined as appointments tend to be politically motivated rather
than merit based.

3.46 In 2013 the government awarded public service workers salary increases that led to
an 18 percent increase in the 2013 budgeted public sector wage bill, and an increase of 46
                                                 29


percent over the actual 2012 wage bill. While this may serve to better attract and retain staff,
it was not consistent with the pay policy, which has at its core principles of an affordable
resource envelope. The increase was, on average, 45 percent, with some civil servants
receiving increases of up to 200 percent. As a result, the estimated wage bill for 2014 was 11
percent of GDP, making up 36 percent of government expenditures and consuming 53
percent of domestically generated revenue. Figure 3.2 compares Zambia to peer countries,
and visualizes the effect of the pay increase above the 2013 MTEF. An attempt to reduce the
fiscal pressures was made, and a temporary wage freeze was instituted from September 2013
for two years.23 Further, fiscal constraints have led to a compression of grades, especially at
the lower end of the pay scale, making it more difficult to implement the recommendations of
a job evaluation and regrading exercise. It is important to note that this is a consequence of a
political decision and does not reflect on the quality of the HR system design, which controls
establishment well. It does however mean that budgetary control (rather than establishment
control) in IFMIS was not facilitated and was only possible because the systems are only
partially integrated. IFMIS facilitates payments, but does not do an automated budget check
for wages.

3.47 While analytical work underpinning the design of the project identified a number of
well-sequenced intervention areas, the project insufficiently prioritized the reform agenda. In
particular, it was noted that short-term measures should include completing the payroll data
cleaning and retrenchment packages to offset the cost of the 2003 salary increases. Medium-
term actions include restructuring and rightsizing the public sector to control the size of the
wage bill, and its structure and composition. This would then need to be complemented by
further decompression and consolidation of allowances and emoluments within the feasible

23
  The wage freeze was de facto for less than two years as wage increases are given in the beginning
of the year and by September civil servants had already received their raise.
                                                   30


budget envelope to attract and keep skilled and qualified personnel. While this seemed
sensible, the project attempted to do all of the above almost simultaneously in too short a
time, which led to some progress in key reform areas, but disappointing results in others.

3.48 Interventions were a logical step removed from the overarching project objective of
‘improved efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery institutions’, and attribution is
limited. This evaluation does not excessively dwell on these issues, but has to make note that
there remain critical shortcomings in the effectiveness of the public service in service
delivery sectors. Leiderer and others (2012) for example assess the health sector noting that
69 percent of health posts are unfilled. In the education sector, Beyani (2013) noted that only
14.5 percent of all government employed teachers had the minimum academic qualifications
required to teach at that level.24

3.49 Significant achievements were made with regards to the implementation and
maintenance of PMEC. On the downside there were mixed results with regards to
retrenchment and performance management, and an unsustainably pay policy was
implemented bypassing necessary budgetary controls. On balance, this objective is rated
modest.

Overarching Objective: To Improve the Efficiency and Effectiveness of
Public Service Delivery Institutions
3.50 In contrast with some countries, relatively high GDP per capita growth (4% or more)
has not resulted in commensurate shared prosperity and delivery of improved services. In
part this is because growth has largely come from enclaved activities without prominent
linkages to the rest of the economy, even though there is contribution through fiscal revenue.
In view of this, sound public expenditure management, and effective government programs
and their delivery are key to poverty alleviation. The project however failed to better link
these upstream reforms to public service delivery institutions and any attribution of the
project to service delivery outcomes is difficult to make (see chapter 2 on design). There was
some evidence of progress in pilots pertaining to the service delivery fund. But these were
isolated efforts, with no provisions for scaling up (see appendix H).

4. Efficiency
4.1     The project contributed to some important positive returns, most notably through
setting up an IFMIS and a functioning HRMIS with adequate establishment controls.
However, there were a number of concerns about the efficient use of project resources:

        Complex donor coordination mechanisms and financing arrangements led to
         disbursement delays, because timely releases were difficult to coordinate across
         multiple donors, which slowed down project implementation and led to frustration in
         implementing agencies.


24
  Other issues such as filling health posts, actual health outcomes, teacher participation and learning
outcomes are not discussed.

        Excessive project complexity led to lack of focus and reform fatigue, meaning that
         more could have been achieved with the resources available. The project included
         subcomponents with questionable relevance to this project. In particular, downstream
         service delivery pilots such as beekeeping and support to mushroom farming may be
         important in their own right, but they are too far removed from upstream PFM reform
         and would have better been handled through other projects.

        Lack of clarity and a plethora of technical working groups, steering committees, and
         secretariats, as well as unclear lines of reporting and responsibilities, contributed to
         inefficient implementation and supervision.25 These arrangements were also partially
         responsible for ineffective management of the IFMIS contractor, which cost the
         government about US$6.0 million. Inadequate handling of the contractor also meant
         that IFMIS implementation progress was suspended, eventually requiring the project
         to extend the closing date by 18 months.

        The IFMIS contractor’s firm was bought out by another firm, requiring that
         government clarify the legal status of the contract before proceeding with
         implementation. It took seven months before the Ministry of Legal Affairs gave
         clearance to proceed, which caused a delay in the schedule. Although this was
         external to the project, it constituted inefficiency in implementation.

        Loss of confidence in the IFMIS management team required that they be replaced,
         necessitating repeat training and delaying implementation.

        An all-encompassing off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning (ERP) package was
         selected and implemented, which was probably not necessary given Zambia’s needs.
         Significant specific subsequent configuration and parametrization was still necessary,
         and this was apparently not fully understood at the outset by the system
         implementers. This meant that time was lost in repeated configuration exercises, also
         leading to additional costs in the form of variation orders to the contract.

        Total IFMIS costs were plotted against number of uses and compared to other
         countries (see appendix D, figure D.1). The total IFMIS acquisition and
         implementation cost for Zambia was approximately US$43 million, including the
         costs of the contract with INDRA and subsequent investments, as well as the costs of
         PMEC, which was a separate implementation done on separate hardware and with a
         separate license for SAP. The cost for each named user in Zambia is estimated at
         about US$18,200, which is markedly higher than that of the average Bank IFMIS
         project (about US$15,000). Further, the cost of the PMEC and that of the total
         systems implementation would likely have been lower if a consolidated systems

25
  This brought out the weaknesses in the donor supervision arrangements. In theory, DFID was the
lead donor for the IFMIS subcomponent, but did not have the necessary capacity on the ground to
carry out the task. The Bank was in a better position to manage this situation, but it was not directly
responsible in view of the MOU.
                                                32


          implementation plan had been adopted, with implementation carried out on the same
          set of hardware and with a jointly negotiated SAP software license agreement.

         The use of undocumented and illegible expenditures constitutes an inefficient use of
          project funds, even if these are reimbursed after project closure, because they were
          not available to the implementing agencies.

4.2       In view of inefficiencies during project implementation, efficiency is rated modest.

5. Outcome Ratings
5.1    Outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory, which is a composite rating reflecting
substantial strategic relevance and modest design, mixed progress in efficacy with major
reservations, and modest efficiency.

5.2      Strategic relevance was rated substantial, but suffered from lack of clarity on the PDO
and excessive ambition. Relevance of design was rated as modest because of the significant
shortcomings in the logical framework. There remains a conceptual gap between project
activities, outputs, and outcomes, and outcome indicators insufficiently inform how upstream
reforms impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery institutions. The
project was overly complex with many subcomponents that were not adequately prioritized.
The inclusion of downstream service delivery pilots, such as beekeeping and supporting a
mushroom farm, is too far downstream to effectively impact on service delivery institutions
and bears insufficient relation to the remainder of the project.

5.3     Efficacy was mixed, reflecting on the one hand significant process outputs being
achieved (IFMIS and PMEC), but on the other failure to translate these into tangible
outcomes, partly because of political considerations, or that various systems were by passed
or not used properly. There was not any plausible contribution by the project to the
overarching program objective of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of service
delivery institutions, which in any event does not appear to have been met.

5.4     Efficiency was rated modest. More could have been achieved given the resources
available. Further, there were a number of operational inefficiencies during project
implementation, including ineffective institutional arrangements, excessive complexity,
inefficient use of project resources, and the choice of an overambitious IFMIS strategy that
was unsuitable for country capacity.

6. Risk to Development Outcome
6.1     There has been an effort to sustain and deepen some of the activities supported under
the project. The follow-up operation (PFMRP Phase I) has dedicated US$30.0 million
through a multi-donor trust fund to continue support in critical areas including budgeting and
planning, implementation of the IFMIS, and procurement reform.

6.2    Payroll and establishment control are now firmly embedded in the system and are
unlikely to be reversed. Retrenchment measures have been taken, though reentry into the
                                                  33


system remains a possibility and is inadequately monitored. Further, the political
appointment (and dismissal) of senior civil servants jeopardizes modest gains made with
regards to performance management. Lastly, risks arise from inadequate coordination
between the cabinet and the MOF. While the macro envelope is provided by the MOF, the
pay reforms and wage negotiations are led by the PSMD. There is scope for better aligning
the negotiations with the budget calendar and improving the coordination between the two
agencies.

6.3     With regards to PFM, a significant risk is that the legal framework is fragmented, and
much of it is outdated, falling short of capturing both recently introduced reforms and
internationally accepted practices. The government has recently proposed a revision of the
existing legal framework including medium term planning and budgeting, a performance-
oriented approach to budget management, comprehensive commitment controls, and the
adoption of international accounting and reporting standards (IMF 2015b).

6.4     Considerable progress has been made regarding the setup and institutionalization of
the IFMIS, and it is unlikely that this would be reversed. Some risks remain that controls are
not sufficiently enforced and informants noted that this problem was particularly endemic in
the roads sector. Further, activity based budgeting has become a risk to budget management
and execution, causing a proliferation of transaction that has becomes unmanageable for the
treasury effectively stifling budget management.

6.5     There remain some gaps with core IFMIS functionality (e.g. bank reconciliation and
interface with revenue and payroll system) and coverage (as extra budgetary funds, and
internally generated funds are largely managed outside the system).26 These undermine the
effectiveness of the system and should be prioritized over currently planned major
investments in technical features, especially since the Zambian system is already amongst the
most advance systems, comparable (in terms of technical features) to Vietnam, Russia, and
Malaysia.

6.6     There remains an issue with mainstreaming the IFMIS project staff into the civil
service. In Zambia, IFMIS staff went into a project where they received greater remuneration
on the one hand, but on the other, were outside the mainstream civil service, thus potentially
forfeiting opportunities for promotion. Mainstreaming the IFMIS project into the
government, and staff into their previous positions, comes at a significant risk of losing
carefully trained staff to the private sector.

6.7     The continued use of the legacy Financial Management System (FMS), which does
have ex ante transaction control (or even basic budget or cash control), undermines budget
management and jeopardizes the integrity of budget execution reports. Donors continue to
push for the continued use of the FMS to support sector specific interventions. This cannot
yield results and instead props up a system that should be abandoned. Further, the set-up of
parallel systems would fragment the current information systems architecture, dilute
capacity, and undermine some of the important achievements made thus far.


26
     Albeit some donor funds are channeled through IFMIS despite not being part of the TSA.
                                                  34


6.8     Risks remain with regard to the TSA. The number of idle balances remained a major
efficiency concern at project end, also limiting the effectiveness of the IFMIS. This has been
acknowledged under the follow-up operation, but with insufficient depth. First, it is
suggested that the IFMIS would strengthen the TSA, rather than the TSA being viewed as a
precondition for an effective IFMIS.27 Second, the implementation strategy is vague. The
PAD (World Bank 2005b, p. 18) notes that “the plan is to expand the centralization of the
government cash balances held in various bank accounts through the creation of a unified
bank account structure of linked accounts.” While linking accounts means that balances
would be known, the central bank will not be able to draw on them for investment (or fund
requests from other spending units), nor do they extend its overdraft limit. Further adherence
to the annual budget law cannot be strictly enforced for these balances under such an
arrangement. An IMF (2011) guidance note on TSA makes this quite clear. For a TSA to
work effectively, accounts should operate on a zero balance basis, and balances need to be
swept into the central bank unconditionally—not periodically on an as-needed basis. The
1998 Ukraine Treasury Systems Project28 may offer some guidance to that end. To maintain
liquidity in commercial banks, the government could specify an amount given out, as was
done for the consolidated fund in the Philippines, which provided full information on cost
and transparency. Some progress was made in consolidating accounts in the Ministry of
Finance, though the majority of accounts across spending agencies remain fragmented.29

6.9    While some of the service delivery pilots were considered interesting and successful,
they have not been funded since, nor have they been sustained or scaled up. The risk that
they would not be sustainable without full government ownership has already materialized.

6.10 Frequent turnover of officials in government was considered a remaining risk to the
reform agenda by interviewees, albeit government has remained committed to IFMIS
implementation despite various down times during project implementation.

6.11      Reflecting the above, risk to development outcome is rated significant.

7. Bank Performance
7.1    Bank performance for quality at entry was rated unsatisfactory and quality of
supervision was rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Overall Bank performance is rated
unsatisfactory in accordance with the harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for ICRs.

Quality at Entry
7.2     This analysis is based on a review of the appraisal documents (PAD, grant
agreements, and decision meeting minutes), as well as stakeholder feedback through
interviews with government officials and Bank staff. It identifies strengths and weaknesses
present at entry. It also considers issues that arose during implementation that can be

associated with gaps in the operation’s design. The main conclusion is that notwithstanding
solid analytical work and an effort to achieve effective donor harmonization and alignment
with the government program, the operation was far too ambitious, insufficiently prioritized,
did not support some of the critical areas, and in some aspects underprepared. Furthermore,
some of the implementation problems stemmed from design choices and key risks not being
mitigated, despite having been identified by various reviewers at the concept stage of the
operation.

7.3      Analytical underpinnings and integration of lessons. A rigorous conceptual
analytical base was provided by the 1998 Fiscal Management Report (World Bank 1998) and
the 2003 PEMFAR (World Bank 2004), which provided an in-depth assessment of the issues
as well as policy recommendations on a broad range of areas subsequently covered by the
project. However, how to sequence (scope and timing) and implement these reforms was
outside the scope of these studies and insufficiently considered during project appraisal. This
is particularly notable in the case of the TSA, where recommendations were vague, and the
FMIS, where the ambitious scope led to the procurement of an excessively complex system
that was unfit for the Zambian environment without adequate module prioritization. Second,
the project design did not adequately draw upon the lessons learned from past experience, in
particular those of the predecessor operation (PSCAP), which were practical and highly
relevant. Lessons from the PSCAP ICR include “project design should be focused and not
overly ambitious”; “an assessment of the implementation capacity of the borrower would
allow for a better design”; and “the design of complex interventions such as IFMIS should
take account of government capacity to conceptualize, design, implement, and manage such
interventions” (World Bank 2005c, p. 15). Further, the operation did not visibly benefit from
the rich Bank experience in implementing IFMIS in other regions30, as is evident from the
overambitious systems design, procurement, and implementation strategy. Similarly, Bank
experience on retrenchment does not appear to have been sufficiently drawn upon.

7.4     Donor coordination and harmonization with the government program. The
operation made a concerted effort to coordinate with other partners in order to reduce
transaction costs and have a more streamlined overall engagement that was closely aligned
with the government reform program. While this was an encouraging effort, the coordination
mechanism turned into overly complicated implementation arrangements, lacking clarity of
roles and responsibilities across partners. Further, a point raised by a peer reviewer during the
decision meeting was that this approach essentially encompassed two SWAPs in one
operation, which would complicate implementation arrangements. Mediation across various
steering committees and technical working groups turned out to be necessary, but difficult.
Further, it was suggested by stakeholders that the breath and complexity of the program was
a reflection of wide-ranging donor priorities rather than a reflection of government ownership
of a multifaceted reform program.

7.5    At the same time, the project was adequately set in an environment of a series of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits, which would in principle leverage a higher-level policy
discussion in both fiscal management and civil service reform. Budget support operations

     An extensive review of the Bank’s portfolio in IFMIS since 1984 is available here.

were highly complementary to the project and contributed to the achievement of the PDOs. A
table of supplementary policy actions is provided in appendix B, table B.2.

7.6     Project too complex, but omitted critical aspect. The design did not sufficiently
recognize the iterative nature of a PFM reform project of this complexity. The project would
have benefited a great deal from including periodic external assessments (as was done in
Cambodia), which would have the potential for steering the project toward what works and
reorient activities based on lessons learned. Further, the project design was excessively
complex, as already discussed under “Relevance of Design,” especially given client capacity.
As noted above, excessive complexity and client capacity were explicit lessons highlighted
from the preceding project (see PSCAP ICR [World Bank 2005c]), but were not taken into
account during design. Further, a peer reviewer during the decision review meeting noted
that “This could be a nightmare to manage for the government and for the donors.” At the
same time, however, the project did not sufficiently recognize the importance of the TSA,
and support for this element was relegated to a U.S. Treasury adviser, even though the
proliferation of bank accounts outside the control of the Treasury was a critical problem. This
aspect should have been a key feature of the reform program, especially as it impacts the
effectiveness of the IFMIS.

7.7    Financing availability and instrument. The overall program resource envelope
(US$100 million) was adequate given scope, and a three-tiered APL was likely to have been
the appropriate choice of instrument. Reflecting on progress from the APL 1, and given that
most reforms in the program were first-generation reforms, the APL, an instrument that
allows a more phased approach, was not utilized to its full potential, instead overburdening
country capacity with excessive complexity. Financing availability exceeded local absorption
capacity, and the five-year implementation horizon was overly ambitious, which is
unfortunate given the lending instrument of choice.

7.8     Institutional arrangements were cumbersome and ineffective because of the
excessive complexity of the operation, which covered too many activities. The institutional
arrangement included a plethora of committees and technical working groups (for example,
the Joint Technical Working Group to discuss technical aspects; the PEMFA Secretariat,
which provided an advisory and coordinating role; the PEMFA Steering Committee, which
was responsible for the implementation of the program; the Public Sector Reform Program
Steering Committee, which provided the overall coordination of PSM; and the PEMFA
Donor Committee, where donors would meet to review progress in overall implementation).
The organogram in the MOU, annex 2 (GoZ 2004, p. 20) visualizes this arrangement.

7.9     M&E. The weaknesses in the results framework have been discussed under
“Relevance of Design and the M&E sections.” Lacking in particular were indicators
pertaining to the PFMRP were absent, placing too much weight on the MTEF, and there was
insufficient attention given to basic performance indicators for Treasury management and
reporting functions, as was highlighted by reviewers during the project decision meeting, but
never accommodated by the project team.

7.10 Decision meeting comments were only partially addressed. Important risks were
highlighted, especially those regarding (i) the need to move toward a more simplified set of
                                                   37


tangible and measurable results (some indicators place undue weight on the MTEF, ignoring
the basic performance indicators for Treasury and reporting functions); (ii) too much of a
focus on the input side, and missing the link to improved service delivery; (iii) complex fund-
pooling arrangements posing implementation risk; (iv) inadequate absorption capacity of the
government; (v) five years was an unrealistic timeframe; and (vi) risks related to rightsizing
the civil service and the need to invest in effective establishment controls both through
Human Resources and the budget system.

7.11 Effectiveness condition. No updated environmental assessment was shared with
IEG, and it remains unclear whether it was conducted. The PAD also states (para 68) that a
social impact assessment would be conducted prior to effectiveness in response to the
retrenchment component, which was also not shared with the team. This was however not
included as a formal effectiveness condition.

7.12 IFMIS design. There were a number of fundamental problems pertaining to the
IFMIS design:

        Prerequisites (including an adequate budget management law, budget classification
         structure, institutional arrangements for banking government funds, and a review of
         functional processes and information flows) were not sufficiently in place prior to
         investing in the IFMIS. Unless these elements are well advanced, the selection,
         procurement, and implementation of the appropriate technology may yield
         unsatisfactory results.

        A “black box” approach to the IFMIS appears to have been adopted in the contractual
         and implementation arrangement, which assumed that if a comprehensive off-the-
         shelf ERP package is selected and implemented in its entirety, this implementation
         would correspond to actual government and user requirements. However, significant
         specific configuration and parametrization was still necessary, and this was
         apparently not fully understood at the outset by the system implementers. This meant
         that time was lost in repeated configuration exercises, which led to additional costs in
         the form of variation orders to the contract.

        The second disadvantage to the black box approach was that it did not prioritize the
         implementation of the modules.31 The simultaneous implementation of all modules
         attempted in this project placed great strains on the capacity available, which delayed
         implementation for several years. Only toward the end, when the project was
         refocused to cater to core functional processes, was some implementation headway
         made.

        The project should not have supported a system (FMS) that is based on ex post
         recording of transactions. When an implementation strategy involves an interim basic
31
  Hashim (2014) notes that, in practice, it is necessary to first get the modules dealing with core
budget execution processes in place, functioning, and stabilized before embarking on the
implementation of non-core modules such as fleet management.
                                             38


       custom system, it is important that it is based on ex ante control of transactions. The
       FMS would be providing information on the budget and commitment ceilings, but not
       enforcing them. The project was designed such that data from the FMS would
       subsequently be uploaded into IFMIS to produce government-wide budget execution
       reports. Combining FMS data (which cannot guarantee completeness or authenticity)
       with IFMIS data (which does have ex ante transaction control) jeopardizes the
       integrity of the IFMIS data and the resulting combined budget execution reports.

7.13 Considering the above, and given that important issues that affected implementation
were identified and conveyed to the appraisal team but ignored, quality at entry is rated
unsatisfactory.

Quality of Supervision
7.14 The ICR presents a candid discussion of supervision, which is in line with the
findings of this evaluation. The implementation arrangements surrounding the SWAP and
pooled-funding approach clouded the actual supervision requirements, resulting in reliance
on agreed review mechanisms within the framework of the original MOU signed in 2004.
These arrangements were a substitute for standard Bank supervision; supervision took place
in the Joint Technical Working Group, various committees, and donor working groups
chaired by the director for PSM, and there were no routine implementation support missions
or aide memoires. Hence, for example, the mid-term review was commissioned by the
government (not the Bank) and discussed at the Joint Technical Working Group, and then
changes were made to the design, and indicators were modified that were never formalized
through a restructuring paper.

7.15 Despite broad recognition that implementation procedures and arrangements were too
complex, the Bank supervision team made insufficient efforts to streamline the support.
Some components were combined after the mid-term review, though the essence of the
activities remained the same. Further, a subcomponent on revenue administration was added
in later years, making project implementation more unwieldly. The PDO was never revised
to adequately reflect project intent (and internal inconsistencies within project documents
noted above), and the project team missed the opportunity to overhaul M&E and the results
framework to better inform progress. Instead, the logical framework remained fragmented
until the end.

7.16 The long gaps between Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs)—for
example, 18 months between the penultimate and final ISRs—undermined their usefulness as
a reporting and project management tool. The realism of some of the ISR ratings was also
called into question by Bank management, but largely ignored.

7.17 The failure of the Bank team to have a sufficient voice in ongoing discussions
between donors and government about the technical content of some subcomponents may
also be attributable to the funding arrangement, whereby the cooperating partners chose leads
for each subcomponent, and the Bank had sole responsibility for the retrenchment component
only, and limited itself to procurement and financial management issues.
                                             39


7.18 Unlike in the predecessor PSCAP, there was continuity in the Bank’s management of
this project. There was only one task team leader for the entirety of project implementation,
which resulted in effective engagement with the client and other cooperating partners. In
addition, from mid-2010, following a locally based financial management specialist joining
the team, the government benefited from technical advice and hand-holding in areas related
to the IFMIS, procurement, and internal audit, with resulting progress in these
subcomponents. The IFMIS subcomponent had been particularly problematic as a result of
overly ambitious design and had been languishing for the first four years of the project’s
implementation. It only started showing results after critical interventions by the Bank,
despite not being the principal donor according to the MOU. This has proven critical in
turning the IFMIS component around, and was to a large extent the reason for today’s
relative success.

7.19 Even though there was some improvement in project performance during the last few
years of implementation, shortcomings in supervision and MTR, reporting, and failure to
restructure the project sooner and more thoroughly lead the Bank’s quality of supervision
being rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

8. Borrower Performance
8.1     Overall borrower performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory, reflecting
unsatisfactory government performance and moderately unsatisfactory performance by the
implementing agency.

Government Performance
8.2     Government ownership and commitment varied across components and project
implementation. Continuous turnover of senior administrative staff in key ministries and
agencies, as well as technical staff in areas such as the IFMIS project, was disruptive. Over
the lifecycle of the project there were six permanent secretaries in the MOF, four
accountants-general, and four project managers overseeing PEMFA implementation. Further,
at one point the entire IFMIS project team was changed, reflecting lack of confidence by
senior management. These frequent changes delayed project implementation, because
management in government had to be continuously briefed, and political support was
unpredictable at times. Despite this, and a turbulent implementation experience in the early
years, overall, the government maintained sufficient commitment to eventually implement
pilots successfully.

8.3     The Government does not appear to have supported the establishment of a treasury
single account, despite it being a critical condition for an effective IFMIS. This was a
political choice, and the various reasons given, such as liquidity concerns could have been
addressed directly as discussed in more detail in chapter 6. As noted elsewhere this increased
the budget deficit and the debt service burden. Further, the sudden and unanticipated decision
to increase wages undermined efforts in civil service effectiveness. In particular, given that
this component was in part justified at project design to offset the 2003 wage bill increase.
This has contributed to an unsustainable macroeconomic situation reflected in a budget
deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP. Lastly, the government made no effort to sustain some of the
                                                   40


pilots that were done under the Service Delivery Improvement Fund, despite preliminary
successful results.

8.4     Also, despite moderate legislative changes the government did not take sufficient
action to reform the underlying legal foundation and major legal provisions relating to
transacting in a computerized environment for IFMIS were missed. Similarly reforms under
the PRSC were delayed or partially implemented,32 which further reflects insufficient
Government commitment.

8.5   Also, despite the required legislative changes identified, the bill was not adequately
amended. Major provisions relating to transacting in a computerized environment for IFMIS
were missed.

8.6    The government made an effort to streamline donor coordination and implementation
arrangements and set up an M&E department reporting directly to the cabinet. While this was
perceived as helpful, the indicators to monitor progress remained unsuitable.

8.7    Government failure to act to address key issues and control of the wage bill results in
an unsatisfactory performance rating.

Implementing Agency Performance
8.8     There were two implementing agencies: the Ministry of Finance in charge of the
PEMFA component, and the Cabinet Office in charge of PSM and retrenchment. Under
these, there were a multitude of offices responsible for various activities of the program.
Under the MOF there was the Controller of Internal Audit, the External Technical
Cooperation Department, the Investment and Debt Department, the Planning Department, the
Financial Management and Accounting Department, and the IFMIS unit. Under the Cabinet
Office, there was the PSMD and the Management Development Division.

8.9    Generally speaking, there were concerns with record keeping, especially when it
came to ineligible expenditures in relation to operational cost such as allowances and per
diems. Oversight of senior management was insufficient, there was a lack of clear lines of
accountability for officers implementing the reforms, and oversight of contract management
was problematic. That being said, there was commitment across the implementing agencies,
such as on IFMIS, which eventually led to successful implementation in certain areas.
Further reporting on progress has been largely adequate, with the data as per results
framework being collected as planned.

8.10 There has been commitment to the reform process despite slow progress at times.
Especially with regard to IFMIS implementation, the MOF has remained committed to
implementing the IFMIS by ensuring organizational and technical readiness, and it took bold
steps, including the complete dismantling and reorganization of the IFMIS unit when there
was no confidence in its implementation capacity. Changes to the team of officers
responsible for the program took place too often, however, and this was disruptive to the

32
     Modest rating for this policy area in ICRR.
                                               41


implementation of the reform agenda. On the downside, the implementing agency did not
establish a clear line of communication among the many stakeholders and partners, which
affected its ability to manage the contractor effectively. This led to various delays (for
example, clarification of the legal status of a revised contract) and inefficiencies, including
honoring of unnecessary costs to the contractor. (Details on efficiency are discussed in more
depth in chapter 4.) Continued commitment to the IFMIS by the Ministry of Finance and
National Planning and various departments was critical for the eventual setup and utilization
of the system. The capacity of the IFMIS team is currently perceived as strong, and receives
important support from a resident adviser. Regarding other PFM activities, commitment has
been modest, especially with regard to implementing new procurement guidelines and
effectively utilizing the procurement authority as an oversight body. Progress with the PFM
legal framework was slow, and the policy brought before the cabinet did not incorporate
some key recommendations.

8.11 Commitment to public service reform was partial. The PSMD showed leadership in
designing and implementing the PMEC, as well as getting the pay policy approved, both of
which required significant government ownership. The pay policy, was approved by the
cabinet in 2009, however implementation was held up until mid-2011 because of its political
sensitivity. Parallel budget support operations had a number of related policy actions to
accelerate the implementation of the pay policy (see appendix B). At the same time, impetus
for progress in performance management has been missing, leading to disappointing results.
Similarly, there was insufficient political will to make inroads in rightsizing of the civil
service, which would have been particularly important given recent increases in the wage
bill.

8.12 Reflecting the above, implementing agency performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

9. Monitoring and Evaluation
9.1     The design of the M&E framework was derived from that of the government
program, which was a justified starting point. The results framework in the PAD, however,
did not include adequate outcome indicators to reflect the objectives – a task made difficult
by a poorly defined objective. Outcome indicators were largely process-oriented and not a
good proxy for the objective. They did not lend themselves to an assessment of broader PFM
outcomes such as fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, operational efficiency, or
effectiveness of oversight institutions. Similarly, public service effectiveness is not well
represented through the outcome measure selected in the results framework, because the ratio
of the total public wage bill to public service head count is not informative on the
effectiveness of the civil service. No attempt has been made to measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of public service delivery institutions, and the indicators chosen do not sufficiently
inform how upstream PFM and civil service interventions and progress facilitate downstream
service delivery – for instance turnover of civil servants and unfilled positions in social
sectors would have been a useful indicator of progress towards objectives.

9.2      Intermediate outcome indicators were insufficient in measuring progress against the
activities, which was partially the result of the complexity and scope of the program. To give
                                                 42


but a few examples, information on supplementary appropriations and the reconciliation of
historical costs and proposed budget estimates would have been helpful to capture progress
on budgetary allocations. The links between policy, planning, and budgeting through PEFA
scores, for example, would provide critical information on allocative efficiency, which has
important repercussions on the ability of a service delivery agency to implement its mandate.
Budget execution could have been measured through cash management indicators and
effectiveness of the internal control environment. An indication of procurement differentials
between the private and public sectors or percentage of procurements not subject to
competitive tender would provide a good indication of operational efficiency. The quality of
oversight institutions could be better reflected through timeliness and quality of financial and
audit reports, evidence of follow-up on recommendations, and the degree of independence of
institutions. Intermediate outcome indicators for civil service management were more
adequate, with indicators regarding payroll, the management of establishment, and
performance management, being particularly relevant. Tracking removal of excess staff from
the payroll is also important, though it would have been helpful to reflect on whether staff
reentered the system after retrenchment.

9.3     Further, indicators were at times not measurable, and inappropriate given the
Zambian context. The ICR (World Bank 2013b, p.12) notes “it is questionable whether the
PDO indicators (for example, ratio of wage bill to the public service headcount) could
actually be measured in the Zambian context, let alone used to measure the outcomes
identified in the PAD.” Indicators suffered at times from imprecision and attribution
problems. This meant that possible slippages in attaining intermediate targets were not
monitored and identified, challenging the attainment of the PDO. Furthermore, the indicators
lacked quantitative baselines, and targets were set only for the first two years. The results
matrix was not formally modified during project restructurings.

9.4     Given the scope of the program, the M&E design would have benefited from
qualitative and quantitative impact assessment such as employing an external advisory panel
(as was done in Cambodia)33 to inform periodically on critical intervention areas. Also
tracking of civil servants and an impact assessment of training would have been beneficial as
was done in Malawi34.

9.5     The M&E framework’s shortcomings were not addressed during implementation. As
many important indicators were not part of the framework, there was limited opportunity for
corrective action by the project team. However, the M&E framework that was in place was
duly monitored, and ISRs reported against all dimensions of the program, albeit at times with
delays.

9.6     The quantitative and qualitative M&E outputs were used by the various committees
and by development partners to assess progress and steer the program. This was done with
regular frequency. A new Monitoring and Evaluation Department was set up, reporting
directly to the cabinet to streamline implementation procedures. Nevertheless, this process

     See Malawi Financial Management, Transparency, and Accountability Project, P078408.
                                               43


was ultimately ineffective as it did not identify the shortcomings in M&E nor steer the
project in a way that would have improved its development impact.

9.7     Given inadequate M&E design, and somewhat passive implementation and utilization
of the framework, M&E is rated modest overall.

10. Lessons
10.1 Good analytical work is an important underpinning for program design, but it is not
sufficient. Program design must be strategic, practical, prioritized, and take into account
ownership, implementation and absorptive capacity of the borrower. The reform agenda was
very relevant in the context of Zambia, but the project failed to achieve its development
objective because of a lack of consideration of the above.

10.2 Excessive project complexity leads to complicated institutional implementation
arrangements, lack of focus, and dilute reform momentum. An approach focusing on a
specific reform agenda may be more effective in channelling the necessary political capital to
accomplish functional change. In Zambia, the IFMIS reform in itself was complex,
politically delicate, and involved a broad set of stakeholders. Focusing on an enabling
environment, IFMIS design, implementation, and appropriate utilization alone may have
been sufficiently ambitious. Even if a complicated design is chosen at entry, it is important
that proactive “pruning” takes place early enough in the implementation process – at the
latest by mid-term review -- by dropping low priority activities where there is limited
traction, and refocusing efforts on top priorities.

10.3 Related to the above, project design with a complex institutional reform agenda
would benefit from explicitly recognizing the iterative nature of the reform process and
making provisions for frequent, in-depth supervision35 to inform periodically on critical
intervention areas that may need to be adjusted and prioritized.

10.4 Donor coordination modalities should be carefully considered prior to project
inception and should be designed to reduce transaction costs to the government and
development partners without making implementation arrangements more complex. Pooling
of donor funds may not be the most effective funding arrangement as inputs are subject to
constraints outside of control of the various partners and pose unnecessary risks. In Zambia
donor coordination was perceived as more taxing than beneficial to the client.

10.5 To ensure effective project management, there must be a rigorous recruitment process
for key positions. Many of the problems that plagued the IFMIS subcomponent, for instance,
were due, in hindsight, to the appointment of a project team that had to be replaced because
of lack of capacity. A reform of the size, scope and complexity of the PEMFA should not be
attempted without commissioning the provision of sufficient internationally experienced



35
  See, for example, the external advisory panel used in the Cambodia Public Financial Management
and Accountability Project, P087945.
                                             44


PFM expertise to advise on the direction of reform and on some of the more complex reform
areas.

10.6 Financing retrenchment of government employees can be deeply unpopular and
carries a significant reputational risk for the Bank. Unless retrenchment reforms are
accompanied with complementary reforms and progress is closely monitored to avoid reentry
of civil servants the intervention is unlikely to be effective. The Bank has a rich history in
retrenchment reforms and design of interventions should carefully draw on previous
experience.

10.7 Merit based recruitment of senior civil servants is a critical aspect to performance
management. Performance contracts are of limited value if senior civil servants are
politically appointed and can be dismissed arbitrarily as was the case in Zambia.

Lessons Pertaining to PFM and IFMIS
10.8 Consolidating fragmented bank accounts takes significant political will and may be
given low priority during a time of economic growth and fiscal expansion. Idle balances are
especially of concern to countries prone to external shocks, as the lack of a treasury single
account means that these funds cannot be drawn on to cushion against unanticipated
financing gaps. Linking accounts (such that balances are known) may be politically more
feasible, but does not address the main problem that these funds are not within the purview of
the treasury. Budget support operations may provide leverage for accelerating the reform.

10.9 Prior to launching IFMIS implementation, prerequisites should be well advanced
(including an adequate budget management law, budget classification structure, institutional
arrangements for banking government funds, and a review of functional processes and
information flows). Unless this is the case, selection, procurement, and implementation of the
System may result in the adoption of the wrong solution or retain obsolete processes, as was
the case in Zambia.

10.10 The selection of a comprehensive, off-the-shelf ERP package is not sufficient for the
implementation of an IFMIS, because it may not correspond to actual government and user
requirements. Significant government-specific configuration and parametrization are usually
necessary, and if this is not understood at the outset, considerable time may be lost in
repeated configuration exercises. This would also lead to additional costs in the form of
variation orders to the contract, as was the case in Zambia.

10.11 Sequencing reforms in the IFMIS is important in order to reap low-hanging fruit and
not overburden client capacity. Core Treasury reform should be prioritized over non-core
modules such as fleet management. At an early stage, even the budget may be uploaded ex
post. In theory, the purchase of an all-encompassing ERP allows the simultaneous
implementation of all modules, although this is rarely feasible, as the Zambia case shows.

10.12 The Bank may consider an approach where it supports training and technical support,
leaving the financing of system implementation to the client. This may bring in realism,
strengthen commitment, and avoid undue engagement in non-core modules. Comparing the
PMEC and IFMIS experience makes for such a case. Government financed essential
                                              45


incremental improvements in PMEC. In contrast, the donor financed IFMIS included many
non-core modules that were not necessary and only diluted implementation capacity.

When an implementation strategy involves an interim basic custom-designed system, it is
important that it is based on ex ante control of transactions. In Zambia the FMS cannot be
used to implement commitment or even basic budget or cash control. A system based on ex
post recording of transactions does not have the capacity to enforce/implement budget, cash,
or commitment control, and its implementation only gives the illusion that such control is
being practiced. The FMS would be providing information on the budget and commitment
ceilings, but not enforcing them. Further, the implementation of the IFMIS was intended to
be restricted to the central and provincial levels of government, and the FMS was supposed
to continue to be used at the district levels, even after the IFMIS became available. Data from
the FMS was supposed to be uploaded into the IFMIS to produce government-wide budget
execution reports. Combining FMS data—which has no controls, and therefore cannot
guarantee completeness or authenticity—with IFMIS data—which does have ex ante
transaction control—jeopardizes the integrity of the IFMIS data and the resulting combined
budget execution reports.

 Pay Reform

1. Substantial progress made in implementing the monetization of benefits available to civil servants.

The cabinet approved the Medium-Term Pay Reform Strategy (MTPRS) in August 2002, which would
decompress pay within an agreed establishment wage bill target. However, this policy was not implemented as
planned. The decompression took place (13:1 from the previous 8:9:1), but the wage bill rose to 8.9 percent of
GDP. The government accepted this overrun and has put in place a number of measures to manage the process.
Among other things, stringent measures have been put in place to manage the restructuring of the separations
program required to bring the wage bill down, and the cabinet approved a new, lower wage bill target of 8.1
percent, which was achieved.
The government is now taking the steps necessary to bring the wage bill down to agreed levels. In the short
term, some of the key steps include:
    i)       Enhancing the link between the payroll and establishment through unique postcodes. This is being
             done through the Interim Establishment Register that has been created under the initial
             implementation of the PMEC. The register is being used to clean the employee database by
             ensuring that only employees in approved positions are migrated to the new PMEC system.
    ii)      Apart from the freeze on any new recruitment, any critical recruitment has to be centrally cleared
             by the Public Service Management Division (PSMD). In this regard, PSMD is only approving
             applications for authority to employ that relate to replacement of deceased employees, those
             dismissed, or those that exit the service, and this is upon confirmation that they have been removed
             from the payroll and that the positions exist in the approved establishment, and if it was budgeted
             for. All applications to fill posts that have been vacant for some time are being rejected.
    iii)     Other measures include the abolition of sitting allowance to officers attending meetings during
             working hours. This is contained in a circular referenced CO.101/25/1, dated 25 June 2004, issued
             by the secretary to the cabinet to all controlling officers.
    iv)      Finalizing the processing and paying of separation packages for already identified excess staff and
             redundant staff and to remove them from the payroll: The government is using funds from both
             the Treasury and under PSCAP to undertake this exercise.
As part of the implementation of the MTPRS, a number of allowances have either been abolished or merged
into the pay, as follows:

Abolished allowances
APPENDIX B                                          54


             i.       Automatic entitlement of directors and other eligible staff to government duty vehicles
                      and running expenses has been withdrawn. Implementation guidelines have been worked
                      out and effected. A monitoring mechanism has been put in place to ensure compliance.
             ii.      The Teachers Special Education Allowance, which contributed up to 30 percent of their
                      total pay, was rescinded completely. Teachers with higher qualifications were put in a
                      higher salary grade.
             iii.     A contributory medical insurance scheme (government, 60 percent: individuals, 40
                      percent) has been worked out and will soon be introduced. For senior staff, this will
                      replace the unlimited medical treatment provided by government free-of-charge to the
                      officer (which sometimes includes evacuation abroad).
             iv.      Other allowances, for example, the Rural Hardship Allowance for employees serving at
                      the provincial and district levels, uniform upkeep, tools allowance, extra duty, and
                      commuted overtime were abolished from 1 April 2003, while others, for example, the
                      Funeral Grant, are to be replaced by a contributory scheme. The Rural Hardship
                      Allowance that was paid to classified daily employees has been merged into the salary.
Allowances merged into pay
             v.       In accordance with PSMD Circular B1 of 2004, from 1 January 2004, in line with the
                      MTPRS, the government merged about 14 allowances payable to police and prisons
                      service personnel into the salary: grade, coxswain, equitation, mental, theatre, fingerprint,
                      protection unit kilometer, body guard, armorer, bandsman, instructor, shift patrol,
                      uniform, and ferrier allowances.
             vi.      As part of the recommendations under the MTPRS, and in line with the MTEF,
                      government will, from 2005, move toward unified salaries. This, however, is subject to
                      negotiations with public service unions.

2. Fixed-term contracts negotiated with all principal secretaries

All principal secretaries are now employed under three-year contracts. Work to develop performance-related
contracts has been completed, and the consultancy report has been reviewed by a committee of principal
secretaries. An implementation plan is currently being prepared for consideration and approval by the secretary
to the cabinet.

3. Salaries of key technical and professional staff increased, as laid out in the MTPRS
The government has continued implementing the measures put in place to manage the wage bill as indicated in
(i) above.
In spite of the challenges encountered with the wage bill, government has made progress, within its capacity,
toward this target since the cabinet approved the MTPRS:
    i.       From 1 April 2003, the salaries of key professional and technical staff were increased by an
             average of almost 100 percent, whereas those of non-key staff were increased by 35 percent.
    ii.      Salary scale decompression started on 1 April 2003, when the ratio of top-to-bottom pay rates
             increased to 13:1 from the previous 8:9:1.
    iii.     In line with the MTPRS, the salary grading structure of the civil service was reduced from 25
             grades to 6 grades, while the number of increments within each grade was increased from 5 to 8;
             protective services salary scales have been introduced for the police, prisons, immigration, and
             fire-fighting personnel, with an effective date of 1 April 2004, as recommended under the MTPRS,
             thus replacing the PF, PS, and PTS salary scales.
    iv.      Government is undertaking periodic payroll-cleansing exercises, and if this results in savings on
             personnel emoluments, government will continue with its efforts to enhance salaries of key
             technical and professional staff.

Establishment and Payroll Control
                                                      55                                        APPENDIX B


4. Effective payroll and establishment control system in place, with no ghost workers, no ghost
allowances, and no retrenched staff returning to the civil service

The implementation of the computer-based PMEC system has reached an advanced stage. The data-cleaning
exercise is now routine, which has helped to ensure a close linkage between the establishment and the payroll.
The following are the notable areas:

    i.        All payrolls, except that of the Ministry of Health, are now on the PMEC.
    ii.       Data cleaning has now become a routine exercise for the end-users trained. The end-users, who
              are charged with the responsibility of managing the payroll areas on the system, are drawn from
              the Human Resources and Accounting cadres.
    iii.      As a contingency measure, a total of 41 support staff drawn from the Human Resources
              Information and Planning and Centralized Computer Services Department have been training to
              ensure that end-users are adequately supported. The cabinet approved the setting up of a separate
              department to run the PMEC system.
    iv.       Sensitization workshops were conducted for all key stakeholders, key among them being principal
              secretaries, chief executive officers, and heads of departments in ministries, institutions, and
              provinces. The workshops are aimed at: (a) disseminating information on the operation of the
              PMEC system; (b) impact analysis of the management of payroll and establishment; and (c)
              management of excess staff that have remained on the old payroll for the areas that are live.
Measure to control illegal employees, allowances, and reentry. In addition to the routine data-cleaning
exercise, the PMEC system has other built-in measures that are aimed at ensuring that ghost workers and illegal
allowances are completely eliminated, and that there is no reentry of retrenched employees on the payroll.
Illegal employees and allowances. The organizational structure and conditions of service (business rules) as
defined in the Establishment Register and Terms and Conditions of Service, respectively, make up the
foundation of the PMEC system. The organizational structure is the control that ensures that only employees
with authorized positions are allowed on the PMEC system. Unlike the old system, which had no link with the
establishment, and therefore could not prevent illegal employees getting on the payroll, the payroll on the PMEC
system is driven by the establishment.
At the same time, the Terms and Conditions of Service are the built-in business rules that ensure that employees
get authorized allowances. The old system had no means of validating allowances, and allowances were given
to employees who did not deserve them. The PMEC system has defined allowances according to positions,
salary scale, qualification, and station as part of the business rules. For example, only employees in stations that
are classified as rural areas are eligible to get rural hardship allowances.
Other controls on the PMEC system are being enforced by the data-driven nature of the SAP system. There is
no more overpayment on such allowances because the period has to be defined, and once the period elapses, the
allowance is automatically dropped. The PMEC system is not paying any abolished allowances such as
equitation, theatre, production boarding master, and the like that were paid on the old system.
Before the 14 payroll areas went live, the PMEC team ensured that only employees on authorized establishment
were migrated to the PMEC system. All the remaining payroll areas that expected to go live before the end of
the year will be subjected to the same process. Similarly, for allowances, the built-in controls (defined business
rules) are applied once the payroll area is migrated to the PMEC system.
It is difficult to come up with the substantial savings on the illegal employees and allowances at this early stage,
considering that only about 4,000 employees are on the PMEC system. However, a more comprehensive and
accurate estimate of savings will be known once all the payroll areas are live. Moreover, benefits are already
being seen, such as terminations that took a long time on the old system are now been done on time by the newly
trained end-users, considering that delays in terminations account for the largest number of illegal employees
on the payroll.

The end-users drawn from the Human Resources and Accounting cadres are now responsible for their payroll
areas, with Human Resources taking a prominent role. They are responsible for ensuring that all employees that
are retired, deceased, resigned, and dismissed are terminated from the system on time. End-users are now aware
APPENDIX B                                          56


that if terminations are not done on time, the system will not allow them to transfer or promote, because the
PMEC system will mark such positions as occupied. In addition, a group of super-users are monitoring end-
users to ensure that they perform their duties diligently and do not abuse the system.
Reentry of retrenched civil servants into the system. The PMEC system will be used to perform some
verification on retrenched employees who decide to return, to ensure that they do not find their way back on the
payroll. The verifications will be performed against termination records on the system. According to the PMEC
system operational requirement, all the termination records will be archived for a period of 10 years.

Financial and Policy Management
5. The MTEF will replace the cash budget as the basis for disbursement in the fiscal year that includes
the final year of the project, Phase I

As reported in the last update, this trigger has been met. The MTEF-based budget for 2004–06 was the first one
to be implemented, and the 2004 budget was the first MTEF-based budget.

    i)       The retooled ABB software has been installed in all ministries and provinces. This enabled
             ministries and provinces to prepare their 2005 budgets from their stations.
    ii)      The detailed review of the MTEF process reported in the last update has facilitated the
             development of the 2005–07 MTEF and the 2005 budget. The Green Paper is currently undergoing
             consultations, and comments from the consultative process are being incorporated in the budget.
    iii)     Sensitization and training programs have commenced for officers at the district level.

6. All proposals with financial implications made to the cabinet over the past year cleared by the MOF
for concurrence with the budget agreed under the MTEF

All cabinet memos have a statement that the MOF has cleared the memo before it is taken to the cabinet. The
linkage between the cabinet and the budgeting process has been strengthened, because the cabinet in general,
and the Estimates Committee in particular, is involved throughout the budgeting process under the MTEF.

Furthermore, strong institutional ties between the Cabinet Office (through the Policy Analysis and Coordination
Division and the Management Development Division) and the MOF have been strengthened, because the MTEF
team spearheading the development of the MTEF includes representatives from the Cabinet Office. Both
institutions are committed to ensuring that future policy and other proposals forwarded to the cabinet are
grounded in the budget and MTEF.

Financial Management and Accountability
7.  The 2001 end-of-year financial statements for the seven ministries piloting the Performance
Improvement Fund ready for review by the auditor general within six months

This trigger has been met. The auditor general report on the audit of government accounts was tabled two days
(29 December 2003) before the deadline (31 December 2003) for the first time.

Appendix C. Progress by PEFA Cluster
This appendix clusters the PEFA indicators by (i) strategic budgeting; (ii) budget preparation;
(iii) resource management; (iv) internal control and management; (v) accounting and
reporting; and (vi) external evaluation following Andrews (2010). Numerals are used to
allow averaging out across dimensions.36 There is some overlap across dimensions, because
some dimensions contribute across clusters.

Appendix D. IFMIS Design, Implementation, and
Utilization
Work on the Zambia IFMIS started under the PSCAP, a 13-year APL launched in 2000,
which closed in June 2005. The PSCAP was intended to put in place critical system-wide
reforms, including the basic financial management, accountability, transparency, personnel,
and other systems, and begin to rationalize staffing, reform pay, introduce more effective
management of payroll and establishment, replace the cash budget, and improving financial
management systems.

Under the Public Sector Management Program Support Project (PSMP-SP), which was the
second phase of the APL and ran from January 2006 to June 2012, the intervention aimed to
develop the government's capacity to manage expenditure on the basis of the MTEF, and roll
out the systems developed and piloted during Phase I throughout government, including the
line ministries, departments, and agencies.

It now continues under the Public Financial Management Reform Program, PFMRP–Phase
1, which is to run from April 2014 to December 2017.

Over this 17-year period, the total investment in IFMIS-related activities under these projects
will be US$37.9 million.37 In addition, DFID is stated to have spent about US$8.0 million on
the design and development of an establishment and payroll management system, and the
government has spent a significant amount of money from its own resources,38 which could
be another US$6.0. Total investment in systems-related work is estimated at around US$50.0
million.

The systems-related activities under these projects were designed to put in place the basic
information systems that would be needed to support the policy, institutional, and procedural
reforms envisaged. They have involved work in three related areas:

      1. Design and implementation of a basic transaction recording system, the FMS, which
         was considered to be an important interim step toward the eventual implementation of
         the full-function IFMIS
      2. Design and implementation of a full-function, integrated, and automated financial
         management system (IFMIS) to ensure efficient and effective use of public resources
      3. The development and implementation of a payroll management and establishment
         control system (PMEC), to improve and rationalize administration of the payroll and
         establishment.

  The exact amount of government-financed investment is not readily available. However, the amount cited is
an amount that was paid by the government to the contractor and not reimbursed from the pooled funds for
reasons discussed later in this paper.

Commitment Control and Financial Management System (FMS)

The FMS is an in-house accounting system that was developed in 2002, and subsequently
rolled out to all the ministries in 2003 under PSCAP. The purpose was to implement more
effective financial management, accounting, and commitment control. PSCAP had also
supported the design and implementation of a commitment control system, which seeks to
control expenditure to the quarterly allocation ceilings as a measure to curb domestic arrears.
The PSMP-SP envisaged an integration of the commitment control system into the FMS and
the rollout of the upgraded system to all central spending agencies and provinces. It was also
envisaged that the FMS Chart of Accounts would be synchronized with that used in the ABB
system, which had also been developed under PSCAP and was used for budget preparation. It
was expected that this would result in a fully automated commitment control system, a retooled
FMS to take into account the ABB budgeting process (World Bank 2005).

The implementation of a basic system such as the FMS was considered to be an important
interim step toward the eventual implementation of the full-function IFMIS, insofar as it
would help identify core information and account processing requirements, and its
implementation would go a long way toward contributing to the development of the
functional specification of the IFMIS modules and preparing staff for the transition to a fully
computerized accounting and reporting environment.

Issues with FMS functionality

The implementation strategy adopted under PSCAP and PEMFA, to start off with an interim,
basic custom-developed system (FMS) until a full-function IFMIS is procured and
implemented (which could take several years) was practical and reasonable. Such a strategy
has also been used elsewhere in Bank-financed public expenditure management projects such
as those in as Russia and Kazakhstan. In these countries, locally developed interim systems
were used to support core budget execution processes until the procurement and
implementation of a full-function system based on Oracle Financials was ready for use.

However, a key difference with the Zambia FMS39 was that the interim systems in these
other countries were based on ex ante control of transactions. All expenditure requests
needed to be entered in the system prior to payment, and would be approved for payment
only after a budget and a funds availability check was done by the system. Ex ante control of
transactions enabled the Treasury and Budget Department to exercise budget and cash
control. If commitment control was also being implemented, then commitments (purchase
order) needed to be recorded in the system and would block funds corresponding to the
purchase order to ensure their availability when an invoice came up for payment, thereby
ensuring that arrears would not be built up. The FMS and the commitment control system,
however, are both based on an ex post recording of expenditure transactions after they have
been paid.



39
  It may be noted that the FMS design approach used in the Zambia project is common to several other projects
in African countries undertaken at this time, including Kenya and Ghana.
APPENDIX D                                    74


Under this mode of operation, the system cannot be used to implement commitment, or even
basic budget or cash control. A system based on ex post recording of transactions does not
have the capacity to enforce/implement budget, cash, or commitment control and its
implementation gives only the illusion that such control is being practiced. The FMS would
just be providing information on the budget and commitment ceilings, but not enforcing
them.

Further, the implementation of the IFMIS was intended to be restricted to the central and
provincial levels of government, and the FMS was supposed to continue to be used at the
district levels, even after the IFMIS became available. Data from the FMS was subsequently
supposed to be uploaded into the IFMIS to produce government-wide budget execution
reports. Combining FMS data—which has no controls and can therefore not guarantee
completeness or authenticity—with IFMIS data—which does have ex ante transaction
control—jeopardizes the integrity of the IFMIS data and the resulting combined budget
execution reports.

Other countries with separate systems at the district level, including Ghana and Malawi, are
making significant inroads in rolling out the central systems to districts. If there is insistence
that a simpler system is needed and only such a system can be implemented, then at least it
must be assured that this system encompasses the core functional processes of budget
execution and practices ex ante control of transactions. A good example is the use of the
Serenic Navigator system used at the district level in Malawi.

Integrated Financial Management Information System

A pilot phase commenced during fiscal year 2003 under PSCAP and envisaged the
implementation of a systemic core IFMIS with procedural, human resource, and legislative
reforms in the areas of planning, budgeting, financial management, accounting, internal
auditing, and financial reporting. It was expected that: (1) the IFMIS would be piloted in five
ministries (and subsequently rolled out to all ministries, provinces, and spending agencies
before being integrated with the systems of other institutions such as local authorities, grant-
aided institutions, and parastatals in the next phase; (2) a government-wide area network
would be implemented; (3) a well-conceptualized, documented, and a comprehensive ICT
strategy would be developed; (4) a trained cadre of information technology and FMS experts
in GoZ government would be put place; (5) the government’s Information Technology Unit
(CSSD) would be restructured and its staff trained to be able to support IFMIS after
implementation. This department would also be expected to coordinate the full rollout of the
IFMIS to other ministries, departments, and spending agencies; and 6) an updated
government financial regulations manual would be developed.

Comments on design
Several policy and institutional prerequisites need to be in place before work can start on the
actual system implementation. These include:
                                            75                                APPENDIX D


      A Budget Management Law that provides the legal basis for financial management and
       provides the basic controls that are to be applied to the use and management of
       government funds
      A budget classification structure and accounts classification that enables consistent
       recording and reporting in accordance with these requirements
      Institutional arrangements for banking government funds and processing expenditure
       and receipt transactions, as laid out in the Budget Management Law.
      A review of the functional processes and information flows and their information
       requirements for specific functions and identifying related issues. This would be
       followed by a redesign of these processes where necessary. The redesigned processes,
       information flows, and information requirements would form the basis for the
       definition of the overall information architecture for financial management and the
       actual design of the information systems modules to support the functional processes
       for a specific function.
It is only after the above requirements have been met or are at least well advanced that the
selection, procurement, and implementation of the appropriate technology should proceed
(see Hashim 2014).

Comparing the Zambia implementation against this list, it is noted that:

      The necessity of revising the Finance Act and associated regulations and manuals was
       recognized. The Finance Act was revised in 2012, but not all of the reforms required to
       implement a good budget execution system based on ex ante control of expenditure
       transactions were included. Nevertheless, a start has been made, although further work
       needs to be done.
      The systems that were envisaged under this component were to use the Chart of
       Accounts and budget classification structure designed and adopted under the
       implementation of the ABB program, which preceded it. The importance of these
       aspects was recognized in the design.
      However, neither the PSCAP nor the PEMNA financial management components
       discussed the issues related to banking arrangements for government funds or had any
       plans to establish a TSA.
      Even though the project documents state that the design of the IFMIS would be based
       on the functional requirements for financial management and would not be information
       technology–driven, there is little evidence that this has indeed been so.

A “black box” approach to the IFMIS appears to have been adopted in the contractual and
implementation arrangement, which assumes that if a comprehensive off-the-shelf ERP
package is selected and implemented in its entirety, this implementation would correspond to
actual government and user requirements. However, this is rarely so, since significant
government-specific configuration and parametrization is necessary, and if this is not
understood at the outset by the system implementers, considerable time is lost in repeated
configuration exercises, which can lead to additional costs in the form of variation orders to
the contract.
APPENDIX D                                   76


The second disadvantage to this implementation approach is that it does not prioritize the
implementation of the modules. In practice, it is always necessary to first get the modules
dealing with core budget execution processes in place, functioning, and stabilized before
embarking on the implementation of non-core modules such as fleet management. The
simultaneous implementation of all modules, as attempted in this project, placed great strains
on the capacity available, which delayed implementation for several years. It was only
toward the end, when the project was refocused to cater to core functional processes first and
was extended by two years that some implementation progress was seen.

Payment and Treasury Management
The policy and institutional infrastructure, which includes government banking arrangements
and the setting up of a TSA, is a prerequisite for the effective functioning of an IFMIS.
Without this, improvements expected from an IFMIS will be restricted to efficient
transaction processing, and it could actually be counterproductive from a fiscal standpoint,
because it could lead to a situation that increases the speed of the fiscal hemorrhage.

At the start of the project, Zambia had a decentralized payment system, with each department
responsible for its own payments. Departments were issued checkbooks by the MOF, and
government bank accounts were controlled by the accountant general. In 1999 the
government had some 204 bank accounts, 99 of which were at the Bank of Zambia. Except
for payments for personal emoluments, line ministries made payments from their
subaccounts at the Bank of Zambia. Funds were disbursed to ministerial subaccounts
("control accounts" 1-99) from the general revenue account (account 99). Ministries held
separate accounts for recurrent and capital expenditures. In addition, subaccounts for donor
projects were kept at the Bank of Zambia. Personal emoluments were paid from a central
account controlled by the MOF (World Bank 1998).

At this time, the lack of information on balances in linked line ministry accounts at the ZRB
and bad cash management caused repeated payment problems, and government checks
bounced regularly. On average, 100 of 3,500 checks bounced every day. Bounced checks
were returned to MOFED rather than the issuing line ministry. As a result, the line ministry
remained unaware of the lack of funds and continued to write uncovered checks. Ministries
also held a variety of accounts at commercial banks. These accounts were used to facilitate
payments in remote areas. They were also used for revenues that line ministries considered
nongovernment revenues (World Bank 1998).

In order to cut down on bounced checks and make the ministries more responsible for their
payments, the government moved to a more decentralized system where the line ministries
could transfer the amounts in their linked accounts at the ZRB to their commercial bank
accounts. The government also decided to decentralize payroll payments for personal
emoluments in order to increase line ministries' responsibilities for their payrolls and provide
incentives to save on personnel by removing ghost workers and no-shows from the payroll.

The World Bank (1998) noted that one of the benefits of decentralized payments would be a
better separation of fiscal and monetary policy, and such a system would shift responsibility
for expenditure control to the line ministries. The report noted that if the decentralization of
                                                      77                        APPENDIX D


payroll accounts proves successful, the government should consider decentralizing all retail
payments.

The Bank report also noted that Zambia's current Treasury management system was not
working well. Expenditure control was centralized by means of the cash budget, but
commitments, payments, and accounting were decentralized to line ministries.

The Bank advised Zambia to move toward a system of Treasury management that matches
responsibility with authority and the capability to perform the function assigned. However,
the Bank report did not point out explicitly that even though several variations are possible to
the basic institutional setting and banking arrangements, it is necessary that they preserve the
basic requirements for control, which are:40

           All government financial resources should be under the control of the Treasury.
           Any commercial bank accounts used for government payments and receipts should be
            zero balance accounts, which should be cleared to the TSA as soon as possible.
           All government receipts should be deposited in an appropriate subaccount of the
            TSA.
           The Treasury should be in a position to determine the magnitude of these resources at
            any given point—that is, the balances in government accounts.
           All expenditures from the TSA or from any zero balance accounts should be subject
            to budgetary controls.

In the absence of these conditions, a decentralized system could lead to a further
deterioration in budget and cash control and cash management across a large number of bank
accounts, and the advantages of decentralizing could be lost due to significant buildup of idle
cash balances in these accounts.

Evidence for this had already started accumulating at the time. The Bank report notes that the
commercial bank accounts could contain substantial amounts of funds, forcing the MOF to
cut cash allocations and issue Treasury bonds. Donors contributed to the inefficient
management of cash when they required deposit of aid in a commercial bank account, since
this cash often remains unused during the year because of lack of counterpart funds. All this
idle cash could be used by the bank to buy T-bills, thereby loaning the government money
back to it at a higher interest rate.

With further decentralization of the banking arrangements in the absence of the basic
prerequisites and an IFMIS that would ensure that payments are in accordance with budget
allocations, the situation deteriorated further. Currently there are over 10,000 Bank accounts
in commercial banks. These accounts are not under the control of the Treasury, and
significant idle balances have built up.

The IMF (Murphy and others 2012) reported that the balances in these accounts in 2009 and
2010 were as shown in table D.1. Thus the average balance was around K 500 billion.
Although the IMF mission was informed by the accountant general that at the end of each

40
     This is outlined in more detail in appendix E.
APPENDIX D                                  78


month, balances typically are cleared to the TSA account within a few days of the end of the
month, the accountant general has no mechanism to monitor whether the commercial banks
are indeed remitting residual government balances back to the TSA within the stipulated time
period.

For comparison purposes it is noted that the short-term domestic borrowing figure for the
government is around US$2.0 billion. This means that this figure could have been cut by 25
percent if these amounts had been swept into a TSA and were available to government for
cash management purposes. The cost of borrowing this amount from the banks at around 15
percent is US$300 million.

Although the proliferation of bank accounts outside Treasury control was a critical problem,
there has not been a discussion of the importance or establishment of a TSA. Some work in
this area was done by the U.S. Treasury, but with little effect in view of the proliferation of
bank accounts and the buildup of idle balances. This aspect should have been a key feature of
the reform program and is a serious omission in the project design.

Sequencing of Reforms
In Zambia, the directions for reform were to implement a decentralized payment system with
less focus on a TSA and a greater focus on the MTEF and more advanced budget
management methodologies such as ABB. In the absence of even a basic budget execution
system, the implementation of advanced budget preparation methodologies such as ABB can
only lead to limited benefits, since there would be no mechanism in place to control
expenditures by programs/activities and to report on actuals against these programs and
activities. The FMS, which essentially has been the system of record in Zambia during 2000–
12, only recorded transactions after they occurred, and it could not be relied upon as an
accurate record of actuals and has no means to do ex ante budget control.

Later developments in early 2011 showed that the TSA idea was central to the reform, and it
was included as an important part of the reform program in a follow-on operation to PEMNA
                                                      79                                       APPENDIX D


that is now under way. With the progress in the implementation of the IFMIS after 2010, an
MTEF and an ABB are likely to translate into more tangible benefits.

Systems Implementation
While discussing systems implementation, it is important to note the implementation and
supervision arrangements that had been put in place under PSCAP and PEMFA. Under these
projects, the Bank and other donors pooled funds to provide support to address the issues
identified. A lead donor was identified for each component of the project based on their
interest and competitive advantage in the activities envisaged under the subcomponent. DFID
was responsible for financing and supervising the implementation of a key payroll and
establishment control system under PSCAP and was the lead donor for the IFMIS
subcomponent under the later PEMFA programs.41

IFMIS implementation started in the early years of PEMFA, and a contract for systems
implementation was awarded to an international firm, Soluziona S.A. of Spain, after an ICB
for an amount of approximately US$23.5 million in November 2006. The contract called for
the implementation of an off-the-shelf package to address financial management and budget
execution issues in Zambia. The firm offered SAP as its application software choice in its
bid.

It was agreed between the MOF and the contractor that the system would be implemented at
eight pilot sites, including the MOF and two provinces. The objective of the pilot was to
confirm the proof of concept. The sites had been selected to represent a complete cross-
section of functional requirements and types of transactions that are generated across
government. The piloting in eight sites was supposed to commence in April 2008.

However, implementation soon ran into trouble, for the following reasons:
         Frequent changes to the team of officers responsible for the program, which also
          indicated a lack of senior management ownership of the IFMIS program.
         The contractor’s firm was bought out by another firm, INDIRA. This required that
          government clarify the legal status of the contract and perform some due diligence
          before proceeding with implementation. It took seven months before the Ministry of
          Legal Affairs gave clearance to proceed, causing a delay in the schedule.
         Loss of confidence in the IFMIS management team required that they be replaced.
In order to address the above concerns, government management, including the secretary to
the Treasury; the secretary to the cabinet; the permanent secretary, planning, MOF; and the
permanent secretary, budget, decided to focus on the challenges facing IFMIS
implementation and initiated a review of the system.

It was decided that the piloting of the IFMIS would be restricted to the MOF, which should
be able to have a technical “go live” date in November 2008. Thereafter, there could be a
more realistic and well-coordinated rollout of the IFMIS. A new IFMIS management team
made up of senior public servants from the Accountant General’s Office was put in place.
41
  It is also noted that under the follow-on project, the Bank has a more direct role in the supervision of the
IFMIS.
APPENDIX D                                  80


The government staff seconded to the IFMIS project was to be reassessed and retained on
merit. A team with legal experts was put in place to carry out a due diligence of the IFMIS
solution-provider and sort out issues related to the contract.

Notwithstanding the above, the implementation arrangements, in which multiple donors were
able to voice requirements and there was no single direct line of communication and control
with the contractor, affected the ability of the government to manage the contractor. This
enabled the contractor to use the situation to his advantage.

The contractor put forward a payment request for extra items amounting to about US$6.0
million, consequent to the changes proposed by government to the schedule and other
factors, including charges for a new set of servers and for delaying the pilot implementation
at all sites. The contractor convinced the government to pay for these and similar items. This
matter came to the attention of the Bank after the fact, when the government asked for a
reimbursement of the amount from the pooled funds. The Bank procurement staff and
advisers found that, according to the contract, these items would not be eligible for payment
and disallowed the reimbursement from the pooled funds; consequently, the government paid
for them from its own resources.

Requests for further additional payments continued from the contractor for items that were
considered by the government to be part of the initial contract, and this essentially caused a
breakdown of relations between the government and the contractor. As a result, the
government was left with one pilot site partially implemented, and the contractor refusing to
do more work without additional payments.

This situation brought out the weaknesses in the donor supervision arrangements for the
component under the project. In theory, DFID was the lead donor for this subcomponent, but
did not have the necessary capacity on the ground to carry out the task. The Bank was in a
better position to manage this situation, but was not directly responsible in view of the MOU
signed by the Bank and the other donors before the start of the project.

However, notwithstanding the MOU, the Bank started taking a more proactive role after the
extra item fiasco, with the realization that without such action, project implementation could
suffer seriously and the project might incur additional financial losses, since the contractor
could take advantage of the situation.

The government requested that the IMF review the pilot implementation and advise on the
future course of action. The IMF adopted a very cautious approach (see Raimonds and
Murphy 2010) and various options for the way forward. The IMF mission in September 2010
noted that the selection of SAP as the platform for implementation may not have been the
most suitable choice for the GoZ, and simpler software, “more contextually appropriate
application software arrangements would have been better.” It also recommended that all
activities related to rollout be stopped until a formal review of the existing pilot was carried
out and project rescoped.

The Bank had fielded a short mission to review the implementation status at about the same
time. The Bank mission noted that at the MOF pilot site, the system that has been made
                                             81                                 APPENDIX D


operational and the transaction-processing layer for budget execution had been implemented.
All departments in the MOF were using the system. Budget preparation was still on ABB.
The Budget Department loaded the approved budget appropriations into the new system and
used it to carry out budget releases. MOF used the system for processing all expenditure
transactions. Procurement requests, purchase orders, GRN, and invoices were processed by
the system, and checks were printed. There was also a working interface with the payroll
system. Altogether, there were about 50 users at the MOF. The mission was informed that the
new system was the only system being used in the MOF for transaction processing related to
expenditures and receipts, and that a parallel second set of books was not maintained on
another system. The Bank mission was of the view that the system, as configured for these
activities, may require some clean-up for more efficient processing, but that this could be
done as part of the pilot evaluation at the end of the pilot phase. The mission was informed
that for the rest of the pilot sites, the H/W infrastructure was ready, end-users had been
trained, and the S/W as configured could be used at these pilot sites, and the part of the
system that is in use at the MOF could start being used at other pilot sites.

In the absence of critical issues with the TP layer, which were not encountered during the
visit, the Bank did not foresee significant risks in the further rollout of the system to the
remaining pilot sites. Instead, the Bank recommended:

   That the government first implement modules to cater to core Treasury processes,
    payments, and receipts transactions across government before going on to other non-core
    elements, such as fixed assets management, human resources management, and budget
    preparation.
   To start with, budget preparation could be done outside the system, and the final approved
    budget could then be loaded in the system and used to control expenditure. However, all
    subsequent in-year budget transactions, such as budget releases, transfers, and the like,
    should then be done in the Treasury system.
   Delay implementation of procurement management, debt management, fixed assets,
    inventory management, and fleet management.
   Implement core interfaces, such as those to ABB, bank reconciliation, and revenue receipts.
   Initially implement an interface to payroll, and eventually integrate it to the IFMIS.
The Bank was of the view that while the government should address the core issues related to
the technology infrastructure to ensure that the system can operate, it need not wait for a fully
functional system at one pilot site that is complete in all its aspects before proceeding further
with the other pilot sites. The Bank’s opinion was based on the fact that the process of pilot
implementation was itself a test, and it is only by using the system in various situations that it
would be possible to unearth its problems and fix them.

The Bank also noted that the government was willing to proceed with rolling out to other
sites on its own with the SAP expertise it had acquired and had appointed a new IFMIS
project manager who had previous experience running a SAP system at the Zambia Revenue
Authority (ZRA). This political support was critical to making progress with the IFMIS, and
a hiatus at this point could lead to a waning of this support.
APPENDIX D                                  82


The Bank team therefore suggested a more aggressive approach to take advantage of the new
government commitment evidenced during the mission and because the team had 10 SAP-
certified specialists who could proceed with the rollout. It recommended that SAP South
Africa be asked to do a quality assurance for the system configuration to address noted
issues. This deployment would only be for pilot test purposes, and issues resulting from it
would serve as a checklist of errors to be corrected as deployment proceeded. Since the
systems architecture chosen was a centralized architecture, these corrections would only need
to be made at the central site, and the corrections would be available across the network. The
Bank therefore suggested that it was not necessary at this stage to suspend the project
pending a detailed, in-depth technical review and rescoping, and that this could be done in
parallel.

The Bank also noted that the software had been acquired by the government through an ICB,
and the process had taken more than a year. Changing the software at this point would be
very wasteful, since the government had already acquired 1,500 licenses for the SAP
software, and the outcome of a new ICB-based procurement process would be unpredictable
and would delay the project a further two years at least.

The Bank also took a more active role in monitoring the process. With a Bank lead financial
management specialist on site in Zambia, the situation improved. The next Bank mission was
able to verify that the team was indeed able to deliver on the promised additional pilot sites.
However, the mission noted that the government IFMIS team required the advice and
guidance of a senior and experienced IFMIS adviser and further strengthening of the team.

By this time, the Bank had, in effect, taken on active supervision of the project and had
started playing a more proactive role. Steady progress continued on this component, with the
28 sites delivered at the close of the project. The quality of supervision and the borrower
performance both improved significantly after 2010, and this improvement continued to the
end of the project.

Parallel to the rollout, reviews of the system configuration were done and issues related to
configurations corrected. Part of this related to the need for the contractor to customize the
original software to expand the SAP domain field to accommodate the largest numbers that
could be expected in the financial reports of the government. The contractor had to customize
the SAP source code to achieve this. Even though the contractor asserted that SAP South
Africa had quality-assured the customization, later developments showed that this
customization had caused serious secondary effects in other parts of the system, and figures
reported from different modules of the system did not match. In 2013 the government
decided to rebase its currency by dropping the last three zeros, and this meant that the normal
field length would suffice. The government hired another firm to do this work, and SAP
South Africa quality assured that the resultant code was bug-free. However, the whole
process of diagnosing and fixing these issues took over two years, and this contributed to
delays and uncertainly in the quality of the implementation.

Overall, the Bank intervention was critical in keeping work on the IFMIS on track.
Continuation of the rollout and embarking on a parallel effort to correct the configuration of
                                           83                                APPENDIX D


and other problems retained momentum, which was critical to advancement of system
implementation. This was confirmed to the present review mission by the government team.

The Bank has now prepared a follow-on operation, which continues support of the IFMIS
implementation and has corrected some of the design deficiencies of the earlier ESCAP and
PEMFA operations. It has included a specific component to address cash management issues
and implement a TSA. A total of 43 out of 50 MPSAs have now been implemented.

System Utilization
The system has been implemented in a centralized architecture, with the central servers
located in Lusaka. A back-up and disaster recovery site with a duplicate platform has been
completed and is connected and operational at a separate location. MPSAs in Lusaka have
been connected through a WAN. Earlier, the provincial headquarters were to be connected
through VSAT. But they are now connected through an optic fiber link, thereby removing
potential problems of latency and delays caused by a satellite-based link. Line ministry
offices at the headquarters and the provincial headquarters use the system to process all
transactions.

The budget is prepared by the legacy ABB system and is loaded into the IFMIS at the start of
the year by the Budget Department. All in-year changes to the budget are made directly in
the system. Cash releases are also recorded in the system by the MOFEP. System
implementation at the line-ministry level covers the complete P2P cycle (Procure to
Purchase), with all stages of the transactions recorded directly in the system. This includes
the request for procurement. The purchase order-LPO is produced directly by the system and
commits funds at the time it is raised by the system. The GRN and invoice are recorded on
receipt, and the payment order is produced directly by the system against the line ministry
bank account at the commercial bank.

The line ministry departments at the provincial headquarters operate through a central
accounting unit that is connected directly to the system. However, the Ministries of Health,
Education, and Agriculture have their own accounting units at the provincial level, and these
units are not connected, nor are the spending units such as hospitals that are subordinate to
these ministries. These units use the FMS system for recording their transactions on an ex
post basis, as do the offices at the district levels. These are posted back into the IFMIS
periodically.

IFMIS has been rolled out to 43 of the 50 MPSAs. In addition, all 10 provincial headquarters
have been connected to the IFMIS for their expenditure processing.

Budget Execution Reports. The review mission met with the chief accountant of the
Ministry of Health and was informed that all transactions at the headquarters of the line
ministry are processed through the system, and no transaction is processed outside the
system. The chief accountant was in a position to produce a report at any point that gave the
budgeted amounts, the revised budget, the funds released, the commitments, and the
expenditures to date by line item for cost centers reporting to her. She showed the mission
the report for June 24, 2015, the day of the visit. The chief accountant informed the mission
that such a report was possible for every ministry where the IFMIS has been implemented. A
APPENDIX D                                    84


more summarized report by line ministry was also produced by the staff of the Office of the
Accountant General for three line ministries as a sample to verify this statement. It is noted
from these reports that between 75 and 90 percent of the expenditure at the line ministries is
processed through the system.

The mission notes that it is important to implement the system and complete the coverage
relating to large spending units of key ministries in Lusaka—for example, hospitals—and
provincial-level deconcentrated ministry offices—Education, Health, Agriculture, Home
Affairs, and Community Development—and donor-funded projects and the district-level
spending units, even though the expenditure as a percentage of the total budget for the line
ministry is not very high, since this will enable the active use of the system for managing
work programs of these line ministries across the country.

This enhancement in coverage is also very important from another point of view. The
mission was informed that other donors who support government’s efforts in the health and
education sectors are eager to proceed with the implementation of separate IFMIS systems to
support their activities in these sectors at the district and provincial levels. This would lead to
the fragmentation of the information systems architecture across the country and undermine
some of what has been achieved thus far.

Furthermore, the mission was informed that the auditor general has already connected
provincial audit offices with the support of the IFMIS team.

Budget Preparation. As mentioned, the ABB legacy system is currently used to prepare the
budget. However, the government has now acquired licenses for the budget preparation
module of the SAP software, and it is envisaged that the budget for 2016 will be prepared in
the SAP system. This will enable better integration between the budget preparation and
execution processes.

Related PEFA observations. The 2012 PEFA report for Zambia was done when only 28
MPSAs were connected. It states that “Expenditure commitment controls (PI-20, dimension
(i)) have strengthened through the advent of IFMIS, which blocks any proposed commitment
not supported by the approved budget and the quarterly allocation ceilings.”

The PEFA report also states “Under the cash-based commitment control system, arrears to
suppliers tend to be paid off eventually during the year, though this is more the case for those
MPSAs on IFMIS.”

With the extension of the system to the additional MPSAs and all provinces, this situation
will have improved further in terms of the coverage of the control functionality provided by
the IFMIS.

TSA and Banking Arrangements

The follow-on Bank operation now addresses the issue of banking arrangements and the
establishment of the TSA, mentioned earlier, which are critical to the effectiveness of an
IFMIS as an instrument of fiscal control. A TSA pilot has been initiated at MOF since
January 2015. The TSA account, a new bank account, has been set up in the Reserve Bank of
                                            85                               APPENDIX D


Zambia (RBZ) as a subaccount of the Control 99 Account/Consolidated Fund Account. The
fund transfer from Control 99 to the TSA account is based on the rolling monthly cash
release of the MOF, determined through the quarterly cash forecasts (profiles) submitted
through the IFMIS. The funds for the recurrent departmental charges are no longer
transferred into the operational bank accounts of the ministry in the commercial bank.

In the pilot, the MOF approves its expenditure payments for the recurrent departmental
charges in the IFMIS and sends the electronic payment instructions to the RBZ through an
interface established between the IFMIS and the banking system. Based on the instructions,
the RBZ transfers funds into the bank account of the respective employee or the vendor
through the RTGS. The recipient gets a confirmation message on their cell phone.

Some quality assurance of the security aspects of the interface with the bank has been carried
out, and the security has been enhanced. SAP South Africa, an RBZ consultant, and the
IFMIS team worked together to set up the recommended tool (MQ Adopter) for this process.
The Bank team is now proposing a third-party assessment of process controls and
information technology security of the IFMIS.

The Treasury plans to roll out the TSA arrangements to the Eastern Province by 1 June 2015
and to complete the TSA rollout by year-end. In addition, a Cash Management Unit has been
set up in the MOF. The Cash Management Unit will be involved in providing guidance to
staff in the ministries on cash forecasting. It is maintaining an inventory of the government
bank accounts and closing down the unnecessary accounts on a regular basis. Following is
the break-up of these bank accounts:

Discussions with the project team for the new operation indicated that there is some concern
in government that since some key commercial banks rely heavily on government funds to
maintain their liquidity and comply with legal requirements, operationalizing zero balance
accounts with these commercial banks outside Lusaka will not be feasible in the short term.
This aspect needs to be monitored closely, as it presents a risk going forward. However, this
situation could be managed by entering into a more transparent arrangement with a set of
commercial banks to operate as fiscal agents of the RBZ with a specified amount of liquidity
maintained in these banks to meet government payments, instead of the opaque arrangement
now in place, where the balances in these accounts are not monitored or controlled, and these
balances build up to levels that have an inordinately high cost to government.

Remaining Work
Some of the key issues pertaining to the IFMIS remain:
      Bank reconciliation: The electronic automatic bank reconciliation process in the
       IFMIS has not been configured yet. The delay in producing a government-wide budget
       execution reports is largely due to the time needed by the MPSAs to manually carry
       out the bank reconciliation. In this process, the RBZ deposits the bank statements in its
       secure portal, accessible to the Treasury staff, who download these bank statements
       and reconcile them with the IFMIS-generated cash book. The Office of the Accountant
       General thereafter compiles the BER for all the ministries. The BER is then sent to the
       information technology team of the Centralized Computer Services Department, tasked
       to post it on the portal. All this takes time. The accountant general plans to improve the
       timeliness by automating the reconciliation process and by setting up a special desk
       tasked with posting the BERs on the portal. This needs to be done with urgency.
      IFMIS interfaces with the revenue system have not yet been developed: The revenue
       information is updated in the IFMIS by the ZRA through a manual process. The
       information on actual revenue collections in the banks is first captured in the ZRA
       system, and reentered in the IFMIS system on a quarterly basis. This is due to the lack
       of interface between the ZRA system and the IFMIS. Such an interface would automate
       the flow of information on a daily basis, and thus reduce duplication of work and update
       general ledger/accounting registers with revenue information on a timely basis to
       support improved cash planning.
      The payroll system, PMEC, is not yet interfaced with the IFMIS to update payroll
       information in the accounting registers in a timely manner.
The government has signed an Enterprise Agreement with SAP South Africa that provides
the government with a source of quality SAP expertise for technical tasks associated with the
system and also rationalizes the licensing arrangements for the software being used for the
IFMIS, PMEC, and ZRA systems under separate licensing arrangements. The work related to
the interfaces is planned to be carried out under this new agreement.

Staffing Issues
It was recognized at the start of the project that inadequate human resource management
arrangements could represent a high risk to implementation and sustainability. The project
envisaged that a trained cadre of information technology and IFMIS experts in government
would be in put place, and the government’s Information Technology Unit (CSSD) would be
restructured and its staff trained to be able to support the IFMIS after implementation. This
department would also be expected to coordinate the full rollout of the IFMIS to other
ministries, departments, and spending agencies.

Notwithstanding the above, staffing has been a constant source of concern in the project. As
noted earlier, the IFMIS team set up at the start was replaced midway in the project by
accountant general staff, complemented by information technology personnel from the
CSSD. Staff has been trained in the use of SAP, but staff numbers remain lower than
required to run a government-wide networked operation. The Bank project team has
struggled to get the government to pay attention to staffing concerns, with mixed results. The
team under the current project has also recommended augmenting the capacity of the CSSD
                                             87                                 APPENDIX D


through additional hiring and training of existing staff. An international IFMIS adviser has
finally been hired and started work in Lusaka effective May 2015.

The current project envisages that the IFMIS team will be mainstreamed now, with the team
moving as a unit to the office of the accountant general and the technical staff moving back
to the CSSD. This has caused some concerns for the staff, since they will be losing some of
their special allowances. Staff discontent represents a high risk to the project and will need to
be managed closely. At this time, technical staffing remains a key vulnerability for the
project.

Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) System

The development and implementation of the PMEC was supported originally by DFID, and
later by the Bank. It was designed to put in place an effective service-wide payroll
management and establishment control system to improve and rationalize administration of
the payroll and establishment.

PMEC was introduced in 2004 and maintains an establishment register where the approved
organizational establishment for included ministries and institutions is recorded. The system
ensures that employees over and outside the establishment in the payrolls cannot be put on
the payroll. The PMEC project included a data-cleaning process, where illegal employees
over and outside the establishment in the payrolls were identified and removed, and a set of
policies and procedures to be used by the end-users was formulated, and end-users and super-
users of the system were trained to operate and use it in their day-to-day work. The PMEC
system had been implemented on a separate instance of SAP, and operated on a separate set
of servers. The system took a considerable amount of time to install, at a cost of about US$8
million.

At the start of the PSM Project, all payrolls managed by the Ministry of Finance and the
Cabinet Office were migrated to the PMEC, which established a firm foundation on which
future payroll and establishment control interventions could be built.

The activities under the PSM subcomponent of the PMEC included training; integrating the
PMEC system with the IFMIS on a common platform; interfacing the PMEC system with
third parties such as commercial banks, DDAC, Public Service Pensions Fund, NAPSA, and
the Department of National Registration; creating the management structure and appointing
qualified staff to administer the system and provide technical support where necessary; and
strengthening of the PMEC Help Desk system so that it adequately and competently supports
users of the system.

PEMEC Implementation
Compared with the IFMIS, PMEC implementation has proceeded comparatively smoothly.
The system has put in place an effective service-wide payroll management and establishment
control system. The system now covers the entire Zambian civil service and produces the
payroll of all government employees (numbering about 179,000), ensuring that they occupy
duly authorized positons and that payments are made to their bank accounts in the
commercial banks. The offices in the provincial headquarters enter the payroll transactions
APPENDIX D                                   88


for staff under their purview, and transactions related to adjoining districts are brought to the
provincial headquarters for entry. The mission was informed that six districts have also been
directly connected to the system to enable transaction entry.

The PSMD staff ensures that payroll costs are within the authorized budget limits, even
though the system has not yet been integrated with the IFMIS, where these authorizations are
maintained.

PMEC is a part of the IFMIS landscape and needs to be integrated into it on a common
platform. This was planned as part of the present project, but it has not happened. At present,
the software versions used for the PMEC and the IFMIS are not the same, with the PMEC
ahead of the IFMIS in currency of the software. Plans are now in place for this integration to
happen, and the SAP expertise available to the government under the recently signed SAP
enterprise agreement should make it possible. The planned interfacing of the PMEC system
with third parties has also not happened. This again is planned to take place under the
Enterprise Agreement. The functionality of the system is restricted to an establishment
register and a payroll module. Other modules of the HRMIS software suite have not been
implemented.

Notwithstanding the above, the focused implementation of the system to address the
establishment and payroll modules instead of a whole raft of ancillary functions at the same
time has enabled this core functionality to be put in place. This has been possible because
government’s commitment to the reform and rightsizing of the civil service was strong, and
these functionalities in the system provided an essential tool for it to proceed on this agenda.
PMEC implementation has ensured that government has a better handle on a significant
chunk of the budget. The secretary, PSDM, stated that payroll costs are currently some 50
percent of the budget and represent about 12.4 percent of the GDP.

The 2012 PEFA (GoZ 2012) notes that “the payroll control system appears to be operating
reasonably well. A major improvement has been the decentralization of PMEC, which has
significantly shortened the time between changes to personnel records/personnel data base
and changes to the payroll. The payroll audit function has strengthened and the chances of
‘ghost’ workers appear to have fallen as a result.”

Implementation Costs

It is useful to compare the costs of the Zambia IFMIS implementation with other Bank-
financed projects that use an off-the-shelf application software package, as Zambia has done.
Implementation costs vary with the scope and scale of the implementation. Nevertheless, it is
possible to get an approximate idea of the costs to be expected for implementing a system
with a given scope from existing data on completed projects by plotting the contracted cost
of actual systems implementation against the number of end-users (used as a proxy for scale
of the system) that are connected to the system. In this exercise, it is necessary to use
comparable numbers. Thus, the cost elements should cover the same elements for all
projects, and if this expense has been incurred in various phases of the project—say, for pilot
implementation and rollout—then these costs should be summed.
                                                   89                                  APPENDIX D


Hashim (2014) gives this data for 10 World Bank–financed IFMIS projects that involve
implementation of a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) package, and the results are shown in
figure D.1, which displays the contracted costs covering the H/W, S/W, implementation
services, WAN/LAN networking, and training plotted against number of COTS user licenses
acquired (used as a proxy for end-users).

It is possible to use this data to predict approximate costs for, say, a 1,000-user COTS
implementation. For example, since the costs are represented by:

Y = 0.0096x + 4.74; if x = 1,000, then y = US$14.34 million (+/-) 20 percent.

Therefore, as a broad parameter, it is safe to assume that implementation costs for a COTS
implementation would be about $15,000 per user.

The diagram also shows the Zambia IFMIS capital costs plotted on this graph. The total
IFMIS implementation costs for Zambia are approximately US$35 million, including the
costs of the contract with INDRA and subsequent investments. The number of named users
on the system according to the project team is currently 2,362.42 This gives a figure of
US$14,817/named user, which is broadly in line with the costs of other Bank-financed
IFMIS implementations.

Here the costs of the PMEC have not been added, since this was a separate implementation
done on separate hardware and with a separate license for SAP. However, if the US$8.0
million incurred for this system is added, the total cost is US$43 million, and the cost per
named user rises to US$18,204.

The cost of the PMEC and that of the total systems implementation would likely have been
lower if a consolidated systems implementation plan had been adopted, with the
implementation carried out on the same set of hardware and with a jointly negotiated SAP
software license agreement.

Appendix E. Information Systems Architecture for Fiscal
Management
Three separate systems have been implemented under the projects discussed here, which
have contributed to setting up these systems for Zambia. These include the central SAP-
based IFMIS to manage budget execution at the central and provincial levels, the custom-
developed FMS that is to be used at the district level, and the PMEC, which is implemented
on a separate instance of SAP and is used to manage the entire civil service establishment
and calculate the payroll for government employees.

The information systems architecture for the Zambia Financial Management System,
outlined below, shows the various systems that have been implemented under the project,
their interfaces with each other, and the banking system and the core information flows.

The figure shows that at the start of the year, the approved budget is loaded into the IFMIS
from the budget preparation system (ABB), and all in-year changes are made directly by the
Budget Department in the IFMIS. For an expenditure transaction, the diagram traces the flow
from the point of its origination at the spending unit to its payment to the payee. For a receipt
transaction, the diagram shows its route from the point it is deposited in a bank by the payer
to the point of its recording in the FMIS. It also shows the interface between the central and
the district-level FMISs and the interface between the PMEC and the IFMIS, which enables
payroll transactions generated from the HRMIS to be routed to the IFMIS for payment.

Appendix F. Arrangements for Banking Government
Funds—the Treasury Single Account and the Zero
Balance Model
Implementation of Treasury systems requires setting up some institutional arrangements to
fulfill the requirements for the custody and use of these funds laid down in the Budget
Management Law. These include arrangements for banking government funds and
processing payment and receipt transactions.

The working of the zero balance model for the TSA is shown in figure F.1 and detailed below.

Figure F.1. TSA Zero Balance Accounts Model




Source: IEG.

TSA–Zero Balance Model: This is an alternative arrangement put in place in cases where
the central bank does not have an adequate network of provincial/regional branches, or does
not have the capacity to handle the large volume of transactions associated with government
payments and receipts. In these cases, the central bank selects one or more commercial banks
to serve as its fiscal agent(s). The fiscal agent(s) makes payments on behalf of the Treasury,
and recoups all payments made from the central bank. Fiscal agents make daily deposits of
all government revenues to the TSA in the central bank. The arrangement has the advantage
of providing more expeditious payments to government creditors in view of the greater
capacity of commercial banks to process these transactions.
                                            95                                APPENDIX F


Two aspects are important for the efficient functioning of this system. First, the float of all
payments to be transferred to the TSA should be as small as possible. Second, these accounts
should be zero balance accounts. Their balances should be cleared to the TSA periodically to
ensure that government has an accurate idea of the total amount of cash available in the
system to optimize its borrowing strategies.

For a system based on the use of commercial banks as fiscal agents to work efficiently, the
fiscal-agent bank branches would need to be automated and connected to their headquarters,
with an automated bank/check clearing system in place. In the absence of such a system, the
time taken to clear all payments and deposit all receipts in the TSA could be longer and could
lead to significant floats before receipts are deposited in the TSA.

Here, spending units can have direct access to zero balance accounts held at a commercial
bank. This arrangement may result in a quicker response time for payment transactions, since
the payment authority resides in the agency itself. However, the bank accounts should
continue to be under the control of the Treasury, even though SUs may have access to them
to make approved payments. This way, Treasury can obtain data on balances in these
accounts and make transfers from or to them independently of the spending agencies.

In this case, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with budget execution limits and
procedures is delegated to the spending agency. For this system to be successful, the MOF
needs to ensure that the agency adheres to necessary controls prior to making a payment.
This can be achieved in two ways:

      Budget control responsibility can be exercised by officers from the Treasury who are
       out-posted to the line agency.
      By connecting the spending units directly to an automated Treasury system used for
       controlling budget execution and for processing payment transactions. Here, the
       system design should incorporate the necessary controls; the location of the payment
       authority is not as important as it would be in a manual system. Prior to allowing a
       payment, the Treasury system software would normally ensure that a budget
       appropriation exists, a warrant allocation (cash) is available, and a prior commitment
       has been made, in cases where commitment accounting has been implemented.
       Manual intervention would normally be required only to override some of these
       restrictions. The system would keep a log of the event, including the date, time,
       amount involved, and the name of the authorizing officer. This would ensure
       adherence to the controls prescribed for budget execution.

The ex-ante adherence to these controls would not automatically be possible in a manual
system. Where spending agency finance personnel are functionally and administratively
responsible to the head of the spending agency, they may be subject to pressures to process
payment transactions that do not comply with specified procedures. It may therefore become
more difficult to ensure that prescribed controls and procedures are adhered to in a
decentralized system, as compared with a Treasury-based central system.

Appendix H. Progress in Pilots Funded by the Service
Delivery Improvement Fund
The aim of the Service Delivery Improvement Fund was to provide resources to potential
transformative initiatives that could positively impact services downstream. Eighteen
individual projects met the criteria and received financial support, including the education,
agriculture and livestock, health, forestry, local government, judiciary, social security
(pension services), and disaster management sectors. Projects included the promotion of
science and technology education through the use of mobile science exhibition units;
establishment of a mobile court system in the Namwala and Itezhi Tezhi Districts;
strengthening community participation in safe motherhood and child health in Mpika
District; decentralized work processes for improved access to pension services; integrating
municipal systems for service delivery in the Mazabuka Municipal Council; and establishing
a decentralized, integrated land administration system in Kitwe.

The justice and health projects in the Itezhi-Tezhi Province were highlighted as particularly
innovative and productive. The introduction of mobile courts led to a reduction of the
pending case load from 400 in 2005 to zero in 2009, and the disposal of new cases in an
average of 10 days, compared with 60 days before the intervention. The project was
recognized in 2009 by the African Association of Public Administration and Management.
With regard to health, there was a reduction in maternal mortality from 179/100,000 live
births (2005) to 69/100,000 (2009). First antenatal attendance rose to 87 percent,
immunization to 74 percent, and supervised deliveries to 85 percent. Improved service
delivery resulting from this project was recognized by the United Nations in 2009.
Improvements from other projects were reported, including an increased number of basic
schools with access to mobile laboratories; a greater number of girls enrolled in science
subjects; increased capacity in milk processing and other milk by-products; improved
production and dissemination of livestock-production extension messages; and an increased
number of community members using modern bee-keeping methods. No rigorous evaluations
(for example, impact evaluations) of these pilots were conducted.

No provision was made for scaling up the successful subprojects, so they remained highly
localized, district-level interventions that had little broader impact on service delivery
improvement. The projects were viewed as an end in themselves, and were thus implemented
as stand-alone efforts by the ministries.
