MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECCTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Somalia -
Bay Region Aericultural Development Project (Credit 972-SO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Somalia - Bay Region Agricultural
Development Project (Credit 972-SO) prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
The project aimed to increase smallholder production. It was an innovative design,
with a first phase of capacity-building followed by a production phase subject to a mid-
term review. At the mid-term review a better understanding of the area's natural resource
and sociological constraints, together with limited success developing agricultural
technology, led to reduction of the project's scope (principally dropping the main
incremental farm production objectives in favor of continued capacity-building, technology
development and preparation of a follow-up phase). Implementation of the revised
project met targets for construction, staffing, training, the organization of agricultural
research and preparation of a second phase. Civil strife then interrupted follow-up plans
and, according to the PCR, may have caused the destruction of much of the project's
investments.
The PCR examines performance against only the modified objectives that emerged
from the mid-term review. In retrospect, this was a risky investment and was designed
accordingly. The risk was worth taking, but events exceeded even the level of risk
foreseen.
The project may be audited to explore natural resource and agricultural
technology issues in semi-arid areas.

BAY REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CR.972-SO)
Preface
1.    This is the Project Completion Report for the Bay Region Agricultural Development Project
in Somalia for which Credit 972-SO in the amount of USS 12.0 million was approved on December
27, 1979. The credit was closed on March 31, 1989, two years behind schedule. US$ 11.91 million
was disbursed. The last disbursement was on December 29, 1989. US$ 0.09 million of the credit
was canceled.
2.    Parts I and III of the report were prepared by the Agriculture and Environment Operations
Division of the Eastern Africa Department, World Bank. A draft was sent to the cofinanciers (ADF,
USAID and IFAD) for comment, but none has been received. A copy could not be sent to the
Borrower for comment due to the security situation in Somalia.
3.    The report is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit Agreement;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

BAY REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 972-SO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    An economic objective of Somalia was self-sufficiency in major food commodities through an
expansion of the area under cultivation and gains in productivity. Development of the Bay Region
was one of the programs to attain this objective. The region contained nearly 60% (320,000 ha) of
Somalia's existing rainfed agriculture, 370,000 ha of cultivable rangeland, and was considered to have
the greatest potential of all regions for a rapid increase in the area of rainfed cultivation and crop
yield. The remainder of the Region (3.3 million ha) was rangeland which supported nearly 900,000
heads, or 9% of the country's livestock. The Bay Region had a long tradition of arable farming and
was one of Somalia's major producers of sorghum and to a lesser extent of cowpeas and mungbeans.
Project Objectives
2.     The project was to lay the groundwork for increasing crop and livestock production in the
Bay Region. Over a period of six years, it was to improve the potable water supply, upgrade the
road network, support the development of a farming system that would preserve the productivity of
the land, train Somalis and help build institutions capable of carrying on agricultural development in
the Bay Region.
3.    The project was conceived as the first phase of a long term development program. It was to
provide the infrastructure, institutional strength and information base, funds and facilities required to
prepare a second phase project that would focus more directly on increasing agricultural production.
Because of the many technical and institutional questions that remained unanswered, the first phase
project was to be implemented in two three-year stages. The first was to concentrate on procuring
project goods, staffing, training, gathering information, extending assistance to farmers, and initiating
an applied research program to find solutions to already identified farming problems. The second
stage was to be triggered by a Mid-term Review (MTR) to assess the status and future direction of the
project.
Project Implementation
4.    Initial implementation was slow due to the complicated financing arrangement involving four
financiers, delays in the recruitment of technical assistance experts and the reluctance of the
government agencies to transfer staff, equipment and facilities to the Project Management Unit
(PMU). The unit was to work closely with the regional offices of the Ministries involved and
coordinate activities with other development activities undertaken by the regional government.
However, this did not work well during implementation. The unit was isolated from the rest of the
regional government and was a drain on Government resources.



- iv -
5.    The MTR was carried out in late 1983. The Government and financiers agreed to proceed
with the second stage but at a reduced scope. While based on the original project objective, the
project was redesigned to concentrate resources on trying to find ways to reduce the risks of rainfed
farming; consolidating the veterinary services; providing reliable water supply; and rebuilding and
maintaining the economically indispensable roads of Bay Region. Two components were dropped: the
Pilot Agriculture Development Units (PADUs) and the associated range management.
6.     Project cost overruns were foreseen during the first project year due to delays in effectiveness
and unexpected domestic inflation. At the MTR, project costs were revised upwards by 14 percent.
The increase was mainly for the water supply component, and the financing gap was to be filled by
USAID.
7.    The Water Supplies program encountered several problems, especially cost overrun. At the
MTR, it was decided that drilling should be confined to the limestone plateau, and if further
exploration drilling was successful, to the limestone depression. Additional financing was provided
by USAID through an extension of the Comprehensive Groundwater Development Project. A total of
116 wells and 38 uars were completed under this component.
8.    Road construction was hampered by periodic fuel shortages. Some of the design criteria,
especially those of the drift crossings were faulty. Nevertheless, the project constructed 332 km of
road and 62 km of track. At completion, the roads were generally in fair condition with the
exception of the drift crossings. Maintenance targets were not reached by a wide margin.
9.    The Veterinar component established 14 veterinary dispensaries, nine drug sales points, and
carried out an average of 292,500 vaccinations annually from 1982 to 1987.
10.   The Building program and Agricultural Research and Training program were completed as
scheduled. The MAU was established but the monitoring and evaluation section never functioned
effectively because of the early resignation of personnel. PMU's role in agricultural extension was
reduced to one of liaison and coordination while the actual extension functions were transferred to
another ongoing IDA-financed project, the Agricultural, Farm Management, Extension and Training
Project (AFMET, Cr.905-SO). This modification was made at the MTR when the lack of
coordination between the two projects was identified as an issue.
11.   The component to strengthen the National Monitoring and Evaluation Facility was
successfully implemented, despite d delayed start in personnel recruitment. Its work program
included an initial inventory of all ongoing agricultural projects, training programs on basic M&E
procedures, improving progress reporting for the Bay Region Project, and data collection on selected
projects for planning, control and program evaluation purposes.
Project Results
12.   The project achieved most of its physical targets as redefined at MTR, and several benefits
had been noted. However, at completion, the project economic rate of return was reestimated at 5
percent, compared with the appraisal estimate of 20 percent. Due to the lack of adequate data at both
appraisal and completion, the estimation of project benefits is subject to a wide margin of error.



v -
Sustainability
13.   Sustainability was not considered an issue at appraisal. Given the lasting civil war in the
country and the massive destruction that has taken place, it is likely that little remains of the project.
Lessons Learned
14.   The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)    Project organization is a major issue in integrated rural development projects. This
project created a separate project unit that drew together staff and resources from the
participating ministries. The PMU took a while to develop into an effective
institution. In the end, one could say that this arrangement enhanced implementation
in the short-term but the impact on institution-building was negative. Its overstaffing
and cost overruns were a drain on the Government and when the project ended, staff
would have difficulty in re-integrating into the regular system;
(b)    There was a lack of coordination with an ongoing IDA-financed project aimed at
strengthening the national agricultural extension organization. Care should be taken,
particularly in the design of integrated regional projects, that they do not conflict with
national systems;
(c)   the Mid-Term Review was an innovative feature (now widely adopted across the
Bank) which resulted in a redesigned project and improved implementation.
However, it failed to tackle the root of the problem, which was the economic
justification for the project;
(d)    given the lack of knowledge about the region at preparation and appraisal, a weakness
the Bank admitted to at ihe outset, project design was overly ambitious and complex.
Attention of supervision staff and the PMU was spread thin over many components
while some essential features, such as monitoring and evaluation and cost recovery
were not given enough attention. These complexities were reinforced by the
involvement of multiple donors, causing delays in project start-up and the loss of
implementation momentum;
(e)    although this was designed as a first phase of a long-term program, greater
consideration could have been given to the question of sustainability. The Staff
Appraisal Report did not discuss this issue since it expected support to continue in a
follow-up project.

PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Qjrect Identity
1.    Project Name:       Bay Region Agricultural Development Project
Credit No:          972-SO
RVP Unit:           Africa, Country Department II
Country:            Somalia
Sector:             Agriculture
B. Background
2.    Somalia was heavily dependent on livestock and farming for its economic development but
with the exception of commercially produced bananas and sugarcane, production tended to be
subsistence oriented. At the time of project formulation, only 0.7 million ha of Somalia's total land
area were cultivated-540,000 ha of this was rainfed and the balance was under controlled or
uncontrolled irrigation. About 195,000 families were engaged in crop production and 90% of the
cultivated area was used to grow sorghum, maize and sesame.
3.    One of Somalia's economic objectives was self-sufficiency in major food commodities through
an expansion of the area under cultivation and gains in productivity. The Government planned to
achieve this objective through increased technical assistance to agriculture, soil conservation, better
water management and irrigation intensification, and progressive transition from nomadism to settled
farming. Irrigation development was intended as a shield against future weather vagaries, while range
conservation and management would protect livestock against prolonged drought and land
degradation. The livestock development strategy emphasized disease control measures, improvement
of the marketing system and improvement of herd productivity through better range and animal
management.
4.    The 4 million ha of land in the Bay Region contained nearly 60% (320,000 ha) of Somalia's
existing rainfed agriculture. It had a further 370,000 ha of cultivable rangeland, and was considered
to have the greatest potential of all regions for a rapid increase in the area of rainfed cultivation and
crop yield. The remainder of the Region (3.3 million ha) was rangeland which supported nearly
900,000 heads, or 9% of the country's livestock. The Bay Region had a long tradition of arable
farming and was one of Somalia's major producers of sorghum and to a lesser extent of cowpeas and
mungbeans. Average rainfall was between 400 and 500 mm. Accordingly, the Bay Region was
identified as a suitable area for investment in rainfed farming and livestock production. Its natural
resources and potential for dryland farming fitted the Government's priorities and provided the best
opportunity for immediate action. Several production constraints in the Region were identified in the
late 1970s. The lack of permanent water for human and animal use during the dry seasons was a
major problem. Due to unsatisfactory road condition, substantial quantities of surplus grain were not
finding their way to the urban centers and were wasted. The practice of shifting cultivation coupled
with a complete dichotomy between crop and animal production needed to be replaced by a more



- 2 -
permanent, sedentary farming system. Finally, the region lacked the qualified manpower needed for
its development.
C. Project Objectives and Description
5.     PrQiect Objectives. The project was to lay the groundwork for increasing crop and livestock
production in the Bay Region by addressing the above deficiencies. Over a period of six years, it was
to improve the potable water supply, upgrade the road network, support the development of a farming
system that would preserve the productivity of the land, train Somalis and help build institutions
capable of carrying on agricultural development in the Bay Region.
6.      Proiect components included:
(1)    Improving the supply of potable water in the Region for human and livestock
consumption.
(2)    Upgrading and maintaining all roads in the Bay Region to give all-season access to
areas where agricultural production was presently or potentially significant.
(3)    Intensification of the Farming System through: (i) introducing simple improved
production practices and initiating a program of adaptive research and field
demonstration trials aimed at crop production, animal husbandry and range
management; (ii) creating four Pilot Agricultural Development Units (PADU) to
integrate crop and livestock activities and test the technical and institutional means of
integrating farm and range activities; (iii) strengthening the veterinary service in the
region; (iv) strengthening the agricultural extension service in the region; (v)
producing quality seeds; (vi) testing means to improve on-farm storage of grains and
fodder; and (vii) supporting the production and diffusion of improved farm tools and
animal drawn implements.
(4)    Strengthening National Monitoring and Evaluation Facility (NMEF).
(5)    Providing technical assistance and training.
D. Project Design and Organization
7.     The project was conceived as the first phase of a long term development program. It was to
provide the infrastructure, institutional strength and information base, funds and facilities required to
prepare a second phase project that would focus more directly on increasing agricultural production.
Because of the many technical and institut.onal questions that remained unanswered, the first phase
project was to be implemented in two three-year stages. The first was to concentrate on procuring
project goods, staffing, training, gathering information, extending assistance to farmers, and initiating
an applied research program to find solutions to already identified farming problems. At the end of
this first stage, the Government of Somalia (GOS) was to carry out a mid-term review (MTR).
Disbursements of credit funds following this review were contingent upon agreement between IDA
and GOS to continue with the implementation of each component as originally defined or as modified
during the MTR. This was an innovative feature which has since become widely used in Bank-
financed projects.



8.    The project was the first integrated agricultural development project in Somalia. At that time
experience with agricultural projects in the country was limited and the appraisal team necessarily had
to make many assumptions as to the desirable project scope, the country's implementation capacity
and the physical and managerial difficulties inherent in executing a complex project. Since the project
involved several ministries, it was decided that a Project Management Unit (PMU) be established at
the regional center of Baidoa to implement the project on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture. It
was to work closely with the regional units of the Ministries involved and coordinate activities with
other development activities undertaken by the regional government. The risk that this would not
work -- due to limited cooperation of the concerned agencies in seconding personnel and resources to
the PMU - was recognized at appraisal. Such difficulties did arise during project implementation,
particularly in the initial stages. Towards the end, the PMU was operating more smoothly but several
issues remained. These included: cost overruns for the PMU because of overstaffing and salary
supplements, the failure to involve local government agencies and communities, and the loss of built
up institutional capacity if the unit were to disband when the project ended. In the short run, such a
unit was beneficial to project implementation but it also had a negative impact on institution-building.
The unit was isolated from the rest of the regional government and was a drain on GOS resources.
Other organizational models had been tried out in rural development projects. In some, the
implementation responsibility was given to local branches of ministries. The result was a lack of
coordination with other ministries which led to confusion and inertia. It appears that in order for
such a structure to work, it is preferable to have a strong decentralized system of government which
empowers local authorities to coordinate and mobilize ministerial staff in the region. This model is
being used in ongoing rural development projects in Kenya. Their outcome remains to be seen.
9.      Another shortcoming in design was the lack of coordination with the Agricultural, Farm
Management, Extension and Training Project (AFMET, Cr. 905-SO), the first agricultural extension
project in the country. Its preparation and appraisal also coincided with the Bay Region project.
However, no clear guidelines were established at appraisal concerning the detailed, day-to-day control
of the agricultural extension service in the Bay Region under the two projects. Such precise definition
and linkage was important since the extension project was expected to take to farmers the findings of
the research station in Bonka, the development of which was part of the Bay Region project. This
problem was identified at the MTR, and the project was redesigned to improve coordination and
linkage with the AFMET project.
E. Proiect Implementation
10.   The project had a difficult start due to the complicated financing arrangement. Four donors
sponsored the project. IDA and IFAD were on a joint basis; the African Development Fund financed
on a parallel basis the road component while USAID covered the costs of the greater part of the well
drilling program, parts of the operation of the research station and the cost of consultants for
agricultural research in Bonka and much of the training. Procurement of goods and services for the
USAID financed portion was tied to U.S. suppliers. GOS was expected to contribute the equivalent
of US$ 5.6 million, or about 12% of total project costs. One of the conditions of effectiveness of the
IDA/IFAD contribution was that all other co-financiers' contribution had to be secured.
Consequently, although the project was appraised in 1978, it did not come into effect until September
12, 1980.
11.   After the project became effective, the initial implementation was slow due to the combined
effects of delays in the recruitment of USAID financed technical assistance experts and the reluctance
of the Water Development Agency (WDA), Ministry of Public Works and National Range Agency, to



- 4 -
transfer Bay Region staff, equipment and facilities to the PMU. Until the end of 1981, the PMU had
not been organized, staffed and equipped.
12.   Mid-Term Review and Project Redesign. The Government and cofinanciers carried out a
mid-term Review in late 1983. The review team found that sufficient efforts had not yet been made
during the last three years to improve agricultural production in the Bay Region over the long term.
The funds spent up till the review, about USS 22 million, had been for equipment (water supply,
roads and the PMU). Implementation of the agricultural improvement schemes was confined to
improvement of veterinary services, which had made modest but satisfactory progress. A natural
resources survey and mapping and a comprehensive socio-economic study carried out in the first stage
also provided new information that made the original project assumptions on agricultural production
questionable (see para. 14).
13.   Despite the shortcomings, it was agreed that the project had indeed filled a void caused by
insufficient infrastructure and less than adequate production support services in the region. The
Government and cofinanciers agreed to proceed with the second stage but at a reduced scope. While
based on the original project objectives, the project was redesigned to concentrate resources on:
(a)   trying to find ways to reduce the risks of rainfed crop farming in the region by means
of operationally oriented agricultural research and trials;
(b)    consolidating the veterinary services;
(c)    providing reliable water supply where the population density was greatest and most
vulnerable to frequent droughts; and
(d)    rebuilding and maintaining the economically indispensable roads of Bay Region
without adding significantly to the existing road network.
14.   Two components were dropped: the PADUs and the associated range managemert. The
absence of large tracts of land (indicated in the survey findings), plus the difficulties inherent in
changing local grazing methods and customs, precluded the allocation of a sizeable range area to any
one group of farmers to establish four PADUs in which to test integrated range and crop production
management trials. PMU's role in agricultural extension was also reduced, leaving most of the
functions to AFMET.
15.   Progress of Each Component. The water suplies program encountered problems due to the
late arrival of equipment and the absence of identified aquifers and the high incidence of boreholes
that were unproductive or had poor quality water. The cost per well was also much higher than
expected. At the mid-term review, it was decided that drilling should be confined to the limestone
plateau, and if further exploratory drilling was successful, to the limestone depression. Additional
financing was provided by USAID under the Comprehensive Groundwater Development Project. The
unit cost was to be reduced by using light weight equipment. At the end of 1987, a total of 116 wells
were drilled. The idea of providing windmill pumps proved unsuccessful: based on experience
elsewhere in Somalia and in other developing countries, it was likely that the problems with windmills
would continue unless an entirely new approach was taken towards their maintenance and operation.
Uars 1/ were to be an alternative source of water, either where groundwater was not available, or
where a uar would provide a cheaper and/or more reliable supply. A total of 38 uars were built and
some of them were equipped with hand pumps.
1/ Excavated depressions used to store surface water run-off.



16.   BQ; construction encountered several problems. Progress was hampered by periodic fuel
shortages. Some of the design criteria, especially those of the drift crossings were faulty. In fact,
given the relatively flat topography of the project area, it was open to question whether the best way
of taking rainwater across the road was indeed by drifts and not by some other means. Nevertheless,
the project constructed an extensive road and motor track network. A total of 332 km of roads and
about 62 km of tracks were built against a revised target of about 300 km of roads and 160 km of
tracks for the entire project period. Road maintenance, however, was not implemented as well. At
completion, the roads built by the project were generally in fair condition with the exception of the
drift crossings, but maintenance targets were not reached by a wide margin. For instance, the 1987
achievement was only 102 km while until the middle of 1988 maintenance was carried out only on 26
km. The target at appraisal was to have about 560 km. of gravel roads under regular mnaintenance by
the end of the project. This was revised to 345 km at the mid-term review.
17.   The Building program was completed as scheduled. The only snag was that in designing the
foundation of the office block on the Bonka Research Station and in one of the veterinary clinics,
insufficient allowance was made by the consultants for the demands of foundations on shrinking clay.
This was remedied at the consultants' expense. At completion the program constructed the following:
project headquarters and staff housing (23 houses and two office blocks in Baidoa and six houses in
Mogadishu for the NMEF); facilities for the research station in Bonka and for the seed farm; 14
veterinary dispensaries, workshops, and garages for equipment.
i8.   After initial difficulties, the PMU was organized and functioned as planned, with a few
notable exceptions: (i) the monitoring and evaluation section was not really established because of the
early resignation and departure of the personnel; (ii) agricultural extension became the function of
AFMET upon its establishment and only a liaison and coordinating role was retained for the PMU.
The PMU was divided between Mogadishu, where it was necessary to maintain a liaison office for
administrative purposes, and Baidoa, where project activities were controlled and supervised. Despite
salary supplements, the project had problems retaining staff because of difficult conditions in the
project area.
19.   The progress of the Veterinary Component was good. The program established 14 veterinary
dispensaries, established nine veterinary drug sales points and took over the administration of
marketing facilities in two centers. Three vaccination teams carried out the following number of
average annual vaccinations from 1982 to 1987:
Rinderpest           80,000       Blackquarter                 120,000
Anthrax             21,000         Haemorrhagic Septicaemia    12,000
Contagious Bovine                  Lumpy skin disease          55,000

Annually an average of about 80,000 cattle, 131,000 camels and 95,000 sheep and goats were treated
against trypanosomiasis, endo- and ecto-parasites and other diseases.
20.   However, there were several issues concerning the effectiveness and sustainability of this
component. First, the 'cold-chain' facilities, which ensured that vaccines were stored at the proper
temperature until used, did not function perfectly. This cast some doubts on the effectiveness of some
of the vaccinations. Another question was whether the extent of the vaccinations was sufficient to



- 6 -
ensure protection of the entire population. Furthermore, as the diagnostic laboratory had been cut out
of the project at the MTR, the staff in the field were able only to respond to, rather than anticipate,
disease outbreaks. Finally, in determining the benefits and sustainability of the treatments, the
question must be asked about the training and competence of the lower-grade staff. There appeared
to be at least the possibility that it was the owners who approached them, with their own diagnosis of
the nature of the disease, rather than the staff determining, by examination, what the problems were.
The complementary activities to promote improved livestock production were not developed.
21.    Agricultural Research and Training. An overseas university fielded a research team to pursue
an adaptive research program and to train their Somali counterparts. The disciplines provided were:
(i) plant breeding, with particular attention to sorghum, mungbeans and cowpeas; (ii) agronomic
investigation into the feasibility of alternative crops; (iii) soil fertility; (iv) pest control; (v) farming
systems studies. The university also provided an Operations Manager for the research station and the
seed farm, and a Research Adviser. Under IDA financing the team was from time to time augmented
by expertise to investigate animal traction, water conservation and retention studies, and a soil
scientist.
22.    The Bonka Research Station undertook a broad range of research trials aimed at understanding
the principal constraints to crop production in the Region. In a detailed farmers survey undertaken in
the 1987 Gu season, farmers identified sorghum stalkborer and ticks as the major constraints to
increased crop and livestock production. Research priorities were also given to improving the level
of soil moisture and fertility and overcoming labor constraints in weeding.
23.   The results of crop trials were mixed. The efforts on sorghum development were
unsuccessful. At appraisal the expectation was that a sorghum variety which would out yield the local
variety and also assure greater safety in adverse years would be quickly identified. However, after
much time and effort, it was determined that the local variety was very homogenous and therefore
selection was unlikely to yield results. The conclusion was that any varietal improvement would
necessarily come only after long-term efforts of introducing other desirable traits into the local
germplasm, without losing any of the existing ones. Attempts to introduce improved pulses varieties
were successful. A new mungbean introduced from Taiwan was reported to be increasingly accepted
by growers, although, as shown by the consultant's survey, mungbeans did not yet appear to be
extensively traded. Similar achievements were expected with cowpeas. Adaptive research on other
crops did not yield very positive conclusions.
24.    Regarding soil fertility, there was conclusive evidence that the application of triple
superphosphate (TSP) gives considerable yield increases of all crops. The effects of TSP were for the
first time extensively demonstrated to farmers in the Gu of 1988. Its widespread application would
depend on availability, the creation of an effective distribution organization and on the effectiveness of
agricultural extension. The effects of pest control were demonstrated and progress was made on
controlling storage pests, which was a significant step in the preservation and improved marketability
of grains.
25.    At completion, most of the training programs planned for research workers were completed
and all trainees were due to resume their posts. Further expatriate technical assistance that would be
desirable for the formulation of research program in some fields and also their effective management
was to be provided under the second AFMET project (Cr. 1794-SO). The designers of that project
foresaw the need for external research support for the Bonka station after the termination of the



contract with USAID and appropriate provisions were made to bridge the gap. The AFMET n
project included financing for consultants until October 1992.
26.   The MAE unit was established in 1983 but never functioned effectively because of the early
resignation of the personnel, who were not satisfied with the working conditions and career prospects
that the project offered. This failure to assemble key production indicators made project impact and
economic reevaluation difficult.
27.   The component to strengthen the National Monitoring and Evaluation Facility was
successfully implemented, despite a delayed start in personnel recruitment. It was headed by a Somali
team leader, supported by four expatriate M&E specialists and other local staff. They occupied new
offices built under the project. Its work program included an initial inventory of all ongoing
agricultural projects, training programs on basic M&E procedures, improving progress reporting for
the Bay Region Project, and data collection on selected projects for planning, control and program
evaluation purposes.
28.   Project Costs. Cost overruns were foreseen during the first project year due to delays in
effectiveness and higher than expected domestic inflation of 80 percent that year. At the MTR,
project costs were revised upwards by 14 percent. The increase was mainly for the water supply
component, and the financing gap was to be filled by USAID through an extension of its
Comprehensive Groundwater Development Project. However, due to the civil war in the country,
actual costs could not be obtained.
F. ProiecLReslti
29.   The project achieved most of its physical targets as redefined at the MTR. It constructed 332
km of roads, completed 38 uars and 116 wells, of which 74 found exploitable amounts of water. All
the buildings were completed. The PMU and the research station were staffed and the research
organization effectively organized. Training of research workers, road engineers and technicians, and
veterinarians, was completed as planned.
30.   At the time of preparation of the completion report, security condition in Somalia prevented
the Bank from visiting the country to assess the economic rate of return (ERR). An evaluation
carried out by a team of consultants hired under the project in 1988 reestimated the ERR at around 5
percent, compared with the appraisal estimate of 20 percent. The consultant report pointed out that
although annual plantings of sorghum in the Bay Region rose from 193,500 ha in 1982 to just over
300,000 ha in 1987, much of the increase could not be attributed to the project's interventions. The
liberalization of the market, giving farmers the freedom to sell to others than the Agricultural
Development Corporation, had a greater effect. The consultant carried out two calculations of the
ERR: (a) if 35 percent of the area expansion was attributed to the project, the ERR would be 2
percent; (b) if 60 percent was attributed to the project, the ERR would be 5 percent. In both cases,
the returns to the project were unsatisfactory. The consultant cited a number of factors for the
discrepancy from the appraisal estimate: increases in on-farm operating costs, project investment costs
and a reduction in the price of commodities relative to manufactured goods and services since
appraisal. Also, with the increase in knowledge about the project area, some of the assumptions used
were different from those at appraisal. Because of the failure of the M&E unit to produce data, the
consultants had to conduct their own survey of villages in the project area. Their report warned that
"even those benefits which it has been possible to estimate are subject to a wide margin of error."

31.   Despite the difficulties in quantifying project results, several benefits had been noted. For
examnple, prior to water supply development, farmers often left their villages in the dry season. This
resulted in late planting and reduction In area planted as well as yields. The availability of water
resulted in timely planting and an increase in the area planted. The road network facilitated
transportation and marketing of cereals.
G. Project Sustainability
32.   The SAR stated that at the end of the project period, continued Government support would be
necessary since the project was only the first phase in a long-term development effort in the Region.
Sustainability was not considered an issue at the time. Nonetheless, the appraisal mission did require
that cost recovery from boreholes provided by the project be carried out in accordance with a study
on water charges. There is no indication in the Bank's files that the study was done, nor is there
mention of cost recovery. At the end of the project, it was envisaged that unless external financing
continued, project works would not be maintained and the supply of veterinary drugs and other
imported inputs would be interrupted. The outbreak of the civil war further eroded project benefits.
33.   In 1988, GOS hired consultants to prepare the second phase project. The proposal turned out
to be similar to the completed project. The projected ERR was 12 percent although there was no high
value crop that could carry the investment cost. While discussions were still going on about the
second project, the civil war broke out. Given the massive destruction that has taken place, it is
likely that little remains of the project.
H. Bank Performance
34.   The project was prepared and appraised without adequate information on all the important
socio-economic aspects. During the project period, a regional study and socio-economic study were
carried out, with results leading to the elimination and modification of some of the project
components. In retrospect, these studies should have been done during project preparation, especially
when the project's success hinged on acceptance by the rural population, and not only on the technical
nature of the project components.
35.   Most of the supervision missions were helpful and constructive, and working relations were
satisfactory. An average of 20 staff weeks per year of supervision were allocated to the project (1: 1
ratio compared to preparation/appraisal), which is quite reasonable. However, because of the
complexity of the project, the attention of supervision staff was spread over many components, with
the result that some essential features, such as monitoring and evaluation and cost recovery were
neglected. Although supervision missions had consistently recognized that the project's development
impact would be marginal, nothing was done to address this issue. It was also raised at the MTR, but
no recalculation of the ERR was done.
1. Borrower Performance
36.   Tle project was a complex development effort involving six ministries and four financiers.
Difficulties in coordinating the project activities and the slow transfer of personnel from various
government agencies to the project caused delay in project implementation. Furthermore, it was
unfortunate that the Somali Petroleum Agency refused permission for the project to import fuel
directly despite representations by the project General Manager, the MOA and the donors.



- 9 -
Consequently fuel had to be purchased with local currency, causing constraints to the road and water
components.
J. Consulting Services
37.   The performance of research consultants was satisfactory. However, the technical competence
of some consultants charged with physical implementation appeared rather weak. For example, the
first group charged with the design of the buildings failed to ensure adequate site preparation on
shrinking clay subsoils. The drift crossings had to be rebuilt to a better design. The consultants
charged with the design and supervision of uar construction had either made design mistakes or did
not exercise sufficient supervision of the implementing contractors.
K. Lni Learned
38.   The lessons learned are summarized as follows:
(a)    Project organization is a major issue in integrated rural development projects. This
project created a separate project unit that drew together staff and resources from the
participating ministries. The PMU took a while to develop into an effective
institution. In the end, one could say that this arrangement enhanced implementation
in the short-term but the impact on institution-building was negative. Its overstaffing
and cost overruns were a drain on the Government and when the project ended, staff
would have difficulty in re-integrating into the regular system;
(b)    There was a lack of coordination with an ongoing IDA-financed project aimed at
strengthening the national agricultural extension organization. Care should be taken,
particularly in the design of integrated regional projects, that they do not conflict with
national systems;
(c)   the Mid-Term Review was an innovative feature (now widely adopted across the
Bank) which resulted in a redesigned project and improved implementation.
However, it failed to tackle the root of the problem, which was the economic
justification for the project;
(d)    given the lack of knowledge about the region at preparation and appraisal, a weakness
the Bank admitted to at the outset, project design was overly ambitious and complex.
Attention of supervision staff and the PMU was spread thin over many components
while some essential features, such as monitoring and evaluation and cost recovery
were not given enough attention. These complexities were reinforced by the
involvement of multiple donors, causing delays in project start-up and the loss of
implementation momentum;
(e)    although this was designed as a first phase of a long-term program, greater
consideration could have been given to the question of sustainability. The SAR did
not discuss this issue since it expected support to continue in a follow-up project.

different from those at appraisal. Adaptive research and seed farm were combined into one
category, and technical assistance and training were incorporated into the other components.
Actual project costs are not available in the files. Due to the security situation in Somalia, a
PCR mission cannot go to the field to collect data.
