The overall objective of the project\n            was to improve the competitiveness and productivity of\n            industry through improved skills of industrial manpower. The\n            Bank's overall performance was rated deficient in both\n            project design and supervision. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            deficient in preparation and implementation and satisfactory\n            in compliance. The key lessons learned were as follows: (a)\n            the Bank, as well as the government, should scrutinize\n            carefully projects that rely heavily on technical\n            assistance; (b) training instructors were not sufficient to\n            raise the utilization rate of Vocational Training Centers;\n            and (c) if the instructors in the training centers are not\n            going to be used intensively after the training period, then\n            it may not make economic sense to invest in upgrading their quality."}, "docdt": "1996-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
