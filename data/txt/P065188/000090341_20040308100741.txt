3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

EFIL's primary development objective was to provide short and medium term working capital and
investment finance to private exporting enterprises to assist the Turkish exporting sector hurt by the 1998
global financial crisis. The secondary, but in many ways even more critical, objective for long term
sectorial development, is that the EFIL structure enables a strategic dialogue and close interaction with the
major banks and the Bankers Association in Turkey, through setting up of stricter and upgraded prudential
eligibility criteria and banking standards for capital adequacy, foreign exchange exposure, connected and
insider lending and risk management systems. The EFIL therefore, through a bottom up sectorial consensus
building approach, complement the top down policy dialogue being undertaken in respect of the
Government's financial sector reform program. Finally, the loan will also facilitate further institutional
development of Turk Eximbank (Eximbank) itself as an efficient and professionally run export finance
institution/export credit agency, through a comprehensive review of its institutional development priorities
and targeted institutional strengthening efforts to be implemented through a technical assistance component
included in the loan.

EFIL objectives have not been revised

3.4 Revised Components:
EFIL components have not been revised. The only change related to the project was a change made in May
2001, where some of the eligibility criteria applicable to sub-borrowers and sub-projects have been revised
in order to speed up the utilization of the Credit Line.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The objectives of EFIL were designed to be fully consistent with the CAS and priorities of the Turkish
Government. Eximbank and government counterparts were involved in all phases of project preparation
and design. The project design has incorporated all of the lessons learned from the previous credit line
operations of the Bank in Turkey and export credit line projects elsewhere (India, Mexico and Colombia).

Experience gained through these operations have demonstrated the appropriateness of using an
export-import bank such as Eximbank, an established export finance institution with a functioning
wholesale lending function, as the borrower and implementing agency for the loan, by use of a set of market
based eligibility criteria for participating banks, sub-borrowers and sub-projects, and by the use of SCL
terms and procurement arrangements suitable for private sector borrowers. In addition to these, knowledge
gained from informal work on banking sector (1988-99) has also helped in the design of the EFIL
operation.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

EFIL has proved to be a successful project, as it provided a timely and focused response to the partially
unmet demand from banks and exporting companies for both medium- and long-term funding, during the
pre- and post-crisis periods. Under the credit line component of the project, the EFIL provided a total of
$246.0 million for short and medium term financing for the procurement of input goods, equipment, works
and services by private exporters. These funds were onlent by Eximbank in its capacity as a wholesale
institution to six private banks (PFIs). Lending to private exporters were done by these banks. The
on-lending margin on these loans were determined to be in line with the existing market practices.
Although initially this margin was above the pre-crisis costs of foreign borrowing of the banking system,
and also above the borrowing costs for shorter term funds, during the implementation period it was
periodically reviewed to reflect the changes in the market conditions and was reduced throughout the
project life, to reflect the existing market rates. At the end of the loan closing date, credit utilization figure
of $243.91 million indicated a utilization rate of 99.2 percent. EFIL with a total disbursement figure
including technical assistance component of $247.19 million, was almost (99%) fully disbursed by the loan
closing date of end-August 2003. Disbursement percentage (99.2) of the credit line component of the loan
was higher than the disbursement percentage (81.8) of the technical assistance (TA) component

The secondary objective of EFIL was to start a strategic dialogue and close interaction with the Turkish
banking system that would lead the way for the regulatory/structural reforms in the Turkish banking sector.
This dialogue and interaction with the Turkish banks and the Bankers' Association of Turkey was initiated
through EFIL structure, by using Eximbank as the borrower and implementing agency and by introducing
stricter banking standards for the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to be selected as intermediaries
for the EFIL operation. At the inception of EFIL the PFIs were obliged under the terms of Subsidiary Loan
Agreements (SLAs) to remain in compliance with "prudential" ratios which were stricter than those
imposed on the banking system by the Turkish bank regulatory authorities. Thus, EFIL, by working with a
set of banks in Turkey, acted as a facilitator in starting a dialogue with the Turkish banking system and
was successful introducing and enforcing stricter banking standards for the PFIs which were later adopted
by the BRSA and the Turkish banking system as standard prudential banking requirements.

4.2 Outputs by components:

1.       Part A of the Project: Credit Line Component - SubLoans:

Lending was done through six private banks (PFIs) including one privately owned development bank
throughout the loan utilization period. The banks that took part in the lending operation were selected
according to the criteria agreed between Eximbank and the Bank. Eximbank would take the credit risk on
the banks selected for participation. The PFIs in turn made the sub-loans to private exporting enterprises
for procurement of raw materials, equipment, works and services in order to expand their current export

volumes, or in exceptional circumstances to enable them to retain and maintain their current level of
exports. The PFIs would take the credit risks on the borrowing enterprises.

PFI Subsidiary Loan Allocations: At the inception of EFIL (September/October 1999), five PFIs
(Garanti, TSKB, Yapi Kredi, Kocbank and Isbank) each signed Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) with
Eximbank. In May 2001, Garanti's participation in the program was suspended because of a lack of
continuing interest in EFIL utilization. In addition to the first group of five PFIs, in April 2002 Eximbank
signed a new US$20 million SLA with Disbank, a medium-sized private bank. Subsequently during June
2002, $20.0 million out of TSKB's original $50.0 million allocation was cancelled and reallocated to other
PFIs. The amount was reallocated in August to Kocbank (US$4 million), Isbank (US$6 million), and
Disbank (US$10 million). As of August 31, 2003, the status of funds allocated to each PFI was:



              PFI                              Amount ( $ million)

             Isbank                            60
             Garanti                           10
             Yapi Kredi                        62
             Disbank                           30
              Total                            246


Credit Line Utilization: During the life of EFIL, a total of $243.9 million was intermediated by the six
banks. All of the loans were medium term loans, indicating that due to prohibitively high interest rate levels
and short maturities of Turkish Lira loans, demand for affordable longer-term funds from the real and
financial sectors in Turkey was very strong. Of the total loan amount, $194.9 million (80 percent) was
utilized for working capital, and $48.9 million (20 percent) was utilized for investment loans. A total of 78
Turkish producer/exporter companies (sub-borrowers) were financed through 97 separate sub-loans. These
sub-loans covered around 20 industrial sectors and all geographical regions of the country. EFIL sub-loans
have performed better than the average credit portfolios of the banks. Currently all these loans are
classified as "pass", i.e. there are no problem loans and all of the interest payments and principal payments
due on these sub-loans are being made on a timely basis. Full details of the loan disbursement as of loan
closing date of August 31, 2003 are provided in Table below.

Overall, the financial performance of the majority of beneficiary EFIL enterprises during the EFIL
implementation period can be regarded as satisfactory. The EFIL facility, which was small compared to the
size of the Turkish economy and export oriented enterprises, has nevertheless been very successful in
helping exporting companies in a country suffering from a severe crisis to continue and develop their export
activities.

2.       Part B of the Project:Technical Assistance Component-Institutional Development of
Eximbank:

Technical assistance funding was intended to support Eximbank's institutional strengthening efforts,
following a comprehensive review of its institutional development priorities. Institutional strengthening of
Turk Eximbank is an integral part of EFIL. Under Part B of the project, the EFIL aimed to provide
financing for further institutional strengthening of Eximbank as a more efficient and professionally run
export finance institution. Support was provided through procurement of consulting services, IT equipment
(hard- and software) and related services, and training for Eximbank staff. The Focus of the Institutional
Development component is to strengthen Eximbank's: strategic planning capacity; organization structure;
budgeting system; Credit, Insurance and Guarantee Operations; Treasury and Asset/Liability Management;
MIS and Management Accounting Systems; Operations and IT Management; Human Resource
Management; and Internal Audit Capacity. EFIL implementation provided the Eximbank staff with an
opportunity to better address the working capital and export-oriented financing performed under a
reimbursement method, and enabled them to evaluate the contribution of the loan to the overall financial
viability of the sub-borrower. Experience gained from sub-borrower evaluation increased financial analysis
capability of the Eximbank staff as well as a deeper understanding of credit rating issues.

In late 2002, Eximbank management requested an extension of the loan closing date to provide training for
the Eximbank staff as continuation of the institutional development program (IDP). This extension was
necessary because the original closing date of the loan - February 28, 2003 - did not leave sufficient time
for implementation of these training programs. The Bank agreed with the request and extended the project
in early 2003, from February 28 to August 31, 2003 to accommodate completion of Eximbank's IDP's
training component and remaining disbursements. As of loan closing date $3.27 million was utilized from
this component. As a result of the findings of the IDP, Eximbank management is planning to do
some fine tuning in many aspects of the Eximbank organization. Details of IDP utilization is provided
in table below.

Strategic Dialogue with the Banking Sector:

The secondary objective of EFIL was to start a strategic dialogue and close interaction with the Turkish
banking system that would lead the way for the regulatory/structural reforms in the Turkish banking sector.
The proposed EFIL, through a bottom up sectorial consensus building approach was expected to
complement the top down reform policy dialogue being undertaken as part of the Government's financial
sector reform program. The objective was to initiate this dialogue with the banks and the Bankers'
Association of Turkey, by using Eximbank as the borrower and implementing agency and through EFIL
structure, by introducing stricter banking standards for the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to be
selected as intermediaries for the EFIL operation. The PFIs to be selected by Eximbank for participation in
EFIL were evaluated by Eximbank for such aspects of their operations as their internal risk management
system capacity, their true capital adequacy ratios, foreign exchange exposure, connected and insider
lending practices, Y2K readiness, etc. At the inception of EFIL the PFIs were obliged under the terms of
Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) to remain in compliance with "prudential" ratios which were stricter
than those imposed on the banking system by the Turkish bank regulatory authorities (at the time the
Turkish Treasury and the Central Bank). As conditionality for FSAL and later PFPSAL the prudential
regulations for the Turkish banking system were tightened and generally brought up to international
standards and in May 2001, the SLAs were amended to replace the original "prudential" ratios with those
set forth in the (new) banking law and regulations issued by Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency
(BRSA).

Although it was a timely and effective response to demand from the banks and exporting companies for
medium-and long-term funding, and had a critical value during the pre-and post-crisis periods, EFIL had a
relatively small impact on Turkish exports when compared to the size of the Turkish economy and export
volume. The real value of EFIL as a lending instrument was in providing long term investment funding for
producer-exporters, which under existing banking conditions/practices was not available. However,
because of the eligibility criteria applied for the selection of sub-borrowers, PFIs were limited to lend to
their most credit-worthy clients which had a long and positive relationship with them.           Under these
conditions, EFIL could not be utilized by firms with promising projects but little or no access to banks, but
by stronger companies who had relatively easy access to alternative funding resources.

When taking these facts into consideration, the real significance of EFIL lies in achieving its secondary
objective which aimed at initiating a strategic dialogue and close interaction with the Turkish banking
system. This objective was achieved by utilizing EFIL as a facilitator, through which the Bank teams: (i)
were able to initiate a dialogue with the Turkish banking sector; (ii) became aware of its structural
weaknesses; and (iii) were ready to be effectively involved in supporting the banking reform of the
government throughout the three ensuing program loans (FSAL, PFPSAL I and II). Another by-product of
this objective was to further develop the credit analysis capability of the Turkish banks. Both of these
objectives had a significant and lasting impact and contributed significantly to the long-term institutional
and regulatory development of the Turkish banking sector.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
N/A

4.4 Financial rate of return:
This project provided, predominantly, incremental working capital to a large number of companies in the
export sector. The participating banks were expected to submit borrowers to a rigorous credit analysis and
all borrowers were required to be in compliance with predetermined debt/equity and debt service ratios.
According to the terms and conditions of the agreements between the PFIs and the subborrowers,
sub-projects involving investments were required to generate a financial rate of return of at least 15 percent
( calculation of economic rates of return was required only in cases where major price distortions in inputs
or outputs were evident).

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The main institutional development impact of the loan was to initiate the adoption of stricter and upgraded
prudential eligibility criteria and banking standards for capital adequacy, foreign exchange exposure,
connected and insider lending and risk management systems by the Turkish banks participating in the EFIL
project. Due to the requirements of the loan, the PFIs selected for the EFIL had to undergo an evaluation of
their internal risk management system capacity assessment by independent consultants. This was a new
experience for almost all of the PFIs and at the beginning was met with some resistance by the banks since
it involved a lengthy preparatory process and involved some consultancy contracts. However, the value and
significance of this assessment and adoption of higher prudential requirements was later appreciated by
these PFIs when the Turkish banking system went through a major crisis in 2000-2001 and all of the PFIs
were better prepared for the crisis and in a better financial situation than their peers. Also, in a narrower
sense, the loan, through the technical assistance component and project implementation, increased
Eximbank's IT and staff capacity and helped Eximbank to become a more efficient and professionally run
export finance institution/export credit agency.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
 Starting in December 1999, the Government with the help of the Bank had initiated a financial sector
reform program to address the weaknesses of the banking sector. Despite successful implementation of
these reforms, however, in late November 2000, Turkey experienced a banking system liquidity crisis. In
February 2001, there was another, much more serious crisis that set off a new wave of turbulence in the
financial sector. Following the 2000-2001 financial sector crises and subsequent economic slump, the
Turkish economy has registered a marked improvement in its performance. By the end of 2002, interest
rates on Government securities had fallen to the 55 percent range, compared with peaks during the
post-crisis period of well over 100 percent. The economic recovery has been stronger than expected, with
GNP growth for 2002 of 7.8 percent, well above the initial target of 3 percent. The positive macroeconomic
outcomes have improved the public debt dynamics, with the stock of net public debt falling by almost 14
percent of GNP in 2002, to 80 percent of GNP. In 2003, economic growth rate is expected to exceed 5%,
in part due to the continued strong export performance.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Turkish exports (Table below) has been an important economic success story in the recent years growing at
an average annual rate of over 12 percent, from $2.9 billion in 1980 to $35.8 billion in 2002 and an
expected figure of $45.0 billion in 2003. The share of exports in GNP increased in the same period from
4.2 percent to nearly 20 percent. However, in the pre-crisis period exports were particularly hard hit by the
combined impact of: (i) the slowdown in growth in Turkey's export markets from an average of 8.9 percent



                                                     - 7 -

in 1997 to 5.3 percent in 1998; (ii) disruption in the previously rapidly growing Russian and other CIS
markets; (iii) the sharp increase in domestic real interest rates which undermined the competitiveness of
Turkish export products in foreign markets; and (iv) the severe credit and liquidity squeeze in Turkey due
to non-availability of reliable short and medium term finance. Consequently, export growth dropped from
13.1 percent in 1997 to an estimated 2.7 percent in 1998. The effect of the major earthquake in 1999
contributed to a further 1.4 percent decline in exports that year.

However, starting in 2000, export growth got back on a positive track, reaching 4.5 percent despite the
December financial market crisis, and then, led by increased competitiveness of Turkish exports after the
Lira devaluation in early 2001 and by increasing market confidence in sustainability of the crisis resolution
measures undertaken by the authorities, jumped to 12.8 percent in 2001 and 14.1 percent in 2002.
Post-crisis economic recovery has clearly been export-led. Exports further grew over 30 percent in the first
6 months of 2003, compared to the same period in the previous year and have reached nearly $29.8 billion
for the first half of the year as compared to $35.8 billion for the whole year in 2002, thus demonstrating
growth in both volume and absolute value of exports.

Although there were no significant delays in project implementation, there were some problems related to
the timing and quality of data received from the PFIs. This was due to the recapitalization scheme which
was launched on February 2002, where private commercial banks were required to undergo a three-stage,
independent audit process. This process     resulted in some delays in finalizing the financial tables for the
period ended 31st December, 2001 and caused delays in analyzing PFI financial performance in a timely
manner.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

In case of EFIL sub-borrowers, export performance data over the loan disbursement period between
1999-2002 have been very positive. Export figures for the years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 were,
respectively, $ 2, 2.8, 3.1, and 4 billion, much more than the projected figures of $ 0.1, 1.2, 1.7 and 1.9
billion for the same period. This corresponded to annual growth rates of 40 percent, 11 percent, and 29
percent in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. The main reason for this better-than-expected
performance was the fact that the majority of these companies were exporters with established markets.
High export volume, increased profit margins and a strong equity base allowed them to sustain and improve
profitable business activities, while maintaining a sound financial structure during both the pre- and
post-crisis periods. In a few cases of unsatisfactory performance, the main culprits were:                 (a)
above-optimal financial leverage, (b) a relatively high percentage of domestic sales within total sales, which
were negatively affected by contraction in domestic demand throughout the economic crisis;(c) decreasing
profit margins due to domestic competition, and/or decreasing capacity utilization as a result of problems
faced in obtaining working capital financing.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

1.       Institutionally: Turkey's past export growth record, as well as the World Bank's own experience
with EFIL, indicate that private sector exporters in general, have the technical and managerial ability to
successfully tap export opportunities, provided they have access to appropriate financing in terms of
pricing and maturity. Through EFIL, the Borrower and Implementing Agency, Turk Eximbank, was able
to strengthen its already well established wholesale lending features thereby placing Eximbank in a position
to successfully channel project reflows to additional private sector exporters beyond EFIL. It is likely that
similar new export operations through Eximbank, financed by appropriate funding terms, will have a very
high likelihood of self-sustainability. Additionally, continued use of high-quality loan and sub-borrower
eligibility requirements, introduced through EFIL, has and will contribute to strengthening the overall
intermediation capacity of the participating banks, which is likely to remain sustainable beyond the closing
date of the loan.

The success and likely sustainability of EFIL - was instrumental in bringing the Bank and the Turkish


                                                     - 9 -

Government to agree on a second EFIL along similar lines. EFIL II is a repeater project and is designed to
follow and build upon the achievements of the first EFIL project and will continue to serve as a catalyst to
support export and real sector growth in Turkey. To this end, the second EFIL will continue to provide
medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to Turkish private exporters while aiming to
improve the ability of the Turkish financial sector to provide financial resources to the private exporters
through further development of intermediation by private financial institutions, including leasing
companies. Both EFIL and EFIL II are part of the Bank's multi-year financial sector reform program for
Turkey, which aims to stabilize and support the further development of the Turkish financial system for the
benefit of the private sector and economic growth. A secondary objective of EFIL II is to continue the
dialogue with the leading commercial banks and to encourage them to improve their financial
intermediation skills and volume by maintaining prudent and rigorous credit appraisal standards that was
introduced by the first EFIL. Sustainability of the credit line component can only be achieved by increased
long-term lending, which in turn will depend on macro economic stability, followed by lower inflation and
interest rates where the banks will be expected to increase their medium and long-term loan portfolios.

2.       In macroeconomic terms: Over the years, medium to long term lending by Turkish banks to the
real sector had already been crowded out by the large and expanding demand for government borrowing.
In addition to this, after-effects of the banking crisis in 2001, their need for re-capitalization in 2002 and a
deposit base that has become increasingly short-term, resulted in the banks becoming more cautious in their
lending operations. Following the simultaneous decline in international syndicated lending to Turkish
banks, all firms, except blue chip firms or dedicated exporters, were generally faced with a credit crunch
and were unable to finance any longer term investments. Therefore sustainability of similar operations
designed to provide medium and long-term working capital and investment finance for Turkish private
exporting enterprises, will depend on macroeconomic recovery (reduced PSBR), increased demand for
longer term funding and ability of the financial sector to support these trends with medium and long-term
working capital and investment finance at a reasonable cost.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
N/A

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank's performance during preparation and appraisal stages was satisfactory. Bank's missions had the
necessary expertise to draw from the experiences and lessons learned from the results of the earlier credit
line projects. During project pre-appraisal and subsequent appraisal stages, Turkish Treasury and Turk
Eximbank officials and several of the prospective participating banks had been consulted on the project
design. In the pre-appraisal phase, contacts were also established with the Turkish Exporters Association
and the Turkish Bankers Association and their feedback on project design was actively sought. The
feedback provided by all these parties, and the lessons learned in the ICRs of previous World Bank credit
line operations in Turkey, were incorporated in the project's design. Following an identification mission in
December 1999, it took three months to move the loan from pre-appraisal to the negotiations stage.

7.2 Supervision:

The Bank's performance during the implementation phase was also satisfactory. Responding to the
Government's request from the Bank, for an export credit line that could help slow the sharp deterioration
in export performance and meet the increased credit demand on the part of private sector, Bank staff



                                                      - 10 -

worked with dedication and used their in-depth country and sector knowledge to respond swiftly to the
Government's request. Supervision missions visited Turk Eximbank (Eximbank), participating banks and
selected subborrowers at regular intervals twice per year, and the interaction of Bank staff with the
Eximbank and with the participating banks' staff was excellent.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Overall, the Bank's performance in this operation has been satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Although Eximbank had not worked with the Bank before, it was very efficient in responding to the Bank's
requirement for establishing a project implementation unit (PIU) specifically for interacting with the Bank
in managing this project, by appointing its Deputy General Manager, Lending Operations, as Project
Manager for EFIL and additionally appointing all of the PIU staff. In addition, Eximbank had already
undertaken extensive export research to document the existence of an export finance demand gap, and had
pre-screened the eligible participating banks. During the project preparation, PIU staff worked closely with
the Bank staff and contributed effectively in the project preparation.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Government supported the project as it was a response to the Government's request from the Bank, and
since project objectives were fully consistent with the CAS and Government's priorities. Government was
also supportive of the institutional impact of the loan, and throughout the implementation of FSAL and
PFPSAL I and II (which coincided with the EFIL implementation) Banking Regulatory and Supervision
Agency (BRSA) worked closely with the Bank to introduce stricter banking standards for the Turkish
banking system.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The performance of Eximbank and the participating banks in implementing the project and the credit
operations was satisfactory. Eximbank as the apex agency was efficient in day to day coordination and
project implementation including monitoring the compliance of the participating banks with the financial
covenants, and compliance of the subborrowers with the required eligibility criteria. Eximbank, in
managing the implementation of this project, came up a significant learning curve, especially as concerns
its oversight function in establishing initial and ongoing participating bank eligibility, using criteria that
were more stringent than the criteria Turk Eximbank itself hitherto had applied to its own wholesale
lending. Since some of the participating banks (TSKB, Garanti and Yapi Kredi) already had some
experience in working with the Bank through previous credit line operations, they had no problem in
adapting easily to the EFIL operation. The newcomers (Isbank, Kocbank and Disbank ), although working
for the first time in a Bank credit line operation, also became adept in implementing Bank's criteria after the
experience of the first two loans. The project was extended for 6 months in order to provide training for the
Eximbank staff since Eximbank management thought the original closing date of the loan did not leave
enough implementation time for these training programs.

8. Lessons Learned

1.      Lessons learned from recent credit line operations: The main lesson learned during the last few
years from Bank credit line operations in the ECA Region and elsewhere, is that the project design should
be kept as flexible as possible, with a minimum number of, or no statutory requirements; e.g. avoiding
constraints like minimum sub-loan size, maturity, currency denomination, sub-borrower co-financing
requirements, sectoral lending focus, etc., but using sensible financial indicators for the selection of both
the PFIs and the sub-borrowers/sub-projects in line with established market practices (e.g., for
participating    banks,  BIS/IAS     based     capital  adequacy      and   other    prudential   ratios, for
sub-borrowers/sub-projects established financial indicators such as debt equity and debt service coverage
ratios). Restrictive procurement requirements unsuitable for private sector borrowers, and the World
Bank's previous currency pool loan features have also proven to be a hindrance to expeditious project
implementation, and wherever commercial practices and SCLs were used, these factors ceased to be a
bottleneck. Another important lesson learned has been that the most successful formula for high quality and
expeditious project implementation is to combine the Borrower and Implementing Agency functions in one
and the same entity if possible. Finally, pre-committing financial intermediaries to borrowing a certain part
of a credit line (which involves paying a commitment fee on the pre-committed amount) provides a strong
incentive to the intermediaries to be quick and effective in finding and financing eligible sub-projects, and
leads to quicker disbursement of the Bank loan.

2.      Lessons Learned from Previous Credit Line Operations in Turkey: The Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous World Bank credit line operations in Turkey indicate that
some of these operations had to be restructured in mid-stream because the initial project design turned out
to be too inflexible (e.g., too many requirements in terms of minimum sub-loan size, sub-loan maturity,
sub-borrower co-financing requirements, etc.). The ICRs indicate that, after restructuring, project
implementation generally proceeded well.

3.      Lessons Learned from Export Oriented Credit Lines: Finally, for export credit line projects,
earlier World Bank credit line operations in India, Mexico and Colombia have demonstrated the
appropriateness of an export-import bank or a foreign trade bank as the focus for the on-lending of World
Bank funds (e.g., export-import bank in India, Bancomext in Mexico, Bancoldex in Colombia). These
banks are dedicated institutions for developing foreign trade, and do not carry out normal commercial retail
operations. Usually they target export financing, and in some cases, they work as wholesale banks and
develop lending programs for the first tier banks, in addition to their own direct lending to exporters.

EFIL project design has incorporated all of these lessons learned, by using Turk Eximbank as the Borrower
and Implementing Agency for the loan, by the use of a set of market based eligibility criteria for
participating banks, sub-borrowers and sub-projects, and by the use of SCL terms and procurement
arrangements suitable to private sector borrowers.
