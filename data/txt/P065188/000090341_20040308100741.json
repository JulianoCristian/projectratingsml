likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned indicate that the project design should\n            be kept as flexible as possible, with a minimum number of,\n            or no statutory requirements; e.g. avoiding constraints like\n            minimum sub-loan size, maturity, currency denomination,\n            sub-borrower co-financing requirements, sectoral lending\n            focus, etc., but using sensible financial indicators for the\n            selection of both the PFIs and the\n            sub-borrowers/sub-projects in line with established market\n            practices (e.g., for participating banks, BIS/IAS based\n            capital adequacy and other prudential ratios, for\n            sub-borrowers/sub-projects established financial indicators\n            such as debt equity and debt service coverage ratios). The\n            Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous\n            World Bank credit line operations in Turkey indicate that\n            some of these operations had to be restructured in\n            mid-stream because the initial project design turned out to\n            be too inflexible. For export credit line projects, earlier\n            World Bank credit line operations in India, Mexico and\n            Colombia have demonstrated the appropriateness of an\n            export-import bank or a foreign trade bank as the focus for\n            the on-lending of World Bank funds (e.g., export-import bank\n            in India, Bancomext in Mexico, Bancoldex in Colombia). These\n            banks are dedicated institutions for developing foreign\n            trade, and do not carry out normal commercial retail operations."}, "docdt": "2003-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
