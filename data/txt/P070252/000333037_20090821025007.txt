F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
 To build capacity within the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) and its national
committees, so that it can better achieve its mandate of managing land and water
resources in the greater Conventional Basin of Lake Chad.
  The GEO has not been revised. While the PAD and Credit Agreement did not provide a
Results Framework, the project had a logframe which contained objectives, outputs and
outcomes. logframe was the norm at the time of project preparation and its design did not
include information on baseline and end-of-project targets. At the time of project
preparation result framework was not a requirement and the logframe was the norm. The
following framework has been derived from information provided in the logframe (see
Annex 1 of the PAD: #Project Design Summary#); refer also to Sections 1.2 and 2.3.
  In Annex 10, UNDP#s APR/PIR and Prodoc outcome indicators have been integrated
with the outcome indicators used in the Bank#s ISRs. This integration provides a better
presentation of project outcomes and an alternative for the Results Framework provided
in this Section F.
  The objectives and indicators of the Project Appraisal Document#s (PAD) logframe
were overly ambitious and by design lacked baselines and targets. As a result, it is
difficult for stakeholders to reach agreement in rating the achievements of the project. For
example, this ICR rates the project performance as moderately unsatisfactory (MU),
while the independent final evaluation rates the project performance as moderately
satisfactory (MS). The MU rating is based on the comparison of the achievement of the
project with the overly ambitious objectives. The MS rating, on the other hand, is based
on the project#s achievements despite the difficulties encountered, such as the civil strife.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Regional context and issues. Lake Chad and its active basin constitute an important
freshwater resource shared by Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Niger
and Nigeria. Due to persistent drought and human activity, the lake's surface area has
decreased from a peak of 25,000 km2 to less than 2,000 km2. Socio-economic pressures
on the region's limited water resource base and a drier climate have led to a significant
increase in extractions for irrigation.
Rural poverty and environmental degradation: General poverty characterizes the
development situation in the Basin, which is a key factor for all environmental threats.
The member countries rank among the last thirty in the latest Human Development Index
ranking (December 2008). Close to 20 million peoples' livelihoods depend on economic
activities carried out in the lake and its hydrological active basin of about 1.0 million km2,
which also includes important wetlands and floodplains.
Inadequate water and environmental management policies: Generally, there is
insufficient knowledge of water resources in the Basin, and there is no effective system
for monitoring freshwater resources. Water demand management is ineffective, and little
attention is paid to adapting production methods to natural resource limitations.
Focus on strengthening regional (LCBC), national and local capacity: On May 22, 1964,
the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) was instituted under the `Convention Relating
to the Development of the Chad Basin,' executed by Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.
CAR joined LCBC in 1994 and Libya ratified the convention in June 2008. LCBC's
broad mandate includes prior notification, monitoring studies and works related to water
resources. LCBC has the authority to examine complaints and contribute to the resolution
of differences among member countries. The latter, however, have often bypassed the
LCBC in pursuing national development projects.
Rationale for Bank's assistance: The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) does not
explicitly elaborate the rationale for Bank assistance. LCBC and GEF requested the
involvement of the Bank as co-implementing agency with UNDP, for its comparative
advantage. At the time of appraisal, the project was consistent with the general sector
goals of relevant Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) and PRSPs, but relevant CAS
documents gave different levels of attention to the issue of water in general, and little or
none to transboundary water basin management. The project contributed to the
overarching goals of the Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) for Sub-
Saharan Africa by strengthening collaboration across borders, promoting cooperation,
and coordinating investments in support of shared water resources. The Central Africa
Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (2003) specifically mentioned the Project and
sector work to define basin-wide priorities.




                                              1
    Designed to generate global benefits through sustainable transboundary water resources
    management and comprehensive participation of local stakeholders in land and water
    management in the Lake Chad Basin, the project was fully aligned with GEF's OP9
    "Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area Operational Program." The GEF project
    was an opportunity for LCBC to embrace institutional change towards: (i) a planning and
    management based organization, (ii) ensuring a sound and environmentally sustainable
    basis for investments and economic developments, and (iii) creating a culture of
    transparent public participation.

    1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)
    Lack of uniformity in GEO descriptions: The PAD, Grant Agreement and Prodoc
    (UNDP) provide various descriptions of the PDO/GEO (see Table 1). These descriptions,
    although different, are not contradictory. They all agree on the capacity building aspects
    of the LCBC, and the Grant Agreement and Prodoc further elaborate on the TDA and
    SAP, and on the increase and coordination of donor support. The Grant Agreement
    mentions donor coordination, while the Prodoc focuses on donor support, specifically in
    implementing the SAP.

                                                                       implementing the SAP.
    Table 1: Description of the GEO in the different Project documents.
    Lack of uniformity, baseline, and end of project target values in key performance
    indicators: While the PAD and Credit Agreement did not provide a Results Framework,
    the project had a logframe which contained objectives, outputs and outcomes. At the time
    of project preparation result framework was not a requirement and the logframe was the
    norm. The design of logframe design did not include information on baseline and end-of-
    project targets. The logframe (Annex 1 of the PAD) only lists outcome indicators (some


                                                2
of which are activities/outputs), in addition to a host of output indicators. Similarly,
Annex 2 of UNDP's Prodoc provides a detailed logframe for the project without baseline
and end-of-project target values for its indicators (see Annex 10).

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
There were no formal revisions of the original GEO and key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary regional benefit of the project was a stronger LCBC for the decision-making
process at the regional level, resulting in: (i) strengthened regional institutional capacity
for coordinated decision-making; (ii) local communities empowered in managing the
Lake Chad and Lake Fitri resources; (iii) design of an effective mechanism to translate
regional policies to the local level for managing the natural resources; and (iv) regional
consensus and support for the next phase of work based on a SAP. The PAD and Prodoc
identified beneficiaries at three levels:
(i) At the regional level LCBC would benefit from institutional strengthening, capacity
building to implement projects, and an overall advancement of its vision, mandate and
strategic planning framework. It would be able to build more commitment from its
members, and serve them efficiently.
(ii) At the national level water management structures of LCB countries would benefit
from institutional capacity building and being mandated to lead the national-level process
of the TDA and SAP. Member governments would put mechanisms in place to
harmonize their activities and get prepared to attract donor support and investment.
(iii) At the local level rural communities in the Basin would benefit from the micro-grant
programs and become more involved in decision-making processes to manage their
natural resources.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of six components, as summarized below from PAD and Prodoc
(see also Annex 2). Components 2 and 6 were implemented through the Bank,
components 1, 3 and 4 were implemented through UNDP, and component 5 (pilot
projects) was jointly implemented. The total budget of the project was US$9.6 million, of
which US$2.9 million was implemented through the Bank.
Component 1 (An established PMU and national Lead Agencies to drive and coordinate
implementation - US$ 2.34m) aimed at establishing: the Project Management Unit
(PMU) at LCBC; national lead agencies; and a Technical Advisory Committee and
Project Steering Committee (PSC) to drive and co-ordinate TDA, SAP, pilot projects,
policy initiatives and institutional linkages.
Component 2 (Enhanced regional policy initiatives and institutional mechanisms to
address trans-boundary issues - US$1.08m) aimed to strengthen the institutional and
environmental management capacity at regional and national/local levels through: (i)
review of current functions and responsibilities of LCBC, creating awareness of national



                                             3
policy makers on transboundary issues and building regional capacity; (ii) integration of
transboundary water and environmental management policies into National development
Action Plans (NAP); (iii) review of legal, institutional, financial and socio-economic
frameworks in member countries; and (iv) the harmonization of legal frameworks,
regulations and approaches for transboundary management of shared resources.
Component 3 (Strengthened engagement of stakeholders - US$ 1.23m) aimed at
strengthening community level participation through: (i) supporting local planning
initiatives to establish their sustainable development plans in line with sub-basin planning
frameworks; (ii) workshops for the prioritization of local, national and regional initiatives
to arrive at a coherent and integrated approach; and (iii) development of a regionally
based methodology and mechanism for multi-level stakeholder participation, with
provisions for environmental impact studies.
Component 4 (A completed TDA and a synthetic framework for concerted management of
the basin ­ US$ 2.05m) aimed to examine basin-wide conditions and issues and to
determine the linkages between environmental and socio-economic systems and their
transboundary impacts. These would serve as an input to the SAP design (component 6)
and implementation. This component was also designed to collect data, improve data
collection systems and capacity, develop water resources models and develop risk
analysis capacity.
Component 5 (Demonstration pilot projects - US$2.54 m) aimed to test and validate
methodologies, secure stakeholder involvement and develop implementation modalities
for national and local SAP and NAP interventions. Pilot projects implemented through
the World Bank were (i) the Lake Fitri pilot in Chad, (ii) the Komadugu-Yobe (KY) pilot
in Nigeria, and (iii) the Waza-Logone (WL) flood plains pilot in Cameroon. Pilot projects
funded through the UNDP included: (iv) the Lake Chad Shorelines and Northern
Diagnostic Basin pilot, and (v) the Upper Chari Basin land use systems pilot in the CAR.
Component 6 (Strategic Action Plan endorsed and donor support mobilized- US$0.36 m)
aimed to develop a prioritized Strategic Action Program (SAP) for basin management
(with an Investment Plan (IP)) and to mobilize donors support.
The Project was jointly implemented by the World Bank and UNDP. The United Nations
Office for Project Services (UNOPS)was the Executing Agency for the components
funded through the UNDP, and acted as a Management Services Provider for the
components funded through the Bank. The project was managed by a PMU in
collaboration with National Coordinators (NC).

1.6 Revised Components
None of the project components were restructured during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
At project effectiveness (January 21, 2004) the closing date was extended till January 20,
2008, following which it was extended twice, ultimately to December 20, 2008. No
significant changes related to project design occurred during implementation. The only
changes made in 2006 were: (i) a reallocation of funds; (ii) the merging of funds for



                                             4
goods and works with the funds for "micro grants" to allow full community participation
in the implementation of local initiatives under the pilot projects; (iii) an adjustment of
the financing parameters for all expenditures to 100%; and (iv) an amendment of the
Procurement Schedule of the Grant Agreement.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA): The project was not subjected to a QEA, but QAG
conducted in August 2004 a Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6), which covered
mainly the period from appraisal to effectiveness. The panel noted (i) the Bank's weak
performance in helping the project achieve effectiveness; (ii) slow response to serious
design issues; and (iii) the absence of a strategy to remedy weak ownership and
commitment of LCBC. The latter was highlighted as a main threat to the project's
sustainability. The Panel also expressed concern about the weak performance of
UNOPS/PMU in project execution.
Delay in project effectiveness. It took a full year after Board approval to achieve
effectiveness conditions in January 2004. Factors causing this delay included: (i) LCBC's
institutional weakness and lack of capacity; (ii) LCBC's failure to provide counterpart
staff for the PMU; (iii) UNOPS' inability to timely establish the PMU; (iv) severe
constraints to travel and communication within the region; and (v) initial disbursement
problems of UNOPS.
Overly ambitious project design: The QSA6 panel (August 2004) concluded: (i) the
project's scope, design and GEO were too ambitious given the implementation
capabilities of the Recipient; (ii) the institutional context was not properly appraised at
entry, (iii) the project design did not sufficiently address the development of SAP
implementation capacity in LCBC; and (v) the safeguard framework overly focused on a
set of micro-level pilot sites, while failing to look at the region's problems more
strategically.
Lessons learned. Lessons learned from other GEF operations were enumerated in the
PAD, but in some cases not adequately incorporated into the project design, such as:
   Political support from riparian countries is needed to strengthen regional
   mechanisms. Although the riparians were expressing their commitment to improving
   the environmental management of Lake Chad, this did not translate into effective
   until the end of the project.
   Capacity building is critical for effective decision-making and management at all
   levels. The project aimed at building regional, national and local capacity to
   strengthen the decision-making process for sustainable ecosystem-based management
   of the Basin's resources. However, the project's design provided insufficient
   resources for strengthening of the regional institution LCBC itself.




                                            5
Assessment of risks: Crucial risk factors were seriously underestimated in the PAD.
These included (i) the political willingness of the member states to effectively support
LCBC financially and politically in executing its mandate and the project, and (ii)
LCBC's lack of ownership of the project. The lack of implementation and fiduciary
capacity within LCBC prompted the Bank to insist that LCBC would utilize a project
management service. The LCBC selected the UNOPS. However, the use of this service
management agent eroded LCBC's ownership of the project.

2.2 Implementation
Inadequate project management caused delays in project implementation: During 2004
and 2005, the project experienced operational and managerial problems. These included
(i) the lack of funds due to problems in UNOPS' financial system ATLAS, (ii) lack of
participation of LCBC staff, and (iii) lack of office facilities, vehicles, and other logistical
requirements. Appointment of a new Project Manager (PM) in 2005 caused
implementation progress to deteriorate further. By then, the lack of communication with
LCBC's management had led to complaints and disinterest at various levels. LCBC was
not involved in project decisions, and its staff members had been withdrawn from the
project.
Lack of commitment and ownership by Recipients: The lack of commitment of the
member countries to LCBC has resulted over time in large arrears in the national
contributions to LCBC, which at the end of 2007 stood at 3.4 billion FCFA or about
US$ 6.6 million1. In turn, LCBC's weak financial position and its limited management
capacity contributed to inadequate co-funding of project staffing. Linkages between the
PMU and LCBC remained weak throughout the project, despite numerous efforts and
commitments to improve the situation, including (i) the establishment of a Project
Management Group (PMG) in LCBC, (ii) increased participation of LCBC staff members
in the project, and (iii) increased internal communications and regular meetings.
Project at risk but not restructured: Following the QSA6 assessment in August 2004, the
team considered restructuring the project. The team faced the following dilemma: either
restructure the project formally or supervise it intensively to improve project
implementation. The formal restructuring would have been a lengthy process as
endorsement was required from each of the member countries.. The project was already
in its eighteenth month of implementation (project Board date January 2003 and
effectiveness January 2004). The team was of the opinion that funding a costly PMU--
which included international staff-- during a lengthy restructuring process would come
with significant transaction costs. On this basis, the team concluded that the optimal
solution was to (i) work intensively with the PMU/UNOPS to improve project
implementation `en route' and (ii) assess the success of this choice at the MTR stage. The
project, at risk of cancellation in 2005, moved out of problem status by May 2006.
LCBC's project ownership and PMU's performance had improved, and substantial

 Since the project became effective in January 2004 only Nigeria paid its contribution for
2005 and Chad reportedly paid its total arrears in 2008.



                                               6
progress had been achieved with procurement. The project slipped back into problem
status in 2007 (refer to section 5.1 for more information on project supervision).
Overly optimistic Mid-Term Review Assessment did not occasion project restructuring to
fix design flaws: An independent MTR was carried out in February 2007, while the
project still had the momentum gained by mid 2006. The MTR concluded that the project
had: (i) established the PMU and coordinating bodies; (ii) prepared a draft institutional
assessment (IA) of LCBC and its restructuring plan; (iii) launched all pilot projects; (iv)
prepared the TDA; (v) launched a consultancy on IWRM and on the preparation of
NAPs; and (vi) contributed to the creation of regional mechanisms to integrated sub-basin
management. The MTR considered the project to be progressing successfully towards the
achievement of the GEO and judged the objectives to be relevant and achievable. The
MTR failed to assess the project's outputs on the basis of the key performance indicators
articulated in the logframe in the PAD, and did not assess the likelihood of achieving the
GEO as per the project document. The overly optimistic MTR resulted in a perception
that the intensive supervision was satisfactorily addressing the design flaws identified as
early as August 2004 (QSAE assessment). In retrospect, the MTR was a missed
opportunity to objectively reconsider the option of formally restructuring the project and
fixing its design flaws.
Security situation caused difficulties with project staffing and implementation: The
recruitment of project management staff for the PMU was difficult due to duty station
location (N'Djamena). Because of civil strife, the project was forced to suspend its
business twice, the Lake Fitri pilot project in Chad was not be completed, and the Upper
Chari Basin pilot in CAR was not initiated.
Delay in approval of the Institutional Assessment (IA): LCBC, until late in the project,
failed to provide leadership in the pursuit of its restructuring. The IA was initially
approved by Technical Experts (June 2006), but did not offer a concrete action plan
towards institutional reform. The November 2006 CoM requested that LCBC
complement the IA. Little progress was made until November 2007, when a consultant
was hired to finalize the phase 2 of the IA. In March 2008, the Heads of States and
Government Summit resolved that "LCBC should carry out - within six months -
institutional reforms in order to define the most appropriate structure for the Executive
Secretariat and adequate mechanisms for institutional capacity building likely to render
the LCBC more operational." Since this statement of the Heads of States and
Government Summit, progress on the IA has improved. The IA was approved in June
2008 by the Extraordinary CoM. Moreover, the action plan implementation (supported by
GTZ) was endorsed at the last CoM held in Nigeria in May 2009.
Missed opportunity of international exposure and donor interest: The Heads of State and
Government Summit (March 2008) requested "the LCBC/GEF project partners to assist
in the preparation and organization of a donors' conference." However, the late
endorsement of the SAP (June 2008) and the delay in developing the IP caused the
Chairman of the CoM to postpone the donors' conference till after project closure.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Inadequate M&E framework design: The PAD and Prodoc did not provide a concise
Results Framework, but provided a logframe, which contained objectives, outputs, and
outcomes. At the time of project preparation result framework was not a requirement and
the logframe was the norm. Outcome indicators varied between the PAD and Prodoc,
which provided mainly lengthy lists of broadly defined output/process indicators. The
documents lacked quantified baselines and were not specific in the end-of-project
outcome/output targets since by design logframe does not contain this information. The
PSC adopted in 2005 a Results Framework, but it was never formalized. Subsequent ISRs
and annual APR/PIR reports of UNDP showed a gradually evolving set of M&E
indicators.
Monitoring of Basin status: During the CoM of March 2008, the `Protocol of Agreement
on Data Exchange between Member States of LCBC' was signed, with the objective to
exchange data on water resources for the LCB. A database will be established for
monitoring the status of the Basin from an environmental, natural resources and water
management angle, including regional basin data on: water resources (quality and
quantity), water use, land use (soil, vegetation and erosion), climate conditions and
meteorological observations, environmental aspects, navigation, and socio-economic
conditions. This regional database will be based in the LCB-Observatory at LCBC, as
proposed in the endorsed IA.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards compliance assessment: The Project was classified as Environmental
Category B due to potential impacts from the implementation of the pilot projects. Four
safeguards policies were triggered for the pilot projects: OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment, OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 4.37
Safety of Dams. During preparation, an Environmental Management Plan and
Resettlement Policy Framework were developed. The latter was developed in view of
possible redistribution of community and/or private assets for optimal resources
management. Framework Dam Safety Plans were also prepared for the Maga Dam in
Cameroon and the Tiga and Challawa George Dams in Nigeria. The project funded
Environmental Safeguards Audits (ESA) in mid 2008 for the K-Y Integrated Wetlands
Management pilot, the Waza Logone pilot, and the Lake Chad Shorelines & Northern
Diagnostic Basin pilot.
The safeguard ratings in the ESA reports varied across pilot projects, but were overall
moderately satisfactory (MS) for the OPs 4.01, 4.04 and 4.12, and Unsatisfactory (U) for
OP 4.37. The dam safety policy was triggered because it was felt that some pilot project
activities might rely on the performance of existing dams, which constituted a
reputational risk. The project did not provide financing to fund mitigation measures and
intended to convene a donor conference to solicit funding for structural and non-
structural mitigation measures. As per Annex 13 of the PAD, the Bank was expected to
receive twice yearly progress reports on the progress in addressing the risks identified at
the various dam sites. However, such reports were not received.



                                            8
Under this project no severe negative impacts arose due to the small scale and thorough
selection process of individual micro-interventions under each pilot project. The ESA
noted missed opportunities to mainstream environmental and social concerns in pilot
projects and to establish a system of screening with environmental and social checklists,
EMPs/ EAs and approval processes. This was noted with reference to the possible up-
scaling of micro- projects under future SAP funded activities, when cumulative
environmental impacts of many small-scale investments may become significant.
The ESA noted that the knowledge of safeguard documents by the project staff and other
stakeholders was very limited, and that the safeguard documents were not applied and
implemented systematically. There was no Environmental Specialist in the PMU, which
relied on the Environmental Specialist of LCBC. The pilot project operators did not
conduct baseline studies before the start of the implementation of micro-projects and did
not put in place M&E systems to assess the impacts of micro-projects. Also, there were
no references to safeguards in the LCB Micro-grants Implementation Manual.
Overall, supervision missions and the MTR report did not pay adequate attention to
safeguard issues. However, the ESA noted that strong positive feed-back was received
from K-Y community members on the process of consultation, training for the CBOs,
and the involvement of CBOs and NGOs in micro-project identification, formulation,
implementation, supervision, and conflict resolution. Communities showed strong
ownership in the implementation of micro-projects.
Financial management assessment: The financial management system for the project was
based on UNOPS' ATLAS system, and all payments for the project were processed
through UNOPS and the project's Imprest Account at the PMU. Neither supervision
missions nor audit reports revealed critical issues. The MTR reported that flow of funds
through UNDP's country offices to pilot project activities (micro-grants) was not
satisfactory. ISRs rated the financial management performance as moderately satisfactory.
UNOPS failed to regularly provide the mandatory annual audit reports, which for the
years 2005 ­ 2007 were only submitted in October 2008.
Lack of fiduciary capacity in LCBC: LCBC generally failed to adhere to the legal
agreement, as it did not timely provide the annual audit reports for the Executive
Secretariat. Therefore, it was agreed at the tri-partite review (May 2006) that the project
would hire a FM consultant to assist LCBC in developing an Action Plan for Fiduciary
Capacity Building and conduct training for representatives of the member countries. This
support was expected to enhance sustainability of project efforts, increase accountability
of LCBC and enhance the trust of donors in LCBC. Unfortunately, this consultancy
performed poorly and was of little use to the LCBC.
Procurement assessment: The Bank's standard bidding documents were adjusted to
UNOPS' internal requirements and procurement clauses in the Grant Agreement were
amended to support the procurement needs of the pilot projects. The task team provided
intense procurement support to the PMU, and most of the procurement activities were
successfully completed by December 2006, albeit with large delays. Procurement was
rated satisfactory in all ISRs. The MTR Procurement review identified a weakness in the
filing of procurement documents and observed undue delays in procurements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The project had marginal success in putting in place a conducive and enabling
environment that would ensure the long-term, environmentally sustainable development
of the basin's transboundary land and water resources. At project closing in December
20, 2008, the biggest foreseen threats to sustainability of achieved results were the
Project's failure to implement the IA of LCBC. As of May7-8, 2009, the CoM endorsed
IA's action plan, which was elaborated with GTZ support. This decision of the last CoM
provides positive signs that the IA is still being pursued. LCBC's current weak financial
position, delay in recruiting technical staff and (past) inadequate management still pose
threats to the sustainability of the project outputs. There is still a risk that the envisaged
long-term objectives of the project may not be achieved.
To increase the likelihood of achieved results being sustainable, the task team ensured
that key milestones of the project, the TDA/SAP and the Institutional Assessment, were
endorsed by an Extraordinary COM in June 2008. The Bank initiated in FY06 the
coordination and communication with other development partners, such as
representatives of the AfDB, the EU, GTZ and AFD (France). LCBC is seeking to secure
additional funding for the implementation of priority actions identified in the SAP, and a
donor conference is now envisaged to take place later in 2009. The Investment Plan (IP)
has yet to be prepared and endorsed by the member countries. Meanwhile, the following
ensuing donor support provides a marginal sustainability scenario:
   The approximately US$ 45 million (UC 30 million) AfDB funded Lake Chad Basin
   Sustainable Development Program (PRODEBALT; 2009 - 2014) was approved in
   December 2008 and is designed to implement part of the SAP. PRODEBALT was
   conceived in response to the observed reduction of flows and water quality, the loss
   of bio-diversity, and the erosion and siltation, which affect Lake Chad and its Basin.
   The program is coherent with the SAP and LCBC's Vision 2025 for sustainable
   development of the Basin and is designed to reverse land and water degradation
   trends in the Basin The project appraisal document for PRODEBALT suggests the
   following co-financing (other than contributions of member countries):
   EU funding of about Euro 5 million for local development activities, water resources
   studies and upgrading of the Basin's hydro-meteorological monitoring systems;
   GTZ funding of US$2 million for implementation of the Institutional Assessment;
   and
   BGR funding of US$3 million for the monitoring and assessment of groundwater
   resources.
The potential catalytic function of this GEF project is well demonstrated by the success
of the Komadugu-Yobe pilot project in Nigeria. This pilot project supported ongoing
activities (JWL and IUCN-NCF projects) regarding the adoption of a Water Charter for
the K-Y catchment by the six riparian states and the Federal Government of Nigeria,



                                             10
which resulted in the creation of a US$13 million Trust Fund for the financing of the K-Y
Catchment Management Plan.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project and its objective remain relevant to sectoral strategies of the member
governments, LCBC, the World Bank and UNDP, as well as to the strategic objectives of
the GEF.
Regional and national priorities: Niger (2008) and Nigeria (2004) developed new PRSPs
since the project became effective. The project objective remains relevant to priorities of
the PRSPs of the member countries, including rural development strategies with the rural
sector as engine of economic growth, the sustainable management of water and other
natural resources, the protection of the environment and reduction of environmental
degradation. The project also responded to objectives declared by NEPAD (Agriculture
and Environment programs) and the MDGs, as well as to LCBC's Vision 2025 (2003)2.
CAS: The Bank generally supports rural development and regional integration in the
LCBC member countries. The Project and its envisaged follow-up (AfDB-funded
PRODEBALT and SAP implementation) contribute to CAS objectives by contributions
to rural livelihoods in the Basin through increased income opportunities for the poor,
improved community-based natural resource management, and a reversal of land and
water degradation trends in the Basin.
GEF priorities: The project is fully consistent with the updated strategic priorities for
GEF-IW projects under GEF-4. It specifically fits with the Strategic Program #3 on
"Balancing overuse and conflicting uses of water resources in surface and groundwater
basins that are of transboundary nature." The following expected outcomes of SP # 3 are
most relevant to the project:
    Political and legal commitments made to utilize IWRM policies towards sustainable
    water use;
    Institutions and reforms introduced to catalyze implementation of policies for basin-
    scale IWRM and increased water use efficiency;
    Communities benefit from access to water-related benefits in tests of innovative
    demonstrations of balancing water uses.




2
  Vision summary: Land, water and all natural resources are conserved, sustainably exploited, managed in an
integrated manner and shared equitably, in order to not only eradicate poverty and improve living standards of the
people living in the Lake Chad Basin, but also to ensure peace, security, cooperation and sound economic
developments of the region'




                                                          11
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
The major expected outputs of the current phase of the project were to: (i) efficiently
carry out a successful TDA/SAP process, (ii) derive lessons learned from pilot projects,
(iii) assess the legislative and institutional frameworks of the member countries, (iii)
enhance LCBC's institutional capacity, (iv) develop a stakeholder Analysis, (v) develop a
transboundary strategy for a functional network of protected areas, and (vi) generate full
commitment of member countries and strong donor support for implementing the
Strategic Action Program (SAP).
The achievement of the GEO in terms of `building capacity within LCBC for better
achieving its mandate of sustainably managing land and water resources' is rated
moderately unsatisfactory, despite various commendable project outputs achieved under
difficult operational conditions. Some key opportunities were missed, including: (i) the
project was not able to support the implementation of the LCBC's reform due to the late
endorsement of the IA; (ii) the Investment Plan (IP) of the SAP could not be completed
due to late endorsement of the SAP; and (iii) as a consequence, the Chairman of the CoM
postponed the donors' conference.
The above deficiencies are primarily due to three key root causes, namely (i) lack of
commitment of the member countries to LCBC until the last year of the project, (ii)
LCBC's lack of ownership of the project until the last year of the project, and (iii) an
understaffed PMU. The moderately unsatisfactory project performance is unquestionably
also associated with the difficult security and logistic circumstances under which the
project had to operate.
The project partially achieved its GEO and key achievements include:
    a) The Institutional Assessment of LCBC was completed and endorsed by the
CoM in June 2008. Also as of March 2008, the Heads of States and Government
Summit resolved that "LCBC should carry out- within six months ­ institutional
reforms in order to define the most appropriate structure for the Executive Secretariat
and adequate mechanisms for institutional capacity building likely to render the LCBC
more operational". The IA report contains 34 recommendations aimed at reforming
LCBC into a reinvigorated, product-oriented institution. These recommendations call
inter alia for the preparation of a Biennial State of the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem
Report and the establishment of: (i) a regionally-based data and information system - the
Lake Chad Basin Observatory - as part of LCBC's capacity to undertake a systematic
monitoring role for the natural resources of the basin; (ii) a Water Resources Experts
Committee (WRC) comprised of senior level water resources specialists from the
Member States; (iii) an Environment, Science and Planning Committee (ESPC) to
provide needed scientific capacity to the LCBC; (iv) a Donor Consultative Committee
(DCC) to facilitate continued donor involvement and investment in the work of the
LCBC, and (v) a Staff Development Fund providing professional development
opportunities for recruiting and retaining high quality staff. The IA also recommends
upgrading and strengthening the fiduciary capacities of LCBC and improving its overall
accountability to Member States and other contributors. Due to the late endorsement of
the IA (June 2008), the project was not in a position to support the implementation of
these reforms of LCBC. It should be noted, however, that the GTZ is currently supporting


                                           12
the LCBC in the implementation of these reforms. GTZ supported LCBC in elaborating
an action plan for the implementation of the IA. This action plan was endorsed during the
last CoM held in Nigeria on May7-8, 2009.
    b) Progress was made towards the harmonization of relevant legal frameworks,
regulations and approaches in the member countries for the integrated and
transboundary management of the shared land and water resources of the Lake
Chad Basin. Comprehensive national and regional diagnostic reports on legal,
institutional, economic and financial aspects of the transboundary management of shared
land and water resources of the Basin have been prepared. These reports complement the
development and implementation of the SAP. Recommendations focused on: (i) creating
transboundary IWRM Committees; (ii) harmonizing and completing the national legal
frameworks through an integrated approach regarding the various uses of water, land and
the environment; (iii) creating of the LCB Observatory to monitor water resources,
environmental, economic, socio-economic and other aspects relevant to an
implementation of IWRM; and (iv) capacity building to promote IWRM. Though
national legal and institutional frameworks are yet to be harmonized, each Member State
has committed to ensure that its body of laws and regulations will be coordinated and
supportive of environmental policies developed through the NAP/SAP process. The
NAPs, the main foundation of the SAP, were prepared based on an assessment of national
priority areas of concern, including regional concerns identified in the TDA. Each
country has developed objectives and targets, proposed interventions and elaborated a
resource mobilization strategy to address their objectives.
    c) A comprehensive Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) was completed
at national and regional levels. The TDA analysis was conducted through a
participatory process and presents the transboundary problems as identified and
prioritised by the basin stakeholders. The TDA identifies three overarching root causes of
the transboundary problems caused by unsustainable resources use practices, i.e. (i) the
absence of sustainable development on the political agendas of the riparian countries, (ii)
low standards of environmental education and awareness, and (iii) population pressure.
The regional TDA identified seven priority regional environmental concerns, as follows:
(i) the variability of the hydrological regime and fresh water availability, (ii) water
pollution, (iii) decreased viability of biological resources, (iv) the loss of biodiversity, (v)
the loss and modification of ecosystems, (vi) sedimentation in rivers and water bodies,
and (vii) the presence of invasive species. The TDA highlights the need to pay special
attention to institutional reform of LCBC as the bedrock for arresting the degradation
trends in the Basin. LCBC lacks the power to arbitrate water conflicts in the basin. It also
has no mechanism for fostering basin level IWRM by way of getting the line agencies of
the member countries to harmonize their water resources development programs.
   d) Based on the findings of the TDA, a Strategic Action Program (SAP) was
completed as a regional policy framework for the Lake Chad Basin. The SAP was
developed in a regional consultation process and endorsed by the Extraordinary COM in
June 2008. This result is commendable as few Basins in Africa have been able to
complete a SAP in five years. The SAP primarily addresses the seven priority regional
environmental concerns as identified in the TDA, lays down the principles of
environmental management and cooperation, and establishes a long-term vision for the


                                              13
sustainable development of the Lake Chad Basin. It subsequently defines a set of targets
and interventions to meet regionally agreed Ecosystem Quality and Water Resource
Objectives (EQWRO) and related indicators for the priority areas of environmental
concern, in the transboundary context of the Lake Chad Basin. These EQWROs are: (i)
improved quantity and quality of water; (ii) restoration, conservation and sustainable use
of bio-resources; (iii) conservation of biodiversity; (iv) restoration and preservation of
ecosystems; (v) strengthened participation and capacity of stakeholders, and (vi)
institutional and legal frameworks for environmental stewardship of the LCB.
The overall objective of the SAP is to contribute to poverty alleviation in the Basin
through priority actions, including (i) initiating shared management of the Basin's water
resources, (ii) implementing a basin-wide sustainable data collection system (the LCB
Observatory), (iii) taking sectoral actions for enhanced water demand management, (iv)
fighting against desertification and against the loss of bio-diversity, (v) preventing and
controlling pollution, and (vi) improving exploitation methods of aquatic ecosystems.
The Project did not prepare the Action Plan for the SAP implementation. Missing
components include (i) estimated costs to achieve the identified EQWROs, (ii) an
Investment Plan, and (iii) a strategy and financing mechanism. Although the envisaged
donor conference could not yet be held, initial SAP implementation will to an extent be
supported by the AfDB-funded LCB Sustainable Development Program (PRODEBALT).
    e) In addition, the micro-grants and pilot demonstration programs yielded
some successes and impacts on the ground. Catchment Management Plans (CMP) for
integrated natural resources management were prepared and adopted for the Chari-
Logone Basin, Lake Fitri and the Lake Chad Shorelines & Northern Diagnostic Basin.
The CMP for the Komadugu-Yobe (K-Y) Basin was developed jointly with the K-Y
Basin Project (IUCN-NCF) and the Joint Wetlands Livelihoods Project (DFID-funding).
The cooperation with these projects yielded a significant success in establishing a Water
Charter for the Sustainable and Equitable Management of the K-Y Basin. This Charter
represents a legal and institutional framework for cooperative management of the shared
water resources of the Basin by six riparian states in Nigeria. The riparian States and
Federal Government of Nigeria established a US$13 million Trust Fund to finance the
KYB - CMP. The CMPs proposed action plans targeted to resolve identified water
problems and challenges and institute integrated natural resources management
instruments in the regions. The Upper Chari and Lake Fitri pilots were terminated due to
security conditions.
Local priorities were supported with 56 micro-grants to demonstrate environmentally
sustainable approaches to reverse land and water degradation, as a basis for poverty
alleviation. Local beneficiaries have been consulted and encouraged to participate in
basin resource management. Local stakeholders have thus developed a certain
environmental awareness that could benefit long-term integrated basin resources
management. Implementation progress and efficiency were hampered by problems with
the transfer of micro-grants to beneficiaries. A Bio-diversity Study was also completed
and a Regional Protected Area Strategy was approved by stakeholders and adopted by the
countries.




                                           14
3.3 Efficiency
Consistent with GEF requirements, Annex 4 of the PAD included an Incremental Cost
Analysis, which found that the project was composed of activities necessary to improve
transboundary water resources management. The support from the GEF was specifically
targeted at covering the transaction and other costs of cooperation between the LCB
riparian countries. Due to the transboundary nature of the issues and the public goods
aspect of the environmental benefits, it is unlikely that beneficiary countries would or
could have financed these activities. Therefore, the costs were almost certainly
incremental, but the project achieved its GEO only partially within the estimated
incremental costs.

Because this was a stand-alone GEF project, additional economic analysis was not
required. Component 5 of the project in the K-Y pilot project contributed to the creation
in Nigeria of a US$ 13 million Trust fund to finance the KYB ­ CMP. Component 6 of
the project contributed towards catalyzing an additional $45 million of future investments
in the sustainable development of the LCB through the AfDB-funded PRODEBALT
project.
Despite the project's contribution to leveraging additional funding, a number of factors
doomed the operation to be inefficient in achieving its objective. These factors were:
prevailing security conditions in the region, time consuming land based transport, limited
services of airlines, non-availability of up-to-date logistical and technical facilities in
N'Djamena, and high costs of workshops. This inherent inefficiency of the project was
exacerbated by large initial implementation delays, the light structure of the PMU,
difficulties in the flow of funds, less than expected contributions of LCBC staff to project
implementation, significant project management issues, and delays in recruiting
consultants and in procuring essential equipment and vehicles. A two-year extension of
the project was insufficient to achieve the overly ambitious project outputs.
Overall, although the project helped to leverage additional funding in the Basin, the cost
of doing business in the region is prohibitively expensive causing the implementation of
the project to be inefficient3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Despite the continuing high relevance of its GEO, the overall outcome of the project is
rated moderately unsatisfactory because (i) the project partially achieved its main
development objective, (ii) key project outputs were insufficiently achieved, (iii) the
project implementation was inefficient, and (iv) sustainability of the project outcome,
although showing promise, is not ensured.


3
  A classic economic analysis is not applicable as this was a regional GEF grant and not an investment
project.


                                                    15
It is noted that with a few exceptions, UNDP's annual APR/PIR reports rated the project
performance consistently as satisfactory, while the Bank's ISR ratings were most of the
time in the unsatisfactory range. The independent final review of the Project rated the
overall outcome moderately satisfactory based on a consideration of the project
achievements, project outputs, project effectiveness, and of the context in which the
project was implemented (see Section 3.2). Given the overly ambitious objective in the
PAD and lack of any baseline or target, the rating of the overall outcome of the project
reflects the proverbial "half-full versus half-empty cup". The last CoM (May 7-8, 2009)
endorsed implementation of the IA and nominated a new ES, providing stakeholders
some assurance on the sustainability of the project's achievements.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Some pilot projects included direct income generating activities and focus on women's
groups. Pilot projects generally improved flooding and desertification conditions in
specific areas. The pilot projects contributed as such to the restoration of income of local
stakeholders, which proved to be an important incentive for stakeholder motivation.
Public participation drives helped to involve as many beneficiaries as possible and
opened up the decision-making process to a broader range of local stakeholders.
Quantitative data on these aspects are not available.


(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening
Although the project did not achieve its objective regarding institutional reform and
capacity building in LCBC, it did achieve some improvement of the institutional
framework for Basin management, including:
      At national level, the project strengthened on-the-job the capacity of staff of key
      institutions responsible for land and water management with potential transboundary
      impacts;
      At local level, the project actively involved communities in the participatory
      management of wetlands and protected areas, and in the equitable sharing of the
      benefits deriving from such management through the set-up and support of CBOs;
      Overall, the project broadened LCBC's traditional sectoral role towards a more
      integrated approach to transboundary basin resources management, by adopting
      principles of environmental sustainability and encouraging participation from multi-
      level stakeholders.
(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
The protection of almost 100% of the lakefront of Lake Chad as Ramsar wetlands sites of
international importance was a great achievement of this project. This is one of the few
examples of fully transboundary lakefront in terms of Ramsar jurisdiction.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No survey was held.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
The risk to the Development Outcome of this operation is conservatively rated as
substantial. Generally, LCBC's weak financial position, the lack of performance
incentives for its staff and its past weak management pose a continuing threat to the
sustainability of the project outcome. It is uncertain when the Investment Plan of the SAP
will be completed, when the envisaged donor conference will be held, and to what extent
donors will be willing to support the SAP implementation. Factors in favor of the
sustainability of project interventions are the recently approved AfDB-funded
PRODEBALT program for SAP implementation, the CoM endorsement of the
implementation of the AI, and the nomination at the CoM of a new Executive Secretary
in May 7-8, 2009 (who assumed office on May 18th, 2009). Although these factors
presage potential improvements in sustainability risks and breakthroughs occurred in the
last year of the project, the rating is kept as Substantial.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a)        Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Whereas the project was aligned with the CAS in all countries and the GEF-IW strategy
and OP 9 guidelines, the PAD did not provide a clear description of the project and its
anticipated activities. The QSA6 panel (August 2004) noted weaknesses, as described in
section 2.1. The design also neither addressed the unsatisfactory level of commitment to
LCBC of the member countries nor designed to help countries to take ownership of the
project. It was further perceived that LCBC's weak management and fiduciary capacity
needed to be compensated by requesting LCBC to contract a project management service
(UNOPS). This approach resulted in lack of incentive for LCBC to be accountable. The
logframe and M&E arrangements for the project were inadequate and the time schedule
for completion of the major activities was not realistic.
(b)        Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Bank team has seen four TTLs. Following effectiveness, supervision intensified to
quarterly supervision. The project, at risk of cancellation in 2005, moved out of problem
status by May 2006. The project slipped back into problem status in 2007. Based on ISRs,
it appears that supervision was of unequal quality during the project's lifetime. The


                                             17
supervision of fiduciary aspects was moderately satisfactory (see Section 2.4). Most
procurement actions were completed in FY06. The quality and candor of ISRs and the
reporting on outcome indicators was generally adequate. Overall, the project was handled
by the Bank as a small operation, and the supervision budgets were inadequate. The
budget was not commensurate with the fact that the project was covering five large
countries in a complex region, with problems of civil unrest requiring intensive
supervision.


The Bank's supervision was generally coordinated with the UNDP as co- implementing
agency, which assigns the responsibility for regular supervision to its local offices in the
member states.
(c)        Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Despite frequent and good quality supervision      during part of the project period, the
project could not overcome its basic design        flaws and did not achieve its main
development objective. The project's overly         ambitious objectives and failure to
restructure guaranteed the final MU rating. The    overall Bank performance is thus rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) (Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The governments of the member countries demonstrated till late in the project an
unsatisfactory level of commitment to LCBC and to achieving the development
objectives of the project. The CoM lacked actions regarding inadequate management of
LCBC. The amount of arrears in the LCBC is of concern (ref. Section 2.2), although the
situations of arrears in contributions also exist to a certain extent in other transboundary
Basins in Africa. Chad reportedly paid its total arrears to LCBC in 2008. As a
consequence, the project faced serious issues regarding counterpart staffing and funding.
Although the CoM endorsed the IA in June 2008, this shows a late commitment of the
member countries, which demanded in 2002 the institutional reform of LCBC's
Secretariat.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
LCBC's performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory for its lack of ownership of the
Project and its ineffectiveness in supporting the PMU in achieving the Project's outputs.
Until the last year of the project, the Secretariat did not lead the process of its IA or use
available resources for addressing its own institutional challenges. It is worth noting that
in 2008 two CoMs and a Heads of States Summit were organized by the LCBC, despite
recent civil strife affecting the operations at the LCBC Headquarter in N'Djamena.
LCBC failed to provide its annual audit reports in compliance with the Grant Agreement.



                                             18
The performance of UNOPS/PMU in managing the implementation of the Bank's part of
the project is also rated moderately unsatisfactory. It is, however, recognized that the
project suffered from having to operate under extremely difficult operational conditions
and lack of support from LCBC. The PMU was understaffed and project management
suffered from repeated changes of the Project Manager (PM). The time required to
establish the PMU, procure project vehicles, establish project offices in the member
countries and procure various consultancy contracts was very long. Consequently, the
project took more than two years from the start of the UNDP component (August 2003)
to achieve some momentum. When the PM resigned in July 2007, the project was
managed by UNOPS from Denmark. UNOPS provided intermittent quarterly progress
reports and financial reports, but the mandatory annual audit reports were provided only
shortly before project closure.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (See paragraphs (a) and (b) above).



6. Lessons Learned
The following lessons can be drawn from the final evaluation of this project:
In complex regional projects, it may be more difficult for the
implementation/supervision process to fix design flaws. To increase the likelihood of
achieving project objectives, design flaws need to be fixed early in project
implementation, at minimum during the MTR. The QSA6 identified significant
design flaws (see section 2.1). For example, the institutional setting included a light-
weighted PMU -- which included only a PM and a DAF-- that was not mainstreamed in
LCBC. The project relied on LCBC's domain expertise, while the availability of such
expertise was not sufficiently considered and guaranteed. The PMU did not report to
LCBC and was not mainstreamed in LCBC. The team did not restructure the project on
the ground that intensive supervision would address identified design flaws. The MU
rating of this project is evidence that supervision does not fix design flaws. Restructuring
is the avenue to fix design flaws and should be conducted at an early stage, at minimum
during the MTR. Hence, it is critical that the MTR conduct a critical assessment of the
likelihood of achieving outcomes, rather than checking a list of outputs achieved.
The full endorsement and commitment of all the riparian countries of a shared
Basin is desirable for successful GEF-IW project implementation, but not necessary
if adequate action plans are incorporated in the project design. Country
management units' and country offices' increased involvement in project
supervision is critical for the regional projects' success. Having the full commitment
of all the countries of a shared basin is unlikely and should not be a pre-requisite to get
involved in a regional project. Lack of commitment of member countries to their regional
institution and ownership of the project by the regional institution need to be assessed
carefully, and an action plan incorporated in project design. For example, the lack of
commitment of the member countries to LCBC has resulted over time in large arrears in
the national contributions to LCBC, which at the end of 2007 stood at 3.4 billion FCFA


                                            19
or about US$ 6.6 million. LCBC's lack of ownership (until late in the project) contributed
to the delay in achieving results (e.g. endorsement of the IA). Hence, the project design
should include an adequate action plan to foster commitment and endorsement of all the
member countries. The countries' compliance with regional commitments could also be
part of the CMUs' policy dialogue.
In the absence of a strong regional institution, development assistance should focus
on capacity building and institutional strengthening of the Recipient, rather than
attempting to resolve or bypass the institution's shortcomings by introducing
outside agencies for project management and execution. In case of the Lake Chad
Basin GEF project, the employment of UNOPS as Executing Agency (EA) for the UNDP
components and Management Services Provider (MSP) for the Bank components
diminished the interest of LCBC's management in the project.
It is critical that strategic decisions are made at the right management level. The
team made the decision to not restructure the project (see section 2.2). This strategic
decision of whether to formally or informally restructure the project should have involved
senior management of the sector unit, regional integration unit, and country management
units.
Joint project implementation through two GEF implementation agencies (i.e. World
Bank and UNDP) requires that roles and responsibilities during project
implementation are agreed upon in advance. Key reporting and supervision
processes need to be harmonized. Different procedures and reporting requirements for
UNDP and the Bank place an additional burden on project implementation. The
difference in UNOPS' roles as EA and MSP caused from time to time confusion
regarding its decision-making authority. For example, certain decisions (e.g. changes in
components) that could be made at the UNOPS/PMU level for the UNDP components
required prior approval from the Bank for Bank components. Although joint WB/UNDP
missions were occasionally conducted to improve cost-efficiency and communication
between all partners, the overall project implementation and supervision might have been
more effective and cost efficient with a single GEF implementing agency.
The Bank should be realistic regarding project implementation planning, the time it
takes to complete a project of this challenging nature, and the outcome targets to be
achieved. There is a need for realism in operations challenged by Recipients' low
capacity and unclear commitment, multiple players, and difficult operational conditions.
Project design should take into account the implementation capacity of the Borrower, and
the potential technical and logistic problems with project implementation particularly in a
region with frequent civil strife and severe limitations in its operational conditions. One
or two years of delay in project implementation are frequent in this kind of projects.
Project documents have no provision to compensate delays and don't include them
among the project risks. Standard Bank budgets for supervision of relatively small
regional GEF operations in this and similar regions are inadequate.

Preface
The preparation for the project "Reversal of Land and Water Degradation Trends in the
Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem" were initiated by the need to hold a donor conference to
financed the 1992 LCBC's "Master Plan for the Development and Environmentally
Sound Management of the Natural Resources of the Lake Chad Conventional Basin". A
number of resolutions of the LCBC's Council of Ministers that reflected this wish
include Resolution N°2 of the 43rd Session held in Garoua, 13th-14th March 1995,
Resolution N°5 of the 44th Session held in N'djamena, 26-28 October 1996, Resolution
N°9 of the 46th session held in Niamey, 25-26 January, 1999, and the Resolution N°3 of
the 48th Session held in Bangui 27-28 March 2001.
The preparation and the consultative process engaging all basin stakeholders that
culminated in the project document took 9 years to mature.
The project eventually commenced with the first Project Steering Committee Meeting
held at Abuja on the 24th-25th June, 2004. As a signed of good fortune for the outputs of
the project, some of the actors present at the 1st PSC meeting have now move ahead to
higher positions of authority. The pioneer Project Manager Mr. Anada Tiega is now the
Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention, a pioneer member of the PSC from
Cameroon, Mr Yaouba Abdoulaye is now the Junior Minister of Planning and Territorial
Administration in the Republic of Cameroon. In Nigeria one of the pioneer PSC members
Engr. I. K. Musa is now the pioneer Director General of the Nigeria Integrated Water
Resources Management Agency, an agency in the forefront of reforms in the
management of land and water resources in Nigeria. A key member of the TDA and SAP
team from Nigeria and also a co-author of the TDA document is now the Administrative
Secretary of the HJKB Trust Fund in Nigeria. It is the hope of the LCBC, that these
eminent personalities will continue to provide their wise contribution so that the long
term objectives of the project articulated in the SAP will eventually be realized.
There were difficulties in the implementation of the project but I am glad to state that the
LCBC has never been in a better position to lead the Member States in the reversal of
land and water degradation trends in the Lake Chad Basin ecosystems. The LCBC is
today in possession of 5 country prepared National Action Plans, a 25-year regional
vision and Strategic Action Programme, Wetland level management plans for the Waza -
Logone and the Komadugu - Yobe basins and the Lake Chad and Lake Fitri management
plans. In addition, the capacity of an estimated 800 experts and stakeholders equipped
with the latest knowledge and tools for sustainable environmental management and an
action plan for a new focused LCBC is now available in the basin.
The LCBC wish to proffer its sincere appreciation of support to the GEF, WB, UNDP
and the executing agency UNOPS. We also would like thank the government of Chad,
Cameroun, RCA, Niger and Nigeria for providing the counterpart contribution during the
execution of the project. We would also like to thank our co-funding partners GTZ, BGR
and the EU and hope that we would continue to get their support as we transition to the
implementation of the Lake Chad Basin Strategic Action Programme.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND START UP

The long-term objective of the GEF project "Reversal of Land and Water Degradation
Trends in the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem" is to achieve global environmental benefits
through concerted management of the naturally integrated land and water resources of the
Lake Chad Basin. The specific purpose of the project is to overcome barriers to the
concerted management of the basin through well-orchestrated and enhanced collaboration
and capacity building among riparians and stakeholders.
The project is built upon the result of an earlier study conducted by the Member States of
the Lake Chad Basin Commission. The project "The Diagnostic Study of Environmental
Degradation in the Lake Chad Basin" had identified trans-boundary issues and had
drawn up an LCBC Strategic Master Plan.
The LCBC GEF Project was therefore designed to complete a Trans-boundary Diagnostic
Analysis (TDA) that will lead to the formulation of a GEF Strategic Action Programme
(SAP). The SAP will include necessary baseline and additional actions to address the
priority trans-boundary issues and provide an essential monitoring and evaluation tool for
implementation. The project will also lead to the development and testing of set of
institutional mechanisms and implementation methodologies, including pilot
demonstrations, that explicitly link regional, national and local initiatives in land and
water management. In addition, the project will institute a basin-wide framework in
which trans-boundary priorities can be addressed and project interventions monitored.
The project implementation commenced in September 2003 with the assumption of duty
of the Project Manager but became effective in January 2004. Project launch and the first
Project Steering Committee(PSC) meeting was held in Abuja in August 2004.
                                                
II. PROJECT DESIGN, EXECUTION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND IMPACT

2-1 Evaluation of Project Design
The project document has clearly defined the objectives of the project. Long-term
objectives has been separated with the immediate project's objectives. The link between
the immediate project objectives and the long-term goals was also similarly defined. The
long-term objective of the project is a combination of LCBC Member State's Vision,
earlier consultations that led to the development of the LCB Strategic Action Plan
together with the vision of Africa Integrated Land and Water Initiative of the GEF
implementing agencies.
The project's long-term objective can be summarized as follows;
     To achieve global benefits through broad, basin wide participation in the
        development and implementation of measures that ensure that the integrity of the
        Lake Chad system is protected by concerted, integrated management of the
        basin's resources by the orchestration of both national and regional activities
        through a working system of basin governance.

The Project's specific objectives are;
   1. To overcome barriers to the concerted management of the basin through enhanced
       collaboration and capacity building among riparians and stakeholders.



                                           38
   2. To complete a TDA and prepare a descriptive framework for the concerted water
      management across the basin.

   3. To prepare a GEF SAP for long term implementation of priority actions to
      address trans-boundary issues.

Output and Activities
The project design identified six principal outputs of the projects. The outputs were
clearly defined and were adequate in establishing the mechanism for future basin

2-2 Main results obtained in each project component

COMPONENT 1 : An institutional and management system established and operational
for the Project
Activities under this component were funded through the UNDP.
All activities in Component 1 of the project were successfully executed. There were
initial delays in project implementation. Notably, the appointment and resignation of a
new C.T.A. affected the smooth take-off of project activities. In the RCA, there was a
delay in the setting-up of the National Coordination Unit due to the delay in the
resolution of the conflict over the appointment of the lead national focal point for the
project by the RCA government.
Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committees were established in the Member States and
have been the medium of providing input for policy decisions on the Lake Chad basin in
each Member State.
Overall, the capacity of 800 estimated experts and local stakeholders have been
strengthened through the implementation of project activities in the Lake Chad basin.
The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 1.
Strengths
         1. Setting-up project management structures (PMU, NCU, PSC)
         2. Setting-up of the IMC and the funding of their operation
         3. Contributions of offices and equipment from some LCBC Member States
Weakness
         1. Insufficient technical personnel in the PMU
         2. Initial instability in the project management
         3. Delay in the release of funds
         4. Delay in the installation of the means of communication(Internet)



                                          42
       5. Difficulty in acquiring project office in some countries
       6. Non-respect of commitments by Member States
       7. Delays in the deployment of logistics

COMPONENT 2: Enhanced regional policy initiatives and institutional mechanisms to
address transboundary issues during and beyond the life of the project
Activities under this component were funded through the WB.
All activities under component 2 were successfully executed. LCBC restructuring Plan
has been validated by the Council of Ministers and an action plan is in the progress of
implementation by the GTZ and LCBC. The GTZ has appointed a year ­long adviser
located in the LCBC headquarters for this purpose.
LCBC Financial audit designed to provide advise for sound financial management and
strengthening fiduciary capacity was completed for the period 2005 - 2007.
The National Action Plan for each of the LCBC Member States in accordance with the
principles of Integrated Water Resources Management have been developed. The study
on Institutional/Legal and economic/financial framework in each of the LCBC Member
State has been completed and recommendations for regional harmonization has been
provided. In Nigeria, reform implementation has been initiated by the discussion in the
National Assembly of 3 bills. The bills are for establishing the National Water
Development Commission, the National Integrated Water Resources Management
Agency and the bill for restructuring the existing River Basin Development Authorities to
be in line with the ecosystem approach.
The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 2.
Strengths
        1. Draft and approval of the institutional Audit
        2. Regional implementation of IWRM practices
        3. Satisfactory financial audit of the LCBC
        4. Completion of national and regional studies for the promotion of IWRM
        5. Training of experts, decision makers and members of parliament in the
            implementation of IWRM
        6. Use of national experts in conducting the IWRM study
        7. Facilitation and use of common tools and methodologies in the IWRM studies
Weakness
        1. Difficulty in conducting the Institutional Audit
        2. Lack of means to implement the IWRM studies at the local level

COMPONENT 3. Strengthened engagement of stakeholders
Activities under this component were funded through the UNDP.
The project identified and mobilized the key stakeholders and launched the local
initiative projects in 4 out of the 5 LCBC Member States. It was not possible to launch
the local initiatives in the RCA because of the persistent insecurity in the country's
portion of the Lake Chad basin. Fifteen micro-grants projects aimed at getting
stakeholder participation were collectively identified, funded and executed in the Lake

Chad basin. Three are located in Nigeria, three in Cameroon, four in Niger and five in
Chad.
The Hadejia ­ Jama'are Komadugu-Yobe Stakeholder Consultative forum a stakeholder
forum for the Komadugu-Yobe has been established and is functioning in the basin.
In the total of six activities in this component, one could not be initiated due to the lost of
time experienced at the beginning of project implementation. The activity that could not
be initiated is;
    (I) Development of regional methodology for involvement in regional
             Environmental Impact Assessment.

This activity being very vital to successful environmental management has been included
into the SAP.
One activity remains to be completed;
    (I) Selection of most successful local initiative projects for inclusion in the
            Investment Plan.


The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 3.
Strengths
       1. Existence of the Stakeholders analysis reports
       2. Project financing of local initiatives through the provision of small grant funds
       3. Active participation of basic communities in the identification of projects,
          provision of matching grant and implementation of local initiatives
Weakness
       1. Insufficiency of follow-up and monitoring of the pilot projects


COMPONENT 4. A completed TDA and a synthetic framework for concerted
management of the basin
Activities under this component were funded through the UNDP.
The TDA has been completed and has identified seven priority trans-boundary problems.
The TDA and the gap analysis form the basis for developing the Lake Chad Basin SAP.
Key environmental indicators have been identified and forms part of the SAP document.
Environmental and social risks have been identified and were communicated to the pilot
demonstration teams and other stakeholders at the local levels.
Two out of the six activities under this component are receiving attention through
complementary funding provided by the BMZ (German Federal Ministry of Economic
Cooperation and Development) and the European Union. GTZ is providing assistance for
surface water in Activity 4.1 and 4.2. while BGR is executing groundwater studies. The
status of the activities are as follows;

   4. Training of LCBC and national experts in the application of the new data base
       system has been completed
   5. A system for the cartographical presentation (GIS) of IWRM information is
       operational on LCBC computers
   6. A methodology for the detection of surface water changes from remote sensing
       data has been developed for the satellite images procured by the LCBC GEF
       Project.
   7. Procurement of IT hardware and software undertaken in 2006.
   8. A study on the current situation and future requirements for the knowledge
       management system of LCBC has been completed in July 2007
   9. The recommendations from the assessment of LCBC's knowledge management,
       including the upgrading of the documentation department has been completed.
   10. Data collection on water resources, water demands and water management
       infrastructure (existing and planned) has been completed.
   11. Historic hydrological information has been published on the MapServer
       (http://www.wr-man.net/lcbc/) and is available to the interested public.
   12. The delineation of drainage network and sub-catchment boundaries has been
       carried out using up-to-date remote sensing data.

       hydraulic depressions. Subsequently groundwater flow direction has been
       determined.
   15. Groundwater contour lines for the Lower Pliocene and the Continental Terminal
       aquifer of the Lake Chad basin and groundwater flow direction were determined.
   16. Localisation, sampling and measurement of static water level in 136 water points
       to update the database and the determination of water quality was carried out in
       2008.

The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 4.
Strengths
       1. Completion and validation of the Lake Chad basin TDA
       2. Full contribution of IMC to the formulation of the TDA




                                          45
COMPONENT 5. Creation of regional programs and initiation of demonstration
projects to test and validate methodologies, secure stakeholder involvement and develop
implementation modalities
The activities under this component were both funded through UNDP and the WB.
Pilot demonstration projects were successfully completed in the Komadougou-Yobe and
the Waza-Logone sub-basins under WB financing. Management plans have been
developed and validated by the stakeholders in the Komadougou-Yobe and the Waza-
Logone. In the Komadougou-Yobe basin, a Water Charter has been negotiated among
the riparians States in Nigeria and a trust fund has been established in addition. Eight
micro-grants projects were executed by the local communities in the Komadougou-Yobe
basin. In the Waza ­Logone pilot demonstration project, eight micro-grants projects
were also executed by the local communities. The Lake Fitri pilot demonstration project
also financed by the WB has produced a management plan and has been validated but
local initiatives projects could not be implemented due to insecurity in the area.
Similarly, the Lake Chad Shoreline and Northern Diagnostic Basin pilot demonstration
project has produced a management plan while 21 micro-grants projects were executed
by local communities under UNDP financing. The Upper Chari Water Course pilot
demonstration project which was supposed to be financed by the UNDP in the CAR
could not be initiated due to insecurity in the area.
The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 5.
Strengths
        1. Formulation of management plans for Waza-Logone, Komadougou-Yobe and
             the Lake Chad shoreline

Weakness
     1. Inability to formulate a management plan for the Upper Chari water course.


COMPONENT 6: GEF SAP designed and endorsed with donor support mobilized
Activities under this component were funded through the WB.
The SAP has been developed and was endorsed by the Council of Ministers. Other
activities relating to the donor conference could not be completed. The uncompleted
activities include;
    (I) Develop and implement strategy for donor support

   (II) Plan and implement donor conferences

   (III)   Strategy for SAP implementation

The PSC provided the following strengths and weakness in the implementation of
component 6.
Strengths
       1. Formulation and the adoption of the SAP

Weakness
     1. None execution of the Investment Plan.


                                          46
       2. None execution of the Donors' Conference.

2-3 Project Coordination and Management
Project management and coordination was centred in the PMU located in the
headquarters of the LCBC in Ndjamena. The PMU provided the coordination and
management structure that implemented the project activities in the member states of the
LCBC.
Problems that affected the smooth implementation of project activities are related to the
peculiar setting of the location of the PMU at Ndjamena. The host country Chad do not
have the facilities to support modern communication and therefore the project was
hampered in implementing an effective communication platform until towards the end of
the project.
During the course of project implementation, the PMU had to be relocated to Cameroon
in 2006 and 2008 due to deterioration in the security situation in Ndjamena. This
insecurity situation in Chad and the Central African Republic also affected the
implementation of pilot demonstration projects in those countries.
Another aspect affecting smooth implementation of project activities include the use of
two different implementing agencies procedures for some activities.
Overall the delays experienced in project coordination and management can be explained
by the initial change in management, lack of clarity in the application of procedures,
difficulties in communication and periods of insecurity in Ndjamena.

2.4 Project Impact on the regional agenda
The project has a great impact on the regional agenda of the Member States of the Lake
Chad Basin Commission. The project has succeeded in bringing the Member States of
the LCBC together to develop a SAP addressing the priority transboundary issues
affecting successful management of the land and water resources of the Lake Chad Basin.
Capacity of the national institutions in working together has been enhanced through the
TDA and the SAP development process. In addition the capacity of national institutions
to address local problems and developed National Action Plans to address them has
created the foundation for implementing basin-wide IWRM in the Lake Chad basin.
For the first time, regional management plans have been developed for key wetlands in
the Lake Chad basin ecosystem while the needs of local stakeholders have been
integrated in finding solutions in a participatory manner.
The project intervention in Member States of the LCBC and the international need for a
new system of water governance has elevated the issue of reforms in the management of
land and water resources to the top of legislative agenda.
                                                
III. ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE WORLD BANK AND
GOVERNMENT

3.1 Assessment of the Activities of the World Bank During Project Execution
The World Bank has provided sufficient support and satisfactory performance in the
implementation of the project.

3.2 Assessment of the LCBC s Activities During the Course of Project Execution


                                           47
The LCBC performance during project implementation was satisfactory despite the
tremendous stress due to insufficient technical staff to participate fully in the pilot
demonstration projects.

3.3 Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Quality of Relations between the World
Bank and the LCBC during Project Execution
The effectiveness and the quality of the relationship between World Bank and the Lake
Chad Basin Commission during project execution has been satisfactory. The project has
established new partnership between the LCBC and the World Bank in facing the
environmental and developmental challenge facing the Lake Chad basin region.

3.4 Evaluation of the Performance of the Various Institutions, Consulting Firms and
Consultants who Participated in Project Activities
All consultants, consulting firms and institutions that participated in project activities
performed satisfactorily with the exception of the following;

                                              Cameroon.
IV. OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE WITH RESPECT TO THE
SUSTAINABILITY OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED
The Lake Chad region now has all the elements needed to assure sustainability of the
results achieved by the project's impact. The SAP document and the future
implementation framework articulated in Institutional Strengthening Study prepared by
the project were both backed by resolutions of the regional Council of Ministers.
The regional institutional network built by the project has however not been incorporated
into the institutional mechanism of the Lake Chad Basin Commission and this will
require further donor intervention to support SAP implementation.

4.1    Sustainability of process
The prospect for the sustainability of the process is good due to the increased in the
capacity of actors in terms of new knowledge, techniques and tools that were generated
during project execution. It is however important that processes and lessons learnt be
incorporated into procedures of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. This could be
achieved through further consolidation of the results of the project in a second phase
through institutional strengthening and focus on water governance.




                                             48
4.2      Sustainability of impact
The project impacts are felt is some portions of the Lake Chad Basin more than in other
portions. In the Komadugu-Yobe basin, it has been reported that for the first time in ten
years, the water flow arrived at the Lake Chad early in July 2008 as a result of the
interventions in the Komadugu-Yobe pilot demonstration project and the subsequent
expansion of the local initiatives to clear the blocked water channels by the HJKYB Trust
fund.
The success in the Komadugu-Yobe pilot demonstration project is also speeding the
process towards institutional and legal reforms within the water sector in Nigeria. The EU
and DFID has given further support to the government of Nigeria for reforming the
water governance system. In the forefront of the advocacy and legislative lobbying for
this reform process are the stakeholders and partners of the LCBC GEF Project who have
benefitted from the projects capacity build effort. The HJKYB Coalition Partners made
up of IUCN-KYB project, HJKYB Trust fund, Joint State IWRM committees, LCBC,
KYB-WDI, C4C-NNWGI(successor to DFID JWL project) objective is to advocate for
legislative reforms and institutionalization of IWRM practices in the land and water
sector. The results of the Komadugu-Yobe pilot demonstration project is the main tool
use in showcasing the benefit of IWRM to livelihood and the environment. The coalition
partners are in the third year of implementing a 5-Year action plan. A draft water
resources bill that endorsed the successful arrangement of basin management through the
Water Charter initiated by the States in the Hadejia-Jama'are-Komadugu-Yobe Basin is
currently in its third revision in the Nigerian National Assembly.
There are probably more of such impacts of the project in the Lake Chad Basin but it will
need more time for them to be sufficiently large to be noticed.
The success of the Komadugu-Yobe pilot demonstration project both in terms of
institutional, legislative, financial and environmental impacts points to the fact that the
result of the project could be replicated in the whole Lake Chad basin provided donors
continue to provide incremental cost support to the Member States of the Lake Chad
Basin Commission. Donor support for the implementation of the Lake Chad Basin
Strategic Action Programme is therefore imperative in ensuring sustainability of project
result.

V- LESSONS LEARNED

5.1     General Lessons7
1. The pilot demonstration projects implementation has been very good. The lessons
    derived from joint fact finding, articulating proposals for solving local problems has
    been judged to be most beneficial to the stakeholders.

2. The TDA/SAP process is the best attempt at regional planning in a cooperative
   manner in the Lake Chad Basin. It creates a platform for competing sectors to
   appraise and agree on common problems and seek common solutions both in the
   national and regional level.

3. The project did not give enough attention to gender and youth involvement.

4. Project implementation using two different agencies and implementing different
   procedures has been cumbersome.

5. Capacity building of CBOs on problem identification, project proposals and
   implementation has been beneficial.

6. The methodology of engagement of stakeholders as a result of implementation of the
   project is different from what obtains in the LCBC and should be incorporated into
   the organization's work procedures.

7. The small grant from a donor and a matching grant from the communities has proved
   successful in getting the communities to work together in solving their own problems.

8. The project provided an opportunity for stakeholder groups to form partnerships,
   collaborate and develop synergies that reduce cost and bring about efficiency.

9. The use of MOU to form partnerships and develop synergies with strong stakeholder
   groups in solving complex problems at the wetlands level should be incorporated into
   the work procedures of the LCBC.

10. There used to be different plans within each country but the NAP process provides an
    opportunity to bring existing plans together and introduce the use of common tools
    and methodology in implementing IWRM in the Member States.

 The general lessons are generated by the PSC members during the final PSC meeting
held in December 2008 at Abuja.



                                            50
11. It was not possible for the executing agency the LCBC to exercise full ownership of
    the project because the implementing agency has a total control of both project and
    financial management. This has impinge on efficiency of project implementation.

12. The pilot projects has enable the local communities to recognize their potentials and
    capabilities and that of other levels of government at the regional, federal, state and
    local levels.

13. The methodologies of stakeholder engagement demonstrated and validated in the
    pilot demonstration project should be incorporated in LCBC work procedures.

14. The development of the TDA and SAP has solved the problem of future project in the
    Lake Chad Basin Commission.

15. Staffing pattern in the PMU was adequate to the task.

16. Future projects should be implemented within the framework of LCBC condition of
    service

17. LCBC seconded staff to the project should provide the linkage from the Phase I and
    Phase II and in the future should form the nucleus of the new LCBC project
    implementation arrangement.

18. The Institutional Assessment reforms, the NAP and SAP implementation should form
    the core the of phase II of the GEF project.

19. The phase II of the project should address the need of building a strong link between
    the transformation of technical decisions into policies and political actions at the
    highest level of the Member States.

20. The results of IMCC, recommendations of the IWRM Study and NAP development
    processes should be incorporated in the institutional arrangement of the LCBC.

21. The Phase II of the project should develop a basin-wide communication strategy that
    will focus on key stakeholder groups including regional parliamentary committee and
    the ambassadors of the Member States.

22. Monitoring and evaluation should provide for a joint supervisory mission made-up of
    donors, government and project personnel

23. There should be capacity building of focal points and strong implication of national
    focal points and experts in the execution of the next phase of the project.

5.2      Lessons Learned on Effective Grant Management8

5.2.1 Seeking Appropriate Grantees
    1. Use nontraditional media outlets and outreach methods to connect with potential
       grantees.

      2. Take risks on nascent NGOs and CBOs.

      3. Bring-in local experts familiar with local conditions where the grant program is to
         take place

      4. Prepare to announce several rounds of grant giving opportunities since most
         proposal funding needs are small in nature until the initial available grant budget
         is exhausted.

5.2.2 Proposal/Concept Paper Preparation
    1. Accept short concept papers before or instead of a full-length proposal.

      2. Provide guidance in thinking through linkages between objectives, outcomes,
         methods and M&E indicators

      3. Use local experts in the selection panel to help the most promising potential
         grantees develop the full-length proposal

5.2.3 Grantee Capacity Strengthening
    1. Arrange field visits to the extent feasible and ask questions.

      2. Be flexible with timelines and sensitive to time constraints.

      3. Provide training and workshops based on grantee needs.

5.2.4 Monitoring and Evaluation
     Introduce monitoring and evaluation into the project planning process.

         Provide guidelines, assistance, and rationale for baseline data collection.

         Facilitate grantee selection of simple, measurable, and useful indicators.

         Encourage the grantor/donor to participate in monitoring visit during grant
         implementation.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other
Partners/Stakeholders

 UNDP contracted consultant provided inputs at time of the ICR mission. UNOPS provided
comments and The UNDP regional team leader provided comments below in addition to
comments provided directly into the text.

Comments received from UNDP
My main comment is with regard to the ICR rating of "moderately unsatisfactory" which
does not reflect well the challenging working conditions of the project and the actual
degree of achievements. As indicated by the ICR section 3.2 on achievements (pages 20-
21) two major outcomes (the institutional assessment, and the investment plan) were not
achieved. However, the following outcomes were achieved to satisfactory levels: (i)
efficiently carry out a successful TDA/SAP process, (ii) derive lessons learned from pilot
projects, (iii) assess the legislative and institutional frameworks of the member countries,
(iii) enhance LCBC's institutional capacity, (iv) develop a stakeholder Analysis, (v)
develop a transboundary strategy for a functional network of protected areas. The ICR
itself indicates that these achievements are commendable and achieved under difficult
conditions.
Comments received from UNOPS
We have reviewed the report here and although we are of course disappointed that in the
end the project could only attract a rating of "moderately unsatisfactory" there is well
reasoned explanations provided by the evaluator, the key finding of which is that the
original project design was overly ambitious. The report does mention the achievements
that the project had despite the difficult circumstances and mentions that the independent
evaluation gave it a rating of "moderately satisfactory". So overall, as it is put in this
report, it is to a large extent a matter of perspective - is the glass half-full or half-empty.
As far as UNOPS is concerned, the report gives credit to our achievement where it is due
and points out our weaknesses, which we acknowledge and have indeed identified during
the course of implementation and taken the necessary steps to remedy these.

Annex 10. Enhanced Results Framework Analysis, synthesized
from PAD and Prodoc
While the PAD and Credit Agreement did not provide a Results Framework, the project
had a Logframe which contained objectives, outputs and outcomes. Logframe was the
norm at the time of project preparation and its design did not include information on
baseline and end-of-project targets. Key performance indicators are the following:
Increased numbers of stakeholders involved in local and transboundary water resource
management issues, with the ability to influence decision making processes;
 Increased awareness of the impact of national policies on shared water resources by
    constituency groups;
 Implementation support for three pilot projects;
 Completion and adoption of the Strategic Action Plan (SAP), with a framework,
    timeline and Financing Plan for implementation of priority activities; and
 Increased donor involvement in and support for the SAP and LCBC Plan
    implementation.
Annex 2 of UNDP's Prodoc provides a detailed log frame for the project, but also does
not provide baseline and end-of-project target values for its indicators. The Prodoc
acknowledged that the project's success cannot be measured against Environmental
Status Indicators (ESI), since it was of catalytic nature and aimed at mobilizing a process
of institutional and regulatory reform, with a focus on capacity building and regional
policy initiatives to address transboundary issues. Thus, the Prodoc expected that most of
the indicators employed to track implementation progress (and to be defined by the PMU
in its first year) would be Process Indicators (PI) and some Stress Reduction Indicators
(SRI) such as changes to regulations, harmonized approaches to land degradation issues,
and improvements in the LCBC's capacity to effectively address its mandate.
In its APRs/PIRs, UNDP monitored progress towards achieving the project objective
through the following outcome indicators:
   A co-operatively developed and approved framework and co-ordination mechanism
   for regional and national interventions on behalf of the participating countries.
   Improved national and regional capacities for the long-term sustainable development
   of the resources of the Lake Chad Basin.
   Increased donor interest in and support for the efforts of the participating countries
   and the LCBC to achieve a sustainable future for the Basin.
   Documented, substantial stakeholder participation in the work of the project
To create consistency and clarity in reporting, UNDP's APR/PIR and Prodoc outcome
indicators have been integrated with the outcome indicators used in the Bank's ISRs, to
provide the following Results Framework for improved presentation of project outcomes,
consistent with subsequent ISRs and APRs/PIRs and as an alternative for the Results
Framework provided in Section F.
