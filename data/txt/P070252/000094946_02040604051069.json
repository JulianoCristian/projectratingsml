implementation of the Lake Chad Basin Project, and, sets the\n            principles of compensation for loss of property, livelihood,\n            and relocation or resettlement, of affected populations\n            within the six countries of the lake basin. The Lake Chad\n            Basin Commission will consult with stakeholders to assess\n            adverse social impacts, and plan the resettlement in\n            accordance with explicit Bank policies. Compensation for\n            land, structures, business and other temporary asset losses\n            will be based on market values, productivity valuation,\n            negotiated settlements, and labor valuation. It should be\n            noted that lack of title, or license would not bar\n            compensation, even squatters will be entitled to\n            construction costs. In addition, workers losing employment\n            in the process of relocating should be entitled to\n            transitional income support; and, project affected people\n            (PAPs) will also be entitled to transitional assistance,\n            i.e., moving expenses, temporary residence, employment\n            training and income support, including an option for full\n            compensation if duration of impact exceeds two years.\n            Compensation will be paid at replacement costs, following\n            the establishment of compensation committees, assessment of\n            replacement values of identified assets, and establishment\n            of compensation rates for assets to be expropriated.\n            Compensation committees shall include representation of\n            PAPs, to establish adequate rates and avoid litigation;\n            however, should grievance prevail a civil court will settle\n            the litigation."}, "docdt": "2002-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
