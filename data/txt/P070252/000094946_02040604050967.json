integrity of the Lake Chad system (which involves six\n            surrounding countries), is protected by integrated\n            management of the basin's resources, by building\n            capacity among riparians and stakeholders, completing a\n            trans-boundary diagnostic analysis, and preparing a\n            strategic action program. However, the degradation of the\n            natural resource base, with the consequent impacts on local\n            populations, requires an environmental, and social\n            assessment. To this end, this environmental assessment,\n            based on the appraisals of the Cameroon, and Nigeria Dams\n            (v. 1 and 2), and on integrated environmental and social\n            assessments (v.3), proposes mitigation measures as follows.\n            The rehabilitation, and construction of a wildlife pond in\n            Waza, will adversely impact natural habitats, forcing\n            wildlife concentrations and an increased localized grazing\n            to build pressure around the water point; thus, water points\n            should be spread over a greater area, and grazing practices\n            limited. Additionally, new water points should avoid upland\n            forest areas, to prevent vegetation degradation. Floodplain\n            connecting channels will be enlarged and blockages cleared,\n            but river flows may be either reduced or increased, thereby\n            disturbing ecosystems; engineering/environmental consultants\n            should monitor river flows, taking remedial action as\n            needed. The identification of critical wetlands for\n            conservation will increase pressure on floodplain resources;\n            an environmental consultant should monitor soil erosion, and\n            review the impacts of conservation on threatened cultivars.\n            A process framework for mitigation of social impacts (v. 5)\n            provides measures to assist affected populations, following\n            an eligibility criteria, and based on public consultations."}, "docdt": "2002-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
