Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
1     INTRODUCTION
1.1   BACKGROUND
The two dams that are the subject of this report both supply dry season flows both to the
Kano River Irrigation Project and for the supply of Kano City. Tiga dam, constructed on
the Kano river, was commissioned in 1974 and Challawa Gorge dam, on the Challawa
river, in 1992. These two rivers join just south of Kano City to form the Hadeija which in
turn is the principal source of supply for both the wetlands and for the northern part of
Lake Chad.
The river regulation effected by the operation of the two dams has resulted in a reduction
of the flood peaks in the Hadeija which it is understood has had undesirable
consequences on the environment and the social economy of the wetlands downstream.
As part of a recent drive to address these problems, which are widespread in the Lake
Chad Basin, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) commissioned a project entitled
"The Reversal of Land and Water Degradation Trends in the Lake Chad Basin" This
project comprised, inter alia six pilot projects, one of which was devoted the problems of
the Komadougou - Yobe basin wetlands, situated on the border of Niger and Nigeria.
During the environmental and social components of this pilot project the need to check
the safet of the two dams was noted', and as a result the World Bank commissioned Mr
L J S Attewill of Jacobs GIBB Ltd to prepare this appraisal of the safety of the Tige and
the Challawa Gorge dams.
1.2   TERMS OF REFERENCE
The terms of reference for this appraisal and that of two dams in Nigeria are included as
Annex A to this Report.
1.3   PREVIOUS STUDIES
Previous studies consulted for this appraisal are:
1.3.1 Tiga Dam Evaluation Report Volume I - Haskoning July 19782
The objectives of this report, which was prepared shortly after the commissioning of Tiga
dam, were:
- Collect all available design data and calculations to prepare a retrospective design
report
- Carry out an evaluation of the design of the dam
- Collect all available construction records to prepare a construction report of the dam
complete with as constructed drawings
- Prepare an Operation and Maintenance manual for the dam.
The results of the evaluation of the design and construction give considerable cause for
concern: the main points are as follows:
- The design process was haphazard and incomplete
- The design of the outlets was ill conceived
-  The foundation design and treatment was inadequate
1-1



Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
- The embankment fill was compacted considerably dry of optimum and as a result fill
density is low
- The wave protection was inadequate
1.3.2 Safety Evaluation of Existing Dams (SEED) examination of Tiga Dam - USBR 19873
This evaluation was carried out after various signs of distress manifested themselves
during the 1980's. The main conclusions of the safety evaluation were:
- there was no immediate danger of collapse at the time of the inspection when the
reservoir level was at 523.7m, 3.6m below full storage level
- the dam should be classified as high hazard
- remedial works should be carried out on the embankment
- further studies were required to assess dam stability and spillway adequacy
- an emergency preparedness plan should be produced
1.3.3 Babtie Report on follow-up works
Many of the recommendations made by the USBR have been implemented, under the
supervision of Babtie, who have submitted a report on the actions taken. This report was
not available at the time of the visit but it is hoped that a copy will be made available
shortly.

Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
2     DESCRIPTION OF THE DAMS
2.1   ACCESS
The Challawa Gorge dam is situated some 90km south west of the Kano city. The Tiga
dam is situated 70km south of Kano city: the location of the two dams is shown in Figure
2.1. To access both dams it is necessary to cross their respective spillway discharge
channels, which might be problematic in times of extreme flood.
2.2   TIGA DAM
2.2.1 History
The dam was based on a design of NEDECO but was constructed between 1970 and
1974 without professional engineering input. HJRBDA took over responsibility for
operating and maintaining the dam in 1976 and as described in Section 1.3 above,
commissioned a series of inspections, studies and remedial works
2.2.2 Characteristics
The Tiga dam is a zoned earthfill embankment whose main characteristics are as follows:
Embankment height river bed level      48m
Embankment length                      6000m
Crest elevation                        530.96masl
Upstream slope                         1:3
Downstream slope                       1:2.5
Crest width                            7.6m
Outlets:
-  Main                                3.65m diameter
-  secondary                           2no 0.9m diameter
Main spillway
-  527.3m crest level                  122m
-  527.6m crest level                  527.6m
Emergency spillway
-  525.1 mcrest level                  200m
-  526 m crest level                   714m
2.2.3 Embankment design
The embankment profile is conventional with a wide central core of low permeability
clayfill supported by shoulders of coarser material. Filter zones are provided to prevent
migration of fine material from the core to the shoulders, and an internal drainage system
to control the phreatic surface in the downstream shoulder. The embankment is founded
on residual soil except at the core, where a narrow and in paces relatively deep trench
was excavated down to the underlying bedrock.
Seepage through the foundation is limited by a grout curtain constructed from the bottom
of the trench.
2-1



Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
The embankment was originally provided with 14 standpipe piezometers which have
since been augmented by a number of new piezometers.
2.2.4 Outlet works
The main outlet works comprises a 3.65m diameter steel pipes set in concrete in a trench
excavated in rock at the close to the original river course. The inlet to the pipe is a
submerged concrete structure containing a butterfly valve that can be used to dewater the
pipe. A gallery situated on the left side of the pipe provides access to the inlet chamber.
The pipe terminates at the outlet structure where the flow is discharged into the main
canal. Flow is regulated by means of a 2.2m diameter Howell Bunger valve.
The two secondary inlets both comprise a 0.9m diameter steel pipe set into the base of the
embankment. The inlet structure is submerged but there is no upstream flow control and
no access. Flow is controlled at the downstream end of the pipe which discharges into the
Kano river.
2.2.5 Spillway
The main spillway comprises an ogee-profile weir, 448m long and curved in plan,
discharging into a channel excavated in rock. The level of the central 122m length of the
weir is 30cm lower than the outer part. On either side of the weir there is a low
embankment of total length 914m and whose crest level is ?? m below that of the Main
dam, so that the dikes would act as supplementary spillways in times of extreme flood A
200m length of this dike immediately to the left of ths concrete spillway, was recently
excavated to the level of the rock foundation.
2.3   CHALLAWA GORGE DAM
2.3.1 History
The project was initiated in 1975 by the Kano State Water and Resources and
Engineering Agency (WRECA) which was responsible for both design and construction.
HJRBDA, who took over responsibility in 1977, commissioned Haskoning to supervise
the construction of the dam in 1980 which they did until their contract expired in 1983.
Construction continued at a slow pace until 1989 when Julius Berger Nigeria PLC were
appointed as the contractor and Water and Dam Services Company were appointed to
supervise construction. The dam was completed in 1992.
2.3.2 Characteristics
The Challawa Gorge dam is a zoned earthfill embankment whose main characteristics are
as follows:
Embankment height river bed level    42m
Embankment length                    7804m
Crest elevation                      527.45masl
Upstream slope                       1:3
Downstream slope                     1:2.5
Outlet                               Twin 2.5m diameter

-  crest level                        523.76
-  crest length527.6m crest level     600m
2.3.3 Embankment design
No information was available on the embankment design other than, like Tiga, it is of
zoned earthfill construction. Relief wells were installed at 50m centres along the entire
length of the downstream toe of the embankment.
2.3.4 Outlet works
The outlet works comprises twin 2.5m diameter (approx)steel outlet pipes passing from
the inlet works at the upstream end to the outlet works at the embankment toe. The pipes
are provided at the upstream end with a stoplog and a butterfly valve, which are both
accessed via an intake tower and a footbridge to the dam crest. The two pipes terminate
at the outlet structure where the flow is discharged into the river channel. Flow is
regulated by means of a diameter Howell Bunger valve
2.3.5 Spillway
The spillway comprises a 600m long straight concrete ogee weir discharging into an
excavated channel which converges to a width of several hundred meters. There is no
emergency spillway
2.4   HYDROLOGY
2.4.1  Reservoir characteristics
The characteristics of the reservoirs are as follows:

2.4.3 Floods
Tiga
Haskoning, in their 1979 report2, estimated the peak flow and total flood volume of the 1
in 10,000 year flood event for a variety of flood durations. The 5 day flood was found to
result in the largest flood rise, as follows:
Flood volume:     706Mcm
Peak inflow:       3257m3/s
Peak outflow:     2043m3/s
Peak reservoir level: 529.4m
Freeboard:         1.5m
From regional flood data the peak flow estimated by Haskoning seems to be low by a
factor of 2. In their 1987 report3 the USBR recommended that the spillway should be
designed to pass the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) and that a new flood study should
be carried out using the additional data collected the 1979 study. It is understood that this
new study was carried out by Babtie, as a consequence of which a 200m length of the
original emergency spillway was excavated, in 2000, to its rock foundations at
525. lmasl. Subsequently in 2001, the wettest year in living memory in the area, the
reservoir level rose to a peak level of 526.31m, its highest recorded level.
Challawa Gorge
The spillway at Challawa Gorge has apparently been designed to pass the PMF which
was stated to be 6,500m3/s by HJRBD. No information of the corresponding outflow or
the peak reservoir level was available. During the inspection it was noted that the 2001
flood mark was some 200cm above the spillway level. This indicates that the peak
outflow in 2001 was 115 m3/s over the spillway plus the discharge through the outlet
structure.

3     THE INSPECTION
3.1   TIGA DAM
3.1.1 Introduction
Due to lack of time, the inspection made by Mr Attewill cannot be considered a full and
detailed inspection.
3.1.2 Upstream face
The upstream face of the dam is somewhat uneven as evidenced by an erratic shore line,
as shown in the photograph: this observation tends to support poor construction control as
suggested in the Haskoning report2 although it could be a manifestation of post
construction settlement due to poor compaction, which is also noted by Haskoning.
The upstream face is protected from wave attack by riprap which appeared, at the points
where it was inspected, to have been dumped. As dumped riprap the average stone size is
undoubtedly too small, as noted by the USBR team3. However the Haskoning report
contains construction photographs in which the riprap was being placed by hand, a
technique which in which smaller stones sizes can be tolerated. It is quite possible that
the smaller stone specified for hand placing was retained even though the method pf
placing was changed, presumably to speed progress. The consequence of inadequate
stone size is of course higher maintenance costs. In addition there is a considerable
amount of weed growth through the riprap layer which will further reduce its
effectiveness in dissipating wave energy.

Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
3.1.3  Crest
The embankment crest, which is covered with a laterite road surface, is variable in width
but otherwise appears to be sound. The was no sign of the longitudinal cracks noted by
the USBR which have subsequently been repaired.
3.1.4 Downstream face
No evidence was noted of the underfilled profile resulting in local steepening reported by
the USBR and which has since been remedied. The downstream face is covered with
grass which can, if the grass cover is well established and dense, provide effective
protection against surface erosion from rainfall.
In various places, however, large areas of grass had been burned which reduces the
protection in the short term and which also revealed that the cover was not particularly
dense.
3.1.5 Downstream drainage
The downstream drainage system has been rehabilitated since the USBR inspection and
appeared to be in a reasonably good state of repair.
3.1.6  Outlet works
The absence of any lights precluded an inspection of anything but a short length of the
downstream end of the access gallery. However the gallery walls felt dry and the tota;l
seepage into the gallery and the inlet structure, which was conveyed in a floor drain,
appeared to be low.
3.2   CHALLAWA GORGE DAM
3.2.1  Introduction
Due to lack of time, the inspection made by Mr Attewill cannot be considered a full and
detailed inspection.
3.2.2 Upstream face
The upstream face of the dam is uniform and in good condition. The riprap protection
was also in good condition with no bare patches or displacement evident.
3.2.3  Crest
The crest of the dam appeared uniform with no sign of any settlement or cracking
3.2.4 Downstream face
The downstream face presented a uniform appearance: the slope is protected from surface
erosion by a layer of small rockfill.
3.2.5 Relief wells
A random check was made of one of the several hundred relief wells and it appeared to
be clean and in good order. The total seepage through the left abutment of the dam and its
foundations was estimated as 20-301/s which is acceptable.
3-2



Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
3.2.6 Outlet works
The intake tower appeared to be in excellent condition with no sign of any seepage from
the reservoir. The condition of the hydromechanical equipment appeared to be good
although a proper inspection could not be made because the lights were not working.
3.2.7 Spillway
The spillway appeared to be in excellent condition. There is moderate to severe erosion
of the ford, where the discharge channel crosses the old road, several hundred metres
downstream of the embankment which does not pose a problem at present but which
should be kept under observation in the future.

Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
4     THREATS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE DAMS
4.1   TIGA DAM
4.1.1  Slope stability
The safety factors calculated by Haskoning were unacceptably low:
Upstream slope, rapid drawdown:                   F = 1 - 1.2
Downstream slope, steady seepage, static conditions:  F = 1.17
The USBR report recommended that a programme of investigation should be carried out
to recover undisturbed samples of fill material for laboratory testing so that the stability
can be re-appraised. They also recommended that a seismic hazard assessment should be
carried out to determine appropriate design seismic accelerations. It is understood that
this work has been carried out by Babtie and this will be reviewed when a copy of their
report is made available.
4.1.2  Internal erosion
Provided the filter material was correctly specified the dam should be protected against
internal erosion. A much bigger threat is posed by the possibility of piping both through
the cut-off trench and piping associated with the secondary draw off conduits.
Piping through cut -off trench
The material placed in the cut off trench, where the possibility of arching action might
severely reduce vertical stresses in the fill, is vulnerable to piping. This was the mode of
failure of the Teton dam in the United States which had a very similar cut-off. There is
also a reference in the USBR report to the possibility of the fill material being dispersive:
if this has not already been investigated it should be as dispersive soils are much more
prone to piping than non dispersive soils.
Piping associated with secondary draw-offs
The two secondary outlets comprise 24 inch (0.6m) diameter steel pipes in which the
flow is controlled only by a valve at the downstream end. The entire length of the pipe is
thus under full reservoir pressure and if (when) a leak develops in the pipe, water will
escape from the pipe at high pressure into the surrounding fill material. It is likely that
this fill will then be eroded by the high pressure water jet and piping failure of the
embankment may ensue. There is of course no means of access to repair leaks that may
develop and the only recourse is to block the submerged inlet using divers to place either
a stop log or sand bags.
4.13  External erosion
As has been noted the stone size of the riprap is inadequate to protect the wave erosion.
The replacement of the riprap layer, especially at the higher levels, would be very
desirable but is probably unrealistic in the short term. It is particularly necessary therefore
that the riprap is subject to annual inspections and remedial works where necessary to
repair any damage.
Similarly it is important to promote a better cover of grass on the downstream face.
Surface erosion from rainfall in a single season will not threaten the integrity of the dam
4-1



Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
but if it is not remedied the cumulative effect can be very serious. The achievement of
good grass cover will therefore reduce the amount of maintenance that would otherwise
be necessary.
4.1.4 Floods
The revised flood study recommended by the USBR was carried out by Babtie with the
result that a 200m section of the dike forming the emergency spillway was excavated.
The Babtie report on the revised flood study will be reviewed when it becomes available
to check that the current spillway can pass the PMF.
4.2    CHALLAWA GORGE DAM
4.2.1  Slope stability
No information is available on the calculated factor of safety of Challawa Gorge. The
design calculations should be examined to determine the critical safety factors. If, on the
basis of supported or of reasonable shear strength parameters, the safety factors appear
adequate, then no further action is required. If these calculations are not available or if the
factors of safety are considered to be marginal, then new investigations and stability
analyses should be carried out.
4.2.2  Internal erosion
A properly designed relatively new dam such as Challawa Gorge dam should not be at
risk from piping failure. The original design report should be reviewed to ensure that
there is no risk of piping at Challawa Gorge.
4.2.3 External erosion
The riprap appears to be adequate to protect the slope from wave attack, although this
should be verified by a detailed review of the actual stone size and the design wave
height.
4.2.4 Floods
The spillway at Challawa Gorge dam has been designed to pass the PMF and therefore
there risk of overtopping by a flood has already been minimised.

5     EMERGENCY PLANNING
5.1   RESPONSIBILITY
It is understood that Nigerian Law holds the dam owner responsible for the safety of his
dam. In the case of Tiga and Challawa Gorge the dams are owned by the Hadejia
Jana'are River Basin Development Authority who are also responsible for the operation
and maintenance of the dams.
5.2   SURVEILLANCE
Although there is no formal safety plan at either Tiga and Challawa Gorge, regular
readings are made and records kept as follows:
- Reservoir level: daily
- Releases: daily
- Seepages: monthly
- Piezometers and well water levels: monthly.
The dams are also inspected periodically by experienced senior staff of the HJRBDA.
5.3   POPULATION AT RISK
5.3.1 Tiga dam
Tiga dam is situated immediately upstream of a relatively densely populated irrigation
area: further downstream several substantial villages and towns - for instance are situated
in the potential flood plain. It is estimated that the population at risk is tens of thousands.
5.3.2 Challawa Gorge dam
The area downstream of the dam as far as the confluence with the Kano river is relatively
sparsely populated: downstream of the confluence the population at risk is the same as for
Tiga dam.
5.4   WARNING SYSTEM
There is no formal warning system at either Tiga or Challawa Gorge dams.
5.5   EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
5.5.1 Routine maintenance
Routine maintenance is of a high standard, given the budgetary constraints. It is
important that the lights in the outlet works are repaired in both dams, as routine
inspections are far less revealing by torchlight and in an emergency the lack of lights
would be a hazard.
It is not known how often the upstream control equipment - the butterfly valves and stop
log gates at Challawa Gorge - are exercised: if they are not opened or closed for
operational reasons, they should be operated once a year to ensure that all components
work.

5.5.2 Plant
Earthmoving plant - excavators, trucks and compactors - should be kept available in the
vicinity of each dam for use in case of emergency repairs are required. It is understood
that such plant is available close to Tiga dam. The situation at Challawa Gorge is not
known.
5.53  Emergency Action Plan
It is understood that at neither dam does an Emergency Action Plan exist.

6     CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1   THREATS FACING THE DAM S
6.1.1 Tiga dam
The main threats facing the integrity of Tiga dam, in decreasing order of probability:
1. internal erosion due to arching of fill material over cut off trench
2. internal erosion caused by a fracture of one of the two secondary outlet pipes
3. slope failure under seismic load
Further study would be required to assess the probability of failure from each of these
threats, but the combined probability must be considered as being high.
6.1.2 Challawa Gorge dam
By contrast the probability of the failure of Challawa Gorge dam to the main threats of
external erosion, internal erosion and instability must be several orders of magnitude
lower than at Tiga.
6.2   RECOMMENDATIONS: DAM SAFETY
6.2.1 Tiga dam
It is necessary to review the Babtie report in the light of the USBR recommendations to
determine the nature, extent and priority of actions required to improve the safety of Tiga
dam. The threats to the integrity of Tiga dam summarised in section 6.1.1 above are all
due to inadequate design and structural solutions to mitigate the risks would be extremely
expensive. It is therefore necessary to rely on non-structural solutions, as detailed in
section 6.3 below. Consideration should also be given to reducing the full storage level
by additional excavations of the emergency spillway on the left bank.
6.2.2 Challawa Gorge dam
The original design of the Challawa Gorge dam should be reviewed to ensure that it
meets modern standards. If design parameters are not available it is recommended that a
programme of sampling and testing should be undertaken to provide any deficiencies in
data.
6.3   RECOMMENDATIONS: SAFETY PLAN
6.3.1 Monitoring
The performance of the dams are already being monitored but the extent of the
monitoring at Tiga should be improved. Increased seepage is the best indicator of
impending piping failure, so it is recommended that the seepage measurement and
monitoring system should be improved, extended and automated. An accurate level
survey should be carried out along the dam crest and downstream shoulder at least once
a year at the end of the dry season

Appraisal of the Safety of the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams, Nigeria
Essential records that should be kept are:
- Daily readings of reservoir
- Weekly readings of seepage flows
- Monthly readings of piezometers and wells
- Annual level survey of the dam crest
Most importantly, vulnerable areas: the downstream toe, especially in the vicinity of the
outlets, should be inspected weekly throughout the year by the maintenance staff and
twice yearly by qualified dam engineers.
An annual report should be compiled describing the performance of each dam should be
prepared. These reports should detail instrument readings and their analysis
6.3.2 Early warning
It is recommended that an early warning system be installed at Tiga dam. The warning
would comprise sirens in communities immediately downstream and radio or telephone
links to the civil authorities elsewhere in the area of inundation. This area should be
determined from a dam break analysis if this has not already been carried out. The
HJRBDA should cooperate to the fullest extent with the civil authorities in the
preparation of an action plan.
