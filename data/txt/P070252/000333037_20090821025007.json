"Ratings for the Reversal of Land and\n            Water Degradation Trends in Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem\n            Project for Africa were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to global environment outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            complex regional projects, it may be more difficult for the\n            implementation and supervision process to fix design flaws.\n            To increase the likelihood of achieving project objectives,\n            design flaws need to be fixed early in project\n            implementation, at minimum during the Mid-term Review (MTR).\n            The full endorsement and commitment of all the riparian\n            countries of a shared basin is desirable for successful\n            Global Environmental Facility- International Waters (GEF-IW)\n            project implementation, but not necessary if adequate action\n            plans are incorporated in the project design. Country\n            management units' and country offices' increased\n            involvement in project supervision is critical for the\n            regional projects' success. In the absence of a strong\n            regional institution, development assistance should focus on\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening of the\n            recipient, rather than attempting to resolve or bypass the\n            institution's shortcomings by introducing outside\n            agencies for project management and execution. The Bank\n            should be realistic regarding project implementation\n            planning, the time it takes to complete a project of this\n            challenging nature, and the outcome targets to be achieved."}, "docdt": "2009-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
