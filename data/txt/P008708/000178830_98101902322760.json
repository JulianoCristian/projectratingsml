"Agricultural credit subprojects to be\n            financed under the proposed loan are estimated to include\n            investments to be undertaken in 1979 and 1980 for 27 new\n            fattening farms, 25 new crossbred gilt production farms,\n            modernization of 37 pig breeding and fattening units, a line\n            of credit to agricultural cooperative members and private\n            individuals, provision of facilities to augment existing pig\n            nutrition research, and construction of a slaughterhouse,\n            cold storage and processing facilities; this would include\n            modernization of existing facilities to improve health and\n            hygiene standards as well as provision of new facilities.\n            Annual incremental pork production resulting from project\n            investments is expected to reach 200,000 tons (carcass\n            weight) at full development. In addition, slaughtering and\n            processing through-put capacities would be increased by\n            275,000 tons (carcass weight). The project is expected to\n            reach full production in 1984 and face no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
