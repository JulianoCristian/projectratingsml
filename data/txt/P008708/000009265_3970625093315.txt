PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - LIVESTOCK II (PIGS) PROJECT
(Loan 1669-RO)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Livestock II
(Pigs) Project in Romania, for which Loan 1669-RO in the amount of US$75.0
million was approved on March 20, 1979. It was fully disbursed, except for
US$467,603 which was cancelled due to misprocurement_ Final disbursement took
place on December 27, 1983, and the Loan was closed as scheduled on June 30,
1984.
This PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Region following a mission to Romania in November 1984 and is based on a
detailed project completion report of high quality prepared by the Borrower
(Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry - BAFI), a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 2279a-RO), the President's Report (No. P-2480-RO), the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements dated April 16, 1979, the Memorandum of
Agreement between the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole and IBRD dated
August 23, 1979, the Multicurrency Loan Agreement between BAFI and Caisse
Nationale de Credit Agricole, dated August 2, 1979, the Cattle and Sheep
Subsector Survey (No. 3174-RO); relevant Bank files, including correspondence
with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and Bank supervision reports;
quarterly progress reports prepared by the Borrower; as well as interviews
with investors and officials both in the Bank and Romania, who have been
associated with the Project.
Since this Pigs II Project had similar objectives and implementation
issues as the Pigs I Project (Loan 1479-RO), which were analyzed in-depth by
the Operations Evaluation Department's (OED) Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 5282) issued on October 9. 1984, it was decided that this abbreviated
PCR would be sufficient to evaluate the performance of the Pigs II Project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on March 29,
1985. Comments received from the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry are
in Annex I.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA - LIVESTOCK II (PIGS) PROJECr
Loan 1669-RO
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Project is a fellow-up to the Pig Production and Processing (Pigs
I) Project (Loan 1479-RO) which was impleiented satisfactorily (see Project
Performance Audit Report No. 5282).  It financed, together with the Pigs I
Project, almost 93X of all investments in pig pzoduction and processing
facilities in Romania (Lei 14 billion, equivalent to US$800 million) during
their implementation period 1978-83. Its objective was to increase Romania s
supply of meat and meat products for domestic consumption and export, and to
increase productivity of its pig industry. These objectives were generally
achieved.
2.       The project was soundly conceived and technologies involved were well
uaderstood in Romania. Compared to the Pigs I Project, innovations under the
project included agricultural credit to CAP members and individual producers,
and investments to augment research on pig nutrition. It was also the first
IBRD financed project under which Romania obtained cofinancing, in the amount
of US$100 million.
3.       Primarily due to overconmitment of Rommnia's construction industry,
project implementation took considerably longer than expected at appraisal.
Construction of new pig farms experienced a delay of about two years,
completion of slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities and research
facilities was deferred by about 3 years, while implementation of pig farm
modernizations, which required less civil works cons.ruction, was in line with
projections.
4.       The project cost in Lei terms was 3.6%, and in US dollar terms, 14%
above appraisal estimates. Sixty-four percent of project costs were actually
spent for pig production and only 26% for slaughtering and meat processing
equipment, compared with appraisal estimates of 50% and 40% respectively.
This large investment in pig production, together with an approximate 2.5
times higher investment in pig farm modernization compared to appraisal
estimates, is the main reason that estimated net annual liveweight production
at full development in 1986 is expected to surpass appraisal estimates by
almost 22%. By contrast, only about 40% of the originally planned
slaughtering capacity has actually been provided under the project. Actual
meat processing capacity was three times the appraisal target while cold store
capacity exceeded the target by 21%. In addition, the project financed
slaughterhouse equipment (equivalent to about 10% of total project cost), four
heating plants and a cooling plant- The 9,200 jobs created is slightly above
the appraisal estimate of 9,000.
5.       Lack of foreign exchange to import protein feed, and Romania's
inability to significantly increase domestic protein feed production, have
seriously affected the bio-economic and production efficiency parameters of
this otherwise physically well implemented and adequately managed project.



-vi-
Assuming a continuation of the present protein deficient feed levels, the
project's economic rate of return would be about 13.01, compared with a rate
of 18.4S if adequate quality feed is made available. Provision of additional
protein feed, either produced domestically or through imports, would thus have
a high economic pay-off. The higher ERR of 301 estimated at appraisal mainly
results from overly optimistic comiodity price forecasts for meat at that time.
6.       The following points are of interest:
(a) If additional protein feed were provided to raise feed quality from
the present average of about 11% crude protein to 14.5% crude
protein, the bio-economic performance parameters of the project would
be substantially higher (para. 4.13), pig production would increase
by 211 without any increase in aggregate feed costs (para. 4.14), and
economic performance would improve significantly (para. 4.22). The
problem of protein deficiency is not a technical one, but a major
policy and planning issue (para. 4.15 and 6.01).
(b) Overcommitment of the construction industry caused delays in civil
works construction (paras. 4.05, 4.08, 4.09 and 6.02).
Cc) lnnovations under the project included extension of agricultural
credit to individual producers (paras. 4.04 and 4.10) and investment
in pig research (paras. 4.05, 4.06 and 4.11).
{d) US$467,603 of the Loan amount was cancelled due to misprocurement
(para.3.04).
Ce) This was the first IBRD financed project under which Romania obtained
cofinancing from commercial banks (paras. 3.09 and 3.10).
Cf) The relatively good financial performance of the project's
slaughtering and meat processing facilities as opposed to the lower
returns from pig production units is the result of controlled
interface pricing (para. 4.19).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROKANIA - LIVESTOCK II (PIGS) PROJECT
Loaa 1669-RO
I. BACKGROUND
1.01    Pig production has traditionally been important in Romania and, over
the past three decades, the size of its pig herd increased from about 2.2
million in 1950 to about 14.3 million in early 1984, including almost 1.3
million sovs. During these years of rapid expansion, the pig sector underwent
significant changes. In 1950, for example, 96Z of all pigs were produced on
individual farms and only 4S by the State (IAS) and cooperative (CAP)
sectors. By 1975, this proportion had changed to about 30S for the individual
and 701 for the social sectors, and the country had established large
coamiercial pig production systems for both IASs and CAPs, which are among the
largest in the world. Central breeding units are usually responsible for
producing weaner pigs to be fattened either on satellite fattening farms or at
the central breeding complex itself. Breeding gilts and boars are bred on
State selection farms, and most of the feed is provided by State-owned feed
mills. The country's livestock slaughtering and meat processing industry,
including both rural and municipal abaLtoirs and large meat packing plants, is
well established.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
2.01    Major expansion and improvement of pig production was a major
objective of Romania's 1976-80 National Development Plan. The first two-year
tranche (1977-78) of a related, nationwide pig production and processing
investment program was partially financed by the Bank-sponsored Pig Production
and Processing (Pigs I) Project (Loan 1479-RO), which became effective in
September 1977. The corresponding Bank Loan 1479-RO, which amounted to
US$71.0 million (or 221 of the total project cost of US$322.4 million), was
equal to the project's foreign exchange component. The original Pigs I
Project proposal requested Bank assistance for a four-year tranche (1977-80)
at a total cost of US$622 million. During appraisal it was however decided to
restrict the project size to a two-year slice and to appraise the second
two-year slice separately. In November 1977, the Romanian Government thus
requested Bank participation in a second pig production and processing
project. Project preparation was carried out by specialized Romanian
institutions under the auspices of the Bank for Agriculture and Focod Industry
(BAFI), based on guidance provided by the Bank and a two-week Bank
preappraisal mission in March 1978. The preparation report was sent to the
Bank in the same month and the project was appraised in May/June 1978.
Negotiations were held in Washington in January 1979 and a Loan (1669-RO) of
US$75 million was approved by the Board on March 20, 1979, without
discussion. The Loan became effective on July 16, 1979, as originally
scheduled, and was closed in June 1984, as expected.

Project Description and Objectives
2.02     Like the Pigs I Project, the project was designed to raise efficiency
and productivity of Romania's pig industry by expanding State and cooperative
large-scale pig production, increasing production of breeding gilts, and
providing new and modernized slaughtering and meat processing facilities,
thereby increasing the supply of pork and processed meats either for domestic
consumption or for tz--;t.  In addition, it had three important new features,
namely (a) a line rf eredit to individual producers for agricultural,
horticultural and ivestock production; (b) an applied research component for
pig nutrition and managgmenet; and (c) cofinancing in the amouat of US$100
million with foreign, private commercial lending institutions. The total
project cost was estimated at US$435.5 million, including US$80 million
incremental working capital, with a foreign exchange component of 21.4X.
2.03     The project was to be administered by BAFf, which had been the
Borrower for seven previous Bank loans for agricultural projects.  BAFI's
branch offices were to be responsible for direct supervision of subproject
implementation to be carried out by State enterprises, cooperatives and
individual producers; and technical assistance was to be provided by
specialized agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI,.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENIATrON
3.01     Implementation.  As of September 30, 1979, 2.5 months after Loan
effectiveness, BAFI had already approved 30X of Loan financed project costs
and, as of December 31, 1979, Bank Loan disbursements amounted to US$8.6
million, or 2.5 times higher than expected at appraisal. This head-start
resulted to a large extent from disbursements made by BAFI prior to Loan
Signing (April 16, 1979) which, according to Schedule I, para. 2(b) of the
Loan Agreement, were not eligible for withdrawal from the Loan. The Bank
expressed its concern about this violation of the Loan Agreement; but granted
a waiver-> of the requirement of Schedule 1, para. 2(b) of the Loan
Agreement, and agreed to disburse against relevant expenditures.
3.02     From the beginning of project implementation it became clear that
over-commitment of the construction industry in many Judets1' would
significantly affect project composition and design as well as the pace of
implementation. In particular, implementation of new project facilities fell
behind appraisal expectation, while modernization of pig farms, which requires
less extensive civil works, progressed ahead of schedule. Thus, by mid-1980,
disbursement for modernization of new pig farms was about six times that
estimated at appraisal, while about two-thirds of the expenditures for
construction of new pig farms and slaughtering and meat processing facilities
were incurred during 1981-83 and 1982-83, respectively, and facilities for the
project's nutrition research program were completed with a delay of over three
years. By contrast, credit to individual producers was disbursed quickly
within a one-and-a-half year period, over one year earlier than projected at
appraisal.

3.03     Procurement.  Goods for an estimated value of US$75 million
(equivalent to the Loan amount) were to be procured under ICB by ROMAGRIMEX.
The table below compares planned with actual procurement results:
Appraisal     Actual
-USS million
Structural Steel                24.4         35.7
Electric Cables                 14.8         4.7
Asbestos Cement Sheets           4.5         13.0
Slaughterhouse and Meat

Total                           75.0         74.8
After significant Bank revision of tender documents, in particular regarding
the technical specifications for slaughterhouse and meat processing equipment,
all the tender documents were approved by the Bank on January 7, 1980, roughly
six months after Loan Effectiveness. As anticipated, international interest
in tendering for structural steel, electric cables and asbestos cement sheets
was very limited, and all three contracts were awarded to Romanian firms on
March 28, 1980 (asbestos cement sheets) and May 23, 1980 (structural steel and
electric cables). The significantly lower amounts for electric cables and
slaughterhouse and meat processing equipment and the correFpondingly higher
amounts for structural steel and asbestos cement sheets was mainly due to
changes in subproject composition and designs which favored modernization of
existing facilities over the construction of new ones.
3.04     By contrast, international interest in bidding for slaughterhouse and
meat processing equipment was high as 29 out of 36 enterprises, who had bought
the tender documents, submitted bids. However, contract award procedures
became unusually cumbersome and, although bid opening took place on April 4,
1980, the bid evaluation report did not reach the Bank until April 6, 1981.
The report, which included 1,246 line items, was found to have many
discrepancies and errurb, paiLLcularly in recalculating new values as a result
of changes in exchange rates.  The Bank thus urged the Romanians to prepare a
new bid evaluation report. This report was still unsatisfactory, and the ever
increasing delays in bid evellXition caused more and more complications and
frustration for both the Borrower and the Bank. Finally, on February 12,
1982, the Bank cancelled US$467,603 fru.m the Loan amount because of
misprocurement ot equipment awarded to Romanian firms, which were not the
lowest evaluated bidders at the time of the initial bid evaluation. In the
meantime, equipment contracts totalling US$4,657,700 had been awarded to six
foreign suppliers and those totalling US$16,730,600 to the Romanian firm
Uzinimportexport.
3.05     Project Costs.  Total project cost, including estimated incremental
working capital, was Lei 8.125 billion compared with an appraisal estimate of
Lei 7.840 billion, an increase of 3.6% (Table 1). In dollar terms, actual
project costs are estimated at US$494.6 million or almost 14% above the
appraisal projection of US$435.5 million mainly due to a hardening of the
Lei : US dollar exchange rate during the project implementation period.



- 4 -
3.06     Sixty-four percent of project costs (in Lei terms) were actually
spent for pig production and only 26.3Z for slaughtering and meat processing
equipment compared with appraisal estimated breakdowns of 501 and 40Z
respectively. The increase for pig production was mainly due to an over 3
times larger number of pig farm modernizations compared to appraisal
projections and the approximate one-third lower investment in slaughtering and
meat processing facilities. Actual project expenditures for credit to
individual producers and pig nutrition research remained as projected at about
9.5S and 0.41 respectively, of total project cost.
3.07     Financing. Data recorded by BAFI covers only financing of fixed
investment costs and does not indicate the sources of financing of incremental
working capital. Assuming'L' that this was funded 80Z by BAFI and 201 by
subborrowers' own resources, actual project financing compares to appraisal
projections as follows:

a/ See Table 2 for more detail.
3.08     BAFI's proportion of total project funding was thus over 50Z higher
than projected at appraisal, for four main reasons: firstly, the project size -
(in Lei terms) was almost 4% larger than planned; secondly, US$467,603 was
cancelled from the Loan amount (para. 3.04); thirdly, revaluation of the Lei
caused the US$75 million IBRD Loan to be worth in Lei terms only about 851 of
its original value; and finally, and most significantly, subborrowers'
contributions of only 5Z of total project cost were substantially below the
28.81 appraisal target. BAFI attributes this gap between expected and actual
subborrowers' contributions to an appraisal oversight of new regulations,
which only required State-owned enterprises to contribute 201 to 351 to "low
priority" subprojects, while 'high priority" subprojects, such as those
implemented under the project. were eligible for 1001 financing by BAFI.
3.09     Cofinancing.  This was the first IBRD financed project under which
Romania obtained cofinancing from a consortium of 43 commercial banks,
including 25 European, 8 Japanese and 5 Arab banks. The syndication of a
US$100 million loan was led by the French Bank "Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole". Lending terms included 10 years maturity with a four-year grace
period, 5/8X per annum over LIBOR for US$70 million and 3/4% over LIBOR for
1/ Based on appraisal models and confirmed as part of the Pigs I PCR.



- 5 -
US$30 million, and 1/2Z management and 1/2% commitment fees.  Signing of the
multi-currency loan agreement between BAFI and the consortium of banks took
place in Paris on August 2, 1979 and the Bank's Board of Directors approved
the cofinancing arrangements for the project on August 22, 1979, including a
"cross default" clause in the Bank's Loan Agreement with BAFI. The US$100
million loan was the first Eurodollar syndication made for a Romanian entity
apart from those made for the Bank for Foreign Trade, for balance of payment
purposes. Obtaining this loan set a precedent in the major capital markets
for accepting Romania for medium-term credit-raising operations in convertible
currencies.
3.10     Bank staff undertook considerable efforts to assist the Romanians in
obtaining the cofinancing loan for the project. This assistance also provided
several indirect benefits to the Borrower. Firstly, experience gained was
useful for BAFI to obtain another US$400 million in cofinancing under three
subsequent Bank sponsored projects1'. Secondly, the availability to the
foreign commercial banks of Bank reports on Romania's economy, BAFI and the
country's agricultural sector, as well as the Staff Appraisal Report and
related legal documents, were key factors in establishing confidence of the
commercial banks and in their providing of the Loan funds-, which would have
been difficult to obtain if Romania had gone to the capital market without
Bank support. Finally, the cofinancing loan was made on more favorable terms
than would otherwise have been available to Romania in the market. During the
PCR mission, BAFI expressed its appreciation for the Bank's assistance in
obtaining cofinancing.
3.11     Disbursements.  With the exception of unusually high Bank Loan
disbursements in the second and third quarter of project year one (para. 3.01
and Table 3), Bank disbursements were well in line with appraisal forecasts.
Final disbursement was made on December 27, 1983 and the Loan was closed on
June 30, 1984, as scheduled.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     (a) Pig Production.  Only 16 of the 27 planned new pig
breeding/fattening farms were constructed under the project (Table 4) and
their pig production capacities decreased accordingly by about one-third, from
94,500 sows plus progeny projected at appraisal to 63,400 sows plus progeny.
The number of pig breeding farms financed is also well below appraisal
expectations (15 instead of 25 farms), whereas their installed capacity is
about 271 above appraisal forecast (60,670 sows plus progeny versus an
appraisal estimate of 47,700). Two of these farms are operated as selection
farms with a total capacity of 7,000 sows plus progeny for the two farms.
Under the pig farm modernization category, over three times the original
expected number of pig farms were modernized (125 instead of 37 farms). While
their total incremental sow spaces actually decreased by 16Z vis-a-vis
appraisal projection (42,800 instead of 50,700 spaces), their fattening
capacity increased by over 50X (970,600 compared to 641,300 finished pigs).

Livestock III (Poultry) Project - Loan 1764-RO (US$100 million); and
Danube-Black Sea Canal Project - Loan 1794-RO (US$200 million).



Altegether, total capacity to house 170,870 sows plus progeny has been
established by the project, which is 12% below the appraisal estimate of
193,300 sows. Out of a total of 158 farms constructed or modernized under the
project in 35 Judets, 70 are CAP and 88 are State farms, including two
research facili ies (para. &.05).
4.02     At full deve:ooment by 1986, and provided adequate feed will be
available from 19S5 onwards (para. 4.13), the project is expected to produce
annually about 2.3 million finished pigs, 64,000 cull sows and 6,000 cull
boars compared to an appraisal forecast of 1.86 million finished pigs, 69,000
cull sows and 3,000 cull boars. Actual net annual liveweight production would
thus amount to about 254,000 tons compared to an appraisal estimate
recalculated by the PCR mission at about 209,000 tons. Consequently, the
project's net annual liveweight production is expected to surpass the
appraisal estimate by 21.5%. In addition, the project would be able to sell
about 220,000 breeding gilts and 406,000 weaner pigs per year to non-project
farms and individual producers, compared to 254,500 breeding gilts and 495,600
weaner pigs projected at appraisal.
4.03     (b) Slaughterhouses and Meat Processing Facilities.  Under the
project, three new slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities and four
meat processing plants were constructed and six existing slaughterhouses and
meat processing facilities were modernized (Table 5). Only three out of the
originally planned nine new slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities
were thus actually constructed, while all the projected four meat processing
plants and six slaughterhouse and meat processing modernizations were
implemented. Actual locations changed drastically vis-a-vis those planned at
appraisal, at which time neither the number of facilities nor their locations
had been definitively decided. Only about 40% (equivalent to 145,000 tons
liveweight) of the originally planned annual slaughtering capacity of 367,500
tons has actually been implemented; and facilities were erected to produce up
to 34,000 Lons of meat pruducts per year, about three times the appraisal
targeL. Iu addition, the project financed slaughterhouse equipment worth
Lei 131.2 million (US$7.5 million), six cold stores with a capacity of
80,500 m3 as against 70,000 m3 expected at appraisal and, in agreement
with IBRD, four heating plants generating 76 tons of steam per hour, as well
as a cooling plant with a capacity to produce 1,500 Kcal N per hour (Table 6).
4.04     (c) Credit to Individual Producers.  Extension of agricultural credit
to CAP members, small farmers and rural households was sponsored by the Bank
for the first time in Romania under this project. Within the first year and a
half of Loan Effectiveness, the full amount of earmarked funds of Lei 620
million (US$35 million) had been disbursed, one year earlier than expected at
appraisal. Almost 97% of credit funds were extended for livestock production
(Table 7). Two-thirds financed cattle fattening, about 13% pig production, 3%
dairying, 9% sheep production, 6% beehives and 3% fruit and vegetable
production and others. Although procurement of construction materials for
improvement of livestock housing, purchase of small equipment and tools, and
concentrate feed was eligible for financing under the Loan, in most cases,
subloans financed exclusively livestock through BAFI branches and credit
cooperatives. Beneficiaries usually obtained subloans in cash, with a five
year repayment and a one year grace period, 3% annual interest, and under a
contractual arrangement to sell related production to Social Sector processing
plants. Altogether over 220,600 feeder steers, 19,000 breeding gilts, 131,500
weaner pigs, 20,100 heiferslyoung cows, 446,000 breeding sheep and 145,000 bee



- 7 -
hives were financed under the project, and the number of total beneficiaries
amounted to as many as 252,795 or five times as many as expected at project
appraisal. Consequently, the average subloan size of Lei 2,453 (US$144) was
only one-ninth the appraisal model (Lei 22,280) and corresponding on-farm
development impact per unit was much less than appraisal expectations.
Returns from subloan investments are, however, estimated to be higher than
those expected at appraisal (para. 4.19).
4.05     (d) Applied Nutrition Research.  An innovative feature of the project
was the financing of animal nutrition research. For that purpose, funds were
to be made available on a grant basis through BAFI/MAFI to (a) the National
Research Institute for Pig Breeding and Production at Peris for laboratory
equipment and a small feed mill; and (b) the Animal Nutrition Institute at
Balotesti for a 400 sow unit, attendant housing and facilities for feeding
experiments. Although the need to significantly improve Romania's an-ial
production research capacity was recognized by both the Borrower and the Bank
since the mid-seventies as a priority field of intervention, implementation of
this part of the project, originally to be undertaken in Project Years one and
two, was deferred due to delays in the finalization of research programs and
construction plans, a comprehensive reorganization of Romania's agricultural
research activities and, in particular, overcommitment of Romania's
construction industry (para. 3.02). Since Government's main concern was
speedy implementation of immediately productive investments in agriculture and
livestock production, low priority was attached to the construction program of
the project's research component. As a result, approval of both research
programs, construction plans and start-up of construction works were
repeatedly delayed; investments at the Peris Institute were not completed
until October 1983, while those at the Balotesti Institute (which is also
receiving funds under the Livestock IV Cattle Project - Loan 1937-RO) are
expected to become operational by the end of the first quarter of 1985 only.
_1.06    Actual investment programs for both Institutes have changed
significantly since project appraisal. This is quite understandable as, at
that tie, available infurmation allowed only rough estimates and since then,
intensive and fruitful dialogues among the relevant Romanian research
organizations had taken place. In addition to projected investments
enumerated in para. 4.05 above, the Peris InstLtute obtained 700 m2 of
laboratory space, 12 modernized pig barns housing 2,000 sows and up to 30,000
progeny per year, and modernization of four out of six out-stations, thereby
increasing breeding capacity from 20,000 to 28,000 sows. By contrast, the
nutrition research capacity of the Balotesti Institute is designed to
accommodate only 270 sows (against 400 at appraisal), including 3,300 weaners
and 3,200 pigs for fattening, as well as related laboratory facilities.
Adequacy of Project Facilities
4.07     (a) Pig production facilities built under the project are of modern,
cost-effective design and are comparable with the best standards anywhere.
Space saving internal designs permit optimal utilization of pig houses.
Efficient mechanical dry feeding systems are standard. Slatted floors are
used for al] categories of stock, and efficient natural ventilation, drinking
and heat'ng systems are available.  The project's pig farm modernization
program incorporated the above design standards in existing, old fashioned pig
houses thereby increasing production capacities and labor productivity by up
to 66Z and 40Z respectively. In addition, it improved hygienic and working



-8-
conditions. Effluent disposal is handled by activated sludge systems and in
some cases via irrigationu Quality of construction varies significantly from
location to location. Some of the facilities have excellent quality while
that of others is quite disappointing. The same applies to their maintenance.
4_08     Serious construction delays in completion of new pig farms
materialized as a result of reasons described in para_ 3.02. At appraisal,
implementation of new farms was expected to take place over a two-year period
per farm. However, an average delay of about two years occurred, while the
implementation pace of pig farm modernizations was well in line with appraisal
expectations.
4.09     (b) Slaughterhouses and Meat Processing Facilities built or
modernized under the project are of adequate standards. Technologies applied
are appropriate and equipment appears to be robust. In most facilities,
however, overall standard of workmanship could have been significantly
improved with a little more attention during design and construction phases.
A disappointing feature of the project was the long construction periods
required to complete the new slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities.
The appraisal phasing of investments allowed for liberal construction periods
of up to three years. Actual implementation took, however, about five years
on average, and the 900,000 pig/year COMTIN slaughterhouse in Tim.soara is
only expected to become fully operational by the end of 1985, three years
later than planned.
4.10     (c) Credit to Individual Producers.  This project component has been
very well implemented. Virtually all beneficiaries take excellent care of
their animals and, as a result, performances are good and average mortality is
exceptionally low. Subloan recovery is almost 100L.
4.11     (d) Applied Nutrition Research.  With the additional facilities and
laboratory equipment provided under the project, Romania would have sufficient
research capacity to carry out a meaningful applied research program in the
field of pig nutrition and management which, at the time of appraisal, was
only rudimentary. While the Peris Institute is already carrying out pig
management and genetic trial work, the Balotesti Institute is to research pig
nutrition, reproduction and behavior, commencing in early 1985. Although
Romania is anxious to develop pig research, there are severe doubts whether
the facilities financed under the project will be utilized cost-effectively.
Constraints include isolation of research workers from the international
research community, gross deficiency in essential scientific journals and
literature of relevant libraries, and little possibility for training of
research workers abroad. Elimination of these constraints is required to
enable researchers to carry out trials and field investigations relevant to
the immediate needs of producers, so that cross-fertilization between research
and practice can be efficiently developed and maintained.
Adequacy of Pig Breeds
4.12     Romania's pig population has been bred for domestic market
conditions, which do not value high meat content, as well as for the
prevailing low protein content feeding regime, which is not suited for
production of the typical Western-type meat pig. The breeding program uses
efficiently the good maternal characteristics of the two dam lines (Landrace
and Large White), the good meat quality and content of the two sire lines



- 9 -
(Duroc and Hampshire), and the related beneficial heterosis effect of
crossbreeding. Up to now, meat quality and stress sensibility do not present
serious problems. The latter is a most important advantage for large
production units, which are common in Romania. Romania is, however, unable to
export pork at reasonable prices to countries which demand lean meat.
Regarding utilization of this export potential, the introduction of a sire
line with extremely high meat content such as the Pietrain or Belgium Landrace
in the mating system might be profitable and should therefore be examined.
Bio-economic and Production Efficiency Paramaters
4.13     As for the Pigs I Project, Romania's substantial protein feed
deficit, estimated at about 35Z to 40S for pigs and 301 for poultry rations
and to amount to at least. the equivalent of 800,000 tons of soybean meal per
year, has disastrous effects on pig production performance, in particular on
feed conversion ratios. Its economic impact has been analyzed in detail in
the Project Performance AAiit Report (PPAR) of the Pigs I Project (Report
No. 5282-, paras. 5.27, 5.30-5.32, 6.13-6.18). As the Pigs II Project is
applying the same production technology and feeding and management systems as
the Pigs I Project, it is safe to assume that its bio-economic production
efficiency parameters are similar to those obtained under the Pigs I Project.
The table below thus reiterates the Pigs I parameters under two different feed
scenarios (poor and adequate quality feed) and compares these with the Pigs II
appraisal assumptions:

4.14     The table demonstrates that if additional protein were provided to
raise the feed quality from the present average of about 11% crude protein to
14.5% crude protein, t.ie techrxcal parameters would be substantially better.
The PCR mission of the Pigs I project thus estimated that if the efficiency of
feed conversion was improver from 5.3 to 4.0, the number of pigs sold per sow
per year would increase oy 13%, average slaughterweight of finished pigs would
rise from 101 to 106 kg and age at slaughter would decrease by about 16%2
giving rise to 21% more pigmeat production without any increase in aggregate
feed costs.  Because of the estimated 16% reduction in age at slaughter, the
iSZ extra pigs coulc be reared or fat ered --ichout adding to existing pig
produc.ion facilities.  Consequently, ccsts per unit fcr livestock housing,
labor, feed manufacturing, transport, storage and handling would be reduced at
both farm and feed mill level as would the cost of effluent disposal.
4.15     The economic analysis of protein feed shortages undertaken within the
context of the PCR of the Pigs I Project also revealed that the foreign
exchange cost of importing soybean meal could be more than compensated for by
exporting maize saved in pig rations (as one kg of soybean meal would replace
about 2.2 kg of maize) and additional exports of pig meat resulting from
better production efficiency parameters. The analysis also demonstrates that
by allocating an incremental 117,000 tons of protein feed worth US$35 million
annually to Pigs I costs, the overall production of this project would rise by
almost US$74 million, most of which would be exportable pig meat. The average
economic value of additional soybean meal used would thus be US$632 per ton
above its border price. Government agrees with this assessment; but although
this matter has been brought repeatedly to the attention of the relevant
Government officials, no action has been taken to remedy the situation.
Without solving this problem, Romania will be unable to utilize its impressive
feed grain base (maize, barley, etc.) effectively. If protein feed imports
continue to be restricted and domestic production fails to increase
substantially, both the Pigs I and II Projects will continue to perform well
below their potential (para. 4.22).
4.16     Bio-economic efficiency parameters vary significantly from pig farm
to pig farm. Some of the best farms, particularly those with access to above
average quality feed (e.g. COMTIM, which is operating its own 5 feed mills
with a total output of about 500,000 tons of concentrate feed per year and
produces about one million pigs per year), wean 20 and more piglets per sow
per year on average and have acceptable feed conversion ratios of 4.2 to 4.7,
while poorly performing farms may have mortality rates in young pigs of up to
25% and correspondingly poor other performance parameters, na=Ay feed
conversion ratios of above 6.0. Poor quality feed is, however, only part of
the reason for low performance. Equally important is the effect of poor
management. As demonstrated by some of the farms, poor feed quality can be
offset to some extent by improving managerial and husbandry skills at the farm
level.
Environmental Effects
4.17     Location of both pig production and processing units has been well
selected and their housekeeping is of adequate standards from an environmental
viewpoint. As in the case of the Pigs I Project, a good deal of care and
attention has been paid tc the design and construction of effluent disposal
systems. However, monitoring data of effluent disposal systems of six large
pig production complexes provided to the Bank under the Pigs I Project



- 11 -
indicate that ineffectively treated effluents are likely to be discharged in
some cases, contrary to the provisions of the Romanian Law No. 9 of 1973.
Effluent treatment efficiency, therefore, needs to be closely monitored by
relevant Government services in order to avoid that poor operation and
maintenance of effluent disposal systems lead to environmental damage.
Financial Results
4.18     BAFI made estimates of cash flows for each of the individual models
funded under the project based on actual financial results achieved up to
1983, estimates for 1984, and extrapolations thereafter, assuming optimal
feeding conditions. Based on this set of figures, financial rates of return
(FRR) estimates compare with appraisal forecasts as follows:
Financial Rates of Return

However, actual financial rates of return, particularly for pig production,
are expected to be lower because of the persistent deficit in protein feed
availability.
4.19     The relatively good financial performance of the slaughtering and
meat processing facilities and cold stores contrasts with the poor financial
results of pig production units, particularly of new breeding/fattening
complexes. Under Romania's fixed price system, an extraordinarily large share
of the total benefit from meat sales is going to processing facilities
compared with pig production un:-s. No FRRs have been reestimated for
individual sector producers because of the large number and variety of actual
investments (para. 4.04) actually carried out, which are not comparable with
appraisal expectations. Due to significantly lower fixed and variable costs
of the individual sector, when compared to the Social Sector, the project's
individual sector component was nevertheless profitable. Indeed, returns from
this credit program are estimated to be somewhat higher than those expected at
appraisal as the bulk of credit funds was invested in livestock, whereas the
appraisal assumed that over 50% of subloan funds would be used for fixed
investments, mainly livestock housing.

Level of Investments
4.20     Economic Impact.  The Pigs I and II Projects were the major source of
finance for investment in pig production and processing during their main
6-year period of implementation 1978-83 as shown below:
Pig Production           Slaughterhouses and
Meat Processing Facilities
Million Lei   Z         Million Lei           Z
Pigs I Project                  3,657       43.2          2,609           47.5
Pigs II Project                 4,336       51.3          1,780            32.5
Other                             468        5.5          1,098            20.0
8,461      100.0          5,487          100.0
Not only have the IBRD assisted Pigs I and Pigs II projects financed almost
93% of all investments in pig production and processing facilities during
te- -  rlementation period, but the level of investment during this period
was also much higher than in previous years. For pig production, the average
investment during 1975-1977 was about Lei 540 million per year compared with
over Lei 1.4 billion per year during the following 6 years, while for
processing facilities the average investment had been about Lei 0.75 billion
per year during 1975-1977 compared with over Lei 0.9 billion per year during
the 6-year project period.
Jobs Created
4.21     Under the project about 9,200 jobs (5,160 in pig production and 4,040
in the processing sector) were created, which is slightly above the appraisal
estimate of 9,000 jobs (5,000 in pig production and 4,000 in processing).
About 1,050 of these jobs account for managerial and technical staff,
including 180 pig nutrition and management research staff at the Peris and
Balotesti research institutes. In addition, over 250,000 CAP members and
other individual producers benefited from credits enabling them to invest on
their own holdings, mainly for livestock production.
Economic Performance
4.22     As the PCR of the Pigs I Project, which achieved bio-economic
performance parameters similar to the Pigs II Projeot (para. 4.13), includes a
particularly detailed economic analysis (PCR No. 5282, paras. 6.13-6.23 and
its Annex 2), the results of the Pigs I analysis, i.e. the economic rate of
return (ERR), have been adapted to this project. Specifically, the ERR
calculation of the Pigs I PCR was updated to reflect changes in commodity
price forec<--ts (a slight decrease in meat prices and a larger decrease in
feed prices) and labor costs (increased by 5%), which have occurred since its
preparation (Tables 8 and 9). A sunmmnry of the sensitivity analyses is given
below:

Poor Feed       Adequate Feed
Quality           Quality

Investment + 10%                          11.8               17.5
Feed Cost  + 10%                          10.0               16.3
Benefits   - 10%                           8.1               14.4
Benefits   +  2%                          13.4               19.2
As would be expected for a livestock fattening project, the project is
sensitive to relative changes in output prices and feed costs.  The ERR of
12.6% compares favorably with the 11% ERR of the Pigs I Project, which
indicates that the terms of trade for pig production in Romania have improved
since the end of 1983. The ERR would increase to 18.4% if adequate quality
feed were made available. The Pigs I PCR also estimated that fertilizer
savings due to manure produced by the project would add about 2% to gross
benefits, thereby raising the ERR by O.8 percentage point. The relatively
high level of the appraisal mission estimated overall ERR of 30% mainly
results from the overly optimistic commodity price forecasts for meat at the
time of appraisal and, in addition, includes incremental revenues from the
highly profitable individual sector operations (paras. 4.18 and 4.19).
v. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
The Borrower
5.01   - BAFI, Lhe Borrower, was responsible for project administration, while
individual subprojects were implemented by State enterprises and CAPs, most of
which were already experienced in either pig production or slaughtering and
meat processing.  BAFI headquarters was in charge of (a) coordinating project
activities with relevant Ministries (namely with MAFI's Livestock DepartmentX) -
the design institute IPSCAIA, MIC, MIT, the Feed Mill Trust, ROMAGRIMEX, and
research stations; (b) approving all subprojects above Lei 10 million; (c)
centralizing withdrawal request and accounting; and (d) -  :oring and
reporting. BAFI branch offices were responsible for appraisal of all
subprojects and approval of subloans below Lei 10 million. They also
supervised the financial and administrative execution of subprojects and
controlled, either together with specialized engineers from other agencies or
with their own engineers, progress of project implementation. Work
supervision was the responsibility of relevant agencies in charge of project
design and/or of subborrowers who hired their own engineers. MAFI's Livestock
Department, the General Directorates of Livestock at Judet Level, MIC and MIT,
relevant research institutes, and veterinary and meat inspection services
provided valuable assistance to both pig production and processing units.
Romania's veterinary establishment, which was able to satisfactorily prevent
and control all the diseases affecting pigs in Romania, deserves particular
praise.



- 14 -
5.02     BAFI supervision of State enterprise and CAP project investments was
fully satisfactory. Supervision of credits extended to individual farmers
received, however, only marginal attention by both BAFI and Credit
Cooperatives, due to the large number of relatively small subloans (over
250,000), lack of transport facilities and limited experience by the lenders
in the field of rural credit operations. As in the case of the Pigs I
Project, reporting under the project was weak for a project of this
significance. Although Quarterly Progress Reports were always received on
time, they were not very informative and information agreed upon in
Supplemental Letters 3, 4 and 5, was generally poor and dubious and often sent
to the Bank with much delay and only after the Bank had made several
requests. Project accounting and auditing were satisfactory. Personnel at
farm and processing levels are well trained and have good opportunities to
improve and update their professional knowledge through seminars or
on-the-spot demonstrations.
The Bank
5.03     Project processing was competent and efficient.  Project design was a
logical follow-up of measures being carried out under the Pigs I Project. It
continued support of integrated pig production and processing on a nationwide
basis, and to refine the production technologies introduced under the Pigs I
project, thereby significantly improving cost-effectiveness, hygiene and
working conditions, and environmental impact of project facilities. The
project's credit to individual producers component was innovative at the time
of appraisal. It contributed to a better understanding of the importance of
Romania's individual sector by both Romania and the Bank and preceded
financing of similar activities under the Bank's Livestock IV (Cattle) and
Moldova Agricultural Credit Projects (Loans 1937 and 2077-RO). Bank staff,
together with the relevant research institutes, were also instrumental in
i.encifying and streamlining the animal nutritioan dua . maigement research
programs being carried out as a result of the project. Moreover, high praise
is given to the Bank by the Romanians for its assistance in obtaining
cofix-ancing for the project from commercial banks. Bank supervision in terms
of su?ervision intensity and staffing was adequate (see Basic Data Sheet).
5.04     The appraisal assessment that the risks associated with the project
were minimal proved incorrect. During project appraisal it was not possible
to foresee the over-commitment of the country's construction industry and the
severity of the economic difficulties which Romania has experienced since
1980, and as a result of the latter, the disastrous effect on feed conversion
efficiencies stemming from a grossly inadequate supply of protein feed. At
appraisal it was reasonable to assume that Romania would be in a position to
import sufficient protein feed supplies like many other countries, including
other Eastern European countries. In addition, the Bank was assured that the
Government would (a) allocate sufficient grain to support the project; (b)
stand ready to forego grain exports, if necessary, to support livestock
activities; (c) actively pursue programs to expand domestic production of high
grade proteins for feed manufacture; and (d) support the importation of
protein materials to supplement domestic supplies1'. The full extent of
protein feed shortages and their impact on livestock performance emerged only
since 1980z', resulting from the combined effect of Romania's rapidly
1/ SAR No. 2279a-RO, page 44, para. 7.12.
2/ Cattle and Sheep Subsector Survey (No. 3174-RO), paras. 6.31-6.34.

expanding intensive livestock production activities, its failure to
significantly increase domestic production of protein feeds as planned, and
its foreign exchange constraints, which in 1984, permitted to import no more
than about one-fifth of minimum protein feed requirements.
VI. MAIN LESSONS
6.01     The problem of protein deficiency is fully recognized by the
Romanians. It is thus uot a technical issue arising out of inadequate
diagnosis, but a major policy and planning issue. As it is not possible in
the context of this PCR to analyze the competing claims of other sectors of
Romania's economy on the country's foreign exchange resources, Government's
decision to reduce imports of protein feeds, despite ever increasing livestock
numbers in recent years, cannot be deemed wrong categorically. However,
within the context of Romania's pig industry, there are no economic reasons
not to rectify the feed situation by corrective policy and planning measures.
6.02     To avoid the severe construction delays experienced under this and
the Pigs I Projects, massive specialized civil works programs, such as pig
production and processing facilities, must be carefully phased. Romania had
never constructed/modernized a similarly large number of such facilities
before the implementation period (1978-83) of the two projects (para. 4.20)
nor does it plan any new substantial investments in the pig subsector for the
future. Spreading project investments over a longer period of time than
actually carried out under the project would have been less demanding on the
capacity of relevant design institutes, and construction and supply
industries. It would also have permitted more efficient incorporation of
improvements in design and technology developed during the implementation of
both the Pigs I and II Projects and would have allowed better synchronization
with the feed mill industry and changing ma cro-economic circumstances.
Moreover, it would have reduced apparent construction quality deficiencies as
a result of less pressure on the available skilled labor, construction
materials, and equipment, which were often in short sup-ly throughout the
implementation period of the project.
6.03     Comprehensive project monitoring and evaluation, which was not
required by the Bank for this project, would have alerted both the Borrower
and the Bank at an early stage of project implementation to the effect of
protein feed deficiency on bio-economic performance parameters and
profitability of pig production. This would have induced changes in the
design of future livestock projects.
