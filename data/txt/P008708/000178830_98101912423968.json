credit to agricultural cooperative members and private\n            individuals, provision of facilities to augment existing pig\n            nutrition research, and construction of a

as provision of new facilities.\n            Annual incremental pork production resulting from project\n            investments is expected to reach 200,000 tons (carcass\n            weight) at full development. In addition, slaughtering and\n            processing through-put capacities would be increased by\n            275,000 tons (carcass weight). The project is expected to\n            reach full production in 1984 and face no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
