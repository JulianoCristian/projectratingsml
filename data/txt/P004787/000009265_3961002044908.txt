zZQigtA           The proposed project would assist the Royal Thai Government to
Description:    improve the efficiency and safety of the country's road
subsector and mitigate its environmental impact by: supporting
selected investments included in the Seventh Highway Plan
(1992-96); assisting the Department of Highways (DOH) with
long-term planning o±' the road network and of its own
institutional needs; and h.oping to carry out and coordinate
components of three action plans addressing vehicular
pollution, traffic safety, and road transport industry
efficiency. The ongoing policy-based action plans, prepared
under the Bank's previous sector project, are aimed at
substantially reducing environmental degradation and vehicular
accidents due to the country's rapidly growing motorization
and promoting improved policies to enhance the operational
efficiency of the road transport industry. The proposed
project would finance: (a) civil works subprojects to be
carried out under the Seventh Highway Plan to rehabilitate,
upgrade to paved standard, improve the safety and increase the
capacity of national and provincial roads and bridges; (b)
technical experts to assist DOH in developing, a long-term
investment and financing strategy and an associated
institutional development plan; and (c) equipment, technical
assistance and training to support the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (HOTC) and its Land Transport Department
(LTD) in preparing and implementing key items included in the
three action plans. Subprojects to be financed under the
project would be selected from the Seventh Plan on the basis
of procedures and economic and technical criteria agreed with
the Government.
Benefits:         Project support to improve the capacity and condition of
Thailand's national and provincial highway networks would
assist the Government to meet the country's surging demand for
road transport, relieve transport bottlenecks and sustain its
high rate of economic growth. The transport industry action
plan would similarly benefit the economy, while the
environmental and traffic safety action plans are expected to
yield substantial health benefits to the general public. The
institutional capacities of DOH, LTD and MOTC would also be
enhanced through project technical assistance.

Rligs:            The main project risk relates to action plan implementation,
which may take longer than expected due to the complexities
involved, the need to emphasize enforcement, and the relative
inexperience of MOTC and LTD in dealing with these matters.
To counter this possibility, technical assistance would be
engaged under the project to assist MOTC to prepare and
implement the various components and a coordinating unit would
be established to assist MOTC in the overview of action plan
components.

THAIIND
EQOT  HIHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
Economic and Sectoral Context
1.1         In 1990, Thailand had the world's fastest growing economy and a per
capita income that had more than doubled since 1981. GDP growth during 1986-90
averaged a spectacular 11.7% per annum. This rapid economic growth has resulted
in an explosive increase in road transport, with traffic rising by an average 14%
a year on the nation's major highways since 1986 and the vehicle fleet (excluding
motorcycles) expanding at an average rate of more than 10% a year since 1984.
Motorcycles, which comprise more than 60% of the total vehicle fleet, have been
increasing by 14% a year since 1984. Today, with some 7.6 million vehicles on
the road, road transport represents 88% of freight and 92% of passenger
transport. In the future, with the continued robust economic growth projected,
rising demand for road transport should continua, resulting in an expected
doubling of the vehicle fleet over the next 20 years and even faster increases
in traffic as vehicle utilization grows.
1.2         Substantial government investments  in road infrastructure have
facilitated the country's economic boom.   During its first four national
development plans (1965-81), the Government focused its road subsector activities
on the construction of a nation-wide network of major highways, resulting in the
growth of the paved network from 5,500 km in 1965 to about 25,000 km in 1981.
Under the Fifth and Sixth Plans, extension of the paved network continued,
reaching almost 40,000 km in 1990, wheni the public road network comprised about
18,450 km of national and special highways, 33,860 km of provincial roads,
132,500 km of rural roads and 14,700 km of municipal roads. At the same time,
the focus was increasingly shifting toward maintenance and rehabilitation, which
represented about 30% of road expenditures in the Fifth Plan period (1982-86) and
sowe 34% in the Sixth (1987-91).
1.3         Under the Sixth Plan, the Government also began to consider the
efficiency with which road infrastructure was being utilized and the rapidly
emerging environmental and safety problems associated with the growing vehicle
fleet. During this period, and in conjunction "-ith the Bank's Third Highway
Sector Project (Ln. 3220-TH, 1990), it prepared action plans in three areas--
vehicle emissions, traffic safety, and road transport industry efficiency,
establisning the direction of the Seventh Highway Plan (1992-96) and the emphasis
of Bank participation in the Plan, that is, to support implementation of Plan
investments and of key actions contained in the three action plans.
1.4         With the Seventh Development Plan, the Government will build on the
objectives of the Sixth Plan, i.e., to achieve maximum utilization of existing
infrastructure capacity while at the same time undertaking capacity-increasing
investments to relieve transport bottlenecks that constrain economic growth.
Specific transport sector goals of the Seventh Plan include: (a) construction of
highways to accommodate traffic increases; (b) an even distribution of
infrastructure investments in the country; (c) reduction of the environmental
damage and congestion related to traffic growth; (d) improvement to the structure



- 2 -
and pricing of infrastructure; and (e) streamlined budgetary and program
implementation procedures.
1.5         The lead agency in the road subsector is the Department of Highways
(DOH) in the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC).  DOH, now a mature
and efficient institution, is responsible for all n&tional and provincial roads.
Rural roads are largely handled by the 73 provinces and municipalities, under the
Ministry of Interior, with assistance from central government agencies like the
Accelerated Rural Development Office and the Public Works Department.  Road
transport regulations, including those for commercial vehicles as well as vehicle
safety and emissions, vehicle inspection and the setting and collection of road
user charges, are administered by MOTC's Land Transport Department (LTD). LTD
assumed many of these responsibilities in 1988 and consequently requires
substantial streagthening in some areas.
1.6         A description of Thailand's surface transport network, including
urban transport, is provided in Annex 1, and a detailed discussion of the road
subsector, with supporting tables, is given in Annex 2.
ExDerienge Under Past Loans
1.7         To date, the Bank has provided a total of about US$600 million for
12 highway projects in Thailand (see Annex 8). Implementation of these projects
has been largely satisfactory, mostly within kudgets and on schedule.   The
Project Completion Report (PCR No. 6205) for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan
1519-TH) indicates the achievement of all project objectives. Although a slight
cost under-run occurred, traffic growth was also less than expected, resulting
in an economic rate of return for the project of 20%, which was less than the 29%
forecast at appraisal but still satisfactory. The project also resulted in
important institution building and development of local consultants and
contractors. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR No. 8447) for the
Provincial Roads Project (Loan 2035-TH) specifically recognizes DOH's strong
performance in carrying out its road program. The PCR (No. 9542) for the Second
Provincial Roads Project (Loan 2311-TH) also notes the capabilities of DOH as
well as the success of the project in achieving its objectives.
1.8         DOH's increasing maturity and the new policy direction of the Sixth
Development Plan made it appropriate to shift from individual project lending to
a sectoral approach with the start of the Sixth Plan. After a somewhat slow
start, caused by temporary shortages of construction materials which necessitated
the rebidding of some contracts, implementation of the first two highway sector
projects (Lns. 2894 and 3008-TH, approved in 1987 and 1988, respectively) is now
progressing satisfactorily, with most of the works committed.   Completion of
disbursement under both projects is expected by mid-1992. Implementation of the
Third Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3220-TH, approved in 1990) is also on schedule,
and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1993.
1.9         The design of the proposed Fourth Highway Sector Project reflects the
Bank's positive experience in dealing with DOH over the years as well as the
lessons learned under projects supported in other transport subsectors,
particularly urban transport, in which implementation was more difficult (see
Annex 1). A Bangkok Traffic Management Project (Ln. 1638-TH), addressing traffic



-3
management aipects of Bangkok's urban transport problem, had high-level central
government support but foundered partly due to poor coordination of the many
entitles involved in the city's transport services and a lack of consensus on the
project from the various political levels of the city administration. Despite
significant differences, the proposed project and the earlier operation share a
broad multi-agency coverage since the proposed loan would support three action
plans to be carried out by a variety of agencies. Precautions were therefore
taken to gradually build a consensus on the action plans over the course of the
preceding two sector projects, to ensure involvement of the major implementing
agencies in actton plan preparation (para. 3.2), and to provide an effective
coordinating mechanism for action plan implementation (para. 4.13).
2. THE SEVENTH HIGHWAY PLAN
2.1         The proposed project is based on DOH's Seventh Highway Plan, which
will be used to guide the Department in Its investments and recurrent
expenditures for the national and provincial highway network throughout the five-
year Plan period (1992-96).  The Plan indicates a balance within and between
investments and recurrent expenditures to address already identified issues and
requirements. At the same time, flexibility is provided to allow adjustment of
annual targets to changes in fiscal and economic conditions as well as in road
use and road transport conditions.   The Plan was prepared on the basis of
adequate economic and technical criteria, procedures and related organizational
arrangements for the selection, engineering and implementation of individual
subprojects. 'n nominal monetary terms, the Seventh Plan, as summarized in Table
2.1 and detailed in Table 2.2, is about 3.5 times larger than the original Sixth
Plan (B 56,722 million) but only 1.5 times larger than the final Sixth Plan as
implemented (about B 135,000 million).

2.2         Recurrent expenses envisioned under the Seventh Highway Plan are
considered appropriate. This is particularly true of road maintenance which is
allocated higher amounts than under the Sixth Plan, starting with a 30% increase
between 1991 and 1992.   Together with the significant rehabilitation and
upgrading efforts proposed under the Investment Plan (see below), these increases
are considered sufficient to meet the additional maintenance requirements from
network increases (nearly 3% per year, but mostly at the low-volume end) and the
rapid traffl.c increases projected for the Plan period based on recent experience.
InvegtMgnt Plan
2.3         DOH's Investment Plan accountes for about two thirds (67%) of total
Seventh Plan road expenditures. Under the Investment Plan, summarized in Table
2.3 and detailed in Table 2.4, DOH proposes to shift its priorities from
rehabilitation to capacity increases.   Rehabilitation and strengthening of
existing paved roads, which together were allocated 54% of Sixth Plan
investments, would receive 36% under the Seventh Plan, while capacity increases,
allocated 33% of Sixth Plan investment expenditures, would receive 47% under the
Seventh.  Capacity would be increased through road widening (construction of
additional lanes on 3,600 km of roads) and improvement of interchanges (in 44
locations) of existing roads and the construction of controlled-access motorways
(198 km). This is appropriate since the surface condition and strength of the
trunk network have been brought to a very satisfactory level in the last several
years, while congestion on the main roads in the Central Region (i.e., the
Bangkok area) clearly indicates that network capacity is not keeping pace with
traffic requirements.

2.4         Of the total proposed investment costs of some B 136 billion, about
B 59 billion is carried over from the Sixth Plan, largely as a result of projects
added to the Plan during its mid-term review; some of these projects may not be
completed until 1994. It is also recognized that some of the Seventh Plan targets
will not be achieved until some two to three years after the end of the Plan
period.
2.5         The large Investment Plan is regarded by DOH as necessary to catch
up with the unexpectedly rapid traffic increases that have occurred since 1986
(dt an annual rate of some 14%) and to handle similar growth expected over the
next several years. However, the size of the Plan may need to be reduced in the
course of implementation due to the emergence of unexpected budgetary constraints
or inadequate implementation capacity.   Other potential constraints are the
construction industry's lack of interest in undertaking ptublic sector works in
a booming construction market and the substantial increase in land acquisition
costs for the major projects planned in the Bangkok metropolitan area.
Financing of the Highway Plan
2.6         Government budgetary allocations are expected to cover about 75% of
DOH's planned expenditures. The remaining funds required would be obtained from
foreign sources, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, and would be applied
mainly to tlo Plan's investment expenditures. The following table summarizes
expected financing sources for the Seventh Highway Plan.

2.8         If the financing resources available for the Seventh Highway Plan are
not sufficient to cover total Plan requirements, the Plan could initially be
reduced by scaling down or postponing subprojects for upgrading and constructing
new (low-volume) road links. To ensure the relevance and adequacy of the Plan,
during negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that the scope and
implementation of the Plan would be reviewed annually with the Bank by July 31,



* 8 -
1992 and by March 31 of each subsequent year of project implementation.
Agreement was also reached on the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation of
existing road activities over construction of new road activities during periods
of resource constraints.
3. ISSUES MD ACTIONS
3.1         The  primary  feature  of  the  proposed  project  would  be  the
implementation of actions and studies to address some of the main issues
identified in the subsector.  These issues, all fundamentally institutional,
relate to DOH's long-term ability to improve the efficiency of its management of
the highway subsector and the ability of MOTC and LTD to carry out their
regulatory responsibilities relating, in particular, to vehicular emissions and
noise standards, traffic safety, the road transport industry, and road user
charges. The Government, prompted by intense public pressure, is particularly
committed to reducing the vehicular pcllution and traffic injuries and fatalities
accompanying the surge in vehicle ownership and use. Viewing vehicle regulation
through inspection and enforcement as fundamental to (among other things)
improved vehicular emissions and safety, in 1988 the Government made LTD, under
the supervision of MOTC, responsible for the regulation of road transport and
road use, thereby centralizing what had been widely dispersed, and poorly
performed, duties. Strengthening of these institutions to effectively plan and
carry out an improved and expanded regulatory program is now being accomplished
through the implementation of three action plans focused on vehicle-related air
and noise pollution, traffic safety and road transport efficiency (Annexes 3, 4
and 5). Key components of the action plans would be supported under the proposed
project. Issues surrounding DOH as well as the appropriateness of current road
user charges would also be studied under the project, with the objective of
defining recommendations for appropriate institutional and policy changes for
future implementation.
3.2         The action plans, prepared in collaboration with the Bank under the
Third Highway Sector Project, were developed by a Coordinating Committee
including representatives of the various responsible agencies and chaired by the
Director General of LTD. The Fiscal Policy Office in the Ministry of Finance
oversaw the Committee's activities and represented the Committee at discussions
with the Bank of action plan components.
3.3         The action plans represent coordinated packages of policy and
regulatory reforms, procedural and institutional changes, and physical
improvements which would substantially improve conditions in the roads subsector.
The action plans directed at vehicular pollution and traffic safety are expected
to have major benefits for the urban population, in particular, by improving air
quality and decreasing injuries and fatalities caused by traffic accidents. The
action plan to enhance road transport industry efficiency would support continued
economic as well as social development. Implementation of some measures included
in or relating to the action plans has already been completed or is in progress.
The Government has also selected a program of priority items in each plan which
either lay the basis for further action or address critical, long-standing
issues.  These priority programs (Annex 6), along with other action plan items
to be selected, would be implemented and monitored under the proposed project.



9-
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the Bank's
annual review of the scope and implementation of the Action Plans for Reduced
Vehicle Emissions and Noise, Traffic Safety, and Increased Road Transport
Efficiency and consultation with the Bank on Action Plan activities to be carried
out during the coming fiscal year, paying due regard to the Bank's comments and
recommendations. Review of action plan implementation and consultation would be
carried out by July 31, 1992 and by March 31 of each subsequent project year, in
conjunction with the annual reviews of performance under the Seventh Highway Plan
(para. 2.8).
A. 1nj&JtotipnalCaDacaig L- DOH and LTD
3.4         DQ.   During the last decade, DOH has successfully improved the
operation and management of the road subsector through programs for: (a) the
development and installation of a modern and efficient maintenance management
system; (b) the development and country-wide installation of an equipment rental
system and the creation of a revolving fund for equipment replacement; (c)
improved and increased road maintenance; (d) construction of new training
facilities and implementation of an improved, expanded training program; and (e)
introduction of a road traffic safety improvement program, including elimination
of existing wblackspots.H Some of these programs will continue as integral parts
of DOH's operations and others as parts of the three action plans discussed
below. However, DOH still lacks a long-term strategy for development of the
national and provincial road network, as well as procedures for identifying
needed financial resources to fund identified investments or for assessing the
potential for private sector participation. In view of the high levels of road
transport demand expected in Thailand over the next 10 to 20 years (and the
increasingly complex problems likely to accompany that demand), DOH needs to turn
its attention to the long-term development of the network, especially of
motorways, in order to define and develop the institutional capacity and
operational tools required to nmanage the planning, financing, construction and
maintenance of the future network. The proposed project would support DOH in
this effort.
3.5         LTD.  The LTD is charged with regulating commercial and, as of 1988,
private vehicles. Its duties include route and operator licensing of commercial
vehicles and the setting of tariff ceilings for road transport, standards of road
vehicles and equipment, vehiclo safety and emissions inspections, and the setting
and collection of road user taxes. Due to difficulties in attracting staff with
transport-related training, the Department has many vacancies, primarily in areas
requiring tertiary education; some sections have only half of their staff
comkplement. Currently, about 700 of its total staff of 5,500 have university
training. LTD's new responsibilities for private vehicles and increased role in
vehicle inspection require it to fill the existing vacancies, to recruit
additional personnel and to provide continuous training. While the ongoing and
proposed Bank-supported highway sector projects include some training assistance
for LTD, much more needs to be done on both the vocational and tertiary levels.
Specifics of the Department's training requirements would therefore be identified
by technical assistance engaged under the project to assist LTD in implementing
selected action plan components.

B. Vehicular Emissions and Noise Standards
3.6         Bangkok as well as other large cities in Thailand suffers from severe
street-level air pollution due to the large number of vehicles and heavy traffic
conditions in the city.   The pollutants of greatest concern are suspended
particulate matter, especially respirable particulate matter, carbon monoxide,
lead,  and toxic air contaminants  such as benzene.   Levels of respirable
particulate matter on major streets are often double or triple those considered
safe, and are considered to be a major factor in causing and aggravating respira-
tory illnesses. Average blood lead levels in the general populace and in exposed
groups such as traffic policemen are also far higher than is safe. Traffic noise
levels, due primarily to poorly-muffled motorcycles, are extremely high.
3.7         Major sources of respirable particulate matter include two-stroke
motorcycles and three-wheel taxis (called "tuk-tuks"), and light- and heavy-duty
diesel vehicles. Host two-stroke and diesel vehicles emit significant visible
smoke, which tends to be confined near the major roads by adjoining buildings and
limits visibility to a few hundred yards during heavy traffic periods (which last
most of the day). Hydrocarbon emissions from two-stroke motorcycles are probably
also the major source of toxic air contaminants such as benzene, while lead and
carbon monoxide in the atmosphere are due almost entirely to emissions from
vehicles using leaded gasoline.
3.8         Since the expected future growth in the vehicle fleet will exacerbate
what is already an extremely serious situation in some areas, the Thai Government
has adopted an action plan to address the environmental degradation caused by
highway vehicles (Annex 3). Key elements of the action plan include: expanded
monitoring of pollution and noise levels, establishment of emissions standards
for new vehicles, supplying of unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel fuel,
encouraging alternative fuels, requiring "smokeless" oils for two-stroke
vehicles, improving vehicle inspections, and extending inspection requirements
to private vehicles. A number of measures have already been taken under this
plan, including the establishment of monitoring sites at major intersections, a
requirement for catalytic converters on new cars after September 1, 1993,
conversion of many taxis and "tuk-tuk" three-wheelers to liquified petroleum gas
(LPG), and supply of unleaded gasoline and increased importation of low-sulfur
diesel fuel while refinery modifications for domestic production of these fuels
are being carried out. Implementation of other priority items included in the
plan would be supported by the proposed project.
C. Traffic Safety
3.9         According to government statistics, traffic accidents in Thailand
rose by an estimated annual average of 14% during 1982-89, and traffic-related
deaths per 1,000 vehicles in 1989 totaled about 43.   In 1990, over 40,000
accidents and 6,000 fatalities were reported by the police.   However,  the
occurrence of accidents, injuries and fatalities is thought to be even higher
since accident records are often neither accurate nor complete. Various factors
are responsible for the high accident rate, including inappropriate design of
some road segments, poor vehicle condition stemming from inadequate maintenance,
and unsafe driver behavior owing to inadequate driver preparation and the use of



- 11 -
drugs and alcohol (especially by truck operators). Exacerbating the situation
is the wide mix of vehicles on the roads, including a high proportion of trucks
and buses mixed with motorcycles and the growing fleet of cars.
3.10        The Government has taken significant actions to reduce these problems
under the Sixth Highway Plan by, among other things: establishing the National
Safety Council in the Office of the Prime Minister to coordinate the traffic
accident reduction efforts of the various agencies involved; launching a DOH
"black spot* program, which includes road improvements and the provision of
traffic signals and signs, guardrails, pedestrian bridges, etc.; and outlawing
the use of amphetamines by truck drivers. The Cabinet has recently approved a
regulation that all vehicle operators must be covered by third-party liability
insurance, under which drivers with high accident records will pay higher
premiums or give up theib licenses. The Ministry of Interior is also drafting
regulations requiring use of helmets by motorcyclists to reduce the severity of
accidents.
3.11        Expanding upon these efforts, the four-year Traffic Safety Action
Plan (Annex 4) includes: (a) strengthening of the road safety organization
responsible for coordinating these activities; (b) design and implementation of
a computerized accident information system for the planning and follow-up of
accident-preventive activities; (c) expanded and improved vehicle testing; (d)
education of drivers and school children as well as promotion of the use of
safety features such as seat belts and helmets; (e) strengthened law enforcement
and traffic surveillance; (f) expansion of the "black spot" correction program;
and (g) improved ambulance and medical response to accidents.
D. Road TransRort Industry Efficiency
3.12        The largely privately operated trucking and inter-city and rural bus
transport industries have developed along with the expansion of the road network.
These industries are extremely important since about 88% of all freight movement
in Thailand is by road while inter-city buses transport over 50% of all inter-
urban passengers. Recent studies of the truck and bus industries have found them
to be highly efficient and effective in many respects, although needed
improvements were identified to liberalize regulations, improve the management
skills of operators, increase industry competitiveness and increase safety.
MOTC, through the LTD, is responsibl for administering the legislation governing
industry regulation.
3.13        MOTC and LTD have already introduced measures to upgrade drivers'
skills, besides computerizing their record and data-base systems. They are also
in the process of developing new proposals to update private and commercial
vehicle registration charges, encouraging private sector development of freight
terminals, and installing a computerized Management Information System (MIS) for
LTD.
3.14        The three-year Road Transport Industry Efficiency Action Plan (Annex
5) would address remaining weaknesses in trucking and bus operations through a
variety of actions.   Measures would be introduced for:  improved vehicle
classification and regulation; increased truck licensing charges and bus fare
liberalization; reduction of duties on the import of new vehicles and parts in



- 12 -
order to improve safety, emissions and efficiency; construction of freight
terminals; and training of drivers and company operators.
E. Road User Charges
3.15        Although the Government does not directly link the level of road-
related taxes to road expenditures, a DOH study has shown that total road user
revenues, principally from customs and excise duties, more than cover annual
expenditures for construction, maintenance and general administration of the road
network (Annex 2, Tables A7-A8). An analysis of the distribution of tax revenues
compared with the costs imposed on the network, in terms of physical damage, by
the various types of vehicles reveals that trucks, particularly heavy trucks, are
undercharged and do not pay adequately.   Furthermore,  while automobiles,
motorcycles and other light vehicles may contribute adequately with regard to
pavement damage, it is less clear whether thc related charges on these vehicles
represent the costs of congestion which they impose on the system.
3.16        The increasing need for more highway capacity, particularly for an
extended interurban motorway system, has spurred the Government's interest in
finding additional funds for highway investments, preferably from road users.
Fuel prices, while higher than the opportunity cost of refined products, are
lower than those in other Asian countries (Annex 2, Table A9). Also, the level
of traffic on many segments of the interurban road network would justify the
broader application of tolls. Currently, only a small number of road segments
have tolls, which were fixed about a decade ago and do not reflect rising costs
or the distribution of those costs by vehicle type. The Government is currently
acting to liberalize the setting of tolls, and MOTC will require support in
developing an appropriate formula for adjusting existing tolls as well as
extending their application.   LTD is also preparing proposals on changes to
vehicle registration fees which will better reflect the relative road costs of
the various types of vehicles.
3.17        Government concern for increasing revenues from road users provides
an opportunity for a more comprehensive look at road financing strategies for the
longer term and assessment of the various options for resource mobilization.
Such an analysis should also evaluate pricing/taxation options from the
perspective of the relative cost of collection, impact on congestion and
environmental concerns, and their relation to road deterioration costs by vehicle
type. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that DOH
would (a) prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish
to the Bank for the latter's review and comments, not later than December 31,
1993, a study on the road financing strategies and resource mobilization options
available to the Government and (b) thereafter, consult with the Bank with
respect to measures to be adopted and steps to be taken in order to implement the
said study's recommendations.

4. BANK PARTICIfElQ=
A. Prolegt Formulation
4.1         Over the past decade, the Government of Thailand has shifted its
focus from the construction of an adequate road network to serve socioeconomic
development within the country to the protection of past investments through
increased and improved highway maintenance and rehabilitation. During this time,
with the rapid growth of road traffic throughout the country and particularly in
the Bangkok area, a number of critical issues have emerged related most notably
to road safety, transport industry efficiency and the environmental impact of the
vehicle emissions and noise associated with high traffic flows. The Government
has recognized the importance of these issues and has already gone ahead with
some significant measures to address them. With assistance under the previous
Bank-assisted highway sector projects, the Government developed and began to
implement three comprehensive, policy-based action plans specifying priority
measures for further improvements in all three areas of concern (Annexes 3 to 5).
The proposed project, a logical continuation of the Bank's involvement in the
subsector, is designed to assist the Government in carrying out the action plans
as well as the investments proposed under DOH's Seventh Highway Plan (1992-96).
The loan, together with residual proceeds from the three previous highway sector
projects (Loans 2894, 3008 and 3220-TH), would finance a slice of about 3.1% of
total expenditures under DOH's Seventh Highway Plan or 4.6% of the Plan's
investment program.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.2         The Bank has for many years supported the development of Thailand's
highway network and has played a significant role in the development of DOH.
Today, DOH is an effective institution with qualified staff carrying out a
balanced program of construction and maintenance activities. As the need for
institutional strengthening of DOH lessens, the Bank's role has shifted to a
consideration of policy issues and strengthening of the capacity of MOTC and
other subsector institutions to address the issues identified.   The Bank is
acting as a catalyst on these issues and a source of technical support to the
Government on what are often complex and politically sensitive issues. It is
also serving to bring together the various agencies whose reFponsibilities
overlap on these issues in a political environment where official coordination
has been difficult.  Thus, while the proceeds of the proposed loan would be
directed mainly at investments to be carried out by DOH, the primary focus of the
project's policy and institutional thrust would be on MOTC and the more normative
subsector institutions like LTD.
C. Obiectives
4.3         The main objectives of the proposed project are to assist the
Government in improving the efficiency and safety of the country's road subsector
and in mitigating its environmental impact by: (a) supporting the preparation and
implementation of an economically justified program of investments for the
national and provincial road network; (b) assisting the implementation and
coordination of actions to substantially reduce environmental degradation and



14 -
vehicular accidents due to the country's rapidly growing motorization; and (c)
promoting improved policies to enhance the operational efficiency of road
transport and road use.
D. Descrigtion of Bank-financed Components
4.4         The project would finance the following components over about a five-
year period:
(a)   civil works subprojects for the rehabilitation, upgrading to paved
standard, and safety and capacity improvement of national and
provincial roads and bridges included in the investment program in
DOH's Seventh Highway Plan (1992-96), including subprojects started
under the Sixth Plan with financing from previous highway sector
projects and subprojects being initiated under the Seventh Plan;
(b)   technical assistance to DOH for the design of a long-term investment
and financing strategy and associated institutional development; and
(c)   equipment, technical assistance, studies and training to assist MOTC
and its departments in preparing and implementing key components of
three action plans to improve road traffic safety, reduce vehicle-
related air and noise pollution, and improve the efficiency of the
road transport industry.
Rehabilitation, Uograding. Safety lmprovements and Capacity Increases of Roads
and Bridges
4.5         Road SubDrojects. Works would be carried out in various parts of the
country on national and provincial roads where: (a) pavements are seriously
deteriorated; (b) earth and gravel roads need upgrading by simple methods such
as bituminous surface treatments; (c) accidents occur frequently due to faulty
road design; or (d) road width and other geometric standards are deemed
inadequate for the high and rapidly increasing traffic volumes resulting in
traffic congestion and uneconomic speeds. The design and scope of works would
be in accordance with standards acceptable to the Bank and would include: for
rehabilitation and upgrading--improvements of side and cross drainage, widening
and strengthening of pavements and shoulders; for safety improvements--the
elimination of black spots, provision of guardrails and improvement of pedestrian
crossings; and for capacity increases--expansion from two to four or more lanes
(including strengthening of pavements and shoulders, as required) and significant
improvement of intersections (including grade separation, as required). Works
would be carried out almost entirely on existing alignments.
4.6         Bridze Subprojects. Works would be carried out on bridges in various
parts of the country that have become bottlenecks for one or more of the
following reasons: (a) severe load limitations due to low initial design loads
or advanced structural deterioration; (b) width restrictions; or (c) hazardous
hydrological conditions. Works would be designed to agreed standards and would
comprise, as required, rehabilitation, strengthening, widening or full
replacement.



- 15 -             1
4.7         Degign and Supervision.  The design of some 2,500 km of roadworks of
various classes, some 15 major interchanges and 1,500 m of bridges would be
financed under the project. About one third of these works would be designed by
DOH's own staff and the remainder, requiring about 1,000 staff-monthi, by local
consultants.   Equipment for computer-aided designs would also be financed.
Supervision of road and bridge works would be carried out by DOH staff
supplemented by about 200 staff-months of local consultants and 50 staff-months
of foreign consultants for overall coordination.
4.8         In principle, any subproject, or part of a subproject, included in
the investment portion of the Seventh Highway Plan is a potential candidate for
Bank financing. However, a significant proportion of civil works subprojects to
be financed under the project has already been contracted, having been initiated
under previous Bank-supported highway sector projects.   New subprojects for
financing under the project would be selected annually based on procedures and
economic and technical criteria, including an economic rate of return of at least
12%, as agreed by the Government and the Bank under Ln. 2894-TH.  DOH procedures
f.or environmental screening and assessment of subprojects to be financed under
the proposed loan (and under DOH's Seventh Highway Plan) are considered
satisfactory and were followed under previous Bank-supported projects (see para.
4.33 and Annex 2, paras. 28-30). All subprojects proposed for Bank financing
would be reviewed by the Bank for compliance with the agreed procedures and
criteria, and found acceptable.
DOH Long-term Investment and Financing Strategy
4.9         The timely provision of highway infrastructure to support Thailand's
continued economic development and its evolving sectoral priorities requires
astute, long-range planning of investments and their financing. The DOW has
previously confined its planning to a five-year time horizon but now recognizes
that a longer view will be needed to respond to the rapidly growing and changing
demands on the highway network. The proposed project would therefore finance
consultants to assist DOH in developing the required highway investment and
financing strategy, including a review of road user charges (para. 3.17), and to
carry out a study of the associated institutional capabilities that the
Department will need to plan, execute and operate the future road network. Some
60 staff-months of foreign and 84 staff-months of local consultants services
would be provided.
Priority Action Plan Components
4.10        Reduction of Air and Noise Pollution.  Problems of air and noise
pollution due to traffic in Bangkok and other large cities in Thailand are
becoming acute (paras. 3.6-3.8). The air pollutants of greatest concern are fine
particulate matter emitted by diesel trucks and buses, two-stroke motorcycles,
and tuk-tuks; carbon monoxide emitted by gasoline vehicles; and lead from
combustion of leaded gasoline. The Government has begun to address vehicular
pollution under an action plan (Annex 3), and has already introduced some
significant reforms (para. 3.8). Further developments will include a study of
gasoline and diesel fuel specifications and refining capacity, development of
revised emissions standards and test procedures for the vehicle inspection
program, review of ambient air quality standards, and development of bid



- 16 -
specifications and tender documents for a demonstration fleet of 200 buses fueled
by compressed natural gas (CNG), to be purchased and operated by the Bangkok
Metropolitan Transit Authority (BHTA). The project would support the following
key elements of the action plan, among other items:
(a)    ghicle  emissionsm  measurement.  To  ensure  accurate  emissions
measurements for planning, monitoring and evaluation purposes, the
project would provide laboratory equipment for emissions measurement
and eight staff-months of technical assistance for the purchase and
installation of equipment, design and implementation of a test
program, and analysis of resulting data;
(b)   Establishmentof nlsw vehicle standards.  Consultant assistance would
be provided for a study to evaluate and recommend emissions
standards for new vehicles (four staff-months) and for the
formulation and drafting of standards and associated regulations for
test procedures, enforcement, warranties, etc. (four staff-months);
(c)  R&finement of vehicle insRection procedures.  Inspection and testing
for both safety and pollutant emissions are planned to be carried
out simultaneously, with vehicle registration linked to passing the
inspection.   Appropriate  test procedures  for both  safety and
emissions would be developed through a consultant study, followed by
testing at a prototype inspection facility.   The project would
finance equipment for the testing facility and consultants to carry
out the study (three staff-months) and assist in the testing,
documentation of the procedures finally selected, and development of
training materials and training programs (five staff-months);
(d)   LPG/CNG Rilot proJect.  The project would finance a consultant study
(six staff-months) to develop a commercialization plan for CNG- and
LPG-powered vehicles, including detailed plans and budgets for
potential demonstration projects--to be carried out in cooperation
with the private sector, and with government and/or donor support.
The study would also recommend emissions and safety regulations and
enforcement procedures to be adopted by LTD. The consultants would
also provide four staff-months of technical assistance to BMTA in
planning and carrying out their proposed natural gas demonstration,
and to other interested government agencies in planning for other
potential demonstration programs;
(e) Reduction of emissions from existing vehicles. Preliminary analyses
suggest that retrofitting or other measures may be justified to
reduce pollutant emissions from the existing vehicle stock,
particularly buses, heavy trucks, taxis, two-stroke motorcycles and
three-wheelers. The project would therefore fund a consultant study
(three   staff-months)   to   identify   potential   measures   for
retrofitting, and technical assistance in planning and implementing
the resulting programs (two staff-months); and
(f)   Traffic management.  To improve the flow of traffic in Bangkok and
thus decrease vehicle exhaust emissions, about 20 staff-months of



- 17 -
foreign and 30 staff-months of local technical assistance would be
financed (i) to assist in improving coordination and scheduling of
building construction activities and develop and implement on-site
measures to mitigate the adverse effects of planned major
construction projects on traffic flow; and (ii) to develop a
suitable traffic management strategy for the automatic traffic
control (ATC) system now being introduced in Bangkok, and to reach
agreement with  the police on responsibilities  for ATC  system
operation.
4.11        Road Traffic Safety.  Technical assistance as well as training and
minor items of equipment would be provided under the project to assist MOTC, LTD,
DOH and the Ministry of Education in carrying out priority items included in the
Road Safety Action Plan (Annex 4). Project support would be provided for the
following, among other things: (a) che design by MOTC of an efficient road safety
organization and a long-term road safety program; (b) improvements to existing
information systems by MOTC to facilitate collection and analysis of safety-
related data; (c) establishment by LTD of an effective vehicle inspection system
and development of an implementation strategy for vehicle testing; (d) traffic
safety education for children by the Ministry of Education; (e) improved law
enforcement and traffic surveillance by DOH; and (f) improved identification of
blackspots by DOH. Correction of black spots would be carried out under the DOH
Investment Plan.
4.12        Road Transport Industry Efficiency.  Technical assistance would be
provided under the project to address key engineering and training needs included
in the action plan to improve road transport industry efficiency (Annex 5).
Regarding engineering aspects of the plan, the technical assistance would help
to: review and update the current vehicle weight and dimension limits; prepare
a truck classification system; and develop more detailed design rules for buses
and trucks, mainly those that are manufactured locally. The technical assistance
for training would help to develop training curricula and materials and to
deliver training courses for HOTC and LTD staff, basic management courses for bus
and truck company operators, and general training of bus and truck drivers.
4.13        Action Plans' Coordinating Unit. Due to the large number of agencies
and organizations involved in action plan preparation and execution, MOTC would
establish a small Action Plans' Coordinating Unit (APCU) in its Department of
Planning under the Office of the Permanent Secretary to oversee management and
coordination of the various components of the three action plans, including
assistance in procuring equipment and consultantr, reporting on implementation
progress, maintaining accounts, and coordinating among the Bank and the agencies
and ministries involved in action plan implementation. For this purpose, MOTC
will supplement its own staff with about 42 staff-months of foreign consultants
services. Selection of a consultant to assist the APCU, under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, is a condition of loan effectiveness. An understanding
was also reached with the Government that formal employment of the said
consultant would take place by August 31, 1992 at the latest.

E. Cost Estimate and Financint
4.14         Along with residual proceeds of the three previous highway sector
loans,-the proposed Bani.. loan of US$177.5 million would finance about 3.1% of
DOH's Seventh Investment Plan (Table 2.3).   Table 4.1 shows the cost of the
various components to which project funds would be applied, and Table 4.2 shows
the same cost by type of expenditure.   All costs are net of taxes.   The
allocations shown are tentative, and funds could be transferred among categories
if yearly needs change.   The foreign exchange component for civil works is
estimated at about 50%, assuming that execution will be mostly by local
contractors as has been the case in recent years. For consultancy services, the
foreign exchange component is estimated at about 30% for design, 50% for
supervision and 70% for technical assistance.   Disbursements, especially for
capacity increases, are designed to be concentrated among a limited number of
large contracts, minimizing the required number of contracts to be directly
monitored under the loan.   Bank financing of specific subprojects therefore
exceeds the foreign exchange component of these works and services but is well
below the overall foreign exchange requirements of the highway program.

Since the proposed loan is expected to finance some subprojects that are already
under way and consultant assistance for the APCU should be recruited as soon as
possible, retroactive financing under the Bank loan, not to exceed US$10 million,
is recommended for expenditures on civil works and consulting services made after
September 20, 1991 and before the date of the Loan Agreement.

F.  Implementation of Bank-financed Activities
4.16        The project is expected to be completed in about five years since
many of the proposed contracts are already signed and under way, and the slow
start-up of previous projects (para. 1.8) has been substantially improved.  As
under the previous three highway sector projects, MOTC would be responsible for
executing most parts of the project through its Departments of Highways (DOH) and
Land Transport (LTD). DOH would be responsible for all civil works components,
while LTD would execute selected activities under the action plans for road
traffic safety, vehicular emissions control, and road transport industry
efficiency. The remaining action plan activities would be carried out by the
respective agencies concerned and coordinated by the APCU (para. 4.13).
4.17        DOH, LTD and APCU would annually submit a list of new subprojects to
be agreed with the Bank. All civil works subprojects to be financed under the
project would be evaluated on the basis of criteria agreed under previous Bank-
assisted highway sector projects (para. 4.8), including the requirement of a
minimum rate of return of 12%.   This rate of return, which represents the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand, has been selected to ensure the economic
viability of proposed investments while enabling the Government to take into
account factors such as broad geographical coverage of needed investments,



- 21 -
poverty alleviation and equity considerations. During negotiations, agreement
was reached with the Government on (a) the selection of subprojects to be
financed under the project using technical, environmental and economic criteria
satisfactory to the Bank, with such criteria to include a minimum economic rate
of return of 12% for civil work subprojects, and (b) consultation with the Pank
prior to introducing any modification to the agreed subproject selection
criteria.
4.18        Project supervision by the Bank would require about 88 staff-weeks
over the life of the project, of which about 21 staff-weeks would be at
headquarters for review of progress and audit reports, procurement actions, etc.
and 67 staff-weeks would be in the field. This input is higher than the average
but is dictated by the complex nature of the three action plans, which require
considerable input by experts.   Supervision would be provided by a highway
engineer, transport economist and specialists in fields covered by the action
plans.    The  borrower's  contribution  to  supervision  would  include  daily
supervisioh of implementat'on, the preparation and submission to the Bank of
reports on various subjects, including implementation progress, and coordination
of the Bank's field visits. A project supervision plan is provided in Annex 7.
Supervision of the project's civil works program would be coordinated with ADB
and OECF, the other major external agencies supporting implementation of the
Seventh Highway Plan (para. 2.6).
G. Procurement of Bank-financed Inputs
4.19        Procurement of project inputs would be carried out as shown in the
following table:

/a    Financed by the Government, except for US$800,000 from the Japan Grant
Fund for preparation of the next phase of action plan implementation.
4.20        Except for small contracts with an estimated cost of less than US$0.3
million each and an aggregate total value of US$10 million, civil works financed
under the Bank loan would be carried out under contracts procured on the basis
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. Prequalification of contractors would be carried out annually, with
invitations issued in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Prequalified contractors
would be allowed to bid on any contract or group of contracts for civil works but
would be eligible for awards only up to the value of works for which they are
prequalified. The small contracts exempt from ICB procedures would be procured
under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Interested foreign contractors would be allowed full participation in LCB
procurement and would not be required to register in provinces where they want
to place bids.
4.21        Equipment would be procured on the basis of ICB, except for minor
items estimated to cost up to an aggregate of US$1.0 million which would be
procured on the basis of international or local shopping by obtaining at least
three quotations from foreign and/or local suppliers.



- 23 -
4.22        Consultants  would be  employed  in  accordance  with  the  Bank's
Guidelines for the use of consultants.  Outline terms of reference for this
assistance are included in the project file.
4.23        DOH and LTD would be  the main implementation and procurement
agencies. Both have ample experience in carrying out procurement under Bank-
financed projects as this will be the thirteenth highway project implemented by
DOH and the fourth with LTD involvement. Both agencies use standard documents
for tendering and contracting. Minor components of the three action plans would
be carried out by agencies with less experience in project implementation,
including procurement, but these agencies would be assisted in procurement and
other implementation matters by technical advisers in the APCU.
4.24        A Country Procurement Assessment Report has not been prepared.
However, in the context of this project, the Borrower's procurement regulations
and procedures for projects financed by external loans were reviewed by Bank
staff. These have been found acceptable for all methods of procurement proposed
under the project, with the exception that: (a) negotiations with the lowest
evaluated bidder are stipulated when the bid price is higher than the Engineer's
estimate for the cost of the works; and (b) approval procedures for contract
award have too many, and unnecessary, steps that take very long to complete (DOH
has recently increased the bid validity period to 270 days for this reason).
During negotiations, the Government reaffirmed its intention to comply fully with
the provisions of the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits, specifically paragraphs 2.46 and 2.60 thereof.   To that end, the
Government has undertaken not to request any bidder to alter its bid after the
first bid has been opened and to seek the Bank's approval before holding any
negotiations with bidders,  rejecting all bids or soliciting new bids.   In
addition, the Government confirmed that DOH would review the current government
practices for approving the award of contracts, with a view to streamlining and
accelerating this process, and that in about two years time, DOH would review,
modernize and agree with the Bank on standard procurement documents used for
Bank-financed projects.
4.25        Under the project, Bank-financed works contracts above US$4.0 million
each would be subject to prior review by the Bank; this review is expected to
cover about 70% of estimated total contract values.   EquipmerZ contracts or
packages estimated to cost US$200,000 and above would also be subject to prior
review, covering an expected 80% of the estimated total contract values. All
contracts for consultancy services would be subject to prior review.
H. Disbursement
4.26        Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would be made against
applications based on contracts for subprojects eligible for Bank financing as
follows:
(a)   Civil Works:
(i)   50% of total expenditures for rehabilitation, upgrading to
paved standard and traffic safety improvements; and
(ii) 80% of total expenditures for capacity increases;



- 24 -
(b)  ggods:  100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory cost); and 80% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally; and
(c)   Consultant Services and Training: 100% of total expenditures.
4.27        To facilitate disbursement, the project would use the Government's
established internal revolving fund system which enables the Controller General 's
Department to advance funds from its own resources to line agencies for
expenditures in both local and foreign currencies. When project expenditures
reach US$50,000, the Controller General's Department will batch the withdrawal
applications and submit them to the Bank for disbursement. Disbursement for civil
works and equipment contracts costing less than US$200,000 per contract and
disbursement for training would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).
4.28        A schedule of estimated disbursements (Table 4.5) has been prepared
on the basis of a tentative implementation schedule prepared by DOH.   The
projected disbursement profile for the proposed Bank participation is broadly in
line with DOH's recent performance and somewhat faster than the disbursement
profile for previous transport projects in Thailand since a significant amount
of procurement has already been carried out or is under way.  The Loan Closing
Date would be December 31, 1997.

I. Monit2rinz and Auditing
4.29        DOH and LrD would be responsible for administering most contracts
under the proposed loan. These agencies would keep records of all procurement
documents (including bids and proposals and their evaluation and contract awards)
as well as official decisions on each agreed subproject, showing accumulated
expenditures, monthly payments and other administrative data. Based on these
records, the agencies would regularly prepare reports showing this information,
as instituted under the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH). The Bank would
reserve the right to inspect and review the documentation maintained on
individual contracts by the agencies and would be sent copies of documents on
request.
4.30        The annual consultations on the highway program and budget and on the
action programs would provide the major opportunity for reviewing progress of the
irnvestment plan for national and provincial roads and the implementation of the
proposed project. Monitoring and supervision of the project would focus on the
following: (a) the evolution and subsequent confirmation of the annual programs
and their financial and physical targets for the road investment and maintenance
programs; (b) the progress made in pursuing the institutional and subsectoral
objectives of the project included in the action plans for road traffic safety,
pollution control, and road transport industry efficiency; and (c) the
implementation progress of Bank-financed subprojects. A set of key indicators
would be established to measure the effectiveness of the action plans: for road
traffic safety - annual changes in the rate of accidents (number of accidents per
1,000 vehicles and 10,000 population), including the number of injured and dead
(number of fatalities per 1,000 vehicles and 10,000 population), and property
damage costs (average cost of property damage per accident); for air and noise
pollution control - annual changes in the level of pollutants (ambient levels of
carbon monoxide, lead and particulate matter) emitted by vehicles; and for the
vehicle inspection system - annual changes in the rate of failure to pass
inspections.
4.31        During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that:
(a) the implementing agencies would keep separate accounts for the proposed
project; (b) the project accounts, including documentation for SOEs, would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, with the audit
also including a separate opinion on SOEs used as a basis for disbursement; and
(c) the detailed audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within nine months
of the end of each government fiscal year.
J. Environmental Impact of the Project
4.32        Project support to the ongoing Action Plan to Reduce Vehicle
Emissions and Noise Pollution would have a salutary effect on the environment.
Thailand's rapidly increasing motorization has been accompanied by serious health
hazards posed by high levels of vehicular emissions and noise in urban areas.
The dangerous effects of respirable particulate matter, high lead levels and high
carbon monoxide levels are now of growing concern to the population at large.
The Government has recognized and begun to alleviate this situation through the
introduction of lead-free gasoline and improved smokeless lubricants as well as
the mandating of tougher noise level standards. Action Plan components to be



- 26 -
carried out under the project would further address these issues through the
review of fuel and ambient air quality standards, the development of more
stringent emissions standards, vehiclo testing, and the introduction of measures
to reduce vehicular noise pollution in the country's metropolitan areas,
particularly Bangkok.
4.33        DOH has confirmed that previously agreed procedures for environmental
assessment (EA) would be applied for all new subprojects under the Seventh
Highway Plan. These procedures, which are fully consistent with the Bank's EA
requirements, call for the screening of all projects for their environmental
impacts at the feasibility study stage and incorporation of any needed mitigation
measures in the project design. Full EA reports, following guideline terms of
reference previously agreed with the Bank, would be carried out for all projects
entailing new rights-of-way or expected to have a significant environmental
impact. DOH has provided EA screening summaries for all ongoing projects for
which Bank financing is committed or proposed under the project. These projects
mainly involve rehabilitation and widening of roads on existing alignments and
within existing rights-of-way. EA screenings of additional subprojects to be
financed by the Bank would also be submitted and found acceptable prior to Bank
funding of such subprojects.   DOH will routinely monitor the subprojects to
assess the effectiveness of any mitigation measures included in their designs and
will include any necessary additional measures for environmental protection in
supplemental investment programs or the maintenance budgets for such projects.
Bank supervision missions will also review the results of the screening process
and the coordination between DOH and the Office of the National Environment Board
for all highway sector subprojects, not only those financed by the Bank.
Although no resettlement is anticipated for subprojects currently identified for
financing under the proposed loan, copies of Bank's Operational Directive on
resettlement of persons displaced by project works have already been provided to
DOH, which has assured that the said directive will be followed for all Bank-
financed subprojects.
K. Economic Justification
4.34        The bulk of investments in DOH's development plan involve such items
as new construction, rehabilitation and paving, all of which lend themselves to
straight-forward economic analysis. All of these components are subjected to
feasibility studies based on criteria reviewed and approved by the Bank. Cost
estimates are based on detailed engineering studies, and the benefits consist of
savings in vehicle operating costs, maintenance cost savings, and diverted or
generated traffic benefits, whenever applicable. Time savings are not included,
except in cases where congestion is a factor. Vehicle operating cost savings are
based on the terrain in which a particular subproject is located and on the
traffic composition and growth. DOH maintains a country-wide system of regular
traffic counts and updated vehicle operating costs. The minimum economic return
for subprojects to be included in the plan is established at 12%, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand. Subprojects already committed under the
plan have rates of return ranging from about 18% to 42% for ongoing works
involving capacity increases and, as shown in Annex 9, 13% to 66% for new
subprojects involving other types of improvement. All subprojects to be included
in the proposed project will be selected in accordance with the methodology which
has been approved and reviewed periodically by the Bank. During negotiations, the



- 27 -
Government agreed on the methodology to be used and that such methodology will
not be changed without consultation with the Bank and that no subproject will be
iAplemented for which the economic return is less than 12% (para. 4.17).
4.35        The economic assessment of the other main project component, i.e.,
the action plan items relating to the environment, road safety and road transport
industry efficiency, is more complex and, by necessity, of a qualitative rather
than quantitative nature. These items are deemed to have substantial positive
benefits, not only to the transport sector, but also to the improved health and
well-being of the population at large. As such, the benefits cannot be easily
quantified, although the key indicators developed to monitor the progress of
action plan implementation (para. 4.30) will provide objective measurements of
some benefits of action plan components.
L. Proiect Risks
4.36        There is no serious risk that DON will falter in the implementation
of its investment program as road works to be carried out under the program
largely follow the alignments of existing. roads, minimizing property disturbances
and land acquisition for rights-of-way. The main project risks relate to action
plan implementation. Implementation of some action plan measures could be delayed
due to the complexities involved, the need to emphasize enforcement, and the
relative inexperience of LTD and MOTC in dealing with such matters. To counter
this possibility, extensive use of technical assistance would be made under the
project to prepare and implement the various components and a coordinating unit
would be established to assist MOTC in the overview of action plan components.
5.  AGREMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1         During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on:
(a)   Mi) its annual review with the Bank of the scope and implementation
of the Seventh Highway Plan and of the Action Plans for Reduced
Vehicle Emissions and Noise Pollution, Traffic Safety, and Increased
Road Transport Efficiency by July 31, 1992 and by March 31 of each
subsequent year of project implementation and (ii) at the same time,
annual consultation with the Bank on activities to be carried out
under the three Action Plans during the coming fiscal year, paying
due regard to the Bank's comments and recommendations (paras. 2.8
and 3.3);
(b)   the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation of existing road
activities over new road construction activities during periods of
resource constraints (para. 2.8);
(c)   (i) DOH's preparation, under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank, and furnishing to the Bank for the latter's review and
comments, not later than December 31, 1993, a study on the road
financing strategies and resource mobilization options available to
the Government and (b) thereafter, its consultation with the Bank



* 28 -
(d)   (i) the selection of subprojects to be financed under the project
using technical, environmental and economic criteria satisfactory to
the Bank, with such criteria to include a minimum economic rate of
return of 12% for civil work subprojects, and (ii) consultation with
the Bank prior to introducing any modification to the agreed
subproject selection criteria (para. 4.17); and
(e)   accounting and auditing arrangements which are satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 4.31).
5.2         During negotiations, the Government also reaffirmed its intention to
comply fully with the provisions of the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, specifically paragraphs 2.46 and 2.60 thereof. To that
end, the Government has undertaken not to request any bidder to alter its bid
after the first bid has been opened and to seek the Bank's approval before
holding any negotiations with bidders, rejecting all bids or soliciting new bids.
In addition, the Government confirmed that DOH would review the current
government practices for approving the award of contracts, with a view to
streamlining and accelerating this process, and that in about two years time, DOH
would review, modernize and agree with the Bank on standard procurement documents
used for Bank-financed projects (para. 4.24).
5.3         Selection of a consultant to assist the APCU,  under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, is a condition of loan effectiveness (para.
4.13). An understanding was reached with the Government that formal employment
of the said consultant would take place by August 31, 1992 at the latest.
5.4         With the above assurances, conditions and confirmations, the proposed
project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$177.5 million equivalent
to the Kingdom of Thailand for 17 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.

THAILA
EORH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
The Surface Transgort System
iji±hways
1.    The highway subsector and its administration are discussed in detail in
Annex 2.
kRaias
2.    The railway system is administered by the State Railway of Thailand (SRT).
The rail network comprises about 3,800 route-km of meter gauge lines: 90 km are
double-track and the remainder single-track. Three main lines (3,046 km) radiate
from Bangkok: the Northern Line to Chiang Mai; the Northeastern Line to Nong Khai
on the Laotian border and to Ubon Ratchatani; and the Southern Line to the
Malaysian border at Padang Besar and at Sungai Kolok. In addition, there are
nine branch lines (total length 746 km), including a direct connection between
the Eastern Line and the country's second biggest deep-sea port at Sattahip.
3.    In recent years, passenger traffic has been growing at about 3% a year to
reach about 87 million passengers in 1988. Freight traffic growth has stabilized
at about 6 million tons a year. Freight mainly comprises bulk cargo such as
cement, petroleum, clinker and rice products.
4.    SRT plans to construct new rail lines during and after the Seventh Plan
period. Currently under construction are three lines serving the Eastern
Seaboard. Double tracking of about 210 km is proposed, as well as the upgrading
of 1,200 km of track to 100-lb hardened welded rail and significant rolling stock
modernization. An inland container depot is planned at Lat Krabang, next to the
Eastern Line. Institutionally, SRT is implementing a program to reduce its
increasing budget deficits and to "break even." This is being achieved through
a combination of marketing efforts, cost containment and efficiency measures,
accompanied by improvements in service and tariff increases.
5.    Since 1950, the Bank has supported SRT's development through six projects.
The most recent oppration is the Railway Efficiency Improvement Project (Ln.
2872, 1987) to improve ORT's operational efficiency and financial viability, with
a focus on strengthening the railway to compete with other transport modes for
the traffic it can serve more efficiently and economically. Studies carried out
under the project indicated the need for a long-range master plan for the
railway's development, and preparation of this plan, which would cover the next
20 years, would-be carried out-tinder a recently initiated study, to be completed
in May 1992. The Qovernliment has requested Bank participation in the study, and
unallocated -funds under Ln. 2872 will be used to finance foreig4 technical
experts to assist the Thailand Development Research Institute Foundation with the
study. The ultimate aim of the study is to restructure the railway to satisfy
the country's long-term economic and social needs.

Inland Waterways
6.    Thailand has a well-developed inland waterway system covering well over a
third of the country and comprising over 1,600 km of navigable waterways. Most
of the system is in the northern corridor between Bangkok and Uttaradit along the
Chao Phrya and Nan Rivers. The remainder is along the Mekong River on the Thai-
Laotian border. However, unrestricted year-round transport is possible on only
about 100 km of the Chao Phrya. Navigation in the other sections is seasonally
limited, forcing barges to detour to slow and costly routes, reduce payloads or
cease operations during the low-water season. Administration and maintenance of
the rivers is the responsibility of the Harbor Department in the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MOTC).   Fleet development is expected to be
undertaken by the traditionally vigorous and competitive private sector, which
handles most of the barges, terminals and loading points.
7.    To utilize the system's potential for low-cost transport, shallow river
sections were deepened, with Bank assistance, under the Inland Waterways and
Coastal  Ports  Project  (Loan  1889-TH,  1980).    The project  also  included
construction of two new river ports and promotion of a new barge design and
operation.   A project completion report prepared for the project (No. 8408,
SecM90-283, March 7, 1990) found that implementation of the project was
significantly delayed by slow procurement and land acquisition procedures as well
as a lack of continuity in thLe supervising Bank staff. The project also failed
to achieve its objectives of reducing transport costs in the country's northern
corridor and of increasing barge traffic because the river sections deepened
under the project were not maintained and barge owners felt that use of these
sections was dangerous.   With only small increases in barge traffic on the
rivers, the project's rate of return was much lower than expected, 6% compared
to 20% estimated at appraisal. In retrospect, both the Bank and MOTC should have
provided better support to the Harbor Department which, when implementing the
project, was still a relatively weak institution.
Ports
8.    Thailand has some 35 shallow-draft "coastal" ports which vary greatly in
size. Frequent maintenance dredging, and in some cases capital dredging, is
required. There are two commercial deep-water ports for dry cargo: the Port of
Bangkok on the Chao Phrya and a former naval facility at Sattahip on the Eastern
Seaboard.  The Port of Bangkok consists of the Klong Toei wharves, which are
operated by the Port Authority of Thailand (PAT), and other privately owned and
managed facilities.   Sattahip is also operated by PAT.  In addition,  the
Government has constructed deepwater ports at Laem Chabang and Map Tah Pud to
support industrial development of the Eastern Seaboard.
9.    From 1950 to 1970, the Bank helped finance three ports projects, all aimed
at developing the Port of Bangkok.   In 1980, the Bangkok and Sattahip Ports
Project (Ln. 1918-TH) was approved, with the aim of relieving congestion at
Bangkok Port by improving Sattahip Port and constructing a container freight
terminal in Bangkok.  Due to a government decision not to implement the main
project works, only US$6 million of the US$47 million Bank loan was disbursed.
The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR, No. 7761, SecM89-603, May 15, 1989)



- 31 -
Annex l
Page 3
found that project preparation had gone ahead without complete consensus on the
project's desirability among the government agencies involved. Consequently, the
major changes in institutional responsibilities expected under the project failed
to materialize -PAT resisted private sector participation in the subsector and
the Royal Thai Navy rejected Sattahip's commercialization. Projections of Klong
Toei traffic used in the project analysis were also overly optimistic, causing
the project to be about five years premature. Only when congestion at Bangkok
Port reached a crisis situation in 1988 could the Government proceed with what
had previously been the politically unacceptable commercialization of Sattahip.
Urban Transgort
10.   Thailand's  rapid  economic  growth  has  increased  and  spread  traffic
congestion and its impacts. Bangkok's traffic conditions are among the worst in
Asia. Severe congestion is the principal symptom, with long journey times, high
fuel consumption and heavy pollution. Rapid growth of the human and vehicle
populations, divided responsibility among various agencies with no coordinating
authority, and inadequate investments have contributed to the growing seriousness
of the siituation over the past 10 to 15 years. However, despite the growing
seriousiness of the problem, ongoing efforts to improve the situation are
inadequate. Construction is under way of a Second Stage Expressway (32 km), the
Rama IV Viaduct, an elevated addition to the Don Muang Tollway (16 km) from the
airport to central Bangkok, and 10 overpasses. These and other planned projects
will largely be built along existing thoroughfares and will severely disrupt
traffic during construction.
11.   The Government is also considering three mass-transit system projects: (a)
the Hopewell Elevated Rail System (60 km) and Elevated Expressway (57 km) for
SRT; (b) Skytrain Elevated Mass Transit System (34 km) for the Expressway and
Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA); and (c) an Elevated Transit System for
BMA. The Government recently commissioned a consultant to investigate physical
conflicts among these projects.
12.   In addition, BMA is about to let a contract for the first stage of a
computer-controlled Area Traffic Control System which will include 143 traffic
signals and a proposed second stage to include 92 intersections. This system
potentially has a valuable role to play in assisting the management of traffic
in Bangkok.   However, agreements between the Traffic Police and BMA on the
division of operating responsibilities have yet to be reached. Measures to
facilitate this agreement would be supported under the proposed project through
its support to the action plan to reduce vehicular pollution and noise.
13.   A long-standing constraint to expansion of the urban transport system has
been difficulties associated with land acquisition due to the very low level of
compensation paid.   This problem has led to underinvestment in local and
distributor roads, which greatly contributes to congestion and has encouraged
inefficient and low-density land development. To avoid the need to acquire land,
the agencies responsible for urban road projects often confine their investments
to corridors where they already have rights-of-way, as mentioned in para. 10.
This has further contributed to a unbalanced development of the network.

14.   A  Bank-financed Bangkok  Traffic  Management  Project  (Loan  1638-TH),
completed in 1985, addressed traffic management aspects of the urban transport
problem in Bangkok but, according to the related PPAR (No. 7068, SecM88-19,
January 6, 1988), with uncertain results. Since traffic management involves many
agencies, with varying priorities, it is more of a political and managerial issue
than a technical problem. Although the Bank prcject had verbal support from the
most senior levels of government, it lacked support from some 15 bodies involved
in the city's transportation services, which tended to act independently because
no agency had overall responsibility for urban transport in Bangkok. Aside from
the major institutional problems that undermined implementation, the economic
analysis of project investments was also judged inadequate, while a restructuring
of the project shortly after approval was found ill-advised and poorly prepared.
In view of the Bank's experience under this project, particular attention was
paid during preparation of the proposed project to consensus building and the
establishment of effective mechanisms for coordinating implementation of the
three action plans, which would involve various agencies.
15.   The valuable, if painful, lessons learned by the Bank from the Bangkok
project have also been applied in our more recent assistance to the Government
with urban transport. The Bank, on behalf of UNDF, supervised the Seventh Plan
Urban and Regional Transport Project (SPURT) which prepared recommendations for
policies and investments to be included in the Government's Seventh National
Economic and Social Development Plan (1992-96).   This study identified the
potential for further traffic management and showed that a form of traffic
restraint coupled with the introduction of mass-transit was the only means to
significantly reduce traffic congestion and benefit the environment.

THAILAND
FOUITH HIGHWiY SECTQR PROJECT
The Highway Subsector
A. The Highw_y Network
1.     In 1990, Thailand's public road network totaled about 199,500 k-. and
comprised about 18,400 km of national roads (including about 190 km of high
volume, limited access special highways), 33,900 km of provincial roads and about
132,500 km of rural roads (Tables Al and A2 to this annex and Map IBRD 22122R1)
as well as some 14,900 km of municipal roads, of which about 11,900 km were in
Bangkok (including some 30 km of expressways with full access control). The
national road system connects the principal towns and regional centers throughout
the country, The provincial system connects provincial centers and other towns
with the national road system and interconnects the rural roads; it is a very
extensive system and provides the only direct access to a substantial proportion
of villages and rural population. The rural (or tertiary) roads connect the
remaining villages and rural population with the provincial and national road
systems. The Northern Region has the greatest length of national and provincial
roads, with a share of about 32%, followed by the Northeast Region with 26%, the
Central Region with 25% and the South with 17% (Table A3). For rural roads, the
approximate regional distribution is 22%, 44%, 21% and 13%, respectively.
2.     Since 1965, the national road system has grown by less than 2% a year,
from about 14,000 km to 18,400 km; however, the proportion of paved road has
increased from 36% to about 94%.  Over the same period, the provincial road
system grew from about 8,300 km to 33,900 km, averaging nearly 10% a year, while
the proportion paved has increased from about 5% to 67%. Despite the rapid rate
of improvement, expansion of the provincial system has barely kept pace, as the
length of unimproved provincial roads has grown only slightly, from about 5,500
km to 5,900 km.
3.     The national road system is now generally well defined and almost entirely
improved and paved.   Most roads are adequately aligned and have sufficient
capacity for present traffic; however, increasing traffic on several sections,
particularly the main routes radiating from Bangkok, is creating congestion which
requires significant capacity increases through an increased number of traffic
lanes and improvement of intersections. Construction in the medium terms will
be confined to a small number of additional links to complete the network and to
shorten some routes.
4.     The  provincial  road  system  has  expanded  rapidly,  mostly  through
reclassification but also through new construc ion. While future expansion of the
provincial system is likely to be much slower in the future, there is still an
existing need to upgrade the nearly 5,900 km of "unimproved" provincial roads,
virtually all of which serve as rural access roads. These roads have not been
constructed to defined engineering standards and often lack permanent drainage



- 34 -
Annex_
Page 2
structures and have little, if any, gravel surfacing; many sections are
impassable during rainy weather.
5.    The rural road system is also extensive, with an average density of
about 1 km per 3.9 km2. The roads are of low standard, average about 4.5 m
wide, and have traffic of less than 50 vehicles per day (vpd). Most are
unimproved or gravel roads. In the dry season, about two thirds are usually in
falr condition and one third are poor. In the rainy season, many roads become
impassable. When justified by significant traffic levels, rural roads are
reclassified as provincial roads and responsibility for their maintenance and
improvement is transferred to the Department of Highways.
B. Road Transport
Motor Vehicle Fleet
6.     The motor vehicle fleet, including motorcycles, grew from about 3.4
million units in 1984 to about 7.6 million units in 1990 (Table A4). Excluding
motorcycles, the increase was from about 1.4 million units to over 2.8 million
units, with an average annual growth of 10.4%, while motorcycles grew at 14%.
Cars and pickups represented about 60% of the total fleet of four-wheel
vehicles, with commercial vehicles--buses, trucks and other utility
vehicles--making up the remainder.
7.    As estimated in the Seventh Plan Urban and Regional Transport (SPURT)
Study, carried out in preparation for the Seventh Development Plan, car
ownership in Bangkok is still low, at about 72 per thousand population in
1989, with motorcycle ownership at 99 per thousand. A doubling of car and
motorcycle ownership is expected over the next decade. Regional car ownership
is much lower than in Bangkok but varies greatly among the cities, with higher
levels in the more affluent tourist areas like Chiang Mai and Phuket.
Throughout the country, road transport is dominant, carrying about 92% of
passengers and 88% of freight.
Iraffic
8.    Motorized traffic (excluding motorcycles) on all national and provincial
roads rose from about 26 billion vehicle-km in 1985 to an estimated 68 billion
vehicle-km in 1990, representing an annual increase of about 20%. About 50% of
this traffic was concentrated in the Central Region within a 150-km radius of
Bangkok, highlighting Bangkok's leading role as the center of government,
commerce, industry and transport. Over 90% of nonurban traffic (excluding
motorcycles) is concentrated on national and provincial roads, with the
remainder on rural roads. The national and provincial roads show great
variations in traffic density. About 15% of the roads, mostly national
highways, accounts for about 55% of the traffic, and about 35% of the road
length accounts for about 70% of the traffic. In 1990, some 12,000 km of paved
national and provincial roads had traffic of less than 1,000 vpd (Table A5),
18,400 km had traffic between 1,000 and 6,000 vpd, while about 3,500 km had
traffic over 6,000 vpd. Medium and heavy trucks in general account for
between 25% and 60% of the traffic volume. Only some 800 km of the network



- 35 -
Annex 2
Page 3
have four lanes or more, while the 3,500 km of roads with traffic over 6,000
vpd should have four lanes or more. DOH's draft Seventh Highway Plan calls
for an increase in the number of lanes of some 3,600 km of national and
provincial roads.
Trucking Industry
9.    About 600,000 trucks now operate in Thailand, most of which are owner-
operated although a few firms have several hundred vehicles each. The
Government-owned Express Transport Organization (ETO), which has a monopoly
for certain services, has about 1,000 trucks. The trucking industry has been
assessed under a two-phased study completed in 1988 with financing under
previous Bank-assisted projects. Recommendations of that study have been used
in developing the Transport Industry Efficiency Action Plan (Annex 5).
10.    Truckinz Regulation. Although the trucking industry is essentially free
of economic regulation, periodic and regular pressure is applied for more
regulation, purportedly to prevent destructive competition within the industry
or with the railway and to reduce the high percentage of empty truck hauls,
which waste fuel and other resoarces. Some of these initiatives attempt to
prevent competitors from entering the free transport market. Regulatory
inroads have, however, been made by ETO, which has trucking monopolies for:
(a) transport of fre'Lght landed at Klong Toey port; (b) a number of
Government-specified commodities; and (c) until recently, transit traffic to
and from Laos. ETO has expanded over the years, despite generally acknowledged
poor performance in cost and services. The size of ETO's work force (over
4,000 staff) has protected it from reform. ETO, however, represents a small
part of the trucking industry as its total tonnage transported is only about
2% of total road freight transport demand.
11.   A peak-period truck ban has been in force in Bangkok of about 20 years.
The industry appears to have adjusted its practices to fit in with the ban,
but has vigorously resisted regular attempts to have the times and area of the
ban expanded. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) has recently
received three proposals for the establishment of truck terminals in outer
parts of Bangkok. Use of truck terminals was endorsed by the SPURT study, but
only if truck operators are not compelled to use the terminals.
12.   Truck Overloading. Overloading of trucks is fairly common and has
implications for road safety, maintenance and the enforcement of road traffic
laws. Truck overloading, however, is essentially limited to the major bulk
commodities, which are carried on ten-wheel trucks largely on the major truck
corridors. There are ten permanent truck weighing stations in the national and
provincial highway system, all operated by the Department of Highways (DOH)
with the participation of the Highway Police Division. In addition, DOH has
some 35 mobile teams with portable scales. The Trucking Industry Study
concluded that existing axle loads and gross vehicle weight limits should be
increased, although to date the Government has retained the existing maximum
axle weight of 9 tons. The composition of the truck fleet is, however,
changing. While six-wheel trucks are the main offenders for overloading,
increased use is being made of multi-axle trucks which, while permitting



- 36 -
Annx 2
Page 4
heavier lcads, may also distribute the loads so that maximum axle loads are
acceptable.
Inter-city aWO Rural Bus Transport Industry
13.   The country's inter-city and rural bus fleet consists of about 60,000
vehicles, about half of which are light buses (vehicles with more than seven
passengers) and half are heavy buses. In general, the buses are operated by
very small operators with few management skills. A Study of Intercity and
Rural Bus Transport (SIRB), carried out under the Second Provincial Roads
Project (Ln. 2311-TH), estimated that in 1989 the industry had the following
structure: one company, the Government-owned Transport Company (TC), had 592
buses; 20 firms had more than 100 buses; 400 firms had an average of about 24
buses each; 45,300 firms had one vehicle each; and 490 license holders had no
vehicles.
14.   For historical reasons, there is a high incidence of affiliation or
"middle men" in the industry. The SIRB estimated that 58% of all bus license
holders own no buses of their own but rather subcontract the rights to operate
to affiliates. Only 14% of all license holders own all the buses operated
unider their licenses. As policy, TC operates only 9% of the 6,600 buses
permitted on their licenses. The SIRB concluded that this extent of
affiliation in the industry should be reduced over time as it is a major
barrier to encouraging the development of larger operators with better
management and operational skills.
15.   As for the trucking industry, a two-phased study was carried out to
assess thp efficiency and effectiveness of the bus industry. The study's
recommendations have been used in developing the Transport Industry Efficiency
Action Plan (Annex 5).
C. Highway Administration
16.   MOTC, through DOH, is responsible for the administration, planning,
construction, and maintenance of the national and provincial road systems
(Chart 1). MOTC's Land Transport Department (LTD) is also responsible for
initiating and administering legislation on the use of roads, including the
licensing of commercial vehicles. The 73 provinces and municipalities, under
the Ministry of Interior (MOI), are generally responsible for the rural roads,
assisted by a number of MOI agencies.
Degartment of Highways
17.   DOH is responsible for the classification of all roads and road systems,
for the initiation of legislation concerning the construction, maintenance and
protection of all roads and for the preparation of programs and budgets for
the development and maintenance of national and provincial roads. While other
government departments and agencies also build and maintain roads for special
purposes, DOH's highways activities cover about 80% of total investments in
the sector. The Department's budget for 1987-90 is shown in Table A6.



- 37 -
Annex 2
Page 5
18.   DOH is a well-organized and well-operated agency, which functions with
considerable autonomy. Its organization (Chart 2) is adequate, comprising 19
divisions at the Bangkok headquarters, 15 field divisions and 82 highway
districts located in the provinces. In addition, the Highway Patrol Police,
under the operational control of the Police Department, is under DOH for
administrative and budgetary purposes.
19.   DOH's staff of about 7,000, including about 1,200 professionals, is
adequate to carry out its functions and responsibilities. The professional
staff, 700 of whom are engineers, is largely capable and experienced. Most of
the staff are civil servants, with their remuneration determined by government
salary scales.
20.   Over the last decade, DOH has gradually improved its training facilities
and programs. This effort has culminated under the ongoing Bank-assisted
highway sector projects which have financed a new training center at DOH
headquarters and another at Chon Buri. These projects have also financed a
significant amount of equipment and training aids as well as consultant
services to assist in the review and revision of course contents and
curricula. In the past few years, about 125 courses have been given annually,
attended by over 5,000 staff. DOH's present training facilities and program
are considered adequate for its expected operations during the next few years,
although further training needs will be identified with the defirAtion of
DOH's long-term strategy and institutional capacity, to be carried out under
the proposed project.
Department of  Land Transport
21.   The LTD's main responsibilities are the regulation of road transport and
road use, including route and operator licensing of commercial vehicles and
the setting of tariff ceilings for road transport, standards of road vehicles
and equipment, vehicle safety and emission inspections and the setting and
collection of road user taxes. LTD's organization (Chart 3) is adequate for
the discharge of its present duties, with 11 divisions at the Bangkok
headquarterr and 72 provincial offices. It has about 5,500 staff, of whom
about 3,000 are involved in private vehicle registration, driver licensing and
related functions conferred on LTD after it took over responsibility for
administering the Motor Vehicles Act in 1988. Of the balance of the staff,
about 700 have college degrees. LTD has difficulty in attracting suitably
qualified staff, particularly those with previous training in transport-
related matters. As a result, staffing levels of many LTD Divisions,
primarily in areas requiring tertiary education, are well below their
permitted maximum; some sections have only half of their normal staffing.
22.   LTD's new responsibility for private vehicles and increased role in
vehicle inspection and enforcement require the Department to fill existing
staff vacancies with trained personnel and in some areas to recruit additional
staff. Recruitment of additional staff as well as continuous training of new
and existing staff will also be needed in conjunction with the upcoming
introduction of LTD's computerized Management Information System (MIS), if the
system's potential is to be realized.



- 38 -
A=x2
Page 6
23.   Despite efforts to increase its capabilities, LTD needs further
strengthening in order to keep pane with the country's rapidly increasing
motorization and road use. Ongoing Bank-assisted highway projects are
providing LTD with training and equipment for vehicle inspections while the
proposed project would finance technical assistance and equipment to
strengthen LTD's staff in specified functions.
24.   A greatly expanded training effort is, however, needed. A program should
therefore be prepared to address both the vocational and tertiary training
needs of LTD staff, using a range of training delivery methods to reach the
various levels of the organization. The latter might include: (a) overseas
observation trips for senior managers; (b) short courses for new staff and
refresher courses for existing staff, accompanied by manuals and texts in
Thai; (c) post-graduate training study assistance for selected staff; and (d)
possible support for relevant training programs at local universities. In
particular, formal training courses are needed in: transport planning,
administration, and economics; vocational areas such as improved vehicle
inspection; use of computers at a basic and advanced level; automotive
engineering; control of vehicle noise and exhaust emissions, etc. The main
objective of the program should be to assist the Department effectively
fulfill its increasingly important role as a manager and administrator of the
nation's vehicle fleet and its use.
D. Hihway Planrning and Environmental Assessment
25.   Planning. The DOH Planning Division prepares its highway development
programs and drafts annual budget proposals for national and provincial roads,
on the basis of highway sector objectives included in the Government's
five-year development plans as well as proposals put forward by DOH field
offices, the provincial authorities and other ministries and departments.
Prior to being accepted, all project proposals are subjected to a field
reconnaissance, during which DOH collects data for a preliminary assessment of
the works required, their cost and project economics. The Planning Division
then ranks the proposals in approximate order of priority and prepares a draft
development p'r based on economic criteria. For smaller projects,
particularly those financed wholly by the Government, little further
preparation is undertaken, other than detailed engineering. For major
construction projects, detailed feasibility studies are carried out, usually
by consultants due to DOH's limited resources. To date, DOH has relied on
joint ventures of foreign and local consultants to help in preparing its main
work programs; however, with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, it is
now establishing a modern pavement management and planning system that will
allow it to be self-sufficient in planning, although local consulting
assistance will be required at times of peak workloads.
26.   Draft five-year development plans prepared by DOH for national and
pzovincial roads (and by MOI for rural roads) are reviewed by the inter-
ministerial Land Transport Coordination Committee, under MOTC, to ensure
adequate coordination and balance. The draft plans are then reviewed by the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) for the size of the
total program and its relationship to national priorities. The plans must then



- 39 -
Annex 
Page 7
be approved by the Cabinet. After approval, the plans are periodically
reviewed and revised to reflect changed priorities and availability of funds.
27.   DOH is now proposing to look beyond its previous five-year horizon and
to begin long-term investment planning. With assistance from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), DOH has prepared a strategic plan for
development of a motorway network of over 4,000 km, besides considering some
of the designs required. The proposed project would provide DOH with technical
assistance to begin its long-range planning and to identify possible sources
of investment financing, including the tolling of motorways and the potential
of private sector participation.
28.   Environmental Assessment.  At the feasibility study stage, all DOH road
projects are screened for their potential environmental impact by the
environmental section of DOH's Planning and Programming Division. The Division
uses an environmental assessment (EA) checklist to determine which subprojects
require full impact analysis. The checklist is an input to DOH's design
process, supplemented by detailed studies of identified issues as necessary.
DOH has been provided with World Bank guidelines on EA requirements for
refining its checklist, as appropriate, and the Office of the National
Environment Board (ONEB) has requested a Cabinet resolution instructing DOH to
strengthen the EA process. Preparation of full environmental analyses will
continue to be on a case-by-case basis until a more definitive set of criteria
are agreed between DOH and ONEB. ONEB is also proposing that budget procedures
be revised to provide for necessary impact mitigation measures as part of each
future project budget, a principle which the Bank strongly supports. The Bank
will be advised of the result of ONEB's request for a Cabinet resolution
expanding EA review and mitigation requirements for highways as well as any
resulting modifications to DOH's established EA procedures.
29.   DOH provided EA screening summaries for all ongoing projects for which
Bank financing is committed or proposed under the Fourth Highway Sector
Project. DOH has agreed that all such projects would be routinely monitored
to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures designed for each project
and to include any necessary additional measures for environmental protection
in supplemental investment programs or the maintenance budgets for such
projects. DOH has stated that such an approach is a routine part of its
operations. Bank supervision efforts should review the results of the
screening process and the coordination between DOH and ONEB for all highway
sector subprojects, not only those financed by the Bank.
30.   DOH intends to apply previously agreed EA procedures for all Seventh
Plan projects. These procedures require the screening of all projects for
environmental impacts during the feasibility study and any necessary
mitigation measures incorporated in the design of each project. For all
projects to be developed on new rights-of-way and those enhancement or
rehabilitation projects judged to have a significant impact, a full EA report
will be prepared using guideline terms of reference previously agreed with the
Bank and other donor organizations. DOH has agreed that a review of guideline
terms of reference would be undertaken in light of the Bank's recent
publication of a "Sourcebook for Environmental Assessment," which includes



- 40 -
hnne^_2
Page 8
revised recommendations on the scope of work by sector and sample terms of
reference.
E. Highway Financing and Road User Charges
31.   Highway Finlancing.  The highway subsector is financed from (a) general
budgetary revenues and (b) foreign loans and grants. Road user taxes are not
earmarked, except for the relatively small proceeds from vehicle registration
fees, which are distributed among the Police Department and the local
governments. Sections of three roads are currently operated as toll roads, and
DOH plans to institute tolls on another three roads. In recent years, external
funding of investments for national and provincial roads has amounted to
around 9% of total expenditures and about 15% of road construction and
improvement costs. The ADB, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF)
and the World Bank have been the principal sources of external financing and
are expected to remain so under the Seventh Plan.
32.   The increasing need for more highway capacity, particularly for an
extended interurban motorway system, has caused the Government to seek
additional sources of financing. Since traffic levels on the proposed four-
lane roads are normally sufficient to justify tolls, consideration is being
given to extending the use of tolls on DOH roads. Currently, tolls are used
on three sections of the DOH network radiating from Bangkok, but the toll
rates have been maintained at Baht 3 for an average 50 km since they were
first set about a decade ago. The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of
Thailand (ETA) imposes tclls on its network of urban expressways, including a
recent Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme to encourage private financing
of expressway development. These toll rates are considerably higher than
those of DOH. Recognizing the potential for tolling, the Government is taking
steps to establish a more rational approach to toll rate setting, and MOTC is
expected to become responsible for proposing appropriate toll levels. There
is thus a need for assistance in developing a methodology for determining such
toll rates.
33.   Road User Charges.  Although the Government does not directly link the
level of road-related taxes to road expenditures, a DOH study has shown that
total road user revenues, principally from customs and excise duties, more
than cover annual expenditures for construction, maintenance and general
administration of the road network (Tables A7 and A8). An analysis of the
distribution of tax revenues compared with the costs imposed on the network,
in terms of physical damage, by the various types of vehicles reveals that
trucks, particularly heavy trucks, are undercharged and do not pay adequately.
Furthermore, while automobiles, motorcycles and other light vehicles may
contribute adequately with regard to pavement damage, it is less clear whether
the related charges on these vehicles represent the costs of congestion which
they impose on the system. No analysis has been carried out on the use of road
taxes to encourage greater fuel efficiency and environmental improvements in
vehicles and their use which could enhance the effectiveness of recent
regulatory initiatives on these issues. It should be noted, however, that
fuel prices, the principal instruments for such objectives, are lower in
Thailand than in neighboring countries (Table A9).



- 41 -
Annex, 2
Page 9
34.   LTD is currently reviewing registration charges for all vehicles and
will present proposals to the Ministry of Finance. The proposed charges will
take into account the purchase price of the vehicle and its engine capacity.
LTD's preferred option would greatly increase charges for all vehicles (by
about three times), particularly for heavy vehicles, and would be
automatically updated each year (see Annex 5). This proposal together with
the changing policies on toll roads suggests the timeliness of a study which
would not only review government options for resource mobilization in the
sector but would also assess these options in terms of the revenues generated
(both public and private) as well as the cost of their collection, their
impact on congestion and environmental concerns, and their relation to road
deterioration costs by vehicle type.
F. Highway Engineering and Construction
35.   DOH's Location and Design Division is responsible for the engineering of
national and provincial roads. The division undertakes a subs'-ntial part of
such work itself, employing consultants when needed but particularly for
externally financed projects. Almost ..11 the firms engaged in detailed
engineering are Thai, since d-nestic consultants have expanded in numbers and
capability in recent years. Foreign consultants, employed only to a limited
extent and chiefly on specialized studies, usually operate in joint venture
with Thai consultants and employ only a few key foreign staff.
36.   DOH has a range of geometric design standards for national and
provincial roads which are appropriate to the road class, terrain and traffic
volumes. It has also established design standards for use by the MOI agencies
charged with this task. For the design of flexible pavements and overlays, DOH
uses the U.S. Asphalt Institute's method, one of the most conservative methods
in common use, taking into account observed and measured existing condition
and traffic volumes and estimated loadings projected for the next seven years.
However, designs for 15 year traffic loadings are also prepared, and the
initial (seven year) thickness determined so that the additional pavement
thickness required for carrying the traffic from year 7 through year 15 is
within a practical range for asphaltic concrete overlays. The result is that
pavements are overdesigned when compared to practices in most other developing
countries.
37.   DOH, through its National Highways and Provincial Roads Construction
Divisions, is responsible for construction of national and provincial roads.
Provincial road construction by DOH includes the improvement of existing
provincial roads and of some rural roads to be incorporated into the
provincial road system. About 90% of DOH construction is by contract. The rest
is by force account, usually for training purposes in eight training centers
set up with bilateral aid. Rural road construction is now also predominantly
by contract. Some small projects, undertaken by the provinces, districts and
groups of villages, are largely constructed by force account with a high
proportion of hand labor.

39.   The Thai contracting industry has evolved during the past 20 years or so
from infancy to maturity, and in 1985 the Thai Contractors' Association had
574 members. The industry's growth is partly due to a 1964 decision of DOH to
increase the volume of highway construction by contract and to reduce its
force account works. Many domestic firms are now fully capable of undertaking
typical highway projects, so that under the three most recent Bank-financed
projects, competition by foreign firms virtually disappeared except as joint
venture partners wLth local firms. Thai contractors have in general performed
satisfactorily and the quality of work has usually been good. The evolution of
the domestic industry can be attributed to the initiative of local
entrepreneurs, fostered by the Government's policy of using competitive
bidding to award contracts for an overwhelming proportion of its large and
continuous stream of road works. International competitive bidding by
prequalified firms is normally reserved for contracts financed by external
sources and for specialized construction work. Construction supervision is
usually carried out by DOH, which, over the years, has developed an efficient
system to coordinate project execution. Local and foreign consultants are used
extensively on foreign-financed projects, with the role of foreign consultants
confined to overall management and assistance with special problems.
G. Highway Maintenance and Rehabilitation
40.   DOH is responsible for maintenance of the national and provincial road
systems while maintenance of most rural roads is the responsibility of the 73
provinces, often with assistance from MOI and the municipalities. Roads for
the operation of irrigation projects are maintained by the Royal Irrigation
Department, and some national defense roads, mainly in the frontier areas, are
maintained by the army.
41.   DOH's maintenance activities are planned and supervised by its
Haintenance Division and carried out by its 15 field divisions and 82 field
districts. Most routine maintenance operations are performed directly by the
field districts, and periodic maintenance is done by contract under the
supervision of the field divisions and districts. Large-scale foreign-financed
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works are carried out by contract and
supervised by DOH headquarters.
42.   DOH's ability to organize and perform road maintenance has greatly
improved over the last ten years. A highway maintenance study carried out in
1976 under the Fifth Highway Project established the framework for the
maintenance of national and provincial roads. In 1978-81, under the Sixth
Highway Project, technical assistance was provided to help DOH set up an
internal maintenance equipment hiring system (the Revolving Fund); the
system's goals are to improve the efficiency of equipment management and
utilization and to provide for the prompt supply of spare parts and funding of
the regular replacement of worn-out equipment. Although limited operation of
the fund began in 1983, the fund was not fully operational until 1988 when the
required legal, administrative and financial arrangements had been completed.
43.   DOH, assisted by consultants, has also been developing a Pavement
Hanagement System (PMS) to help its Maintenance Division in assigning



- 43 -
Annex 2
Page 11
priorities for maintenance of paved roads under its control. Development and
countrywide introduction of the system was delayed by various technical and
institutional problems, but with the help of technical assistance provided by
ADB these problems have been overcome and a modern and efficient system is
expected to be operational in early 1992.
44.   The national and provincial paved network is in reasonable condition. In
1990, some 62% of the paved network was rated good, 20% fair and 18% poor
(Table A3), but the condition of the network's high-volume corridors is
somewhat better. Nonetheless, an important part of the system is approaching
the end of its design life and is increasingly in need of major repairs and
rehabilitation as the network ages and as traffic volumes and loadings
increase much faster than anticipated at the design stage. Furthermore, until
about 1985, expenditures on road maintenance and rehabilitation were often
below the levels needed to prevent general deterioration of the road network.
While the overdesigning of pavements (para. 37) counteracts some of the
pavement damage incurred, DOH estimates that during each of the next five
years, some 1,200 km of the network will need to be rehabilitated and about
1,000 km upgraded to paved standard; this indicates that more than 4% of the
network will annually require major improvement during the Seventh Plan
period.
45.   DOH's road maintenance expenditures were inadequate until about 1985
when expenditures began generally to match requirements. Maintenance
expenditures proposed for the Seventh Plan amount to about US$4,500 per km in
1992 and increase to about US$8,000 per km in 1996. Together with the
significant amount of rehabilitation and upgrading works planned during the
Seventh Plan period, these allocations are considered satisfactory.

FOTH HIHWAY SECTOR PROJEQ T
Action Elan to Reduce Vehicle Emissions and Noise Pollution
The Pr,bl&
1.    Bangkok and Thailand's other major cities suffer from severe street-
level air pollution, primarily due to the large and rapidly-growing number of
vehicles and heavy traffic conditions typical in urban areas. The pollutants
of greatest concern are suspended particulate matter, especially respirable
particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), lead, and toxic air contaminants
such as benzene, all of which are directly emitted from vehicles. Along the
major roads where pollution is greatest, pollutant concentrations present a
significant threat to health. Noise levels along the main roads are also
extremely high. However, unlike other heavily-polluted cities like Mexico City
and Los Angeles, the levels of photochemical smog and other regional-scale
pollutants such as NO2 are modest, and not yet of major concern.
2.    While air pollution in Thai cities is largely limited to the major
roads, it is still a matter of grave concern. A significant fraction of the
urban population lives and/or works along the major arteries, and are thus
exposed to high pollution levels for much of the day. In addition, the high
levels of traffic congestion in Bangkok and the fact that the urban road
layout forces nearly all traffic onto the main roads mean that even those
inhabitants who do not live or work along major roads are exposed to these
unhealthful conditions for many hours each day.
3.    Particulate matter. Exposure to high short-term levels of suspended
particulate material has been linked to increases in illness and death from
respiratory causes. Increases in respiratory mortality have been associated
with annual geometric mean particulate levels exceeding 100 micrograms per
cubic meter (pg/M3), and increased respiratory illness with annual levels of
30-100 pg/H3. Annual average particulate levels at a number of monitoring
stations in Bangkok range from 80 to 200 pg/H3, far exceeding the Thai air
quality standard of 100 pg/M3 (the comparable U.S. standard is 75 pg/H3).
Short-term measurements of particulate concentration at curbside frequently
exceed 400 pg/H3. Although no direct measurements of particulate size distri-
bution are available, it is suspected that most of the suspended particulate
material lies in the respirable size range of less than 10 microns (PN10).
Particles in this size range are considered especially damaging, since they
can bypass the body's filter system and deposit deep in the lungs.
4.    The major sources of respirable particulate matter in Bangkok are smoke
from two-stroke motorcycles and three-wheel taxis, from heavy-duty diesel
trucks and buses, and from light-duty diesel trucks. Vehicles with two-stroke
engines require lubricating oil to be mixed with the intake charge to lubri-
cate the cylinder. Much of this oil fails to burn in the engine, and is
emitted in the form of oil droplets in the exhaust, forming a blue or gray
smoke. Diesel particulate emissions are primarily soot formed during the



- 54 -
hnnex 3
Page 2
combustion process, together with adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates, and other
constituents. Soot particles are responsible for the characteristic black
smoke emissions from diesels. In addition, both diesel and gasoline vehicles
in poor mechanical condition can emit large amounts of particulate matter in
the form of vaporized lubricating oil (blue smoke). At present, most of the
two-stroke and diesel vehicles on the road in Thailand emit significant
visible smoke, and thus significant particulate emissions. Due to poor
maintenance, a significant minority of these vehicles are grossly excessive
smokers. Smoke tends to be confined near the major roads by buildings on each
side, and smoke levels along major roads during heavy traffic periods (lasting
most of the day) frequently limit visibility to a few hundred meters.
5.    PM10 emissions from vehicles can be minimized by establishing strict
particulate emissions standards for new diesels, imposing strict periodic
inspections and on-road enforcement to identify vehicles that are smoking due
to poor maintenance, re-engining existing diesel vehicles with engines meeting
emissions standards (including engines using alternative fuels, such as
natural gas), and either requiring the use of low-smoke lubricating oils in
two-strokes or (preferably) eliminating them entirely.
6.    Lead. Lead is a cumulative, systemic toxin with effects on blood
pressure regulation and the nervous syscem. Exposure to atmospheric lead is
usually through the gastrointestinal tract as a result of consuming dust
containing lead particles. This exposure route is most important in young
children, who tend to crawl and put things in their mouths. At sufficiently
high levels in the blood (above about 60 pg/deciliter), lead acts as an acute
toxin, damaging kidneys, the nervous system, and the brain. However, changes
in enzyme chemistry, statistically significant effects on intelligence test
results in children, and blood pressure levels in adult males have been demon-
strated at blood lead levels as low as 15-25 gg/dl. For comparison, average
blood lead levels in the Thai population are about 15-27 pg/dl, and newspapers
have reported average blood lead levels in Bangkok in excess of 40 pg/dl in
both children and adults. If these reports are correct, then a large fraction
of the population is being exposed to dangerously high lead levels, with
adverse effects on central nervous system development and intelligence in
children, and on the incidence of hypertension and related maladies in adults.
7.    Data on ambient lead levels are available only for Bangkok. Although the
measured levels are well within the Thai air quality standard of 10 pg/M3, and
even the U.S. standard of 1.5 Vg/M3, these standards are not adequately
protecting the health of the population. This is perhaps due to the fact that
Thais spend far more time on the streets, in close proximity to heavily-
trafficked roads (and thus to lead emissions) than do people in most developed
countries. In the United States, regulators have moved increasing toward a
zero-tolerance policy for lead, as evidence of damaging effects has accumulat-
ed at ever-lower levels of exposure. The dominant source of ambient lead
aerosol is the combustion of lead antiknocks in gasoline; the most effective
control technique is to reduce or eliminate the use of these compounds,
achieving required octane levels instead through the use of high-octane
blending agents such as ethers, or by increased processing during gasoline
refining.

Page 3
8.    Besides airborne lead, humans are exposed to lead through drinking water
and food (although some of the lead in food may also originate as airborne
lead, especially in Thailand, where food marketing, cooking, and eating often
take place near the street). Thus, even eliminating lead in gasoline will not
eliminate lead exposure but will help to reduce it significantly.
9.    Q. When inhaled, CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxy-
hemoglobin. This deactivates the hemoglobin molecule, preventing the transport
of oxygen through the body and reducing the oxygen supply to sensitive tissues
such as the brain, heart and blood vessel linings. The results of moderate CO
toxicity include shortness of breath, increased blood pressure, headaches, and
difficulty in concentration. CO effects are most significant in pregnant wom-
en, young children and those suffering from heart or respiratory disease. CO
effects are also cumulative over short periods such as a day; the longer the
period of exposure, the lower the concentration required to produce a signifi-
cant effect.
10.   Although ambient monitoring in Bangkok has not shown excessive CO
levels, curbside emissions measurements have shown CO concentrations above
Thai and U.S. standards, and it is suspected (based on measurements in other
cities) that actual CO exposure of vehicle occupants and pedestrians on major
traffic arteries may be significantly higher than is safe. The long hours
spent in traffic by many of the population would tend to aggravate the risk of
any given level of CO exposure.
11.   CO is emitted primarily from gasoline vehicles, especially those in
which the air-fuel mixture is set too rich. Average CO emissions can be
reduced significantly by periodic checks of the air-fuel ratio for existing
vehicles, by establishing CO emissions standards and adopting advanced fuel
metering control for new vehicles, and by converting existing gasoline
vehicles to gaseous fuels such as LPG and compressed natural gas.
12.   Other air pollutants. The population is also exposed to pollutants like
SOx, NOx, and toxic air contaminants such as benzene and formaldehyde. SOx is
produced by combustion of sulfur-containing fuels, primarily diesel. NOx is
produced by both gasoline and diesel vehicles as a byproduct of combustion.
Emissions of toxic air contaminants are due either to unburned fuel or to
products of incomplete combustion, and are produced by both gasoline and
diesel vehicles. Two-stroke vehicles are an especially important source of
fuel-derived toxic compounds such as benzene, since they typically emit 10%
and 30% of their total fuel consumption as unburned hydrc.carbons.
13.   Noise. Traffic noise in urban areas in Thailand is primarily engine
noise from heavy-duty trucks and buses and from motorcycles, many of which
have had their mufflers tampered with to reduce their effectiveness. Because
of the low average traffic speeds, especially in Bangkok, noise from vehicle
motion (wheels, air motion, etc.) is relatively minor. The most effective way
to reduce traffic noise would be to establish and enforce strict noise
standards, especially for in-use vehicles. This would require periodic
inspections to ensure that mufflers had not been tampered with, supplemented
by on-road enforcement actions to identify and cite the worst offenders.

Thg governments Plan to Addregs the Problem
14.   The Royal Thai Government (RTG) has adopted an action plan to address
the air pollution problems caused by highway vehicles. Appendix 1 gives a
tabular summary of this plan. Key elements of the plan include: expanded
monitoring of pollution and noise levels, establishment of emissions standards
for new vehicles, supplying unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel fuel,
encouraging alternative fuels, requiring "smokeless" oils for two-stroke
vehicles, improving vehicle inspections, and extending inspection requirements
to private vehicles. A number of measures have already been taken under this
plan, including the establishment of a number of monitoring sites at major
intersections in Bangkok, a requirement for catalytic converters on new cars
after September 1, 1993, conversion of many Bangkok taxis and "tuk-tuk" three-
wheelers to LPG fuel, and supply of unleaded gasoline. Additional measures
under this plan would be supported by the proposed project.
15.   Monitoring of Pollution and Noise Levels. The Office of the National
Environment Board maintains a network of stationary air quality monitoring
sites in Bangkok, as well as mobile sampling systems for curbside emissions
measurements. This network is to be expanded to include 15 to 20 roadside
monitoring stations in and around Bangkok, as well as in a number of other
cities. In addition, four new automated public information displays have been
set up, in conjunction with sampling sites, to display ambient pollutant
concentrations to the public on a real-time basis. It is hoped that these
displays will increase public awareness of air pollution issues, and lead to
increased actions to control pollution.
16.   Emissions Standards for New Vehicles.       One of the most effective ways
to limit vehicle emissions is to establish emissions standards and certifica-
tion requirements for new vehicles, thereby ensuring that they are designed to
incorporate emissions controls. Given the rapid growth in the Thai vehicle
fleet, it is important that such standards be established and take effect as
soon as possible, since each new vehicle sold without emission controls will
remain in the fleet, polluting for many years. The RTG will require catalytic
converters on new cars, and standards are being developed for that purpose.
Standards for motorcycles and diesel vehicles (which might have been consid-
ered to have higher priority than passenger cars, given the severity of the
particulate problem) are still being developed but are expected to be promul-
gated within the next year. There is a lack of independent technical analysis
and evaluation in support of standards-setting, however, and this could poten-
tially result in weaker standards and enforcement procedures than desirable.
17.   Standards for pollutant and noise emissions from new motor vehicles are
set by a government technical committee chaired by Prof. Phulporn of Chulalon-
gkorn University's Department of Mechanical Engineering and including repre-
sentatives of the Office of the National Environment Board (ONEB), the
Ministry of Industry, the Land Transport Department (LTD), and vehicle
manufacturers. The committee has no staff or resources to carry out indepen-
dent studies or analysis, and most of the work involved in drafting standards,
etc. seems to be done by staff of the Institute of Standards in the Industry



- 57 -
Annex 3
Page 5
Ministry, with technical information provided primarily by vehicle manufactur-
ers. The lack of independent technical advice for the committee raises a
concern that vehicle manufacturers may be able to shape the regulatory process
to their advantage by providing only carefully selected information, for
example, data on the lenient European (Economic Commission for Europe, ECE)
emissions regulations rather than the more stringent U.S. and Japanese
emissions standards.
18.   Responding to a government decision requiring catalytic converters on
new passenger cars, the Institute of Standards is drafting regulations for
these vehicles based on ECE regulation 15.04. These standards will take effect
in 1993 and will be used for only a short time before proceeding to the more
stringent ECE R83 standards. Emissions standards are also being developed for
motorcycles as well as for heavy-duty diesel engines and light-duty diesel
trucks. The new motorcycle emissions standards will be based on ECE R40, at
least for the time being. This standard is so lenient that even two-stroke
engines can meet it, and thus will provide little relief from the particulate
problem. Current plans also call for the new diesel engine and vehicle
regulations to be based on ECE regulations--R83 for light-duty diesel trucks
and (presumably) ECE R49 for heavy-duty engines. Both regulations are far more
lenient (especially for particulate emissions) than U.S. requirements.
19.   Procedures for verifying compliance and for corrective action to deal
with non-complying vehicles will also need to be developed. The Institute of
Standards plans to contract for laboratory facilities to measure emissions
from gasoline vehicles within a few months, and the facilities should be on-
line by end-1992. Facilities for testing diesel engines and motorcycles are
scheduled for completion about one year later. It is currently envisioned that
these would be used only to verify compliance by new vehicles; as in Europe,
but unlike the United States, manufacturers will bear no responsibility for
continuing emissions compliance in consumer use.
20. Vehicle Inspection Peogram. Vehicle inspection serves two purposes in a
vehicle emissions control program. First, it helps to identify vehicles in
which maladjustments or other mechanical problems are causing higher emissions
than necessary. Second, it ensures that the emission control equipment on
vehicles so equipped remains in place and operational, so that the emissions
benefits of that equipment are realized.
21.   The RTG agency responsible for vehicle inspections is the Land Transport
Department (LTD). Under the Land Transport Act, LTD has for some time carried
out emissions and safety checks on the buses and commercial trucks covered by
that act. These inspections are carried out almost entirely at LTD's regional
offices by LTD staff. These vary in equipment and capability, with those in
Bangkok being fairly well equipped and efficient, but with levels of equipment
and training reportedly much lower in the provinces. Although private-sector
inspection facilities are permitted, and a few have received licenses from
LTD, they have not been popular--LTD inspections are free while private
facilites must recover their costs from the users, and administrative problems
have occurred owing to the facilities' lack of access to LTD records.



- 58 -
Annex 3
Page 6
22.   With the rise of concern over air pollution, LTD has been made responsi-
ble for carrying out emissions checks on all vehicles, including private cars,
trucks, and motorcycles covered under the Motor Vehicle Act as well as the
commercial vehicles covered by the Land Transport Act. To accomplish this
task, LTD proposed to license a network of private-sector inspection facili-
ties, which would carry out the inspections under LTD oversight, and which
would charge a fee for inspection. A detailed strategy for licensing is
scheduled for completion by end-1991.
23.   Two of the key issues to be addressed in the vehicle inspection program
are the test procedures and pass/fail levels ("cutpoints") to be used, and the
institutional setting in which the inspection will take place. The resolution
of these issues will heavily affect both the costs and the effectiveness of
the program. Two types of institutional settings for vehicle inspection are
common: vehicles may be inspected either in a large number of private garages,
most of which also offer emissions repairs, or they may be inspected in a
smaller number of dedicated, high-volume inspection facilities operated either
by the government or by a private organization under a government concession.
The former, decentralized, type of inspection system has been found to have
low effectiveness, due to the difficulty of enforcing correct inspection
procedures. Since the number of inspection locations and inspectors is much
smaller in a centralized program, the level of skill and training can be much
higher, and cheating can be prevented much more easily. Due to economies of
scale, average inspection costs are also lower in the centralized programs.
24.   Definition of test procedures and cutpoints to be used in the inspection
program is the responsibility of ONEB. ONEB has requested technical assistance
from the Bank to do so, as it presently has little technical capability in
this area. Issues that will need to be addressed will include the test
procedure to be used for each vehicle class and the relative severity of the
cutpoints. Ideally, test procedures would be defined based on a strong
correlation with actual on-road emissions, and cutpoints for each procedure
would then be established by taking into account both the technical capabili-
ties of the vehicles and the maximum failure rate that is likely to be
acceptable from a political standpoint. Cutpoints would initially be set to
catch only the highest emitters, and would gradually be tightened over time as
the highest emitters were repaired or retired from the fleet.
25.   Reformulation of Vehicle Fuels. Reformulation of gasoline and diesel
fuels can help significantly to reduce emissions. Unleaded gasoline is
essential for vehicles with catalytic converters, as lead antiknocks will
rapidly poison the catalyst, rendering it ineffective for emissions control.
Given the high ambient lead levels and the very high levels of lead in blood
of exposed populations, a reduction in the lead content of leaded gasoline is
also urgently needed. Unleaded gasoline was introduced in Bangkok in May 1991,
and is scheduled to be available nationwide by June 1992. Lead concentrations
in leaded gasoline were limited to 0.4 g/l in 1990, and the permissible
concentration will be reduced to 0.15 g/l on January 1. This is equal to the
present European specification, but considerably higher than the maximum of
0.03 g/l of lead allowed in U.S. fuel. Use of unleaded gasoline is being



- 59 -
Annex 3
Page 7
promoted by subsidizing the price so that it is less than that of leaded fuel,
with funds for the subsidy obtained through a surtax on diesel fuel.
26.   Another gasoline-related measure to reduce emissions is the addition of
methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) or other oxygenates. Blending of oxygenates
in the range of 5-15% by volume can reduce HC and CO emissions, and (because
the oxygenates themselves have high octane values) can reduce the need to use
lead antiknocks to meet octane specifications. Such "reformulated" gasolines
are planned to be required beginning in 1993. The greatest potential benefits
from gasoline "reformulation" would come from reformulation of leaded gaso-
line. Vehicles using this fuel will not be using catalytic converters, and
will thus have much higher average emissions than the (mostly catalyst-
equipped) vehicles using unleaded. A change in gasoline formulation producing
a given percentage reduction in emissions will thus result in a much greater
absolute reduction (and correspondingly better cost-effectiveness) if applied
to leaded gasoline.
27.   Changes in diesel fuel formulation can also affect emissions from diesel
vehicles. Reducing the sulfur content of diesel fuel reduces SOx and PM10
emissions; increasing the cetane number or decreasing the aromatic content can
also help to reduce PM10, NOx, and noise. Use of a "light" diesel, without
high-boiling components, may also help to reduce smoke and particulate
emission, although the evidence on this is contradictory. Low-sulfur diesel
fuel is also essential for certain advanced diesel emissions controls, such as
catalytic converters and catalytic trap-oxidizers. Current Thai diesel fuel
specifications allow up to 1% sulfur by weight, which is double or triple the
sulfur content in most developed countries. To reduce air pollution, the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is increasing imports of low-sulfur
diesel fuel, and "light" diesel will be required as the only available grade
in Thailand from January 1, 1992. Diesel fuel sulfur content will be limited
to 0.5% by weight beginning in September 1992.
28.   In addition to the foregoing, there are many other fuel-related proper-
ties and specifications which can affect emissions to a greater or lesser
degree, each of which has significant impacts on costs, power output, etc. Due
to the complexity of the phenomena involved, the numerous studies that have
been carried out in this area often contradict each other. Given this situa-
tion and the strong vested interests of oil companies and others in shaping
regulations to their own convenience, the RTG will require expert technical
assistance to establish appropriate and cost-effective specifications. To this
end, it has requested funding from UNDP (with the Bank as executing agency)
for expert consultants to assist the National Energy Policy Office in this
area.
29.   For fuel regulations to be effective, compliance must be ensured by
checking fuel properties throughout the distribution system (and especially at
the retail level). This will be especially important for unleaded gasoline, as
the sale of gasoline contaminated by lead could result in widespread damage to
catalytic converters. The Fuel Oil Division of the Ministry of Commerce is
responsible for this testing, but currently lacks some required equipment and
a safe laboratory facility for carrying out such checks, as well as sufficient

trained staff. The proposed project would finance the acquisition of laborato-
ry equipment and staff training and professional development in order to
strengthen this organization.
30.   WSmokelessw Lubricants for Two-strokes.  The long-chain paraffins and
aromatic hydrocarbons normally used as the base stock for lubricating oil burn
poorly. In two-stroke engines, which require oil to be mixed with the charge
in order to lubricate the cylinder, much of the lubricating oil passes into
the exhaust unburned, where it condenses into aerosol droplets and produces
the high smoke and PM10 emission characteristic of two-stroke engines. A class
of synthetic hydrocarbons known as polybutenes have lubricating properties
similar to normal base stocks, but burn much more readily. By substituting
these compounds for the normal base stock in the oil, visible smoke emissions
can be reduced significantly. It is likely that PM10 emissions are similarly
reduced, but no experimental measurements to confirm this are available. The
RTG has established standards for "smokeless" two-stroke oils, and these will
be the only type permitted after end-1991. It is hoped that the widespread use
of these oils will reduce PM10 emissions from motorcycles and three-wheelers.
31.   Alternative "Clean" Fuels.  Although relatively poorly endowed with
petroleum deposits, Thailand is rich in natural gas, and pipelines are being
constructed to distribute this fuel to the major population centers. Liquified
petroleum gas, or LPG, is extracted in the processing of natural gas for
pipeline shipment, and also as a byproduct of refining. Both natural gas and
LPG are considerably less expensive, on an energy-equivalent basis, than
either gasoline or diesel fuel. With proper choice of engine technology, they
can also be burned much more cleanly than these fuels. Conversion from liquid
fuels to natural gas or LPG can thus help to reduce emissions, lower fuel
costs, and improve the foreign trade balance simultaneously. Technology to
accomplish this for gasoline vehicles has long been available, and the
majority of taxis and tuk-tuks in Bangkok are already fueled by LPG. NEPO is
now developing a strategy to encourage and/or require alternative fuel use in
certain vehicles.
32.   The Bangkok Metropolitan Transit Authority (BMTA) has successfully
demonstrated a bus fueled by compressed natural gas, and preparations are
under way for a demonstration project to consist of 200 buses. If successful,
this project could pave the way for conversion of the remaining BMTA fleet of
approximately 3,000 buses, as well as many trucks and private buses operating
in the city. Because of the novelty of the technology, BMTA has requested
technical assistance from the Bank in planning the demonstration program and
developing bid specifications for the demonstration fleet.
33.   Traffic Management.  Major construction activity in Bangkok is creating
severe congestion, dust, noise and other emissions, and concentrations of air-
borne pollutants are extremely high near construction sites. In 1990-91, the
Australian Government provided the Bangkok Municipal Administration (BHA) with
technical assistance in coordinating and scheduling construction activities
and on-site measures to mitigate the adverse effects of major construction
projects. This assistance, called the Assistance for Impacts Management (AIM)
project, would be extended under the action plan.

34.   To expand on the traffic management measures in place, BMA is installing
an Area Traffic Control (ATC) system for Bangkok. The first stage of the
system, comprising 143 intersections at a cost of about B 418 million, would
be completed by end-1993. A second stage is proposed to include 92 intersec-
tions at a cost of about B 148 mill-ion. The ATC system is expected to reduce
delays, with consequent savings in travel time and vehicle emissions.
However, realization of the system's potential benefits is contingent on the
development of an overall traffic management strategy and the establishment of
institutional responsibilities for system operation, which would involve both
BMA's Traffic Engineering Division and the traffic police who now control
traffic lights manually. The action plan therefore includes the development
of an appropriate traffic management strategy for Bangkok and assistance to
BMA and the police to reach the necessary agreements,

THAILA
FOURTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Road Trafgic Eafety Action Plan
Bacekround
1.    According to government statistics, traffic accidents in Thailand rose by
an estimated annual average of 14% during 1982-89 and traffic-related deaths per
10,000 vehicles totaled about 43 in 1989. In 1990, over 40,000 accidents and
6,000 fatalities were reported by the police.   The occurrence of accidents,
injuries and fatalities is thought to be even higher, however, since accident
records are often neither accurate nor complete. Various factors are responsible
for the high accident rate, including inappropriate design of some road segments,
poor vehicle condition stemming from inadequate maintenance, and unsafe driver
behavior owing to inadequate driver preparation and the use of drugs and alcohol,
especially by truck operators.
Agtign Plan
2.    The Road Traffic Safety Action Plan (Appendix 1) aims at achieving
immediate reductions in the number of accidents and their consequences, as well
as establishing the necessary administration, technical systems and practices to
ensure continued efforts to limit the number of accidents. The cost of priority
items included in the Plan is shown in the Appendix. The action plan is in eight
parts as follows:
1.    Road Traffic Safety Organization
2.    Information Systems
3.    Vehicle Testing and Safety Aspects
4.    Behavior: Training and Education
5.    Law Enforcement and Traffic Surveillance
6.    Roads and their Physical Environment
7.    Insurance
8.    Rescue and Health Services
3.    Road Traffic Safety Organization. As in most countries, activities related
to traffic safety in Thailand are spread over a number of ministries and
agencies, including the Department of Highways (DOH) and the Land Transport
Department (LTD) in the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), the
Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) under the Ministry of
Interior (MOI), the Ministry of Education (MOE), etc. Coordination is provided
by the Traffic Safety Council (TSC), under the National Safety Council (NSC) in
the Prime Minister's Office. While it is appropriate to place a coordinating
unit in an independent position as in the NSC, the TSC has not been able to be
an effective coordinator since it lacks both resources and a formal
organizational  status.      To  provide  proper  coordination  for  effective
implementation of traffic safety measures, the action plan suggests the following
activities: (a) establishment of clear, detailed traffic safety objectives at the
national, district and local levels; (b) development of a comprehensive and



- 69 -
Page 2
coordinated long-term road safety program; and (c) formal establishment by law
of an independent unit in the Prime Minister's Office to coordinate road traffic
safety, with its own budget and responsibilities.
4.    Information Systems.  A variety of information is needed for road safety
operations, including data on accidents, vehicle and driver's licenses,
transportation permit registrations, etc. While some traffic-related information
systems exist in Thailand, they are often underdeveloped and uncoordinated.
Furthermore, analysis of the data that do exist is scant. The DOH keeps records
of accidents reported by the police, but deficiencies in the forms used for
reporting accidents and in the thoroughness of police responses result in
incomplete information. LTD, however, is in the process of installing an on-line
information system to handle taxation, issuance of driver's licenses, vehicle
registration and transport operation permits country-wide.
5.    To develop improved procedures for recording, transferring and analyzing
accident data, the Action Plan includes a study to establish an efficient
accident reporting system appropriate for Thailand which, among other things,
adopts uniform road traffic safety definitions like those developed by the United
Nations, trains traffic police to complete a simplified accident form which is
used countrywide, provides for centralized, computer-based tabulation and
analysis of accident data, and provides these data to all agencies involved in
planning and carrying out traffic safety activities. The study would assess the
possibility of incorporating the LTD information system into the new accident
reporting process, as well as the technical assistance in road traffic safety now
being provided to 8 NSC staff by the Swedish Road and Traffic Research
Institution (VTI).
6.    Vehicle Testin2 and Safety AsRects.  Thailand's current vehicle inspection
system is ineffective owing to insufficient and poorly maintained testing
equipment, an inadequate number of LTD inspection centers, poorly trained
inspection staff, and an inadequate, out-of-date regulatory system for safe
vehicle performance.   The Action Plan therefore recommends:  (a) adoption of
Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) regulations for safety standards; and (b)
compulsory, periodic vehicle inspection and testing, involving both the
Government and the private sector.   Facilities and equipment for vehicle
inspection stations would be expected to meet specified standards. Due to the
scale of the vehicle fleet (over 7 million vehicles nationwide, including 2
million in Bangkok), the cost of establishing a vehicle inspection system would
be high, perhaps B 500 million just to construct and equip the estimated 100
stations needed in Bangkok alone. This high cost and the complex issues involved
made it advisable to initially develop an implementation strategy as a first step
in addressing the problem. The inspection strategy adopted for both vehicle
safety and vehicle emissions (Annex 3, paras. 22-23) is therefore to establish
relevant performance criteria to be used in inspections carried out by both LTD
and authorized private garages.
7.    Behavior Trainine and Education.  Road users in Thailand are generally not
aware of the need for road safety precautions. In the case of drivers, this lack
of awareness is due to a lack of knowledge of road traffic safety rules and
regulations and to a general disregard for safety matters. Activities targeted

to various road user groups have therefore been included in the Action Plan to
heighten road user safety awareness. Road safety information campaigns would be
launched to inform road users in general of the need to use seat belts and, for
motorcyclists, helmets, the dangers of using alcohol or drugs when driving, etc.
Driver and rider safety would be improved through improved driver training and
testing, mandatory use of seat belts, improved training of driver examiners, and
the production of handbooks for learners, drivers and driver instructors. Most
important, safe behavior in traffic would be taught to school children, who are
particularly exposed to accident risks.   Such training would also develop
children's safety consciousness for their future roles as motorists and road
users. For this purpose, the Ministry of Education is developing road safety
training materials to be incorporated in school syllabuses and is training
teachers in tt.ese matters.
8.    LawJ-nforcement and Traffic Suryeillance.  Probably the most effective tool
to encourage drivers to behave more safely is effective traffic surveillance and
law enforcement by the police.   In Thailand, uniformed highway, traffic and
metropolitan police are empowered to stop and arrest any driver, passenger or
pedestrian who commits offenses under the Land Traffic Act, the Land Transport
Act, and related regulations. The police also collect data about road accidents.
However, they are constrained in carrying out their duties by inadequate amounts
of equipment (e.g., motorcars, motorcycles, speed-detecting machines, and
communications equipment) as well as a shortage of knowledge and training
materials.   The Action Plan would therefore strengthen the capacity of the
traffic police through increased manpower equipment, improved practices and
stronger laws.
9.    Roads and their Physical Environment.  Road safety can be improved through
attention to all factors determining the environment of roads and streets. Such
factors include road design guidelines and standards, road maintenance, etc.
While some Thai design manuals have recently been revised with Japanese
assistance, other guidelines and standards manuals still need to be updated,
particularly those for planning public transportation. An extensive program to
eliminate "black-spots" was carried out under the Sixth Five-year Plan, and will
be continued under the Seventh Plan.  Further improvements might be made by
increasing the skid resistance of road surfaces during maintenance activities,
provision of useful driver information on road signs, road markings easily seen
at night, lighting where necessary, and adequate road sidings. The Action Plan
responds to these needs by calling for revised road planning and design manuals
which include safety considerations and the provision of training and equipment
to assist road engineers to identify black spots.
10.   Insurance. Third-party liability insurance for all drivers in Thailand was
only recently made mandatory. An information campaign to inform drivers about
this insurance as well as enforcement of the regulation would be carried out
under the Action Plan.
11.   Resgcu  and Health Services.  To reduce the number of fatalities from car
accidents and the seriousness of injuries sustained, the Action Plan calls for
the training of police in dealing with accident victims and the initial purchase
of six fully-equipped ambulances.

FOURTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Road Transport Industry Efficiency Action Plan        ---
1.    UgulatorX Framework and Institutional Responsibilities. The road transport
industry is governed by a regulatory framework established in 1979 under the
following laws: (a) the Land Transport Act, for the regulation and licensing of
operators and drivers of buses and trucks for commercial use; (b) the Motor
Vehicles Act, for the regulation and licensing of private vehicles and taxis, and
their drivers: specifically vehicles which carry fewer than 7 persons such as
taxis and tuk-tuiks; and (c) the Land Traffic Act, providing rules and regulations
for the use of the roads and highways. The Land Transport Department (LTD) is
responsible for administration of the Land Transport and Motor Vehicles Acts,
while the police are responsible for enforcing these Acts. The Traffic Act is
administered by the police, the Department of Highways (DOH) and LTD. Because
of LTD's major administrative responsibilities for the road transport industry,
it has a fundamental role in implementing appropriate changes.
2.    Issues.  Today, road transport represents about 88% of freight and 92% of
passenger transport.   Recognizing the importance of the trucking and bus
industries, the Government, with assistance under two previous Bank-assisted
highway projects, carried out comprehensive, two-phased studies of the
industries: the Trucking Industry Study under Ln. 2035-TH and an Inter-city and
Rural Bus Transport Study under Ln. 2311-TH.   These studies found that the
industries were in many respects efficient and effective, but that improvements
were needed to liberalize urnnecessary regulations, strengthen management skills
of operators, increase competitiveness and improve safety. Furthermore, despite
significant investment in new vehicles, the truck and bus fleets are believed to
be on average about 8 to 10 years old due to high import duties on imported new
vehicles and parts.   The fleet has consequently not been able to take full
advantage of modern technology to reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions
and increase safety.
3.    Based on recommendations of the industry studies and other government
initiatives, an action plan (see Appendix 1) was developed under the Third
Highway Sector Project to further improve the industry's efficiency and safety.
The plan is directed at the national trucking and bus transport industries, but
would at the same time benefit transport operations in Bangkok. The components
of the action plan are discussed below.
The Trucking Fleet
4.    The most popular truck is the "10 wheeler," which has a rigid chassis with
tandem rear wheels and is locally assembled. In 1988, registration statistics
showed that this truck type represented 30% of the national truck fleet of
252,000 trucks. Under present vehicle weight regulations, the 10 wheeler has a



- 84 -
Annex 5
Page 2
payload of about 12 tons and a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 21 tons. Recent
amendments to truck dimension regulations now permit truck/trailer and
tractor/semitrailer combinations. Although current duties on imported new
vehicles are high and discourage the introduction of these new, efficient truck
types, it appears that the trucking industry is now investing heavily in the more
modern units despite their higher prices, partly by importing second-hand
vehicles.
5.    The longer-dimensioned trucks have a GVW of up to 38 tons. For inter-city
operations, they are more efficient than 10 wheel trucks because they may have
up to six axles and so have lighter axle loads than those for the three-axle, 10
wheelers. While the length of these vehicles may prohibit their use in many
parts of Bangkok and other urban areas, they could be used in conjunction with
freight terminals, the establishment of which the Government is now considering.
Trucking Industry Action Plan
6.    The action plan for the trucking industry follows up on recommendations of
the two most comprehensive industry studies recently carried out, the Bank-
financed Trucking Industry Study completed in 1988 and the Seventh Plan Urban and
Regional Transport Project (SPURT), completed in 1991 in preparation for the
Government's Seventh Development Plan. The earlier study recommended an increase
of vehicle weight limits for 10-wheel trucks and immediate reduction in import
duties on new vehicles and separately imported parts to encourage the
Introduction of r.ew technology, particularly for improved safety, emissions and
energy consumption. It recommended that duties for truck tractors be reduced to
10%, with a similar reduction in duties on imported parts. To better
differentiate trucks by size, gross vehicle weight and number of axles, the SPURT
study recommended the adoption of a truck classification system and the review
and updating of vehicle dimension limits of all potential truck types. It also
repeated the earlier study's call for increased vehicle weight limits for 10-
wheelers.
7.    In line with these recommendations, the action plan consists of changes in:
(a) classification and regulation; (b) initial registration and annual license
charges; (c) truck technology; (d) import duties; (e) freight terminals; (f) the
state-owned Express Transport Organization (ETO); and (g) training.
8.    Glassification and Regulation. The dominance of truck transport of goads
in Thailand makes efficiency in trucking operations of critical concern.
Reductions in barriers to importing more efficient truck types, as proposed in
para. 13, and other measures included in the action plan would significantly
change the composition of the national truck fleet toward more efficient truck
types. However, this potent:ial change should be guided by informed analysis of
suitable truck types, their dimensions, permitted maximum axle loads, etc. and
their other economie and environmental  impaets. The actL.on plan therefore
includes initial development of a classification system to assist the
introduction of more appropriate vehicle registration and annual licensing
charges. Also included in the plan is a detailed review of permitted vehicle
dimension limits, likely maximum axle loads and permitted maximum weights. This
review should be supported by analyses showing the related benefits to the



- 85 -
Annerx 5
Page 3
economy, the effects on highway traffic congestion and the increased road
maintenance and other costs such as enforcement.
9.    LTD's current licenaing requirements focus mainly on the corporate and
financial status of applicants. However, more attention should be given to the
capability of firms and their staff to provide reliable and safe services. For
larger firms, checks should be made on the firms' experience and staff, including
offense records. Preference should be given to operators with adequate insurance,
good quality vehicles and acceptable vehicle maintenance procedures. Small firms
and individual owner/operators should meet similar requirements as a conditior
of owning a truck and show adequate driving competence. A Management Information
System (MIS) now being introduced in LTD would assist staff in checking offenses
and other data needed to assess license applications and then to monitor and
enforce relevant provisions. LTD's implementation of these higher licensing
standards would require up to ten additional staff.
10.   Registration and Annual License Charges. Registration and annual licensing
systems should give positive incentives for the purchase and operation of
efficient truck types. At present, registration charges for commercial vehicles
are based on vehicle weight and were set over ten years ago. Under this system,
a maximum rate is specified, below which actual charges can be set by the LTD
Registrar.   Because the charges have declined in real terms since being
established, an ongoing review, which began in late-1989, is studying how to
increase registration charges in order to maintain the total level of government
revenues.    Optimally,  these  charges  should  take  into  consideration  the
environmental and economic impacts of the various vehicle types. The current
registration charge system is also difficult to adjust, since amendment of the
rate system requires Cabinet approval of the relevant regulations, which is
difficult to obtain. A better system is one being considered for private vehicle
fees, i.e., regular indexation of charges withou; Cabinet approval. The action
plan therefore includes increased registration and license fees and introduction
of annual indexation of charges.
11.   Truck Technologv.  LTD currently uses regulations to specify permitted
vehicle types and their characteristics. However, many countries specify required
design characteristics through vehicle design rules that can provide more
detailed specifications than can be accommodated in regulations.   Under the
action plan, a system of design rules would be developed for trucks (and buses),
starting with items that affect safety such as braking, length, weight, and
materials. LTD would need technical assistance for this purpose.
12.   Import Duties.  Inconsistencies in import duties would be rationalized
under the action plan and duties that discriminate against the introduction of
new technology in the truck (and bus) industries would be reduced, starting with
vehicles and vehicle parts which affect safety, efficiency and vehicle emissions.
Th.e need for rationalized charges is illustrated by the fact that the total rate
of tax on an imported vehicle may be 12%, while the tax applied on separately
imported components of the same vehicle may be 44% for an engine or 80% for
chassis components.

13.   Freight Terminals.   A consultant's studty, carried out at Government's
request and completed in 1991, indicated that the construction of well-planned
and appropriately located freight terminals, particularly in the Bangkok area,
would have considerable environmental benefits. The same study recommended a
freight terminal demonstration project, provided use would be voluntary.
Development of this terminal would be carried out under the action plan. MOTC has
recently received three proposals to develop freight terminals in Bangkok, the
details of which are not yet available, and a Japanese-financed study of this
subject will commence by end-1991, on behalf of LTD.
14.   ETO. The state-owned ETO is a major trucking operator, with a monopoly on
access to Klong Toey Port, the transport of certain goods on inter-urban routes
and, until recently, cross-border trade with Lao PDR. ETO has a staff of over
3,000 persons, many approaching retirement, and an aging vehicle fleet. The
Trucking Industry Study indicated substantial scope for improving ETO's
performance and, in particular, its accounting systems. Under the action plan,
a corporate plan and manpower training program would be developed to help ETO
plan for its future, and modern accounting and control systems would be
developed.
15.   Training. With the help of technical assistance, under the action plan LTD
would develop curricula and training materials and implement training courses for
truck drivers and otier industry and government personnel.
The Bus Industry Action Plan
16.   Many of the actions recommended for the trucking industry are also relevant
to the inter-city bus industry. Besides these improvements, which are noted in
the action plan, LTD requires additional staff to undertake forward planning of
new bus routes, bus services and terminals. As recommended by the Inter-city and
Rural Bus Transport Study, at least seven additional staff, associated supporting
services and up-country travel budgets are needed. Over-regulation is also a
problem in the industry, hampering efficient operations. Many regulations were
formulated 30 years ago when illegal operations were extensive, but now
regulations covering the type of route, fare levels, and the number of bus trips
allowed each day prevent bus operators from serving a variety of routes even
though they may legally have the right to do so.  Various components of the
action plan will therefore remove the unnecessary regulations and so assist
industry efficiency.
Management Information Syste
17.   LTD has recently selected a bidder for their computerized MIS system. It
is recommended that, rather than proceeding with the system as now envisioned,
the system should be expanded, as recommended in the SPURT study, to become a
useful driver licensing and contravention system. Modification of the system
before actual implementation is necessary to minimize costs. The enhanced system
could then be shared by the police and LTD. A budget of US$4.4 million would
provide sufficient resources to develop a full contravention and licensing system
as outlined in the SPURT study. This component is considered to be of high
priority and should be included in the next project.

Supervision Plan
Bae. SURervisLon In=
1.        The staff input indicated in the table below refers to field missions
only and is in addition to regular supervision needs at headquarters for review
of progress and audit reports and consultants' reports on technical assistance
and studies, procurement actions, correspondence, etc., which is estimated at
five staff weeks in FY93 and four staff weeks each for FY94-97.  The Bank's
supervision input is estimated to total 88 staff-weeks, of which 21 would be at
headquarters and 67 in the field. This input is higher than the average but is
dictated by the complex action plans for improved traffic safety, reduction of
pollution from vehicle emissions and improvements in road transport efficiency,
which require considerable input from specialists.
