The ongoing policy-based action plans are aimed at\n            substantially reducing environmental degradation and\n            vehicular accidents due to the country's rapidly\n            growing motorization, and promoting improved policies to\n            enhance the operational efficiency of the road transport\n            industry.  The project will finance:  (a) civil works\n            subprojects to be carried out under the Seventh Highway Plan\n            to rehabilitate, upgrade to paved standards, improve the\n            safety and increase the capacity of national and provincial\n            roads and bridges; (b) technical experts to assist the\n            Department of Highways in developing a long-term investment\n            and financing strategy and an associated institutional\n            development plan; and (c) equipment, technical assistance\n            and training to support the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications (MOTC) and its Land Transport Department\n            (LTD) in preparing and implementing key items included in\n            the three action plans."}, "docdt": "1992-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
