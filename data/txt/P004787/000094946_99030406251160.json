"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The implementation progress of the\n            project was satisfactory overall. The execution of the road\n            civil works, the strategic investment study, and the action\n            plans for traffic safety and for air quality improvement\n            separately rated as highly satisfactory while the progress\n            of the transport efficiency action plan with the Land\n            Transport Department was less satisfactory. The primary\n            lesson emerging is of the importance of borrower ownership\n            and the commitment of key officials to project design and\n            implementation. Agencies will effectively perform given a\n            clear mandate, appropriate institutional capacity, and\n            timely technical and financial supports. Regulatory and\n            institutional frameworks should be carefully assessed in\n            light of the country policy objectives and in close\n            coordination with key agencies before embarking on similar\n            projects in order to minimize the overlap of\n            responsibilities and conflicts of interest, especially where\n            interagency communication is notoriously lacking. In\n            practice, government procedures to allocate counterpart\n            budget and national procurement regulations constitute a\n            downside of the action plan and should be carefully\n            addressed. Assigning an adequate number of qualified staff\n            to the project is also a critical factor affecting the\n            performance of agencies as is their technical capability to\n            ensure quality of work. Therefore, allocate more budget to\n            staff training. Finally more information should be\n            disseminated about World Bank procedures and requisites."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
