by the\n            government of Jordan in the energy sector. The Energy Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project will address the supply side\n            constraints to macroeconomic growth imposed by the energy\n            sector; and restructure the energy sector, financially and\n            institutionally, to establish an enabling environment for\n            sustainable sector growth and development. The reforms are\n            designed to rationalize energy prices to ensure they cover\n            economic costs and satisfy commercial goals; restore the\n            financial viability and commercialization of power\n            enterprises; restructure the power subsector and corporatize\n            enterprises in both the power and oil/gas subsectors; and to\n            establish enabling conditions to allow private sector\n            investment in power generation and distribution. In\n            addition, the reforms are designed to establish a\n            transparent regulatory framework for the power subsector;\n            strengthen institutional arrangements for sector policy\n            formation and planning; and strengthen measures for\n            environmental protection and energy conservation."}, "docdt": "1993-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
