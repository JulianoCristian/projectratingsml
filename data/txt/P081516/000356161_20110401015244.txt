JUDICIAL BRANCH MODERNIZATION PROJECT (P081516) 
CREDIT 4098-HN  
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
A. SUMMARY 
 
1. 
This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks the approval for the restructuring of the 
Honduras Judicial Branch Modernization Project (P081516), Credit No. 4098-HN. 
The 
proposed changes are of second order category: cancellation of SDR 0.64 million, or 
US$1 million equivalent, and extension of the closing date from March 31, 2011 until 
June 30, 2011.  The proposed Restructuring Paper will not change the Project 
Development Objective (PDO). 
B. PROJECT STATUS 
2. 
 The proposed extension will ensure that the Project Development Objective 
(PDO) is fully achieved, as a set of key activities will be fully completed.  To date, 
achievements include: (i) enhanced access to justice for vulnerable groups (30,000 annual 
users), first instance courts in rural zones (1,000 annual users) and mobile courts in 
urban-marginal areas (7,000 annual users); (ii) specialized service to 10,000 women in 
family courts; (iii) improved protection to 15,000 women and children against domestic 
violence; (iv) specialized service to 1,500 persons from vulnerable groups; (v) 
establishment of an integrated financial management system that promotes transparency 
and efficiency of the courts; (vi) development of the judicial career with all the manuals 
for the selection, classification and evaluation of personnel that will allow the transparent 
and competitive selection of 3,200 personnel; (vii) adoption of a new management model 
for case management that will allow monitoring and evaluation of 1,200 judges; and (viii) 
improved services to internal and external users of the courts through an IT system and 
judiciary information kiosks. 
3. 
With respect to implementation progress, to date all planned activities for CY11 
have been procured and/or contracted and all activities for previous CYs have been 
completed.  Amongst the achievements to date are the establishment of 5 new justices of 
the peace offices in the Municipalities of Colón, Ocotepeque, Intibuca, Lempira, y Valle, 
the operation of 2 mobile courts in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, the inauguration of 
the new Justice Services Center of Tegucigalpa, and the redesign of the internal financial 
management systems of the Supreme Court. The disbursement rate for the credit is 
currently 76 percent. 
C. PROPOSED CHANGES 
Cancellation of funds 
4. 
The project has disbursed SDR 7,600,000 or 76 percent of the total loan. SDR 
0.64 million, or US$1 million equivalent, can be cancelled because of cost savings arising 
from contractual commitments in two large components (case-tracking systems and 
Page  3
3
integrated financial management systems) that were lower than initial contract estimates. 
The disbursement percentages will not change. 
5. 
Because of the cancellation, proceeds for 
Honduras Judicial Branch 
Modernization Project (P081516), Credit No. 4098-HN 
will be reallocated as follows:

Extension of Closing Date 
6. 
The Government has requested the extension in consideration of the efforts made 
to have the procurement processes completed before the Project’s revised closing date 
(March 31, 2011). The Judiciary maintains that no alternative sources of funding are 
available. The Project’s new closing date extension for up to 3 months will allow for the 
completion of the following activities: 
 
(i)  
Implementation of the case management software for civil courts 
(US$150,000)
.
This software was developed by an international company 
selected under QCBS.  The software has been delivered to the Honduran 
Judiciary on March 25, 2011, but extra time is required to test the system 
and train the personnel required to implement it in the integrated civil 
courts center of Tegucigalpa (whose refurbishment was financed by the 
Project).  This software will generate statistical information that feeds 
performance indicators to allow efficient monitoring of these courts, as 
well as facilitating decision-making processes. The total contract cost was 
approximately US$450,000, but without testing and implementation the 
amount eligible for Bank financing would be significantly reduced (to 
US$300,000). This could jeopardize the implementation of the new civil 
procedure code, which is a key element for the PDO.  
 
(ii)  
Final adjustments to the SIAF modules of budgeting and accounting 
(US$60,000)
.
The project has invested approximately US$170,000 in 
adjusting the Integrated Financial Administrative System (SIAF) but the 
budgeting and accounting modules still require further adjustments to be 
fully operational, as well as the required training of personnel in charge.    
 
(iii) 
Design and incorporation of two more SIAF modules (US$25,000)
.
The 
SIAF also requires the automation of two more modules (planning and 
performance evaluation) to facilitate the implementation of the 2010 - 
2015 Strategic Plan.  
 
(iv) 
Completion of the Domestic Violence Campaign (US$12,000).
The 
Domestic Violence Campaign could not be completed in the northern area 
of the country (Olancho, Atlantica, Cortes) that features high levels of 
domestic violence that mainly affects women.  
 
(v) 
Training on access to justice to indigenous populations (US$12,000)
.
An 
important result of the Project was the education of ethnic communities in 
access to justice and gender issues.  The Project was able to train more 
than 280 small Afro-Honduran community leaders, but the training in 
indigenous communities could not take place before March 31, 2011.  
7. 
This is the second extension of the Closing Date, up to nine months from the 
Project’s original Closing Date.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY 
8.
 
The Task Team has reviewed the action plan for the activities to be completed 
within the three month extension period and found it satisfactory.  The extension of the 
Closing Date will ensure the completion of the pending activities and the raising of the 
disbursement ratio by the revised Closing Date up to 100 percent. The completion of the 
abovementioned activities will also facilitate satisfactory achievement of the PDO and 
improve prospects for sustainability of project achievements. The proposed restructuring 
does not trigger new risks nor exceptions to Bank policy.
