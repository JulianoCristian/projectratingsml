The project aims to improve\n            the capacity and performance of the judicial branch in three\n            areas: 1) greater efficiency of case processing, judgments\n            and appeals, 2) enhanced transparency and accountability,\n            and 3) better access to justice, especially for the most\n            disadvantaged groups. The changes are of second order\n            category: cancellation of SDR 0.64 million, or US$1 million\n            equivalent, and extension of the closing date from March 31,\n            2011 until June 30, 2011.

The extension\n            of the closing date will ensure the completion of the\n            pending activities and the raising of the disbursement ratio\n            by the revised closing date up to 100 percent. This is the\n            second extension of the closing date, up to nine months from\n            the project's original closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
