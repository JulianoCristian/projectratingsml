Industrial Estate Project, which will develop an\n            industrial park to promote labor-intensive industries,\n            posits negative environmental consequences and explores the\n            following options for their mitigations. Adequately\n            collecting stormwater and monitoring groundwater quality\n            will mitigate ponding, soil erosion, and water\n            contamination. Debris from vehicles will be taken to a\n            disposal site or a trench-to-truck construction method will\n            be adopted. Adopting specific archaeological mitigation and\n            monitoring plans will prevent site destruction. To maintain\n            the water supply, treated wastewater will be reused, water\n            from Mekorot will be purchased, conservation will be\n            encouraged, technologies will be implemented, and other\n            water resources will be considered. Wastewater treatment\n            provides for screening, equalization, biological treatment,\n            post-equalization, tertiary filtration, and chlorinating\n            treated effluents. Treated effluent and stormwater runoff\n            will be stored and reused as irrigation water; and will\n            require an extensive underground monitoring system to\n            prevent industrial pollutants and increased salinization.\n            Water logging and soil salinization, water-borne diseases,\n            and agricultural pests will be offset by lining the\n            immediate area of treated wastewater application. Solid\n            waste not recycled or composted will be transferred to a\n            plastic-lined landfill equipped with a leachate collection system."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
