Government of Indonesia (GOI), and\n            ensuring that they are implemented well; (ii) assisting GOI\n            to bring about an early recovery in economic activity,\n            consistent with external and internal financial stability;\n            and (iii) maintaining the policy dialogue on further reforms\n            to promote the efficiency and longer-term viability of the\n            economy. The loan will be used to finance general imports of\n            goods to meet part of Indonesia's near-term foreign\n            exchange requirements, and play a catalytic role in\n            mobilizing fast disbursing assistance from other donors."}, "docdt": "1989-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
