Silvopastoral Approaches to Ecosystem\n            Management Project in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua is\n            to demonstrate and measure a) the effects the introduction\n            of payment incentives for environmental services to farmers\n            on their adoption of integrated silvopastoral farming\n            systems in degraded pasture lands; and b) the resulting\n            improvements in eco-systems functioning, global\n            environmental benefits, and local socio-economic gains\n            resulting from the provision of said services. There are\n            four project components. The first component strengthens\n            local development organizations to assist farmers in\n            establishing and maintaining improved silvopastoral systems,\n            and in the technical and institutional aspects of\n            silvopastoral systems. The second component develops and\n            implements an improved monitoring system to provide accurate\n            information and understanding on the potential of\n            intensified silvopastoral systems in providing global\n            ecological services and local socio-economic benefits. The\n            third component creates and implements an eco-services\n            payment mechanism to provide incentives for establishing and\n            maintaining improved silvopastoral systems on farms. The\n            fourth component supports policy formulation and\n            dissemination, specifically developing a replication\n            strategy, including exploration of potential sustainable\n            financing mechanisms, to ensure the long-term sustainability\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2002-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
