{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Integrated Silvopastoral\n            Approaches to Ecosystem Management Project for Colombia,\n            Costa Rica, and Nicaragua were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to global environment outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the indices developed by the project were\n            very useful tools that farmers quickly related to. They were\n            able to relate their activity to a direct level of\n            compensation, allowing each individual to reach his or her\n            own comfort level. Contracts with farmers specifying amounts\n            per land use change made annual payments easier. There was a\n            high correlation between the indicators measured for on-site\n            biodiversity and carbon with the values assigned to the\n            ecological index, an indication that the land use index was\n            a good proxy for Payment for Environmental Services (PES).\n            The index had to be adjusted only for overestimated values\n            assigned to fodder banks, as they were frequently harvested.\n            The project has developed a large database on biodiversity\n            and found two main variables explaining its presence:\n            diversity of tree species and tree cover. These variables\n            can therefore be used to predict biodiversity along with\n            landscape connectivity."}, "docdt": "2008-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
