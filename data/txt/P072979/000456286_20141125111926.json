"The growing use of Payments for\n            Environmental Services (PES) for conservation has fostered a\n            debate on its effectiveness, but the few efforts to date to\n            assess the impact of PES programs have been hampered by lack\n            of data, leading to very divergent results. This paper uses\n            data from a PES mechanism implemented in Quind\u00edo, Colombia,\n            to examine the impact of PES on land use change. Alone among\n            all early PES initiatives, the Silvopastoral Project\n            included a control group of nonparticipants, whose land use\n            changes were monitored throughout the project period, as\n            well as detailed baseline data on both PES recipients and\n            control group members. By comparing the land use changes\n            undertaken by PES recipients to those undertaken by control\n            group members, we can distinguish the impact of PES from\n            that of other factors. The results show that payments had a\n            positive and highly significant impact on land use change,\n            under a variety of model formulations. PES recipients\n            converted over 40 percent of their farms to\n            environmentally-friendly land uses over 4 years, increasing\n            environmental service provision by almost 50 percent. In\n            contrast, control group members converted less than 20\n            percent of their farms, increasing environmental service\n            provision by only 7 percent."}, "docdt": "2013-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
