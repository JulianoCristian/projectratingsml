"Ratings for the Transport Infrastructure\n            Maintenance and Rural Access Project for Uruguay were as\n            follows: Outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: Project\n            Development Objectives (PDOs) and PDO indicators should be\n            commensurable to what a project can realistically attain.\n            Both the PDO and the corresponding PDO indicators were\n            defined too broadly, given the scale and scope of the\n            Project, and with too optimistic targets. A US$70 million\n            specific investment loan can contribute to address road\n            maintenance issues but cannot be expected to impact\n            sector-wide trends. This should be adequately reflected in\n            terms of project design, ensuring that objectives and\n            indicators are coherent with the project's capacity to\n            deliver. If needed, complementary instruments should be\n            adopted to address broader sector-wide issues identified by\n            the borrower. Fast-track preparation projects should include\n            significant flexibility in their design so as to become\n            quickly operational: although the project was prepared\n            rapidly, this implied that some of the preparatory work\n            typically: engineering designs that should have been\n            undertaken prior to project approval were actually carried\n            out in the first years of implementation. An early\n            understanding of the particularities of a market can avoid\n            procurement-related delays further down the road. In the\n            case of this operation, an earlier identification of the\n            specific characteristics of the Uruguayan construction\n            market, and the consequent adaptation of standard Bank\n            qualification criteria applied in bidding documents, could\n            have avoided some of the delays encountered during\n            implementation. Ensuring adequate financing for maintenance\n            remains a challenge and future Bank engagement in the sector\n            should focus on this issue. Sector financing still faces\n            strong restrictions; budget allocations cannot account for\n            sector needs."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
