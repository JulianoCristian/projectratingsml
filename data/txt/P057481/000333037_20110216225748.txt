2.     The project implementation progress has been satisfactory and is on track to achieve
the project development objectives. On Feb. 1, 2011, the loan proceeds were 95%
committed and disbursements reached US$60.5 million (86.4% of the loan amount).

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to (i) formalize the transfer of road
rehabilitation contracts implementation responsibility from the line ministry (Dirección
Nacional de Vialidad ­ DNV) to the National road corporation (Corporación Vial del
Uruguay ­ CVU); (ii) adjust the amounts allocated to the various expenditures categories to
what was actually achieved on the ground.

4.       The proposed reallocation would reduce three main expenditure categories
allocations. (i) Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract (CREMA) subprojects: out of the
6 contracts that the loan intended to partially finance, three of them are under
implementation; it is proposed to cancel the allocation of the 3 other contracts, not ready
yet. (ii) Road safety subprojects (works and goods): it is proposed to cancel related
allocations, as these activities were funded by Government of Uruguay's and Inter-
American Development Bank funds. (iii) Technical assistance program: as for item (ii),
some activities were completed but financed with other resources (e.g.: Montevideo
transport masterplan, National port strategy), while priorities have changed for other
activities (e.g.: road transport planning study). It is therefore proposed to reduce
accordingly the allocation to the technical assistance program.

5.     Two main expenditure categories would benefit from the proposed reallocation. (i)
Works under CVU: this subcomponent has financed approx. 90 km of road rehabilitation
and the rehabilitation / construction of 5 bridges (to be compared to the 24 km of roads and
20 bridges mentioned in the Project Appraisal Document). (ii) Departmental Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance subprojects: the proposed reallocation would finance 3 to 4
additional months of the departmental road rehabilitation and maintenance subproject.
Likewise, this subproject has turned out to be particularly successful with almost 9,900 km
per year of departmental roads maintained since the project started and high impact on
maintaining access to remote communities.

6.      The proposed reallocation will not impact adversely the likelihood of achieving
targets on the Project Development Objectives, as they are expressed in terms of quality of
the highway network, irrespective of the kind of rehabilitation contract or contract
executing unit.
