Infrastructure Maintenance\n            and Rural Access Project development objective is to upgrade\n            the country's transport infrastructure to a condition\n            that facilitates the transportation of freight and\n            passengers, at a cost-efficient level of service. The first\n            component - Transport infrastructure rehabilitation -\n            entails reinforcement, replacement, and rehabilitation\n            works, subdivided into three subcomponents: A) route\n            management by the Direccion Nacional de Vialidad (DNV) or\n            the National Highways Directorate; B) management of roads\n            and bridges by the National Road Corporation - CVU; and, C)\n            rehabilitation of the transfer terminal rehabilitation.\n            Component 2 - Road rehabilitation and maintenance\n            contracting - CREMA contracts - and contingencies, will\n            implement the rehabilitation and maintenance works in six\n            road sub-networks covering an estimated 981 km of national\n            roads through performance-based CREMA contracts. Component 3\n            - Departmental road rehabilitation and maintenance, and\n            contingencies, includes selected annual departmental road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance sub-projects. The fourth\n            component - Transport infrastructure safety program - aims\n            at implementing low-cost measures and investments to\n            increase road safety, and, the fifth component - Transport\n            sector management and institutional building will provide\n            technical assistance to enhance transport infrastructure management."}, "docdt": "2005-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
