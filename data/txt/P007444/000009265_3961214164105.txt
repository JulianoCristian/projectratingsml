IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 28694JM)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fourth Power Project in
Jamaica for which Loan 2869-JM for US$18 million equivalent was approved on August 4, 1987
and made effective December 12, 1988. The loan was closed on June 30, 1995. Final
disbursement took place on September 14, 1995, at which time a balance of US$43,072 was
canceled. The borrower was Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS). The ICR was
prepared by Eduardo Zolezzi of the Infrastructure Operations Division of Department III of the
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office (LA3IN) and Eric Greenwood (Consultant),
and reviewed by Peter Ludwig (Division Chief, LA3IN) and Robert Crown (Project Adviser).
The ICR was based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report(SAR); the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements; supervision reports: correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; intemal
Bank memoranda; JPS's progress reports and discussions with Bank staff. Preparation of the ICR
began during the Bank's completion mission in September 1995. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by preparing an evaluation of the project's implementation and results
(Annex), and by commenting on the Bank's draft ICR.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
2.    Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS) is a Government-owned company
responsible for commercial generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout
Jamaica. The Fourth Power Project, which was financed with the assistance of a US$18 million
Bank Loan to the company, is the subject of this report. The Project aimed to continue the
rehabilitation and institutional objectives of the Third Power Project, for which a US$30.5 million
loan was approved in 1982. This Project was completed in 1988. The rehabilitation of JPS's
existing generating units resulted in a reduction of outages due to generator failures as well as
system heat rate improvements of about 20%.
3.    In 1966, the Bank made a first loan to JPS of US$22 million to help finance generating
plant and transmission lines in the Greater Kingston area. This was followed by a second loan in
1978 of US$22 million to help finance urban transmission and distribution, as well as technical
assistance for the preparation of operating and maintenance procedures.
Project Objectives and Description
4.    The main project objectives were to (a) increase and improve the utilization of the existing
generating system by expanding and upgrading the transmission distribution network to improve
system reliability; (b) prepare future power projects; and (c) strengthen JPS's managerial and
engineering capabilities.
5.    The project included (i) the construction of a 138 kV transmission line between Bellevue
and Duncans and 25MVA-69 kV substations at Three Miles (New Port West) and Tredegar
(Spanish Town) respectively; (ii) expansion of existing 138 kV and 69 kV substations as well as
main distribution network; (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of 69 kV transmission lines and
distribution grids; (iv) establishment of a permanent training center; and training program and
engineering/consultant services for JPS. The final project cost (excluding IDC) was US$30.8
million compared to the appraisal estimate of US$29.9 million. The closing date of the loan was
extended twice for a total of two years.
6.    To assist in financing the restoration of transmission and distribution facilities, which were
severely damaged by the September 1988 hurricane, loan funds amounting to US$3.74 million
were reallocated, mainly to finance distribution materials and equipment. Some of the project
transmission lines and a substation were financed by USAID and Sweden respectively instead of
from the Bank loan. The remaining funds required to finance the Distribution Master Plan and
Least Cost Expansion Program were provided by Sweden.



-3-
Achievement of Objectives
7.    The planned project facilities were constructed with some minor modifications, and are
operating satisfactorily. The studies financed under the project were used as a basis for planning
JPS's expansion program.
8.    System losses were reduced from 22% in 1989 to 19% in 1995. This compares to a
targeted level of 15%. Further efforts are underway to reduce these losses through meter
resealing, voltage standardization and the installation of capacitors on the system. It is expected
that these efforts will reduce losses to industry standard levels by 1998 with an initial target of
17.5% by early 1996. The average plant heat rate (BTU/kWh) improved by about 19% between
1988 and 1995.
9.    Efforts to improve institutional performance were only moderately successful. The project
training component helped improve job performance. The high staff turnover prevalent in the
early stages of project implementation was eventually reduced, as a result of the introduction of
competitive compensation. Better staff training helped improve staff morale, and also contributed
to reduced staff turnover. Cost savings through personnel reductions, however, were not
achieved. In FY95, JPS had 2,375 contract and permanent employees and its index of 158
customers per employee was below prevailing international standards.
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
10.   The project was completed in 1995, about two years behind schedule. The loan was
approved in August 1987, but did not become effective until December 1988. As a condition of
loan effectiveness, JPS was required to implement a new tariff structure, but there were
differences of opinion between JPS and the Planning Institute of Jamaica about the proposed
structure. JPS's facilities were damaged by a severe hurricane in September 1988, and required
immediate reconstruction. So that a part of the loan could be available promptly to help finance
the reconstruction, the revised tariff structure required as a condition of loan effectiveness was
waived, and replaced by a dated covenant. This, and the diversion of staff resources to deal with
the reconstruction effort caused implementation delays. Further delays were caused by
Government budgetary limitations on capital spending of public enterprises.
Project Sustainability
11.   In addition to organization improvements, JPS has placed considerable emphasis on staff
development. It is expected that the improvements in operating efficiency achieved in recent
years will continue, and that the facilities constructed under the project will be effectively
maintained. However, it is important that timely tariff increases be made to ensure that lack
financial resources do not interfere with JPS's operating efficiency. The Energy Deregulation and
Privatization and the Generation Recovery and Improvement Projects financed with the assistance
of the Bank as well as an Electricity Improvement Project financed with the assistance of IDB are
underway, and will continue the improvements achieved under the Fourth Power Project.

Bank Performance
12.   Relationships between JPS and Bank staff were conducted in a professional and
cooperative spirit, and project issues were satisfactorily resolved. The Bank was responsive to
the changing needs of JPS, especially in reallocating the loan expenditure categories to help
finance the urgently needed restoration of facilities damaged by the 1988 hurricane.
Borrower Performance
13.   During early project implementation, JPS was short of qualified and experienced staff and
staff tumover was high. However, after this difficulty was overcome, JPS's performance was
good.
Assessment of Outcome
14.   The main project components consisted of the physical facilities. These were completed,
within the cost estimates, and are operating satisfactorily. Training conducted under the project
will provide long-term benefits through improved personnel efficiency. Overall, the outcome of
the project is expected to be satisfactory.
15.   JPS made timely requests for tariff increases to the Government, but approval was either
delayed or not granted. JPS was able to meet the loan agreement rate of return requirements of
5% and 6% on annually revalued net fixed assets in FY88 and FY89 respectively. The rate of
return requirement for FY90 onwards was 8%. JPS was unable to meet this requirement between
FY 90 and FY95 except in FY93. Despite its inability to fully meet the rate of return
requirements, JPS was able to finance about 70% of its FY88 to FY95 capital spending and
additions to working capital from internal cash generation.
Future Operations
16.   Following Government's decision to privatize JPS, no further Bank assistance in financing
JPS's physical facilities is planned. However, as part of a possible future operation, the Bank may
provide some assistance to Government to help identify, evaluate and select a site for future
generation facilities to be built, owned and operated by the private sector.
Key Lessons Learned
17.   Major project delays were probably unavoidable given the circumstances described in
para. 13 above. The main lessons to be learned are:
(a)   Where industry standards personnel levels are important to the attainment of
efficiency improvements, as is the case for public utilities, a specific loan covenant
covering these levels should be agreed with the borrower.



- 5 -
(b)    To help avoid delays in the early stage of project implementation, sufficiently
qualified personnel should be required to be appointed as soon as possible and, at
the latest, before loan effectiveness.
(c)    If adequate, tariff levels and structure or sector policy reforms are necessary, they
should be required to be implemented before loan effectiveness given the
difficulties of achieving such reforms subsequently.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2869-JM)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Background
1.    The Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS),a Government-owned company, is
responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Jamaica.
Government plans to privatize the company are now underway. Meantime, Government policy is
that all new generation capacity will be provided by the private sector. JPS's peak demand in
FY95 was 391.8 MW (FY88 297 MW) and the company had about 372 thousand customers
(FY88 271 thousand). JPS has about 1900 permanent employees. A Third Power Project, which
was completed in 1988 with the assistance of a US$30.5 million Bank Loan, rehabilitated JPS's
existing generating units. As a consequence, outages due to generator failures significantly
declined, and the system heat rate improved by about 20%. Despite these improvements in power
supply, there were frequent outages caused by inadequate maintenance and management
practices. Overloaded distribution equipment was also a cause of high system losses. Continued
improvements to power supply were regarded as crucial to tourism development and industrial
competitiveness. The Fourth Power Project, which is the subject of this report, aimed to continue
the rehabilitation and institutional objectives of the Third Power Project.
Project Objectives and Description
2.    The main project objectives were to: (a) increase and improve the utilization of the
existing generating system by expanding and upgrading the transmission distribution networks; (b)
prepare future power projects; and (c) strengthen JPS's managerial and engineering capabilities.
The project was designed to help JPS meet Jamaica's power needs to 1992. It consisted of:
(a)   Transmission Lines: Construction of about 51 circuit-kilometres of a new 138kV
transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans and rehabilitation of about 70 circuit-
kilometres of existing 69 kV transmission lines.
(b)   Substations: Extension of the existing 138 kV substations at Bellevue and Duncans;
construction of a new 24kV substation at Newport West and at Spanish Town..
(c)   Distribution: Extension and upgrading of the distribution network to provide
electricity to new customers to improve power supply and reduce system losses.
(d)   Consulting Services: Consulting services for: studies related to expansion of JPS's
system; supervision of the construction of the 138 kV Bellevue-Duncans transmission
line; 1987-1995 Distribution System Master Plan study; and assistance in management,
engineering and operations.



- 7 -
(e)    Training of JPS staff: Continuation of the training program started under the Third
Power Project. The program aimed to develop JPS's staff and to establish a permanent
training center.
(f)   Information System Program: Purchase of software packages to upgrade
managerial and operational systems and procedures.
3.    The final project cost (excluding interest during construction) was US$30.8 million
compared to the appraisal estimate of US$29.9 million. During the FY88 to FY95 project
implementation period, JPS's total capital spending was about US$282 million.
Achievement of Project Objectives
4.    Physical Objectives. The main physical objectives of the Project were achieved as shown

5.    To assist in financing the restoration of transmission and distribution facilities, which were
severely damaged by the September 1988 hurricane, loan funds amounting to US$3. 74 million
were reallocated, mainly to finance distribution materials and equipment. Some of the project
transmission lines and a substation were financed by USAID and Sweden respectively instead of
from the Bank loan. The remaining funds required to finance the Distribution Master Plan and
Least Cost Expansion Program were provided by Sweden. The information system component of
the project was postponed and removed from the Project, but consulting services to recommend a
long-term strategic infornation system were later added. Progress has been made in
implementing the recommendations. The general ledger component is complete and the
introduction of the customer information system well underway.
6.    The Least Cost Expansion Plan included in the project was used as a basis for planning
JPS's generation needs.
7.    Institutional Objectives. Efforts to improve institutional performance were only
moderately successful. About 140 staff months of training in administration, engineering and
power system operation were conducted under the Project. This has improved job performance.
After some delays, a more competitive remuneration system was established for managers and
professional staff. This was one of the project objectives and, together with improved morale as a
result of staff training, has resulted in reducing the high staff turnover which prevailed earlier.
Cost savings through personnel reductions, however, were not achieved. In FY95, JPS had 2,375
of which 1,806 were permanent employees. Its index of 158 customers per employee
(considering contract and permanent employees) was below prevailing international standards.
The personnel efficiency index defined in the SAR (see Table 5 in Part III) was customers per
permanent employee, which overestimates this index.
8.    As a result of a 1991 Operations Audit study and a 92/93 study on restructuring the power
sector, both as part of the Energy Sector Deregulation and Privatization Project (Loan 3502-JM),
JPS went through a series of organizational changes. The changes have improved the company's
operating efficiency and led to speedier decision making. The company was organized into
separate divisions one for generation and the second for transmission and distribution. This was
intended to prepare the way for the creation of two separate entities, as part of the plans for
privatization. However, Government now plans to divest the company as a single entity, and the
operation of two separate divisions has been discontinued.
Improvements to JPS' System Operating Efficiency
9.    The average plant heat rate (BTU/kWh) improved by about 19% between 1988 and 1995.
System losses were reduced from 22% in FY89 to 19% in 1995. This compares to a targeted
level of 15%. Further efforts are underway to reduce these losses through meter resealing,
voltage standardization and the installation of capacitors on the system. It is expected that these
efforts will reduce losses to 17.5% by early 1996.
10.   Financial Objectives. The Jamaican dollar (J$) declined from J$5.50 to the US$ in 1988
to J$33.50 in 1994. This added considerably to JPS's costs, and tariff increases did not keep pace



-9-
with inflation. JPS made timely applications for tariff increases, but approval was either delayed
or not granted. JPS was able to meet the loan agreement rate of return requirements of 5% and
6% on annually revalued net fixed assets in FY88 and FY89 respectively, The rate of return
requirement for FY90 onwards was 8%. JPS was unable to meet this requirement between FY90
and FY95 except in FY93. The FY93 performance was the result of a December 1991 tariff
increase and strong sales growth. A JPS request for a 13.4% tariff increase, effective June 1,
1995, has not been approved by Government.
11.   Despite its inability to fully meet the rate of return requirements, JPS was able to finance
about 70% of its FY88 to FY95 capital spending and additions to working capital from internal
cash generation. As indicated in para. 12 below, JPS's investment program was much lower rate
of return requirement would probably have sufficed.
Return on Investment
12.   In the SAR, the project was estimated to represent about 6% of JPS's FY88 to FY94
investment program. As the project benefits could not be separated from those of the investment
program, the rate of return was calculated on the overall investment program. On this basis, the
return on investment was estimated at 9.8%. Costs consist mainly of investments in generation,
transmission and distribution as well as incremental fuel and operating costs. Benefits consist of
incremental sales revenues related to the investment program. The FY88 to FY94 program was
prepared before Government decided that new generation capacity is to be provided by the
private sector, and contained a large generation component. The rate of return was recalculated,
using a similar methodology to that in the SAR, for the smaller investment program in the project
implementation period FY88 and FY95. The project was about 11% of the program. The return
on investment is estimated at 1.4%. As the components and period of the investment program
differ from that assumed in the SAR, the returns on investment are not comparable. However, a
low return is to be expected as real tariff levels were reduced by an estimated 24% between FY88
and FY95.
Implementation Record and Major Factors affecting the Project
13.   The project was substantially completed by 1994, about two years behind schedule. The
loan was approved in August 1987, but did not become effective until December 1988. As a
condition of loan effectiveness, JPS was required to implement a new electricity tariff structure,
but there were differences of opinion between JPS and the Planning Institute of Jamaica about the
proposed structure. JPS's facilities were damaged by a severe hurricane in September 1988, and
required immediate reconstruction. So that a part of the loan could be available promptly to help
finance the reconstruction, the tariff requirement relating to loan effectiveness was waived, and
replaced by a dated covenant. Delays in loan effectiveness and the inevitable diversion of staff
resources to dealing with the damage to JPS's facilities caused by the hurricane delayed project
implementation. Further delays were caused by Government budgetary limitations on capital
spending by public enterprises.

Project Sustainability
14.   In addition to organization improvements, JPS has placed considerable emphasis on staff
development. It is expected that the improvements in operating efficiency achieved in recent
years will continue, and that the facilities constructed under the project will be effectively
maintained. However, it is important that timely tariff increases be made to ensure that lack
financial resources do not interfere with JPS's operating efficiency. The Energy Deregulation and
Privatization and the Generation Recovery and Improvement Projects financed with the assistance
of the Bank as well as an Electricity Improvement Project financed with the assistance of I:DB are
underway, and will continue the improvements achieved under the Fourth Power Project.
Bank Performance
15.   Relationships between JPS and Bank staff were conducted in a cooperative spirit, and
project issues were satisfactorily resolved. The Bank was responsive to the changing needs of
JPS, especially in reallocating the Loan between project components to help finance the urgently
needed restoration of facilities damaged by the 1988 hurricane. The Bank also waived a condition
of effectiveness that may have delayed early access to loan finance.
Borrower Performance
16.   During early project implementation, JPS was short of qualified and experienced staff and
staff turnover was high. However, after this difficulty was overcome, JPS's performance was
satisfactory although internal procurement procedures tended to slow down the steps leading to
contract award.
Assessment of Outcome
17.   The main project components consisted of the physical facilities. These were completed,
within the cost estimates, and are operating satisfactorily. Training conducted under the project
will provide long-term benefits through improved personnel efficiency. Overall the outcome of
the project is expected to be satisfactory.
Future Operations
18.   In FY95, following an explosion which caused extensive damage to JPS's generation
facilities, the Bank provided a loan of US$21 million to help JPS restore lost generation capacity.
Following Government's decision to privatize JPS, no further Bank assistance in financing JPS's
physical facilities is planned. However, as part of a possible future Bank project, the Bank may
provide some assistance to Government to help identify and select sites for future generation
facilities. These facilities will be constructed and operated by the private sector.



Key Lessons Learned
19.   Major project delays were probably unavoidable given the circumstances described in
para. 16 above. The main lessons to be learned are:
(a)   Where industry standards personnel levels are important to the attainment of
efficiency improvements, as is the case for public utilities, a specific loan covenant
covering these levels should be agreed with the borrower.
(b)   To help avoid delays in the early stage of project implementation, sufficiently
qualified personnel should be required to be appointed as soon as possible and, at
the latest, before loan effectiveness.
(c)   If adequate, tariff levels and structure or sector policy reforms are necessary, they
should be required to be implemented before loan effectiveness given the
difficulties of achieving such reforms subsequently.

APPENDIX 2
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
JAMAICA
JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY LIMITED (JPS)
Fourth Power Project - Loan No. 2869-JM
Executive Summary
1.    The Jamaica Fourth Power Project, was approved on August 4, 1987, and made effective
on December 12, 1988. The Project is a continuation of the IBRD funded programs and came
immediately after the Jamaica Third Power project, completed in 1988.
2.    The completion of the Fourth Power Project was originally scheduled for June 30, 1993,
and was subsequently extended on three occasions to June 30, 1995. On the date of closure the
project was 95% complete with 100% completion expected by the end of December 1995.
3.    The total cost of the project was estimated at US$34. 6 million with US$18 million being
provided by the World Bank and the remaining US$16. 6 million by the JPSCo. The foreign cost
was estimated to be US$23. 4 million and local cost of US$11. 2 million. Final cost at completion
was US$36. 1 million.
4.    Final disbursement of the Bank loan took place September 14, 1995. A balance of
US$43,072. 38 remaining at October 31, 1995 was subsequently canceled.
5.    The preparation of the Implementation Completion Report commenced with the Bank's
final supervision and completion mission conducted September 18-22, 1995. This report is
prepared by the Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPSCo) and compliments the ICR
prepared by the Bank. It will be included as part of the Bank's final report.
Project Objectives
6.    The objectives of the project were primarily to improve JPSCO's utilization of existing
energy generating capacity by expanding and upgrading the transmission and distribution network.
The Project also included provisions for consultant services to prepare for future power projects
and to strengthen the company's managerial and engineering capabilities.
Project Implementation Record
7.    Below is a list of the principal aspects of the project and other factors that affected its
outcome.



- 27 -
8.    In September of 1988, the island was affected by a hurricane that caused severe damage to
the Company's transmission and distribution facilities. Consequently, revisions were made to the
Project to reallocate funds to assist in the restoration program. The funds that were reallocated
amount to US$3. 735 million and were mainly for the procurement of distribution material and
equipment to assist in the hurricane restoration.
9.    The allocation of project funds to the "Hurricane Restoration program" necessitated the
removal of the project component for the provision of an Information System. A component for a
Consultant to develop a Long-Term Strategic Information System was later added.
10.   Rehabilitation of the Walks Road - Old Harbor 69 kV transmission line was removed from
the program as the work was undertaken under a USAID sponsored "Hurricane Restoration
program".
11.   Funding for the proposed Spanish Town Free Zone Substation (New Twickenham) was
removed and alternately funded by BITS of Sweden.
12.   The upgrading of the existing Tredegar transmission substation, to include distribution
facilities, was reinstated in the program as it was originally dropped to facilitate the Spanish Town
Free Zone Substation.
13.   Funding for the Distribution Master Plan and the Least Cost Expansion Plan were
discontinued under the loan program as these were alternatively funded by BITS of Sweden.
14.   Due to timing and other considerations, the Company with the approval of the Bank took
the decision not to pursue the consultancy for Thermal Plant Assessment.
15.   The total project cost has remained unchanged throughout the loan period, however, there
have been re-allocations to accommodate changes due to additions, removals and the contribution
to the "Restoration Program".
Achievement of Project Objectives
Transmission Facilities
16.   The construction of 58 circuit-kilometers of a new 138 kV transmission line and the
extension of existing 138 kV substations facilitated the interconnection of the load centers along
the northern coastal regions, where most of the country's tourism facilities are located.
17.   A total of 58. 5 circuit-kilometers of existing 69 kV transmission lines was rehabilitated as
well as the associated substations, which were in a state of disrepair.
18.   A new 69/24 kV, 25 MVA substation was constructed at Three Miles and is now
accommodating the expansion of the Kingston Free Zone area and the resulting load growth.



- 28 -
19.   A new 69/24 kV, 25 MVA distribution substation was constructed at Tredegar and is now
providing for the load growth in the Spanish Town region.
Distribution
20.   Between 1989 and 1995, the distribution system was extended to accommodate an
increase in the average number of customers from 271,000 to 382,000. This growth represents a
net increase of 111,000 new customers or a 41% increase in the Company's customer base.
These customers were added as a part of the project.
21.   Approximately 2,200 circuit-kilometers of distribution line were upgraded from operation
at 4 kV, 12 kV and 13. 8 kV to 24 kV. This has assisted in reducing system losses from 22% in
1988 to 19. 6% in 1994. The system losses estimated at June 30, 1995, was 17. 44%.
22.   A total of 58. 8 MVARs of capacitors have been installed and has assisted in improving
off-peak power factor to 0. 98 and on-peak power factor to 0. 92.
Consulting Services
23.   The Company's ability to utilize existing generating capacity and plan for future capacity
has been significantly improved.
24.   The Least Cost Expansion Plan (LCEP), was reviewed under the loan program, and now
forms the basis of the generation plan, which is reviewed bi-annually and in turn forms the basis
for the Medium-Term System Expansion Plan which informs future investment forecasts.
25.   The subsequent revisions of the LCEP and the development of the Medium-Term Plan are
now being done utilizing in-house resources.
26.   Engineering assistance provided by the Project has strengthened the Company's
capabilities in the implementation of the various transmission and distribution subprojects.
27.   Consulting assistance has facilitated the establishment of a Long-Term Information
Systems Plan to address the development of the Company's Management Information Systems.
Arising from this Plan, projects have been launched to implement new Financial Management and
Customer Information Systems. Other upgrade projects are also being carried out in Inventory
Management and Human Resource Systems.
28.   Training programs, both locally and overseas, were provided at all levels, aiding in
improving the Company's manpower base and assisting in reducing the high staff turnover,
prevalent in the late 1980's.
29.   A Demand Side Management Unit has been established and is now in the process of
implementing a pilot demonstration program to reduce energy demand and increase energy
efficiency.



- 29 -
Difficulties
30.   The major deterrents to the achievement of the project's objectives were as follows:
31.   There were initial delays between Bank approval on August 4, 1987, and the loan
becoming effective on December 12, 1988, due to the difficulties in completion of all conditions
precedent.
32.   There was a massive dislocation in the Company's operation due to the September 12,
1988 hurricane. The hurricane caused significant damage to the company's facilities. A three-
month emergency short-term and a twelve month recovery program was implemented. Resources
had to be reassigned to these programs and necessarily detracted from the progress of the Fourth
Power Project.
33.   Throughout the loan program there were budgetary constraints imposed by the
Government on the Company's expenditure. These limitations on expenditure prevented the
Company, which is a government-owned entity, from adhering to disbursement schedules and
thus caused delays in the project implementation.
34.   At the outset of the Project, the Company suffered shortages of sufficiently qualified and
experienced personnel as well as very high staff turnover levels that reduced the resources
available to the project. Training, provided under the project, and competitive remuneration has
assisted in alleviating this situation.
35.   There were frequent changes in the management, staffing and organization of the various
areas, especially during the latter stage of the loan program. These organizational changes were a
result of preparatory moves by the Government to divest the Company and restructuring to
improve efficiency within the Company.
36.   The JPSCo and the government of Jamaica's procurement, evaluation and approval
processes are very lengthy for construction projects.
37.   On June 3, 1994, there was an explosion at the Old Harbor Power Plant which reduced
system capacity. This reduced the outages available to facilitate construction activities and further
diminished financial resources.
Project Sustainability
38.   The power sector has improved significantly since the inception of the project in 1987.
There has been a reduction in the frequency of customer outages and increased power system
reliability.
39.   The strengthening of the Generation, transmission and distribution systems, under the
Project, has assisted in this regard and is being continued through the implementation of the
following program:
-     IDB - Electricity System Rehabilitation and Improvement Program.



- 30 -
-     World Bank/IDB -- Private Sector Energy Development Program
-     World Bank/Global Environmental Trust
-     Demand Side Management Demonstration Project
-     World Bank -- Generation Recovery and Improvement Project
40.   These programs are designed to continue the development and improvement of the power
system where the Fourth Power Project left off, as well as enhance and develop associated areas
that were not fully addressed in that program
41.   The current move by the Government to divest the Company is not expected to detract
from the achievements of the Fourth Power Project. The program of improvement and expansion
is expected to continue. The forecast of peak demand indicates that growth in energy demand is
expected to continue at the present annual rate of 5% through to 2005. To meet this demand,
another 440 MW of generating capacity will have to be added and this the Government is
initiating through BOO (build-own-operate) projects.
Bank Performance
42.   The Bank's performance during the implementation of this project was satisfactory. No
major problems were encountered during the period. Minor difficulties encountered during
implementation were quickly resolved and whenever it became necessary, the Bank was very
responsive to requests for disbursements and approvals that assisted in expediting project
activities. The personnel assigned to monitor the project were always helpful and cooperative.
Borrower Performance
43.   At the start of the Project, delays were due mainly to the 1988 hurricane and the general
shortage of expertise within the company at the time. In the latter stages of the project, delays
occurred in areas over which the Company had more control including procurement of
consultants and on in-house construction projects.
44.   Several of these subprojects, which had been delayed, had to be re-assessed during the
Bank's supervisory missions. Objectives for these subprojects had to be modified and deadlines
re-established as the Project approached completion. The company's emphasis, over time, had
shifted to other projects which were just coming on stream or had greater priority.
45.   The control of over-expenditure on the construction projects was fairly good considering
the difficult economic conditions (high inflation and escalation of the exchange rate - J$:US$)
prevalent during the loan period.
46.   Project reporting was good, but submission was delayed on several occasions due mainly
to the length of time required to obtain financial data. Submission of the semi-annual report,
including financial data, 30 days after the end of the semester, is difficult to achieve.



- 31 -
47.   Despite all the shortcomings, the company was still able to achieve most of the objectives
of the project. In some cases, the objectives were even exceeded. In conclusion, the performance
of the company, in achieving the project objectives within the extended time frame, was
satisfactory.
Assessment of Outcome
(1)   48.   The major drawback to the Project was the two year delay in its completion. At
the close of the Project on June 30, 1995, the Bellevue to Tredegar 69 kV transmission line
rehabilitation and consultancies for Load Research and Human Resource Information System
were the only sub-projects still outstanding and these were scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1995.
