The Fourth Power Project has been\n            designed to help JPS to meet Jamaica's power needs\n            through 1992.  It includes:  (i) the construction of a 138\n            kV transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans and 25\n            MVA-69 kV substations at Newport West and Spanish Town\n            respectively; (ii) expansion of existing 138 kV and 69 kV\n            substations as well as the main distribution networks; and\n            (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of 69 kV transmission\n            lines and main distribution grids.  Finally, the project\n            involves the (iv) establishment of a permanent training\n            center; and (v) training program and engineering/consultant\n            services for JPS."}, "docdt": "1987-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
