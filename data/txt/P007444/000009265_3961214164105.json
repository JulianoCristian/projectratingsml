Some lessons learned included:  where industry\n            standards personnel levels are important to the attainment\n            of efficiency improvements, as is the case for public\n            utilities, a specific loan covenant covering these levels\n            should be agreed with the borrower. To help avoid delays in\n            the early stage of project implementation, sufficiently\n            qualified personnel should be required to be appointed as\n            soon as possible and, at the latest, before loan\n            effectiveness. If adequate, tariff levels and structure or\n            sector policy reforms are necessary, they should be required\n            to be implemented before loan effectiveness given the\n            difficulties of achieving such reforms subsequently."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
