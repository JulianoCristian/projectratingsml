    Project is to help improve the Jamaica Public Services Co.\n            Ltd.'s (JPS) system operating efficiency by expanding\n            and upgrading transmission lines, substations and\n            distribution networks.  The Fourth Power Project has been\n            designed to help JPS to meet Jamaica's power needs\n            through 1992.  It includes:  (i) the construction of a 138\n            kV transmission line between Bellevue and Duncans and 25\n            MVA-69 kV substations at Newport West and Spanish Town\n            respectively; (ii) expansion of existing 138 kV and 69 kV\n            substations as well as the main distribution networks; and\n            (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of 69 kV transmission\n            lines and main distribution grids.  Finally, the project\n            involves the (iv) establishment of a permanent training\n            center; and (v) training program and engineering/consultant\n            services for JPS."}, "docdt": "1987-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
