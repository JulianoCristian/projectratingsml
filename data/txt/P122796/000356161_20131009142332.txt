1. Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

      Macroeconomic and sector background

1. At the time of appraisal for the first Agriculture Development Policy Operation in the
new series (AgDPO3) that succeeded AgDPO1 and 2, Ghana’s economy was recovering
from a series of shocks, partly spilling over from the 2008 global economic meltdown
that exacerbated a structural trend of widening fiscal imbalances. However, economic
prospects remained high and the Ghanaian economy continued its strong and steady
growth performance, showing strong signs of macroeconomic stabilization. Compared
with 2008, both the fiscal and current account deficits were significantly reduced in 2009
and 2010, as a result of positive exogenous shocks (high cocoa and gold prices) and
significant fiscal stabilization achievements. The exchange rate stabilized. Enhanced
domestic food production, reduced public demand, and credit for private sector also
contributed to a reduction in annual consumer price inflation to single-digits levels.
Ghana also began to export oil in commercial quantities at the end of 2010, shifting the
economic paradigm of Ghana, from agriculture- to oil-led economy. Economic growth
rebounded, reaching 7.7 percent in 2010 (up from 4.0 percent in 2009) and 13.6 percent
in 2011. The Country Economic Memorandum (2007) noted that national rural poverty
(headcount) had decreased from 64 percent in 1991/92 to 50 percent in 1998/99 and 39
percent in 2005/06. Over the same period, the depth of poverty among rural households
(as measured by the poverty gap) had diminished as well, from 0.24 to 0.18 to 0.14.

2. These remarkable achievements resulted in part from strong growth in the agricultural
sector. Cocoa earnings in 2008 amounted to about US$ 1.2 billion, exceeding earnings
from gold. Farmers received 55–60 percent of international prices, increasing the impact
on the local rural economy. Sustained growth rates experienced in the agricultural sector
averaged around 5 percent per year between 2001 and 2006 (compared to 2.1 percent in
2000) and exceeded population growth estimated at 2.7 percent per year. Over 2000–05,
the crop and livestock subsectors grew by 30 percent in real terms—equivalent to an
average increase of 5.4 percent per year.

3. The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy III – Ghana Shared Growth and Development
Agenda (GSGDA) (2010–13) - is an agriculture-led strategy to diversify the economy
away from its dependence on cocoa and toward cereals and other cash crops for export
markets. Development partners regarded the GSDA as an acceptable basis for aligning
support over the short to medium term. The GSGDA recognized that a large share of
growth in agricultural productivity would come from activity in the private sector,
supported by adequate public investments, institutions, and policies.

4. Experiences with PRSCs suggest that budgetary support can be an appropriate
instrument for development assistance. However, the PRSCs—and the MDBS, to which
they contribute - were not considered sufficiently appropriate instruments to deepen the


                                            1
policy dialogue at the sector level, because they necessarily focus on cross-cutting targets.
At the same time, the government had not fully addressed budgetary needs at the sector
level. Instead it relied predominantly on investments through rural development and
agriculture projects, which fostered fast agricultural growth and export diversification.
Yet the use of budgetary rather than project resources was considered critical for Ghana
to plan and implement a coordinated, internally consistent development policy that also
addresses the agricultural sector’s needs at the local government level. In response to the
financing gap for GPRS and the need for sector-level policy support, a first and
subsequent AgDPO series were prepared, with a specific focus on increasing and
improving agricultural outcomes.

      AgDPO design

5. During the first AgDPO series (2008-2010), the government adopted the
Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) which provides a
continent-wide planning framework for development of, and investment in, the
agricultural sector. The adoption of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment
Plan (METASIP) in October 2009 led to a decision by the Regional Operations
Committee to discontinue the on-going AgDPO series and initiate the preparation of a
new AgDPO series to reflect the newly defined policy priorities and resource
requirements, and support the implementation of METASIP.

6. The METASIP represents a Ghana-owned program for the implementation of the
CAADP Compact that was signed in October 2009 by the Government, development
partners, private sector and civil society, including farmers, committing all stakeholders
to renewed collective and individual efforts to support agricultural development.
METASIP also provides an enhanced framework for scaling up resources to agriculture -
in particular, in line with G20 commitments at l'Aguila and Pittsburgh - and for improved
harmonization and alignment.

7. The second AgDPO series was designed to better accommodate the Government's
specific implementation priorities moving forward. As reflected in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report, the new AgDPO series constituted a strategic
response with the following expected benefits: (i) it allowed for closer alignment of Bank
support with the new Government's agenda; (ii) it provided for a more compelling case to
scale up assistance beyond the levels originally envisaged in the CAS; and (iii) it
facilitated a better alignment of more specific policy measures to be supported with the
Government's policy and institutional reform agenda.

8. The second AgDPO series supported the development objectives set in the Ghana
Shared Growth and Development Agenda for 2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the
need for greater executive efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the
adequate setting for reducing poverty and socio-economic inequalities through
agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. The
operation was aligned with the recently updated World Bank Group’s CAS objectives for
FY08-12 and with the World Bank’s Africa Action Plan. The AgDPO series was



                                             2
consistent with the Bank's strategic focus on country systems, and the Government's draft
aid policy that seeks a greater share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support.

9. The AgDPO3 and AgDPO4 operations supported the Government’s efforts to address
the development needs of the northern part of the country. To address the growing
regional disparities between the North and the South, the Government’s agriculture
programs feature a strong focus on the North, evidenced by the Savanna Accelerated
Development Agency’s (SADA) program that facilitates commercial agriculture
development. In addition, fertilizer technology adoption programs focus on commodities
that are predominantly grown in the North, mainly maize, rice and sorghum.

10. The Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) forms the basis
of Ghana’s agriculture sector programs, and the METASIP. It constitutes a sector policy
that extends beyond the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) and encompasses the
mandates of all ministries that are expected to contribute to agriculture sector outcomes.

11. The METASIP is a sector-wide investment plan that embodies the commitments
made in the CAADP Compact. It includes activities among all agriculture-related
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) based on the classification of functions
for the sector. It also anticipates activities of the private sector and civil society and takes
into account ongoing projects. As a sector investment plan, emphasis has been on
consultations and actions by all stakeholders of the sector: MoFA, other relevant MDAs,
Development Partners (DPs), NGOs, academia, civil society, farmers and other on-farm
and off-farm private sector operators, researchers and service providers. The
implementation of the METASIP is intended to drive the application of a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAp) to bring on board sector stakeholders in effective coordination and
participation.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

12. The original Program Development Objective of AgDPO3 was “to enhance the
productivity and competitiveness of Ghanaian agriculture”.

13. The AgDPO series focused on accelerating agricultural growth to reduce poverty,
particularly in the North, and to ensure that Ghana’s agriculture remains competitive and
profitable. To achieve this result, productivity of the sector would have to increase
substantially, access to markets by farmers and firms would have to improve, and
management of, and support to, the sector would have to be enhanced.

14. The key indicators approved were:
     Number of demand driven research projects identified for funding
     Quantity of certified seed produced
     Number of agro-dealers selling seed
     Value of non-traditional exports
     Value of agriculture sector lending by banks
     Storage capacity for agricultural commodities


                                               3
      Number of joint management structures of irrigation infrastructure in place
      Number of new PPPs on irrigation at prefeasibility stage
      Issuing of new licenses for industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels restricted
      Number of industrial trawlers with fishing license
      Composition of MoFA budget (Admin/Goods & Services as % of MoFA
       discretionary budget)
      MoFA budget execution rates Admin/Goods & Services and Investment
           o budgeted against released
           o released against expenditure

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

15. In preparing AgDPO4, a minor modification was made to the original PDO “enhance
the productivity and competitiveness of Ghanaian agriculture”, to read “enhance
productivity and market access among farmers, and to improve agriculture sector
management”. This reformulated PDO better reflected the policy areas, outcomes and
indicators in the Results Framework.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

16. Consistent with the Sector Objectives of FASDEP II and METASIP, the following
policy areas and objectives were identified and supported by the AgDPO series:

       AgDPO Policy Area 1. Agricultural technology for improved on-farm
productivity
             Policy Objective: Improved research, extension services, skills training

18. The second AgDPO series, originally envisaged to consist of three operations was
discontinued after the second operation in the series (AgDPO4) because the Government
of Ghana desired to consolidate budget support in a single series (instead of several sector
specific DPOs) to give it greater flexibility and oversight over policy actions and to
reduce transaction cost.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

19. The Board approved the first of the programmatic series (AgDPO3) on May 26, 2011,
a Credit of SDR 36 million (US$ 57 million equivalent) to support METASIP. Following
Board approval, the Financing Agreement for AgDPO3 was signed on July 29, 2011 by
the Borrower and the International Development Association (IDA). The Credit was
declared effective on September 16, 2011.

20. The second of the series, AgDPO4, was approved by the Board on May 15, 2012, a
Credit of SDR 32.2 million (US$ 50 million equivalent). Following Board approval, the
Financing Agreement for AgDPO4 was signed on August 7, 2012 by the Borrower and
IDA. The Credit was declared effective on September 12, 2012.

21. AgDPO3 in the amount of US$ 57 million equivalent was disbursed in September 22,
2011 based on the Recipient’s completion of the following prior actions:

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:



                                                  6
   Background analysis

23. During design and implementation, both operations drew on social and economic
analysis, specific analytical work, as well as work on public financial management (see
references in Annex 6). Poverty aspects continued to draw on results of the 2006 Ghana
Living Standards Survey (GLSS-5), identifying recent trends in poverty and human
development, confirming the need for sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for
maintaining the long term trends in growth, urbanization and poverty reduction. Program
design also drew on background papers of the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
entitled Ghana: Meeting the Challenge of Accelerated and Shared Growth, which focused
on necessary actions to reach the Government‘s stated goal of attaining middle-income
status by 2015. The 2008 WDR on Agriculture noted that to grow and reduce poverty,
Sub-Saharan African countries will need a well performing agriculture sector. These
findings guided the program to be supported by the series. The operations also responded
to the IEG report on agriculture assistance which recommended that the Bank focus
attention on achieving improvements in agricultural productivity by: a) establishing
realistic goals for expansion of irrigation; b) recognizing the need to increase productivity
of rain-fed agriculture through improvements in land quality, as well as improved water
and drought management; c) helping to design efficient mechanisms, including public-
private partnerships, to provide farmers with critical inputs, including fertilizers, water,
credit, and seeds; and d) supporting the development of marketing and transport
infrastructure. The FY07 External Reviews of Public Financial Management (ERPFM)
also confirmed that public expenditure is a critical element of implementing the new
policy and ensuring the efficient use of scare public resources.

24. The METASIP design process informed the formulation of the first AgDPO series.
Studies by IFPRI, based on their computable general equilibrium model, identified the
significant potential for agricultural growth by narrowing existing yield gaps as well as
additional opportunities for value addition. These studies also confirm the wider literature
on the substantial poverty reducing impact of such growth. The USAID-funded AgCLIR
diagnostic (Agriculture Commercial, Legal and Institutional Reform), identified measures
to increase private investment in agriculture including measures to strengthen links with
out-growers. This reinforced previous analytical work that identified the important
contribution to be played by FBOs. Analytical work by the Bank has highlighted the
threats to Ghana’s marine fisheries and the urgent need for improved management of the
fishing fleet. Several assessments of the initial implementation of the fertilizer voucher
program identified a number of areas for improvement, while also reflecting the differing
positions among stakeholders.

 Positive factors
25. The introduction of the second AgDPO series responded to the financing needs of the
newly developed METASIP and to the needs of MoFA as the lead government institution.
It reflected newly articulated policy and program priorities and was designed to
complement investments by other development partners, using the METASIP as a single
reference point. The AGDPOs give GoG flexibility in program management; by using the




                                             7
GoG system, it helped to strengthen systems (including financial management,
procurement, planning and M&E).

26. The Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG), comprising government and
development partners, is providing the platform for dialogue and coordination. This
group was also instrumental in adopting the CAADP planning process, including the
launching the CAADP Compact, and the adoption of the METASIP. During the period
under review, the ASWG held annual sector reviews, whose recommendations provided
input into the policy discussion related to AgDPO and the more general sector policy
dialogue. The task team leader engaged actively in the ASWG as deputy co-chair, and
later co-chair with the government representative (Minister and Chief Director of MoFA),
which strengthened the policy dialogue in the sector between the Bank and the
Government of Ghana. The task team leader also led dialogue among Development
Partners that are active in agriculture and represented thee ASWG at various fora. This
dialogue promoted enhanced coordination amongst Development Partners, and identified
a division of labor amongst Development Partners based on expertise in various sub areas
of the agricultural sector.

27. Preparation of the second AgDPO series took into consideration the ongoing budget
support operation by CIDA, whose policy agenda focused on local level government
management processes, gender, farmer organizations and research-extension linkages.
The AgDPO series was designed in close consultation with CIDA, resulting in a policy
reform agenda that provided complementarity and mutual reinforcement.

28. During the design of the G-8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition
Cooperation Framework in Ghana in 2012, the second AgDPO series was used as a basis
for the formulation of policy implementation measures in the areas of technology
development and adoption, enabling environment for investors, agricultural data/statistics,
and nutrition. This reflects the important role the AgDPOs 3 and 4 played in helping
identify program support priorities based on a commonly recognized and Government
owned policy reform framework.

29. From the point of view of MoFA, the second AgDPO series has continued to provide
flexibility and discretion over the allocation and use of resources for the agricultural
sector’s priorities. Its complementarity to traditional investment lending was appreciated,
especially because it facilitated sector dialogue that allowed MoFA to remain focused and
maintain the momentum in rolling out agreed policy and institutional reforms consistent
with FADSDEP II.

30. MoFA staff suggested that the ministry had enhanced its capacity for planning and
executing its programs. CAADP-oriented support mechanisms, including the AgDPO
series, enabled and empowered MoFA to lead the design of FASDEP II and its
implementation instrument, METASIP, which now provides the overall framework for
investment in food security and agricultural development.

   Negative factors



                                            8
31. The discontinuation of the AgDPO series by the client implies that policy support
planned for the third, concluding operation in the series (AgDPO5) will not occur as
planned, with possible negative consequences for some of the policy objectives that
required consolidation before positive results could be expected.

32. Substantial reforms in the seed technology sector, as supported by the AgDPO series,
are of great importance and pave the way for long term productivity growth. However,
they have not resulted in rapid change on the ground during the two AgDPOs. A response
to fundamental reforms such as the new legislation and new institutional support
structures will require more time to translate into increased availability and adoption of
improved technology among farmers. In the absence of continued support through the
AgDPO series, the G-8 New Alliance Cooperation Framework has recognized the
importance of the policy reform and has started providing implementation support.

33. Administrative constraints in the form of limited resource allocation at the district
level have been identified by CIDA as a constraint for effective service delivery. The
decentralization process that has recently started is expected to improve resource
availability, accountability, and implementation capacity at the local government level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34. Responsibility for implementing policy reforms under AgDPO3 and 4 resided with
MoFA, with additional financial and contractual responsibilities performed by MoFEP.
Bank supervision was aligned with MoFA’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
and the activities of other donors, focusing on annual reporting and the Joint Sector
Review process by all stakeholders.

35. The design of the AgDPO series’ results framework is consistent with FASDEP II
Sector Objectives and draws on the MoFA M&E framework. Out of the seven PDOs and
12 indicators, performance of seven indicators was tracked using data from the MoFA
M&E system and other frequently collected information. Data for the remaining
indicators were either partially or not at all covered and required data from industry
sources.

36. During implementation, ongoing analytical work under the Joint Sector Review
process, policy studies by IFPRI, and other analytical work were utilized to augment
MoFA sector performance data. Reports on macroeconomic developments assessed
progress in implementing the macroeconomic framework agreed by the Government of
Ghana, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and MDBS. Those reports
formed the basis for assessing the adequacy of the macroeconomic framework for the two
operations.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation




                                            9
37. The objectives of AgDPO3 and 4 remain highly relevant to Ghana’s current
agricultural development policy, FASDEP II, and the sector’s investment plan METASIP.
The policy agenda emphasizes the need for achieving poverty reduction and enhanced
resilience of the agriculture sector through productivity-enhancing technology
development and subsequent adoption; farmer integration into value chains; improved
management of fisheries resources; and improved institutional coordination and sector
management. The PDOs directly reflect FASDEP’s policy objectives (see section 1.4).
Moreover, the objectives are consistent with the program areas of METASIP. In addition,
the PDOs are aligned with the CAS.

38. During preparation of AgDPO2 in the previous series, the need to align subsequent
budget support operations more closely with METASIP became clear. The Bank and
government agreed that, in order to accommodate the government's specific
implementation priorities moving forward, the first series would be concluded with
AgDPO2, and a new series would be prepared. As reflected in the CAS Progress Report,
this strategic response was expected to have the following benefits: (i) better alignment of
Bank support with the government's new agenda; (ii) improve the case for scaling up
assistance beyond the levels originally envisaged in the CAS, in recognition of the
financing gap identified in the newly articulated investment program under the CAADP
framework; and (iii) improved alignment of specific policy measures within the
government's policy and institutional reform agenda.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

39. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, AgDPO3 and 4 were successful in
achieving their objectives, especially considering the absence of AgDPO5. The
operations focused on creating the regulatory and institutional frameworks for improving
agricultural technology adoption and productivity, market access, management of the
fisheries sector, and management and coordination in the agriculture sector. Out of seven
objectives, achievement of two objectives is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Four
objectives are rated satisfactory, and one is rated highly satisfactory. In assessing
outcomes, it must be recognized that the programmatic series of three operations was not
completed and that only AgDPO3 and 4 were implemented. In line with the policy areas
supported by AgDPO3 and 4 as presented in section 1.4, achieved outcomes can be
summarized as follows:

AgDPO Policy Area 1: Agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity

   a. Improved research, extension services, skills training and education in
      agricultural sciences and farm management

40. Across Africa, the development and dissemination of relevant agricultural technology
remains a challenge that requires coordination and substantial investment. In Ghana, with
the mainstreaming of agricultural research in the national STI (Science, Technology and
Innovation) Policy and Development Program (a Prior Action of the AgDPO operations),
and consequently the mainstreaming of agricultural research in the national budget



                                            10
process, the sustainability of agriculture research funding has been improved. This
includes the institutionalization, coordination and planning required to enhancing the
ability of the research system to identify and program research priorities among
producers and other stakeholders, thus ensuring their relevance. Progress has been
recorded with 48 demand driven research projects identified in all 10 regions during 2012
which exceeded the target of 30. An important vehicle for identifying the type of research
required by farmers are the regional Research Extension Liaison Committees (RELCs).
The West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) funded by the Bank and
CIDA provides support to the research system.

41. An important element of technology development and dissemination is regional
technology exchange which is part of the STI Policy. A key aspect of its implementation
is the regional seed harmonization regulation of ECOWAS that allows for accelerated
release of plant varieties that are centrally registered.

42. Targets for demand driven research and technology development have been exceeded
and overall progress towards the objective is being made. Achievement of the objective is
satisfactory.

   b. Adoption of agricultural input technology

43. To improve the availability and quality of certified seed and fertilizer among
smallholder farmers in Ghana, private sector investment is needed. Legislation has been
passed, institutional adjustments have been made, and technology adoption programs
have been implemented (courtesy of various Prior Actions of the operation). Significant
progress was made under the AgDPO3 with the passing of a new national plants and
fertilizer bill in June 2010.

44. Regarding seed, transition from the existing government-driven plant breeding and
seed distribution system to a competitive private sector driven system will take several
years. In the Results Framework it was projected that seed production (as a proxy for
seed availability to farmers) for maize, rice and soya would increase by 10% between
2010 and 2012, reflecting the improved enabling environment and the demand generated
by the government’s input support program that included seed. However, the results show
that seed production figures across crops have declined rather than increased (from a total
of 8,927 tons in 2010 to 5,365 tons in 2012). This decline can be partly attributed to
adverse weather conditions during 2011 which affected many crops and resulted in
overall poor performance of the sector. The decline in seed production for these three
crops is also a manifestation of inadequate seed production and marketing arrangements
that persist during the transition from a public to a private sector operated system.

45. While seed production, crop production and crop yields for maize, rice and soya may
have been disappointing during 2011 and 2012, other crops have performed better, as
evidenced by the substantial increase in Non-Traditional Exports (see next section). This
may mark the beginning of a crop diversification process that includes a number of
export oriented value chains into which smallholder farmers are increasingly integrated.



                                            11
46. In the meantime, MoFA is implementing an intensive farmer education program on
the benefits of improved seeds use.. In addition, certified seed for staple food crops is
being offered to farmers as part of the fertilizer-subsidy program, promoting the
synergies of fertilizer and seed and moving away from the fertilizer-only mindset (a Prior
Action of AgDPO4). Further improvements and an exit strategy of the subsidy element of
the program were going to be covered in AgDPO5. However, it is reassuring to see that
the Government is already taking action to improve the program by reducing leakages
and developing an exit strategy under the recognition that subsidy programs must be
temporary and terminated as soon as its objective has been reached (in this case, to
introduce a new technology to farmers)).

47. To measure the expected improvement in the availability of seed in rural areas, the
number of agro-dealers selling seed is used as an indicator. The indicator’s baseline value
(291 dealers) would need to be updated by the industry, an exercise that was planned for
2013/14. Preliminary information from MoFA suggests that there were 257 registered
seed dealers in 2012, but this may not be a complete count. With the AgDPO series
discontinued, no reliable data are available.

48. Private seed supply is not monitored systematically by MoFA and could therefore not
be used as an indicator, but for purposes of interpreting the results for this objective it is
necessary to make the link with Policy Area 2. Improvements in grain markets that
involve private investment often occur through contract farming and out-grower schemes
that mostly bypass the government input supply chain. For example, companies that
financed the majority of the additional warehousing space (such as Wienco) supply maize
seed (mostly imported), fertilizer and agrochemicals to tens of thousands of farmers
through their own distribution networks, effectively replacing the demand for traditional
certified seed with a demand for high quality improved varieties. Likewise, the three
companies that have revitalized the cotton sector in the northern regions of Ghana
provide tens of thousands of smallholders with cotton seed and other inputs.

49. Undoubtedly, private sector participation in agro-input dealership has grown over the
years. Under the 2010 Plant and Fertilizer Act (Act 803) and its regulations, 33 fertilizer
companies, 1,079 fertilizer retailers, 85 fertilizer distributors and 90 fertilizer products
have been registered, alongside with 2,023 dealers that deal in inputs of various kinds.
The number of registered agro-input dealers increased by 753 (from 1,270 to 2,023
dealers) in 2011 (the year of implementation of AgDPO3). This increase in registered
dealers exceeds the target of 291 specified in the AgDPO3, 4 and 5 results framework.

50. Despite the decline in seed production as measured in 2012, the number of agro-
dealers has increased and reforms in the agricultural inputs sector have been substantial,
including increased private sector led supply of high yielding maize varieties and
provision of other inputs for various crops grown under contract arrangements. It may be
well that a substantial part of the 753 additional dealers sell seed but this could not be
substantiated, for the lack of up-to-date data on seed dealers. AgDPO5 would have




                                             12
allowed for consolidation in this area, in the absence of which achievement of the
objective is rated unsatisfactory.

AgDPO Policy Area 2: Market and Value Chain Development

   a. Increased participation of smallholders

51. The establishment of the Outgrower Value Chain Fund (a Prior Action of AgDPO3),
the introduction of an agriculture window in the Export Development Fund (a Prior
Action of AgDPO4), the introduction of loan guarantees, the adoption of weather
insurance, and the launch of the Warehouse Receipt System (Prior Action of AgDPO3)
have contributed to increased availability of short and medium term financing. Lending
by commercial banks and rural community banks has increased from GhC 472 million in
2010 to GhC 631 million in 2012, exceeding the 2012 AgDPO4 target of GhC 566
million as well as the AgDPO5 target of GhC 613 million.

52. As an indicator for smallholder participation in internationally competitive
agricultural value chains, the value of non-traditional agricultural exports was used. This
excluded cocoa (as cocoa production is managed through COCOBOD) as well as tuna
and banana (which do not involved smallholder enterprises).

53. The available data suggest large increases in volume and value of agricultural exports
in 2011 over 2010, which were largely sustained during 2012.

54. The largest contributor to the growth in non-traditional exports is cashew, whose
production increased from 57,000 tons in 2010 to 157,000 tons in 2012, valued at GhC
170 million. In addition, shea nut exports more than doubled during this period, to GhC
48 million in 2012. Other significant increases were recorded for coffee, fish, pineapple,
mango, coconut and beans, all of which are smallholder crops. The information in the
table above however does not include cotton whose production increased from 2,000 tons
in 2010 to some 20,000 tons in 2012. The cotton sector’s revival is being facilitated by
the government and implemented by three companies that work with 20,000 farmers in
the northern regions.

55. As measured by the increased availability of credit to the agricultural sector,
combined with the increase in the production of smallholder cash crops, participation of



                                             13
smallholders in value chains has increased substantially and AgDPO3, AgDPO4 and
AgDPO5 targets were exceeded. Achievement of this objective is highly satisfactory.

   b. Improved performance of grain markets

56. Grain marketing in Ghana is suffering from high post-harvest losses, poor product
quality, lack of market transparency, and unpredictable market interventions by
government agencies. With the Government formally supporting and facilitating a
privately operated Warehouse Receipt System (Prior Action - AgDPO3), including
associated legislation (which would have been a Prior Action under AgDPO5), the
private sector is responding by expanding its market activities and investments in rural
areas. Although its operational modalities were publicized at the onset of the 2012
marketing season (Prior Action of AgDPO4).

57. As a measurement of grain market performance, available storage capacity was
selected as an indicator. Against a baseline of 110,460 tons of storage capacity (80,105
tons of which are publicly owned) for agricultural purposes, and recognizing the general
lack of storage capacity (especially in rural areas), the target increase in warehouse
capacity of approximately 23,000 tons was realized during 2013. This includes
warehouses constructed under the auspices of the Ghana Grains Council for the
Warehouse Receipt System, community warehouses as well as warehouses financed by
individual private sector operatives including WIENCO. The total increase in warehouse
capacity consists of 19,680 tons storage capacity in the Northern Region; 560 tons in the
Upper East Region; 320 tons in the Upper East Region; 500 tons in the Brong Ahafo
Region; and 2,000 tons in the Ashanti Region.

58. Government has actively facilitated private sector participation in grain markets and
has recognized the importance of transparency and predictability of its interventions
through the National Buffer Stock Company. The demand for additional storage capacity
confirms the improved policy environment, and the construction of 23,000 tons of
warehouse capacity since 2010 meets the target set for AgDPO5. Achievement of the
objective is satisfactory.

AgDPO Policy Area 3: Irrigation and Other Infrastructure

   a. Improved irrigated agriculture

59. The introduction of new regulations regarding the management of public irrigation
infrastructure (Prior Action under AgDPO3) aims to encourage water users to take
responsibility for the upkeep of infrastructure, and allow larger scale public-private
partnerships to develop. The regulations also address important issues of land allocation
within irrigated areas and support the Joint Irrigation System Management (JISM) system
that is operated by GIDA and farmer cooperatives in a number of schemes. As part of the
development of the JISM system, Land Allocation Committees (LACs) were formed and
strengthened in all 14 schemes using the JISM system during 2012. The LACs play an




                                           14
important role in collecting the Irrigation Service Charge (ISC) and are instrumental in
ensuring sustainability.

60. To support the development of new irrigation investments (including PPPs), a new
irrigation sector Pre-investment Reform Action Framework was completed (Prior Action
under AgDPO4). This framework outlines investment priorities, institutional reforms, and
implementation modalities. Based on the framework, recommendations on the
restructuring of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) are being
developed (would have been Prior Action for AgDPO5).

61. A PPP is currently being developed at the Torgorme Irrigation Scheme (Kpong Left
Bank Irrigation Project - KLBIP). The project started in 2010 with funding from the
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and is under construction. The main stakeholders
under this PPP include:
   i. The Government of Ghana, represented by GIDA.
  ii. VEGPRO, a private investor who has leased 1,000 ha of land for irrigated high
       value horticulture production, operating a privately financed center pivot
       irrigation system, drawing water from the main canal and from Kpong dam.
 iii. Ten midsize private irrigators who operate on a total of 50 ha (5 ha each).
 iv. Approximately 880 farmers grouped into 15 farmer organizations and collectively
       cultivating 400 ha. These farmers act as out-grower farmers for VEGPRO.
  v.   The Irrigation Development Authority represented by a contracted manager of the
       facility.
 vi. A Stakeholders Governing Board (SGB) providing oversight and direction to the
       scheme’s management. The SGB represents private and public stakeholders and is
       chaired by a GIDA representative.

62. A second PPP is being developed on the Kpong Right Bank with support from the
Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project (co-financed by the World Bank and USAID). A
pre-feasibility study of the PPP has recently been completed and will allow the
preparation of detailed terms of reference for the full feasibility study. This process is led
by GIDA.

63. Policy and institutional reforms in the irrigation sector have gained momentum in
recent years and are resulting in changed management structures in existing public
irrigation schemes as well as in the development of PPPs. Given that all targets were
exceeded, achievement of the objective is satisfactory.

AgDPO Policy Area 4: Fisheries

   a. Improved management of the fisheries sector

64. The Ghana Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector Plan (2011-2016) was approved by
Cabinet in October 2011 with an overall objective of revitalizing the fisheries sector. In
particular, the plan seeks to improve the sector’s governance and make the fisheries
governance institutions robust. The plan would ensure that fish resources are managed in



                                             15
an environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically profitable manner. It
also seeks to reduce illegal fishing through the strengthening of monitoring, control and
surveillance (MCS) of fisheries licenses and regulations, in order to increase the value
added benefits from fish resources captured by the country.

65. A suspension on the issuing of new licenses for industrial and semi-industrial fishing
vessels was issued in 2012 (Prior Action AgDPO4). The suspension has been
implemented, with 14 industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels registered (as
renewals) in 2012, compared to 17 that were registered in 2011.

66. The number of industrial trawlers with fishing licenses (which is a different vessel
category from the industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels above) was to be
maintained at 67 under AgDPO3 and to be reduced to 63 under AgDPO4. However, a
total of 81 industrial trawlers licenses were issued in 2011, and 87 in 2012. The Fisheries
Commission clarified that all licenses issues constituted renewals of existing licenses, i.e.
no new licenses were issued. The additional trawlers that appeared with licenses were in
dry dock and not operational during 2011, and had their existing licenses renewed for
2012. The baseline number of licenses of 63 did not include these dormant licenses that
were renewed since that time. Although no new licenses were issued, no gradual
reduction of trawler licenses has been pursued, which was the original intention.

67. While new license restrictions are fully imposed for industrial and semi-industrial
vessels as well as trawlers, the original intention to gradually reduce the number of
licensed industrial trawlers has not materialized. Achievement of the objective is
therefore moderately unsatisfactory.

AgDPO Policy Area 5: Sector coordination

   a. Policy Objective: Enhanced delivery of agriculture sector investment
      program

68. A number of measures have been taken to improve the management of the agriculture
sector, which involves multiple ministries and other institutions. A first important step
was the adoption of the METASIP, the sector’s overall investment plan (Prior Action
AgDPO3). METASIP’s structure is consistent with the country’s overall agricultural
policy framework (as laid out in FASDEP II) and with Ghana’s national development
plan (Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda). For the government and other
stakeholders, METASIP provides a broad basis for planning, budgeting, and program
implementation. A new budgeting methodology (Program-Based Budgeting) was
developed in order to enable MoFA and other ministries and agencies to jointly plan and
budget agricultural activities (Prior Action AgDPO4). In addition, an agriculture
expenditure review was carried out in 2012-2013, providing a historical perspective of
sector planning and budgeting during the past 10 years. The study, funded by the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation and administered by the Bank, identifies constraints and
improvements that can be made in the sector’s planning and budgeting.




                                             16
69. Improvements in the planning and budgeting process have translated into improved
budget outcomes. The shares of MoFA budget lines 2 (Admin/Goods & Services) and 3
(Assets/Investment) in MoFA’s total discretionary budget resources (which represents
the resources that deliver activities on the ground) increased from 24% in 2010 to 26.3%
in 2012. This achievement exceeds the original target which was to prevent the share
from decreasing.
          Table 4: Composition of MoFA Budget as a % of Discretionary Budget
         Category                                       2011                 2012
         Budget line 2 (Goods and Services)              4.41                 5.91

70. Regarding MoFA budget execution (the extent to which budgeted resources were
made available and utilized), two indicators were used for line items 2 and 3: budget
releases, and actual expenditures.

71. Respectively 84.2% and 97.2% of the Government of Ghana’s resources that were
budgeted for items 2 and 3 were released to MoFA in 2012, - or slightly below and
slightly above target respectively (Table 5). However, due to the implementation of the
new “single spine” salary structure for civil servants, releases for employees
compensation exceeded the budget by 73%(). Budget releases for assets/investments
were extremely low in 2011. On the other hand, releases of donor resources generally
exceed budgeted amounts and compensate for any shortfall (Table 6).

A comparison of actual expenditure against the annual budget reveals that the former
generally equals or exceeds the latter – i.e. with the exception of line item 2 in 2012, the
targeted budget execution performance of GoG and donor resources has been met or
exceeded.

72. Significant improvements in sector-wide planning and budgeting have been made.
Actual releases of GoG resources were mostly higher than budgeted but mainly for
salaries. Donors have compensated the shortfall in actual expenditures for goods and
services and assets. Actual expenditures of the resources that were released were mostly
above target, except for Goods and Services in 2012. Achievement of the objective is
therefore moderately satisfactory.

73. In addition to the specific PDOs, AgDPO 3 and AgDPO4 have contributed to the
following sector outcomes:

   Agriculture remains the mainstay of the majority of Ghana’s population of about 25.4
    million, especially the poorest, although its contribution to the country’s Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) continues to decline as the economy transforms and the
    share of agriculture in overall economic activity has declined. Indeed the 2012
    economic data show that agriculture now accounts for 22.7 percent of GDP (down
    from 31 at the revision of the national accounts). Agricultural Gross Domestic
    Product (AgGDP) has however shown a steady increase since 2008, both at current
    and 2006 prices. It almost doubled in 2012, showing an increase of about 73.5%.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

74. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The objectives of the AgDPO series remain highly
relevant to Ghana’s priorities in the agriculture sector. Overall, the policy and
institutional reforms supported by the AgDPO have contributed to achieving key
outcomes related to the PDOs. Growth and diversification in the agricultural sector have
occurred and are continuing. While the contribution of staple crops to GDP has decreased,
the livestock, fishing and cash crop sectors have recorded substantial growth. An increase
in commercial cash crop production has occurred, generating unprecedented export
revenues (GhC 400 million in 2012). While poverty remains concentrated in the northern
regions of the country, these regions achieved disproportionately high agricultural
production and productivity increases and a catching up process has been set in motion.
During recent years, various out-grower schemes for food and cash crops have been
established in the northern regions, benefiting tens of thousands of smallholder farmers.
On the other hand, progress in other areas (such as the production of certified seed and
the planned reduction of licensed industrial trawlers) was less than envisaged. – e.g.
Therefore the overall outcome rating of the DPO series is rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

75. The AgDPO supported the government’s efforts to address rural poverty, particularly
in the northern regions. Fertilizer subsidies, the block farm program, and crop purchases
under the buffer stock program respectively made agricultural inputs more affordable,


                                               19
contributed to employment generation, and provided a market where normally the private
sector would not operate. Increases in staple food production were particularly high in the
three northern regions of the country.

76. Since 2008, under the CIDA-supported Agricultural Services program, a total of
1,480 farmers from 296 FBOs have been trained in enterprise development. 40% of the
beneficiaries of this training were women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

77. The AgDPO series helped empower MoFA to take the lead in the design of FASDEP
II and its implementation instrument, METASIP. In addition, the AgDPOs contributed to
strengthening the policy dialogue of MoFA with other agencies and development partners
active in the sector, and led to the design of a policy action framework for the agriculture
sector that is integrated into the sector M&E system for accountability. MoFA has also
increased in financial management capacity due to the use of Government systems.

78. The second AgDPO series provided continuity to the process of legal and institutional
development in the irrigation, seed and fisheries sectors which started under the first
AgDPO series (AgDPOs 1 and 2). Further reforms under the second series including the
preparation of an investment framework for the irrigation sector, the preparation of a
regulatory framework for implementation of a new seed and fertilizer law, and the
implementation of a licensing cap for the industrial fishing fleet.

79. During AgDPOs 3 and 4, the fertilizer subsidy program was reviewed to include
improved seed in the subsidy package to further enhance the impact of increased fertilizer
use. An enabling environment was created under which the private sector input
distribution network expanded. In addition, an exit strategy for the fertilizer subsidy is
also being prepared.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

80. No unintended outcomes and impacts were identified.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

81. Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

82. Rating: Substantial. Ownership of the policy reforms in the sector is strong and
outcomes related to sector growth and poverty reduction appear to be sustainable based
on the government’s policy of supporting market-driven, private sector-led development.
However, the recently worsened fiscal situation is a reminder of the unpredictability of
the Government’s ability to pursue a major agricultural investment agenda to which it
would allocate a substantial portion of its budget in line with the CAADP agreement.



                                            20
83. The discontinuation of the AgDPO series increased the risk of not reaching the
development outcome – in particular where the process of reforms is still in the early
stages. Continuation of policy engagement and technical support are both needed in order
to maintain the momentum that was generated during the second AgDPO series.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

84. Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
satisfactory. The operation was well designed and reflected best practices in the
preparation of development policy operations. The preparation process was carried out in
close collaboration with MoFA and other development partners and together all parties
focused on identifying critical gaps and opportunities for support in the agricultural sector,
based on a robust body of analytical evidence. The objectives of AgDPOs 3 and 4 were
consistent with the government’s sector development priorities as specified in FASDEP
II and the CAS. Drawing on lessons learned from the first AgDPO series and DPOs in
other sectors, the Bank carefully assessed the operation’s risks during preparation, and
used a participatory approach that involved sector stakeholders in identifying priorities..
The operation was well focused supporting selected reforms and policy actions, and the
list of prior actions included actions and reforms deemed essential to its successful
implementation. The adequacy of the macroeconomic framework was assessed in close
collaboration with the IMF.

(b) Quality of Supervision

85. Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank's performance during the implementation of the
operation was satisfactory. The task team kept track of the selected reforms and policy
actions supported by the AgDPOs while keeping a clear focus on the operation’s overall
developmental impact. The task team leader was based in the Bank’s country office in
Accra and intensively engaged in the sector policy dialogue, allowing a continuous
interaction with government officials and development partners. The leadership role
played by the task team leader in sector policy dialogue allowed him to closely monitor
progress on prior actions and provide technical assistance to the government. The Task
Team embodied aid effectiveness principles as it collaborated effectively with all DPs
and MOFA and provided leadership in the comprehensive review of the METASIP. It
also worked closely with MDBS donors to ensure the operations’ complementarity to
donor support programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

86. Rating: Satisfactory. The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory based on a
successful integration of lessons learned and best practices. Strong implementation



                                             21
support together with substantial sector coordination efforts has strengthened the Bank’s
leadership role in the agricultural sector.

5.2 Borrower Performance

87. Rating: Satisfactory. The Government of Ghana, through the ministries of Food and
Agriculture (MoFA) and Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) worked closely with
the Bank to effectively prepare and implement the AgDPO project. From the design stage
onwards, there was strong teamwork in identifying the policy actions that would
contribute to the objectives of the METASIP. The overall commitment to and ownership
of the operations and their accompanying policy actions remain strong. The government
maintained and continues to maintain a high degree of engagement – as reflected in a
broad multisectoral agenda involving development partners and other ministries to
facilitate and implement a sectoral approach to development in the agricultural sector.
Lessons learned from the previous DPO series (AgDPOs 1 and 2) were taken into
account. This resulted in improved capacity at MoFA to integrate policy reform measures,
and align AgDPOs 3 and 4 with CIDA budget support and the G-8 support into the
planning and management functions to enhance donor coordination and improve
development outcomes.

88. There has been active participation and collaboration among the various partners and
stakeholders in the implementation of the DPOs. For example, the relevant directorates of
MoFA and MoFEP worked closely together. Another example relates to the Agriculture
Sector Working Group (made up of key actors in the agriculture sector, including
Development Partners) which has been closely involved through sharing of information
at the monthly meetings and discussion of outcomes at the annual Joint Sector Review.

89. The decision by Government to discontinue the series under review has had a
negative impact on the overall performance and impact of the lending instrument.
However, the institutional and program structure that is in place and which was supported
by the series will provide for the needed continuity, with an active CAADP agenda, and
an investment plan that is supported by a wide range of donors and other development
partners and stakeholders. The policy reform agenda supported by the AgDPO series
under review continues to be used by MoFA and other stakeholders in policy dialogue
and continues to influence MoFA decision making.

6. Lessons Learned

90. Key lessons learned from AgDPO 3 and 4 include the following:

   Outcomes and indicators that measure those outcomes should be closely linked to
    prior actions and triggers. Whereas policy reforms are expected to eventually result in
    changes at the farm level, prior actions and triggers only cause change at an
    intermediate level, which must be seen as necessary steps towards achieving the PDO.
    For example, planning and implementing reforms in the seed sector has proven to be
    a medium to long term process needed to increase adoption of improved seed


                                            22
    technology at the farm level. The AgDPO has supported a number of key reforms,
    starting with new legislation, followed by institutional reform required to implement
    the new legal framework and government programs that facilitate technology
    adoption. Relative to the time it takes for an industry to restructure and fully develop
    its potential, the duration of the AgDPO series is short and the expectation of
    increased volumes of seed produced and marketed through a wider distribution
    network was ambitious. Result indicators that are more closely linked to the measures
    taken would perhaps have been more appropriate.
   Sector-specific DPOs have a technical ministry as the main counterpart and client for
    policy development, and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning as the
    contractual partner and client to whom the resources are disbursed. The
    administrative relationship between the two ministries is important for processing the
    AgDPO series and allocating the resources. However, even more important than the
    administrative relationship are relationships at the technical level that shape the
    policy dialogue on the concerned sector’s fundamental policy issues and substance of
    the reform agenda supported by the DPO. Only then can the necessary buy-in and
    ownership of the process by MoFEP be ensured. In other words, stronger
    engagement of MoFEP and better collaboration between the latter and MoFA on
    agricultural sector policy could possibly have improved the quality of the policy
    reforms and may have influenced the decision making process that led to the
    discontinuation of AgDPO5.
   The AgDPO series successfully integrated a number of policy issues that are relevant
    to the implementation of a number of Bank-financed investment lending operations.
    In some cases, the policy reform implementation trajectory is actually supported by
    the IL operation, as was the case with the AgDPO’s fisheries sector reform agenda. A
    substantial delay in effectiveness of the Ghana fisheries project, however, caused
    delays in the implementation of reforms related to the reduction of trawler licenses.
    For future DPOs it is therefore important to coordinate closely with the partner IL
    operations in order to align the policy reform steps and set realistic targets.
   Sector Development Policy Lending for the agriculture sector has proven to be an
    effective, flexible instrument that empowered the Government of Ghana to implement
    a country-owned policy and the related programs that work to strengthen the
    institution. An important lesson for future operations is to ensure that the policy
    agenda underlying the operation is complementary to the Bank’s and other
    development partners’ investment lending operations, thus creating synergies that
    enhance the policy making process as well as program implementation.
   Linking disbursements to achievement of prior actions leveraged Government
    decisive action on policy and institutional issues. Actions beyond the jurisdictional
    mandate of the sector ministry would be better managed under the Multi-donor
    Budget Support (MDBS) process.
   The design of AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are major
    undertakings that need to be better integrated in MoFA’s planning process.
    Internalizing prior actions, triggers and the related reporting requirements at various
    levels within the sector ministry enhances ownership and improve reporting,
    especially when operation’s results framework is drawn from existing indicators to
    measure performance in the sector. This also reduces the risk of data unavailability.


                                            23
     Coordination between the World Bank’s and CIDA’s budget support programs
      prevented duplication and contributed to sector planning and coordination. It also
      points towards the importance of the development of an overall policy priority
      framework, akin to a larger policy matrix that identifies key actions required to
      implement METASIP. Specific prior actions and triggers can be drawn from this
      framework for future Bank and non-Bank budget support operations.

    93. Great report -and very useful for me too! I've made a few suggestions in the text.
    I`ve attached MoFA`s financial reports as I make a few comments on the budget section
    of your report.

    94. Among other suggestions/commends made in text, you may want to add how not
    only did the AGDPO give GoG flexibility, by using the GoG system, it helped to
    strengthen systems (Financial Management, including procurement, planning and M&E).
    That has been a key result for us so you may want to bring it up.

    95. You may also want to add something about how the Bank’s analytical process
    involved evaluating existing expertise in the sector (amongst DPs) as a means to build
    on each other’s work. This was an important part of the Bank’s work, and I think in
    Ghana, we are particularly good at “division of labor” amongst the DPs, playing on each
    other’s strengths so that we have a comprehensive program.

    96. Bank Supervision was Highly Satisfactory! I think the efforts you made to be
    collaborative amongst all DPs and MOFA and your leadership in reviewing the
    METASIP in a comprehensive way demonstrates that your supervision went above and
    beyond “typical” support program, and really embodied aid effectiveness principles. I
    would also mention that you worked closely with MDBS donors to ensure
    complementarity.

                          OPERATIONS

Introduction

Introduction

1.     The Agriculture Development Policy Operations (AgDPOs) were introduced in
2008 by the World Bank as budget support instruments to support the implementation of
Ghana’s agricultural sector development policy agenda - the Food and Agriculture Sector
Development Policy (FASDEP II), approved by Cabinet in June, 2008. The first
operation was designed as a three-year program covering 2008 to 2010 with annual
disbursement of $15 million. Before approval of the first AgDPO, the Bank increased the
annual program cost to $25 million in response to the 2007/8 World food crisis. The
increased funding was to support government’s strategy of improving access and use of
improved inputs by farmers to increase their productivity. Two disbursements were made
under the first program, 2008 and 2010. There was no disbursement in 2009 due to unmet
macroeconomic conditions by Government
.

2.     The Bank demonstrated further support for Ghana’s agriculture sector following
the signing of Ghana’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program
(CAADP) Compact in October 2009 by key stakeholders. In support for the
implementation of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP)
developed as the Countries CAADP Country Investment Plan and an instrument for
implementation of the FASDEPII, the Bank terminated the first three-year program after
the second disbursement and developed another three-year program with an increased
annual cost of $50 million in response to the huge funding gap for the implementation of
the METASIP. The second program with three-year annual disbursements covered 2011
to 2013


Objective
3.     The main objective of AgDPOs was to support Government’s agriculture-led
growth agenda to achieve poverty reduction in a sustainable manner through the
implementation of the country’s national and sector development strategies as reflected in
the FASDEP and its implementation plan, the METASIP. Agriculture in the country is
largely practiced by the rural poor, and as such it provides the greatest economic
opportunity for reducing poverty through interventions aimed at increasing rural incomes
and food security.

4.      The AgDPOs were aligned to the six key policy objectives of FASDEP II (i) food
security and emergency preparedness; (ii) increased growth in incomes; (iii) increased



                                           29
competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic and international markets; (iv)
sustainable management of land and environment; (v) science and technology applied to
food security and agricultural development; and (vi) improved institutional coordination.

Design

5.      The Policy Matrix of each AgDPO was central to the Operation and provided the
framework for the policy initiatives to be pursued. Each DPO was also supported by a
Letter of Development Policy (LDP) by Government which outlined Government’s
priority areas of development.

6.       AgDPO 3 and 4 supported five policy areas:

           i.   Agriculture technology for improved on-farm productivity
          ii.   Market and value chain development
         iii.   Irrigation and other infrastructure
         iv.    Fisheries, and
          v.    Agriculture sector management

7.     Each of these policy areas had corresponding specific objectives and prior actions
for each Operation which had to be accomplished prior to loan negotiations and approval.
Annex 1 shows the Policy matrix for AgDPO 4 and 5. Seven specific objectives were
pursued. They are:
           i. Improved research, extension services, skills training and education in
              agricultural sciences and farm management
          ii. Adoption of agricultural input technology.
         iii. Increased participation of smallholders.
         iv. Improved performance of grain markets
          v.  Improved irrigated agriculture.
         vi. Improved management of fisheries sector
        vii. Enhanced delivery of agriculture sector investment program.

8.      The design process was consultative and participatory. Government and the Bank
as well as other actors engaged in an iterative process to reach agreements on prior
actions to be accomplished before Board approval of the Bank.

9.      The approval and disbursement processes for the loan was shorter than the typical
project type loans. In addition the use of country systems in implementation, reporting
and accountability enhanced the effectiveness of the facility. Single-tranche
disbursements also contributed to the efficiency of the program and made funds available
at one-go for transactions to be carried out.

Implementation
10.     As a budget support, the funding was not specifically targeted to any specific
program in the agriculture sector. It however helped MOFA to pursue its agenda of
increasing productivity through enhanced use of improved inputs such as fertilizers and



                                           30
seeds. The policy areas of AgDPO 3 and 4 were consistent with the FASDEP II
objectives and the policy actions were carefully selected to catalyze effective
implementation of the sector strategy and advance the achievements of these objectives.
A total of $107 million was disbursed under the AgDPO3 ($57 million) and AgDPO4
($50 million)

11.    The AgDPOs have encouraged overall focus of Government on the
implementation of sector policy and institutional actions and their related outcomes
which also provide an enabling environment for project interventions to succeed. During
design emphasis is put on selecting policy and institutional actions in the sector that will
contribute to effective implementation of the sector priorities.

12.    There has been active participation and collaboration of all partners in the
implementation of the AgDPOs. The key ones being the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and its relevant directorates.
The Agriculture Sector Working Group made up of key actors in the agriculture sector,
including Development Partners, have been involved through sharing of information at
the monthly meetings and discussion of outcomes at the annual Joint Sector Review.


OUTCOMES OF AgDPO 3 AND AgDPO 4

13.  The results achieved through the enabling prior actions implemented under
AgDPO 3 and 4 are reported below under each of the five policy areas.

POLICY AREA 1: AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVED ON-
FARM PRODUCTIVITY

14.    Two policy objectives were pursued under this policy are: (i) Improved
research, extension services, skills training and education in agricultural sciences
and farm management and Adoption of agricultural input technology

Policy Objective - Improved research, extension services, skills training and education
in agricultural sciences and farm management

15.     The enabling actions under this policy objective sought to (i) enhance funding for
agricultural research, (ii) ensure there is a policy framework that promotes mainstreaming
of agricultural science and technology innovation, demand driven agricultural research
and regional collaboration in agriculture research.

16.     Outcome: The Research-Extension-Liaison-Committees (RELCs), which
comprise key actors in the agriculture value chain including provide a platform for
identification and prioritization of problems presented by farmers and other actors of the
agriculture value chain for research have been active and continue to be relevant. During
the period under review, RELC planning sessions were held in all the10 Regions each



                                            31
year where agricultural actors’ problems were discussed and researchable problems
identified and prioritized.

17.     With a base of 27 researchable areas prioritized for research in 2010, the year of
implementation of AgDPO 3, 60 researchable problems were identified. This included
the problems identified during the 2010 planning meetings which were not resolved. A
report from Council for Scientific Information and Research (CSIR) on the performance
of RELC in the 2012 indicated that, all the problems that were identified at regional
planning sessions are either being addressed or have been addressed with funding from
WAAPP 1A and the main ministry. As a result, nine technologies were developed (6 in
maize and 3 in soy beans) and twenty others were released in collaboration with CSIR.

18.     Some of the outputs of the RELC sessions held during the period of reporting are
as follows;

      Farmer participatory evaluation, selection and promotion of multiple disease
       resistant soybeans varieties in the Ashanti region in 2010 – 2012,
      Promotion of CSIR – SARI Technologies in two deprived communities in the
       upper east region in 2011 – 2012
      Development of control strategies for termite infestation in the field in April 2011
       – March 2012
      Development of control strategies for pests and diseases of harvested groundnuts
       left on the field and in storage barns in April, 2011 – March 2012

19.    The target set under AgDPO 4 was to increase in number demand-driven
researchable areas identified in all 10 regions. Achievements indicate that, 5 researchable
areas were recommended at the planning sessions organized.

Policy Objective (ii): Adoption of agricultural input technology

20.     Building upon the progress made under AgDPO 1 with the passing of the “Plant
and Fertilizer Act (803)” in 2010, AgDPO 3 and 4 enabling actions sought to enhance
private sector participation in the sale and distribution of fertilizers and also support the
establishment of regulatory Councils to oversee the development of fertilizer, seed and
plant protection services. These actions were met.

21.     Outcome: The participation of the private sector in the fertilizer subsidy
implementation intensified in 2012 as the participation was broadened by the
procurement process which encouraged as many dealers as were interested to bid.
Subsequent arrangements after the bidding process involving distribution of quotas
according to capacity of fertilizer companies required engagement with the dealers to
reach a workable agreement amongst them.

22.    Fertilizer usage more than tripled since 2008. The initiative by government to
increase use of fertilizer began in 2008 with a total of 43, 176 MT of fertilizer subsidized.
Consumption in as at the month of August in 2013 was 142, 000 MT, this could increase


                                             32
to 180,000 MT by the end of the year. Total fertilizer imports also increased significantly
from 70,000MT in 2008 to 374,602MT in 2012. Fertilizer usage has gone up from
8kg/ha to 12Kg. This is below the CAADP target of 50kg/ha by 2015. Number of
registered agro-input dealers/outlets increased by 59.3% in 2011 compared with 2010.

23.    Seed is a necessary complement to fertilizer if optimum yields are to be achieved.
Use of improved seed is quite low; certified seed constitute about 10% of seeds used
annually. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture decided in 2012 to provide a subsidy on
improved seed to increase its usage. While this effort was to yield increased use of seed,
evidence from the data on seed production shows that seed production for the key crops
promoted by MoFA – maize, rice and soya – declined in 2011. Even though 2012
production was slightly better than 2011 production it was lower than the 2010
production level. From total seed production level of 8927 mt for the three crops in 2010,
production fell to 5345mt in 2011 and inched slightly in 2012 to 5365 mt. The poor
performance was attributed to high cost of production as well as unfavorable climatic
condition.

24.     In 2011, the target of 5% increase in production of maize, rice and soya bean
seeds over their 2010 levels of 4460 mt, 4112 mt and 355 mt respectively were not
achieved. Instead a maize and rice seed production declined by 41.4% and 45.1%
respectively while soya bean seed production increased by 33%.

25.     Similarly, in 2012, AgDPO 4 target was 10% increase in production over base
year levels were not achieved. While maize and rice seed production increased slightly in
2012 over their 2011 they still remained 37.3% and 42.3% lower than their 2010
production levels. Soya bean production fell by about 44.5% in 2012 (see results Table).

26.     Seed is very vital to increasing productivity and so efforts must be intensified by
MOFA to ensure that it is available and affordable to farmers at the right time. This
requires collaborative efforts among Government, development partners and the private
sector. The passing of Act 803, approval of the fertilizer and seed policies together with
the establishment of the Councils for fertilizer, seed and plant protection services
provides an enabling opportunity for joint partnership in ensuring the right inputs are
available and appropriately applied to increase productivity.

POLICY AREA 2: Market and Value Chain Development

27.    Two policy objectives were pursued under this policy area (i) Increased
Participation of smallholders and (ii) improved performance of grain markets.
Expected outcomes were increased value of production of key crops and increased
integration of small farmers into grain markets.

28.     Enabling actions undertaken, pursuant to these policy objectives were the
establishment of the Outgrower and Value Chain Fund to support commercial production
and marketing of key cash crops, adaption of the Export Development and Investment
Fund (EDIF) to Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund (EDAIF) to



                                            33
incorporate a window for agriculture, introduction of Warehouse Receipt System as a
pilot and improving transparency in the operations of the National Food and Buffer Stock
Company activities.

Policy Objective - Increased Participation of smallholders
29.      Including smallholders in commercially viable agriculture production through the
nucleus-outgrower relationships provide mutual benefits to both parties. The OVCF and
the EDAIF are designed to provide funds to viable production systems that are integrated
with downstream activities such as marketing and processing. The outcome of these
initiatives is expected to be show in increased production and value of cash crops.

30.     The indicator for this outcome for AgDPO 3 was 5% increase in value of non-
traditional exports over the base year (2010) value of GHC 161 million (US $ 112) and
for AgDPO 4, a 10% increase in 2012 over base year. The targets of US$117.6m and
US$123.2m for AgDPO 3 and 4 respectively were both exceeded. Instead and increase
of 165% (US$297 million) over the based year was achieved in 2011 and 146% (US
$276 million) achieved in 2012 compared with the base year.

31.     The second outcome indicator on bank lending to the agriculture, forestry and
fishing subsectors by deposit money banks and rural community banks (excluding cocoa
marketing) showed positive outcomes. Data from Bank of Ghana indicate that 2011
recorded an increase in credit to the agricultural sector. Compared to the baseline value
of GHS 472m, lending to the sector increased to GHS 631.3m in 2012 (33.8%) exceeding
the 20% target of GHS 566.4million.


Policy Objective 2 - Improved performance of grain markets
32.     The launch of the pilot warehouse receipt system in 2010 together with improved
transparency in the operations of the National Buffer Stock Company were aimed at
improving market efficiency and reducing price volatility in the grain markets. Under the
auspices of the Ghana Grain Council, 10 warehouses with a total capacity of 23,000 MT
are currently certified for operations. Four financial institutions are participating system.
Under this system warehouse receipts will be accepted as collateral by banks to leverage
commercial credit. Other benefits to derive from this system include the provision of
market place for farmers, stockholding that will improve bulk trade and improved storage
to reduce postharvest losses.

33.    Government through the Ministry of Trade and Industry is still pursuing the
promulgation of the necessary legislative instruments to guide the operations of the WRS
as well as a Commodity Exchange. A joint cabinet memo by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture is being prepared.



POLICY AREA 3: IRRIGATION AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE




                                             34
Policy Objective – Improved irrigated agriculture
34.    Two policy actions were undertaken under this objective. One was the submission
of revised regulations by the Minister of Food and Agriculture to Attorney Generals
Department, confirming joint responsibilities of operation and maintenance of irrigation
schemes by beneficiaries and Government. The other was the design of a new irrigation
pre-investment Reform Action Framework outlining investment priorities, institutional
reforms and implementation within the METASIP.

35.    Expected outcomes from these actions were number of jointly managed irrigation
schemes and number of new Public-Private-Partnerships on irrigation at pre-feasibility
stage. Reports show that, both indicator targets under the two Operations were achieved.
Under the Farmer Participation in Irrigation System Management (FAPIM, 2004-2006),
GIDA implemented the Joint Irrigation System Management was implemented in 2006.
For the past 7 years the operation and maintenance of the irrigation schemes has been the
responsibility of both the GIDA and the farmers’ cooperatives. All public irrigation
schemes described as formal schemes are jointly managed by GIDA and water user
associations formed by beneficiary farmers. The source of funding of the management of
the schemes is through GoG budget and Irrigation Service Charge (ISC).


36.    The promotion of PPPs by MoFA/ GIDA present the way forward for irrigation
development. GIDA reports a PPP arrangement piloted at the Torgorme Irrigation
Scheme in the Volta region under Kpong Left Bank Irrigation Project funded under the
Millennium Challenge Account.


POLICY AREA 4 – FISHERIES

Policy Objective: Improved management of fisheries sector

37.     Two enabling policy actions under AgDPO 3 and 4 were undertaken. One action
required the issuing of the fisheries regulations to guide the implementation of the
Fisheries Act, 2002. The other action needed the fishing license register for all existing
industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels to be updated and issuing of new licenses
suspended. These were aimed at improving sustainable management of marine and inland
fisheries. There requirements were met.

38.    Other efforts by Government to improve governance of the fisheries subsector
and achieve sustainable production include the development of the Fisheries and
Aquaculture Sector Development Plan (2011-216). This plan seeks to improve
sustainable management of the fishery resources in the country with emphasis on
development the aquaculture. It will also curb illegal fishing activities through increased
monitoring, control and surveillance activities.

39.   Fisheries Commission established and operationalized a task force team in 2010
to check fishing illegalities. In furtherence to this, to streamline the sustainable



                                            35
exploitation of the nation’s fisheries resources an Enforce Unit has been established,
organisational structures are being put in place to make it functional.

40.     Under AgDPO 3 restriction of the licensing of vessels had not been enforced. In
2012, a total of 14 vessels were registered as against 17 in 2011. This is in agreement
with the efforts to reduce number of industrial vessels fishing in Ghana’s territorial
waters.

41.    Total number of trawlers licenced increased from 68 in 2010 to 81 in 2011
representing a 19% increase. The target for number of industrial trawlers with fishing
lincense was not achieved.

42.    Illegal fishing practices reduced reflecting in marginal increases in production
from marine, inland and aquaculture. For example, production from marine canoes
contributed 70% in 2011 as against 66% of total production in 2010. On the other hand
there were no reduction in number of licensed industrial trawler as expected under the
two Operations.

43.     Ghana still has a demand deficit in its fish requirements. Out of an estimated
demand of 968,000 mt in 2012, total production from marine, inland and aquaculture was
estimated at 455,697mt. Total fish import was 175,340.55mt. Effective implementation
of the fisheries and aquaculture plan will help meet this demand gap.


POLICY AREA 5: Agriculture Sector Management

Policy Objective: Enhanced delivery on agriculture sector policy and investment
program

44.     Two policy actions were carried out under this objective. A multi-stakeholder
governance structure led by MOFA was established to oversee the implementation of
METASIP. To enhance planning and budget allocation to agriculture, a methodology was
developed to identify agriculture related spending across Ministries and was applied as a
test case to the three agriculture related agencies – Ministries of Environment, Science
and Technology, and Trade and Industry.

45.     Improved institutional coordination is one of the objectives of FASDEP. The
CAADP framework represented in Ghana by the Medium Term Agriculture Sector
Investment Plan (METASIP), required a Country Team - a multi-stakeholder governing
structure to oversee and guide its implementation. The country team comprised a
Steering Committee made up of private sector, civil society and agriculture sector related
Ministries, Departments and Agencies; a Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support
System made up of committees to provide technical and policy analytical support towards
the implementation of METASIP; and a Secretariat. The Country Team was established
in 2011.




                                           36
46.    Other sector coordination mechanisms in the section include the monthly
Agricultural Sector Working Group (ASWG) which meets to dialogue on policy and
operational issues in the sector. It also provides a platform for sharing information and
knowledge exchanges. The annual Joint Agriculture Sector Reviews instituted in 2008
also supports coordination of the sector. The 2012 Review held in May, took a more
proactive approach at the end where a Business meeting was held between MOFA
Management and key Development Partners to deliberate and agree on key issues way
forward. Some of the issues included:
      Collection/generation of quality data as a basis for planning and decision making
      Strengthening the resource allocation process to make it more inclusive and
        linking it to strategic planning
      Priority areas for investment arising from METASIP review, including (a) Value
        chain development; (b) Infrastructure investments; (c) Institutional Capacity
        Building; and (d) Coordination
      Development of a complementary framework for METASIP to operationalize
        the overall aim of private sector-led agricultural value chain development,
        providing guidance and principles for leveraging private sector investment and
        access to finance for agricultural value chains

47.     The Sub-groups under the ASWG are tasked to come out with action plans for
taking these issues forward.

48.     The expected outcome under the AgDPO 3 and 4 was to have greater
coordination of agriculture-related spending to result in improved resource allocation for
METASIP implementation. Under the AgDPO 4 a methodology was established to
identify agricultural spending across Ministries and applied to 3 Ministries as a test case.
The methodology was then used to estimate the entire agricultural sector spending during
the Agricultural Public Expenditure Institutional Review which was completed in 2013
(Maputo Declaration Target.). Further to this, the Government developed the Program-
Based-Budgeting system. This system is to ensure that sector programs are linked to the
national development program - the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda and
also enable related MDAs to jointly plan and budget for sectoral programs.

49.     Other initiatives undertaken to enhance agriculture sector planning and budgeting
was the Agriculture Sector Expenditure Review, which was completed in June, 2013. It
provided a historical picture of agriculture sector expenditure over the last ten years,
revealing in particular, and challenges with budget and expenditure data that need to be
addressed to inform planning and resource allocation to the sector. Linked to the
Program based budgeting is the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information
System (GIFMIS) that seeks to control budget execution and reporting. This will provide
information on sector-wide budget allocation and expenditure which together with
adequate reporting on outcomes on expenditure will enhance effective allocation of
budget resources.

50.   Indicators for improved planning and budget execution show positive outcomes.
The ratio of MOFA budget that is used for operational activities on the ground


                                            37
(Admin,/Goods/Assets) to that of total MoFA discretionary budget increased from 24%
in the base year (2010) to 26.3% in 2012.  

51.     Two other areas of budget performance were (i) proportion of GOG budget
against funds released and (ii) GOG and Donor funds released against actual expenditure.
The table below shows the performance for the two categories.

52.    The target for AgDPO 3 - 85% for Admin and Goods was not met whiles that of
Assets, 95% was exceeded, for the proportion of GoG budget for 2011. Corresponding
achievements were 49.30% and 125.29% respectively. Similar results were achieved in
2012 where target were not met for Goods and Services but were exceeded for Assets.
Targets set were 90% and 95% for Goods &Services and Assets compared to
achievement of 84.20% and 102.50% respectively. With regard to the combined budget
of GoG and Donor the data shows marked improvement.

53.     Achievements on expenditure under the two Operations indicate that, funds
expended on Goods and Services did not meet the set targets. The situation was however
different for Assets where targets were exceeded. On the Donor side, achievements for
Goods & Services and Assets were 88.13% and 191.51% in 2011 and 70.55% and
223.33% in 2012 respectively. The same scenario was repeated for GoG, where
expenditure on Goods and Services recorded an execution rate of 71.36% and 87.25% in
2011 and 2012 respectively. On the Asset side however the target was not met in 2011
with an achievement rate of 66.12% compared to 2012 where target was exceeded at
106.93%.

54.    Progressively sectors and Government are seeking ways of improving planning
and budgeting processes to improve efficiency of resource use and contribute to reduction
in poverty. The recommendations from the Joint Sector Review and the Public
Expenditure review together with efforts at joint planning will contribute to these
improvements.

MoFA’s Performance and Lessons Learned
55.     The Ministry of Food and Agriculture in 2008 had the right conditions in place to
implement a Development Policy Operation. These included the existence of policy
framework, the FASDEP which was jointly developed by the Government and the
development partners in the sector and approved by Cabinet in July 2008, the functioning
of a vibrant agriculture sector working group with membership from a broad spectrum of
actors in the agriculture sector and the existence of a financial management system which
was continuously improved. A policy operation that supported the development policy of
the sector was therefore the right approach compared to the traditional projects which
involved long design periods and operational difficulties. \

56.    Similar to the collaboration experienced in the implementation of AgDPO 1and 2,
MoFA continued to collaborate with the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning and other key actors concerned with the implementation of the prior
actions to areas to ensure that prior actions were met before negotiations and Board
approval.


                                           40
57.    AgDPO 3 and 4 provided increased funding to the sector for the implementation
of the METASIP and particularly helped the sector to promote use of improved fertilizer
and seed through the subsidy scheme.

58.    Apart from the AgDPOs providing predictable funding, thus enhancing planning
and implementation, they reduce transaction costs and promote use of country own
systems at the sector level.

59.      The policy matrix, which contains the policy actions that must be met prior to the
approval of the Operation by the Bank, has particularly been very instrumental in
bringing about policy and institutional reforms that would otherwise have taken time to
address. The Operations also leveraged the support of other complementary actors and
enhanced dialogue on critical issues central to the implementation of METASIP and the
smooth implementation of the interventions in the sector. Examples of policy and
institutional issues implemented in the last operation include the audit of fishing vessels
and suspension of the issuance of fishing licenses, geared towards improvement in the
fishery resource management to be supported under the West Africa Regional Fisheries
Project, and the establishment of the governance structure for the implementation of the
Plants and Fertilizer Act.

60.     The process strengthened policy dialogue with other agencies like the Canadian
International Development Agency and with the other development partners active in the
sector, leading to the decision to design a policy action framework for the agriculture
sector that is integrated into the sector M&E system for accountability.


The World Bank’s Performance and Lessons Learned
61.     The Bank’s performance regarding the design and implementation of the
Operations was satisfactory.
The Ministry of Food and Agriculture finds it however unacceptable that the Bank having
abrogated the first series for good reasons of scaling up the funding envelope from $25
million to $50 million agreed with the Ministry of Finance to abrogate the second series
after two disbursements.
62.     This demonstrates inconsistency in policy by the Bank. Each series had a results
framework. MoFA and the Bank were compelled to write a completion report for the first
series with inconclusive results due to the abrogation. This completion report is again
being written with inconclusive results because the Operation did not travel its full course.
Having to write completion reports after two years of disbursements has burned
Government with a transaction cost that could have been avoided.
Suspending the Operations could have also sent wrong signals to other development
partners that the Operations are not yielding the expected results. This at a time when the
sector has in place a vibrant Agriculture Sector Working Group coupled with the Joint
Sector Review mechanism which provides opportunity for harmonization and
coordination of the sector.




                                            41
Proposed Arrangements for Future Operations
63.     The METASIP was reviewed in 2012 to inform prioritization of section
interventions so as to focus investment in a coordinated approach. Key recommendations
from the review endorsed the relevance of the strategies in METASIP but recommended
the need to focus investment on the following areas: (a) Value chain development; (b)
Infrastructure investments; (c) Institutional Capacity Building; and (d) Coordination.
64.     In addition to the recommendation above, key policy issues identified for action at
the end of the 2013 JSR include:
     Collection/generation of quality data as a basis for planning and decision making
     Strengthening the resource allocation process to make it more inclusive and
        linking it to strategic planning
     Development of a complementary framework for METASIP to operationalize the
        overall aim of private sector-led agricultural value chain development, providing
        guidance and principles for leveraging private sector investment and access to
        finance for agricultural value chains
     The Policy Operations should be introduced with a broader policy agenda
        involving all the key stakeholders in the agriculture sector.


Conclusion and Recommendations
65.      Similar to the conclusions reached at the end of the AgDPO 1 and 2, it is
important to emphasize that Development Policy Operations are more adaptable to
country priorities and promotes ownership of development interventions. The
implementation arrangements are consistent with ideals of aid effectiveness, country
ownership, leadership, management for results, accountability and use of country systems.
The process is less demanding compared to project lending, thus freeing time for
implementation and decision making. The prior actions which are jointly identified by the
Bank and the Ministry, for example, provide an added opportunity for policy and
institutional issues to be addressed to support the implementation of programs.

66.    Transformation of agriculture in a way that impacts positively on smallholders
can only be achieved through increased and sustained investment in viable agriculture
programs supported by right policies
