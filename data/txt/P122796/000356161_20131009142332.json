moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            outcomes and indicators that measure those outcomes should\n            be closely linked to prior actions and triggers. Whereas\n            policy reforms are expected to eventually result in changes\n            at the farm level, prior actions and triggers only cause\n            change at an intermediate level, which must be seen as\n            necessary steps towards achieving the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). Sector-specific DPOs have a technical\n            ministry as the main counterpart and client for policy\n            development, and the Ministry of finance and economic\n            planning as the contractual partner and client to whom the\n            resources are disbursed. The AgDPO series successfully\n            integrated a number of policy issues that are relevant to\n            the implementation of a number of Bank-financed investment\n            lending operations. An important lesson for future\n            operations is to ensure that the policy agenda underlying\n            the operation is complementary to the Bank's and other\n            development partners' investment lending operations,\n            thus creating synergies that enhance the policy making\n            process as well as program implementation. The design of\n            AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are\n            major undertakings that need to be better integrated in\n            Ministry of Food and Agriculture's (MoFA's)\n            planning process."}, "docdt": "2013-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
