     GHANA THIRD AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION


Borrower                    Republic Of Ghana

Implementing Agency         Ministry of Food and Agriculture

Financing Data              SDR 36 million (US$57 million equivalent)
                            Blend IDA terms: 35-year maturity with a 10-year grace period
Operation Type              This is the first DPL operation in a new series (AgDPO 3, 4, and 5)
                            and is aligned with the new Medium Term Agriculture Sector
                            Investment Plan (METASIP) that was prepared, consistent with the
                            African Union’s Comprehensive African Agricultural Development
                            Program (CAADP).
Main Policy Areas           These are: (i) agriculture technology for improved on-farm
                            productivity; (ii) market and value chain development; (iii) irrigated
                            agriculture and other infrastructure services; (iv) fisheries; and (v)
                            agriculture sector management.
Key Outcome Indicators      These are (respectively, according to main policy areas above):
                            Adoption of technologies; farmer participation in out-grower
                            schemes; agriculture credit uptake; irrigation efficiency; fisheries
                            sector production and profitability; agriculture sector resource
                            allocation.
Program Development         The operation is consistent with the CAS objective of supporting
Objective(s) and            Ghana’s poverty reduction strategy and in particularly ‘modernizing
Contribution to CAS         agriculture’. The program development objective is “to enhance the
                            productivity and competitiveness of Ghanaian agriculture.”
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The main risks are: (i) change in policy direction, away from private
                            sector-led, government-facilitated agriculture growth; (ii) a
                            challenging fiscal and macroeconomic context, and the risk of
                            poorly managed oil revenues to the detriment of the agriculture
                            sector; (iii) continued weakness in financial management and
                            coordination of sector-wide resource allocation; and (iv) delays in
                            completion of the sector-wide approach and further advances in
                            harmonization and alignment.
                            Mitigation strategies to address these risks are as follows:
                            confirmation of the Government of their continued commitment to
                            prevailing agricultural policy framework and investment program;
                            intense engagement with the IMF on macroeconomic management;
                            technical assistance to improved financial management and
                            coordination; and active engagement through the CAADP and sector
                            working group mechanisms.

1.      Ghana's agricultural sector is on a growth path and opportunities exist for
significant further development. Structural transformation of Ghana's economy is
ongoing. The contribution of the country's services sector to the economy has overtaken
that of the agricultural sector, the latter now no longer in first place. Poverty levels are
falling, and Ghana as a nation is largely food secure. Notwithstanding these positive
developments, rural poverty remains high in the northern regions of the country, and
agriculture sector productivity needs to improve in order to increase competitiveness. A
new focus on private sector-led growth requires an approach that includes smallholder
farmers into value chains and facilitates agribusiness investments. Climatic conditions
conducive for a diversified agricultural sector, a relatively stable investment climate,
untapped agricultural technologies, high agricultural commodity prices, and strong
Government - Development Partner (DP) dialogue and cooperation are among the
opportunities that, if capitalized on, will enable Ghana to further improve the performance
of the agricultural sector. In that regard, the AgDPO is timely and complements other
development efforts.

2.      The proposed third agricultural development policy operation (AgDPO 3) is a
single tranche credit for US$57 million equivalent and the first DPO in a new series
intended to help the Government of Ghana (GoG) implement the Medium Term
Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP). The METASIP represents a Ghana-
owned program for the implementation of the Comprehensive African Agricultural
Development Program (CAADP) in Ghana. The Ghana CAADP Compact was signed in
October 2009 by Government, development partners, private sector and civil society, and
commits all stakeholders to renewed collective and individual efforts to support agricultural
development. It also provides an enhanced framework for scaling up resources to
agriculture - in particular, in line with G20 commitments at l'Aguila and Pittsburgh - and for
improved harmonization and alignment. The corresponding Agriculture Sector Investment
Program (METASIP), on which the proposed AgDPO 3 is based, was finalized in
September 2010.

3.      The new AgDPO series will better accommodate the Government's specific
implementation priorities moving forward. As reflected in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) Progress Report, the new AgDPO series constitutes a strategic response
with the following expected benefits: (i) it allows for closer alignment of Bank support with
the new Government's agenda; (ii) it provides for a more compelling case to scale up
assistance beyond the levels originally envisaged in the CAS, in recognition of the
financing gap identified in the newly articulated investment program under the CAADP
framework (approximately US$150 million per year over five years); and (iii) it facilitates a
better alignment of more specific policy measures to be supported with the Government's
policy and institutional reform agenda.

4.     The proposed operation supports the development objectives set in the Ghana
Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA
emphasizes the need for greater executive efficiency, transparency and accountability to
provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities
through agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human resource development. The
proposed operation is aligned with the recently updated World Bank Group’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives for FY08-121 and with the World Bank’s Africa
Action Plan. The AgDPO 3 is consistent with the Bank's strategic focus on country systems,
and the Government's draft aid policy that seeks a greater share of foreign assistance in the
form of budgetary support.

5.      The proposed operation supports the Government’s efforts to address the
development needs of the northern part of the country. To address the growing regional
discrepancy between the North and the South, the Government’s agriculture programs
feature a strong focus on the North, evidenced by the Savanna Accelerated Development
Agency’s (SADA) program that facilitates commercial agriculture development. In
addition, fertilizer technology adoption programs focus on commodities that are
predominantly grown in the North, mainly maize, rice and sorghum.

6.      The Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) forms the
basis of Ghana’s agriculture sector programs. It constitutes a sector policy that extends
beyond the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) and encompasses the mandates of all
ministries that are expected to contribute to agriculture sector outcomes.

7.      The METASIP is a sector-wide investment plan that embodies the
commitments made in the CAADP Compact. It includes activities among all agriculture-
related Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) based on the classification of
functions for the sector. It also anticipates activities of the private sector and civil society
and takes into account ongoing projects. As a sector investment plan, emphasis has been on
consultations and actions by all stakeholders of the sector: MoFA, other relevant MDAs,
Development Partners (DPs), NGOs, academia, civil society, farmers and other on-farm
and off-farm private sector operators, researchers and service providers. The
implementation of the METASIP is intended to drive the application of a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAp) to bring on board sector stakeholders in effective coordination and
participation.

8.     This sector development policy operation should be seen in the context of other
budget support organized under the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)
framework to which the Bank contributes through the Economic Growth Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (EGPRS) and the recently approved Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC). The PRSC and the MDBS are not appropriate instruments to
deepen the sector level policy dialogue as they necessarily focus on cross-cutting issues
including public financial management (PFM) and economic governance. At the same time,
the Government is yet to fully address budget needs at the sector level, relying
predominantly on DP-financed investment projects. While these investments are
contributing to faster agricultural growth and export diversification, a key objective of the

allocation and implement using its own budgetary resources.

                               II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

                   A.     RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
9.      The Government elected in January 2009 inherited a difficult macro-economic
situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a structural trend of
widening fiscal imbalances. By end-2008, fiscal (on a cash basis) and current account
deficits, including grants, respectively culminated at 8.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP. While
fiscal expansion was prolonging trends observed since 2005 – with a public sector wage bill
to revenue ratio growing from 34 to 57 percent between 2004 and 2008 – it was also the
result of a combination of severe exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late
2007 and the rise in world commodity prices in 2008. Deficits and demand pressures
strongly contributed to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost approximately 45
percent of its value against the US dollar over June 2008 to June 2009, and to accelerated
consumer price inflation, which culminated at 20.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2009.

10.     In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal
stabilization plan, to bring back the fiscal deficit and debt to GDP ratios to sustainable
levels by 2011. These intentions were reflected in the successive Budget Laws 2009, 2010
and 2011 approved by Parliament, targeting end-year fiscal deficits (on a cash basis) at 5.5,
4.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP in CY09, CY10 and CY11 (or equivalently 9.4, 7.5 and 7.5
percent of non oil GDP before national accounts revision, see Box 1). The plan received the
financial support of the IMF (Extended Credit Facility, US$600 million July 2009), and the
World Bank (Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit, US$300 million, June
2009, and the Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit, January 2011, US$215 million).

11.     Since mid-2009, the economy has shown strong signs of macroeconomic
stabilization. Compared with 2008, both the fiscal and current account deficits were
significantly reduced in 2009 and 2010, under the impact of positive exogenous shocks
(high hydroelectric reserves with good rains, low oil prices, high cocoa and gold prices) and
significant fiscal stabilization achievements. Thus, between 2008 and 2010 the current
account deficit dropped from 10.8 to 7.2 percent of GDP, and the basic fiscal primary
deficit -- the difference between domestic resource and domestically financed expenditure,
excluding debt service and arrears repayment -- went down from 5.3 to 0.7 percent of GDP
(see Tables 1 and 2). Lower grants, higher foreign-financed capital expenditure, higher
domestic service and the repayment of arrears altogether nonetheless made the reduction in
the overall cash fiscal deficit less pronounced (from 8.5 to 7.7 percent of GDP between
2008 and 2010). Yet, since July 2009, the exchange rate stabilized, and consumer price
inflation decelerated to less than 10 percent per year. Meanwhile economic growth
remained robust, and estimated at 5 percent and 6 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively by
the Ghana Statistical Services. From the supply side, crops, construction, transport and ICT
were the main drivers of growth between 2008 and 2010. On the demand side, continued
high export receipts (gold, cocoa) and foreign direct investment in 2009 and 2010 mitigated
the negative impact of fiscal stabilization on aggregate demand.

12.   Measured on a commitment basis, the fiscal deficit was reduced from 12.5
percent of GDP in 2008 to 8.4 percent in 2010, as the stock of public expenditure arrears

                                             6
uncovered since 2009 could not be put under full control and progressively reduced. This
included in particular arrears to contractors, as well as inter-governmental outstanding
obligations from the consolidated fund to statutory funds (Social Security, National Health
Insurance, District Assembly Common Fund, Road Fund, and Education Trust Fund).
Along with accumulated outstanding obligations to energy State-Owned Enterprises (to
cover under recoveries from under pricing), the accumulation of Government arrears
entailed significant increases in banks’ non-performing loans (up from 8 percent of gross
loans in December 2008 to 20 percent by February 2010, before declining to 17 percent by
end-2010), weakening their financial robustness and affecting their ability to extend credit
to the private sector. In retrospect, the rapid expansion of credit in 2007 and 2008 in a high
inflation and high interest rate environment also created conditions for the subsequent asset
deterioration, as risk management regulations and practices did not improve
commensurately. In the second half of 2010, though, private sector credit growth
rebounded, as banks’ balance sheets continue to expand rapidly and non performing loans
started to decline, thus meeting demand from firms to build their inventories and invest in
prevision of a booming 2011 year.

                                Box 1: Ghana’s New National Accounts

New national accounts were published in November 2010 by the Ghana Statistical Services (GSS). The new
accounts cover the period 2006-2009. These new national accounts present a major departure from previous
national accounts from GSS, as entailing an upward revision in current GDP of 60 percent in 2006.

While the use of a new base year (2006 instead of 1993) has implications for real GDP growth computations
going forward and backward from 2006, the difference in 2006 between old and new accounts is entirely
attributable to (i) the inclusion of additional data sources (population census, households surveys, tax data,
industrial and transport surveys, etc.) which allow more accurate coverage of economic activity, and (ii) the
adoption of an improved methodology to compute national accounts (SNA93, in lieu of SNA68 used so far).
The new methodology includes using supply and use tables, as well as new ways to compute wholesale and
retail trade, fisheries, livestock, and forestry value addition. The computation of the new national accounts
benefited from the technical assistance from GTZ, DANIDA and IMF.

From an economic perspective, the new accounts portray a wealthier and more service-oriented Ghanaian
economy. While agriculture and industry GDP were revised upward by about 30 and 22 percent respectively,
service GDP was revised upward by about 147 percent in 2006. As imports, exports, government final
consumption and gross capital formation were almost unaffected by the revision, most the upward adjustment
took place in household final consumption (+72 percent in 2006). In turn, the latter found its financing in
higher income from domestic production for domestic markets, services in particular. While emerging
services were better captured with the new methodology (e.g., information and communication technologies),
the large revision of the service sector also mirrors a better coverage of the informal sector, through household
or transport surveys, or the revision in the methodology used for computing retail trade.

                        B.       MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND
                                   DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.     In 2011, the pursuit of fiscal and debt stabilization will require additional
efforts. While structural reforms undertaken in 2010, such as the introduction of cost
recovery mechanism in electricity, cash management and commitment control systems at
MoFEP, or the single spine salary structure pay reform should help prevent the re-
occurrence of expenditure slippages, new bold fiscal measures will be needed in 2011 to
consolidate macroeconomic stabilization achievements recorded since 2009. Indeed, the net
revenue from oil2 channeled to the budget (per the Petroleum Revenue Management Law
adopted in February 2011), at 1.6 percent of GDP, will be insufficient to further reduce the
deficit and the stock of public expenditure arrears (including vis-à-vis SOEs, for a total of
2.5 percent of GDP) as intended by the Authorities. Against this background, the
Government, intends to increase non-oil taxation by 1.0 percent of GDP, through the
collection of VAT on financial services and improved tax administration (at customs
notably), benefiting from the establishment of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA,
merging VAT, Customs and IRS) in 2010. With higher GDP after statistical revision (see
Box 1), the Government of Ghana indeed acknowledges the need and the potential to
improve its poor domestic revenue collection performance (at 15 percent of GDP in 2010).

14.     Combined with higher GDP with oil, these measures would bring the overall
cash deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2011, down from 7.7 percent in 2010. In the
absence of new arrears accumulation, the reduction in the public deficit measured on a
commitment basis would be more pronounced, from 8.4 to 3.1 percent of GDP between
2010 and 2011. In turn, the containment of government financing needs, the liquidation of
arrears and related NPLs and the continued expansion of banks’ balance sheets should
continue to encourage private investment through private sector credit growth. From 2012,
a reduction in Ghana’s net public debt to GDP is foreseen, as transfers to oil funds
(stabilization and heritage) will represent about 2 percent of GDP.

15.      With this macroeconomic framework, the IMF will likely successfully
conclude its third and fourth review under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement.
As with first and second reviews concluded together in June 2010, the IMF staff plans to
conclude simultaneously the third and fourth reviews in May 2011. Indeed, in spite of
positive overall macroeconomic development in the first half of 2010, the conclusion of the
third review was delayed given concerns regarding the fiscal impact of implementing the
single spine pay reform and the continued accumulation of public expenditure arrears
blurring the fiscal picture and weakening the financial sector. In the first months of 2011,
however, these concerns were mitigated as the Government assessment of the fiscal
implications of the single spine reform was strengthened (and more than half of the public
labor force migrated to the new salary structure), and the extent and composition of public
expenditure arrears was known with greater certainty, with some early steps taken to

   The production of oil which started in December 2010 will have a significant impact on GDP, from a
national accounting perspective, as reflected in Table 1. In 2011 for instance, with the production
progressively extended to 120,000 barrels a day, the oil GDP should amount to US$3.1 billion. But it will
initially have a modest impact on households’ incomes, or non oil economic activity. Indeed, job creation in
the oil sector, and forward and backward linkages to non oil sectors are expected to be modest. And oil
revenues not going to the budget or funds (to be invested abroad, per the Petroleum Revenue Management
Law adopted in February 2011), that is, going to the consortium, will mostly be repatriated to amortize capital
expenditures undertaken to build the extractive capacity.

                                                     11
liquidate them. The 30 percent increase in petroleum prices in January 2011 also signaled
Government’s strong willingness to reduce potential losses in utilities stemming from the
rise in world oil prices – in spite of its short term political cost. Thus, the successful
conclusion of ECF third and fourth reviews scheduled for May 2011 will provide the
necessary insurance that the macroeconomic framework will remain adequate for World
Bank development policy operations.

16.      The Government strategy is not immune from risks. Slower non-oil GDP growth
than expected and mounting political pressures for fiscal expansion ahead of next elections
could undermine Government plans to restore fiscal sustainability. Fiscal projections for
2011 rely on a non–oil GDP growth outlook of 6.5 percent in real terms, which is
dependent on a number of optimistic assumptions on exogenous factors such as continued
high export demand and prices3 and good rains (for agriculture and hydroelectric
production). Under a low case scenario characterized by a less favorable environment, non
oil GDP growth could fall to the 4-5 percent range and jeopardize the fiscal stabilization
strategy, through lower revenue4 and political support to it. Unfavorable unexpected
commodity price developments, food in particular, could also entail additional fiscal costs,
as in 2008. The pursuit of the fiscal adjustment is also endangered by a delicate political
economy. Risks lie particularly in Government’s ability to negotiate with unions a within-
budget public wage increase in 2011, succeed in significantly raising taxes, contain
domestically financed capital expenditures, and initially use oil wealth to (i) reduce the
deficit rather than to finance new public programs; and (ii) replenish oil funds. The onset of
oil, the announcement of higher financial resources through greater South-South
cooperation, and the higher statistical GDP have indeed, without doubt, led to high
expectations among the population that Ghana will soon join a group of oil rich countries
and that this will provide a large part of what is needed. And public sector unions have
strongly pushed for the introduction of the “single spine” salary structure which will
eventually entail substantial increases in individual remunerations once fully rolled out
across the entire public sector. This in a broader context of very competitive politics and a
repeated history of macroeconomic slippages ahead of general elections, the next one being
scheduled for end-2012. In the face of it, greater communication with CSOs and labor
unions on macroeconomic issues and is critically needed to manage expectations.
Productivity gains for better service delivery, through public sector reform (job
identification, performance and human resource management, salary administration), will
be needed to accompany the implementation of the new salary structure. Reaching
agreements among political parties to isolate fiscal matters from bipartisan politics, through
fiscal responsibility rules and laws (e.g. the oil revenue management bill) are also critical to
ensure the sustainability of reforms over successive administrations.

17.    The arrival of oil brings additional challenges to the quality of growth and its
pro-poor nature. Oil, through its impact on Government revenue, will almost inevitably
boost growth in the next years through demand effects. But it will also exacerbate a number
of already existing challenges related to governance (in oil and gas sectors, and more
broadly in the management of public resources), volatility (prices, oil reserves uncertainty),
3
  Terms of trade are forecast to start declining in 2011 and 2012, under the influence of rising oil prices and
declining export prices (gold, cocoa). Between 2004 and 2010, export prices grew by 96 percent, and were at
their historically highest levels in 2010.
4
  Staff calculations suggest that the materialization of the low case scenario could entail a 0.8 percentage point
of GDP deviation with respect to fiscal deficit targets retained in 2011.

                                                       12
agricultural competitiveness and geographical disparities. Ghana’s ability to address these
challenges will have a major influence on longer term growth and poverty alleviation. The
World Bank report on the economy-wide impact of oil discovery prepared in 2009 suggests
that, in absence of fiscal consolidation, increased transparency, removed bottlenecks in non
tradable sectors, stabilization mechanisms and increased provision of agricultural public
goods, economic growth could, after the initial boom, be lower over the long run that
without oil. In the event, poverty would suffer from lower economic growth and increased
regional disparities, in disfavor of the North.

18.     The implementation of the Government’s economic stabilization and reform
program should minimize risks of external debt distress. A new joint Bank-Fund DSA
will be distributed to the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank in FY11. Preliminary
results suggest that, with higher GDP – and thus lower debt to GDP,5 and lower than
expected non concessional borrowing in 2010, see below, risks of debt distress have not
increased compared with the DSA prepared by the Fund staff in 2010, in spite of a lower
than expected fiscal consolidation in 2010. With higher GDP – and thus higher GNI per
capita6, prospects for concessional financing will also diminish more rapidly than
previously thought but, the conclusion of previous DSA remains basically unchanged: the
pursuit of the programmed fiscal consolidation will be the ultimate premise for debt
sustainability in the years to come.

19.      Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non concessional borrowing.
Following the issuance of US$750 million worth of Eurobonds in 2007 (to finance
additional electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed US$458 million
equivalent in 2008 and US$448 million equivalent in 2009 to finance projects for rural
electrification, electricity transmission and generation capacity, housing, health, and
security, as well as to cover an unfunded external SOE liability. In light of these
developments, and the assessment of a weak capacity to assess social returns to public
investment projects, both non concessional borrowing policy notes distributed to the Board
of Executive Directors in January 2010 (covering loans contracted in 2008) and January
2011 (covering loans in 2010) recommended that IDA provide Ghana its full IDA
allocation on blend terms. A new note covering loans contracted in 2010 (preliminary
estimated by the IMF staff at US$216 million) will be distributed to the Board in FY12.
The new note will discuss recent steps taken by the Government to improve its capacity to
manage non-concessional debt by (i) restoring SOEs’ operational and financial
sustainability to limit default risks on their non-concessional debt; (ii) developing a
Medium Term Debt Management Strategy; and (iii) strengthening Ghana’s capacity to
select and appraise public investment projects, through the adoption and implementation of
the Public Private Partnership policy. In the meantime, Ghana will continue to be provided
IDA resources on blend terms, which will evolve under IDA-16.7

20.    Ghana’s macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of
the proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 Budget

5
  End-2010 external (public and private) and public (external and domestic) debt to GDP were respectively
estimated at 28.8 and 43.3 percent of GDP.
6
  Using new GDP figures, GNI per capita was estimated at US$1,190 in 2009 (Atlas method).
7
  From FY12, countries classified as blend – such as Ghana currently – will benefit from loans with a 5-year
grace period and a 25-year maturity. This compares with a 10-year grace period and a 35-year maturity in
FY11.

                                                    13
and confirmed with the successful conclusion of IMF ECF third and fourth reviews. The
nature and pace of actions taken by the Government in 2009 and 2010 to regain control of
the fiscal situation on a sustainable basis and the complementary financial assistance from
Development Partners and the IMF provide the conditions for the proposed operation to
meet its objectives and justifies the use of IDA resources.

      C.        POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND HUMAN
                              DEVELOPMENT
21.    Ghana recorded very significant poverty reduction between 1992 and 2006,
with the poverty rate falling from 52 percent to 29 percent.8 Malnutrition halved
between 1993 and 2008. However, most of the poverty reduction occurred in the South,
where large productivity gains in the agricultural sector (cocoa in particular) and
demographic changes freed human and financial resources to be redeployed and invested in
higher value-added sectors, the urban informal sector in particular. More than half of
Ghana’s poor reside in the three northern regions (which accounts for a fourth of Ghana’s
population) and where no significant poverty reduction has been observed in the past, either
through local development or out-migration.9

22.      Participatory and quantitative poverty assessments describe a situation where
the poor in Northern Ghana are predominantly rainfall-dependent farm households.
Households have few opportunities to diversify income sources and consequently remain
highly vulnerable to shocks. Recent increases in education have not increased livelihood
opportunities. Key risks –floods, droughts, pests, diseases, conflicts – are all preventable
with relevant infrastructure, public services, insurance and conflict resolution mechanisms.
Without such investments, the poor mortgage their prospects to escape poverty by depleting
their human and physical capital and adopting risky behaviors, such as child migration or
illegal artisanal mining.

23.      Government efforts to address lagging regions have been amplified under the
Savanna Accelerated Development initiative which is supported by several Development
Partners (DPs) including the Bank. Acknowledging the centrality of agriculture, the
initiative aims to increase agricultural productivity, promote a more sustainable
management of its natural resources and reduce the exposure of the population to collective
risks, such as natural disasters. Effective decentralization of decision making is foreseen as
an important means to address regional imbalances in service delivery, via the
strengthening of local capacity and vertical accountability mechanisms. Coordination
among various development actors – donor projects, Government programs and civil
society efforts will be improved. Existing social protection programs will be better targeted
(through geographical targeting and the adoption of a common targeting mechanism in
particular) and scaled up. According to a recent assessment, Ghana’s Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program offers the greatest guarantee of reaching
the poor,10 although implementation costs are high and could be reduced as the program
expands. Efficient targeting and cost effective delivery are critical in light of recent fiscal
8
  Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line of
US$1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

   See Republic of Ghana: Improving the Targeting of Social Programs, World Bank, June 2010, Washington
D.C. The report suggests that with 57 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line, LEAP has the highest
targeting efficiency among Ghana’s social programs and subsidies.

stabilization: pro-poor spending was protected but as reported in the forthcoming public
expenditure review, increases in personnel costs need to be accompanied by improvements
in the productivity of delivery mechanisms in health and education in particular.

24.     The review of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
depicts a picture of quick progress, but on sanitation and health. The income poverty,
hunger, primary completion, gender parity at school and access to water goals (MDG1a,
MDG1b, MDG2, MDG3, and MDG7a respectively) are on track to be met by 2015, if not
already met (MDG7a).11 These services have been extended to millions of poor in the past
decade, and protecting the gains of the past must be a key priority for the coming years. At
the same time, other important MDGs, such as sanitation (MDG7b), child (MDG4) and
maternal mortality (MDG5) are still off-track and require more effort, for their own sake
and likely large impact on other MDGs.12

   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating them,
the World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To do so, it
compares the progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption that progress
becomes increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is equivalent to comparing
the annual growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate required to reach the MDG in
2015 from the situation in 1990.

25.     Two factors affect the progress in poverty since the last living standards
survey. First, patterns of economic growth and poverty reduction over 1990 – 2006 suggest
a consistent record of pro-poor growth which, given reasonable growth over 2007 – 2010
has probably continued in recent years. However, the revision to the national accounts may
alter this relationship, with implications for measures of income distribution. Non-food
private consumption has been revised upward (by about 72 percent in 2006). As the poor
mostly consume food13, most of the additional non-food consumption is consumed by
richer households.14 Second, between 2006 and 2009, per capita real private consumption
grew by approximately 4 percent which, assuming this is shared equally across all
13
   The poverty line defines the minimum food and non-food consumption required not to be poor (the sum of
food and non-food poverty lines). The calculation of adult equivalent’s food requirements (the food poverty
line) involves measuring the local cost of consuming 2900 calories per day under a typical diet. Non-food
requirements (the non-food poverty line) are measured by the amount of non-food items consumed by those
whose total consumption is close to the food poverty line. This is based on the principle that these non-food
items are so essential to households that they forgo meeting their food requirements to purchase these non-
food items. In 2005/6, these non-food items represented 22 percent of the total consumption of households
close to the poverty line.
14
   It is known for a fact that expenditure surveys typically underestimate consumption levels of the rich
households more than they do with poor households, as the latter have simpler consumption patterns to
measure.

                                                             16
households, would have reduced the poverty headcount to 27.4 percent by end-2009.
However, this assumption is contested: recent shocks might have disproportionally affected
the poor thereby mitigating poverty reduction gains. Although tentative in the absence of a
recent household survey,15 various analyses indeed suggest that recent macroeconomic
turbulences could have had a significant impact on poverty. A participatory analysis,
voicing the perspective of the poor from the poorest Northern regions, emphasizes the
negative consequences of climatic events and price variations (upwards and downwards) on
vulnerable households’ livelihoods, and the fact that short term coping strategies (e.g. bush
burning, child labor and migration) chosen by the same households often aggravate their
situation. An ex-ante simulation analysis, linking recent macroeconomic developments and
outlook (lower FDI and remittances, export demand) to microeconomic outcomes
(monetary consumption, caloric intake, education and health demand), also suggests the
likely negative impact of the global crisis on poverty.

     D.     THE GHANA SHARED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
26.     In 2010, the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA, 2010-
13) followed on from Ghana’s second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS
II, 2006-9). The GSGDA was presented and discussed at the Consultative Group meeting
with Development Partners in September 2010, even though instructions for the preparation
of the Budget 2010 already included some of its main features. Next steps will include a
presentation at Parliament in 2011, per constitutional requirements. While the GSGDA and
its predecessor the GPRS II share many objectives (including MDGs and access to Middle
Income Status) and means to achieve them (e.g. education and skill development, access to
health, malaria control and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, social protection, access to
water and sanitation, housing and slum upgrading and population management, integration
of traditional authorities in formal institutional structures), they also differ in several
respects, reflecting political differences and changing realities. While the GPRS II
emphasized the centrality of private-led growth to reduce poverty, the GSGDA stresses the
need for the Government to focus on agriculture, fisheries, SMEs, sanitation and the
Savannah region for poverty reduction. The GSGDA also acknowledges the centrality of
macroeconomic stabilization (“seeking to address the macroeconomic challenges that had
emerged at the end of 2008”)16 to generate the fiscal space for investing in policies,
programs and projects related to the enhancement of Ghana’s private sector
competitiveness, accelerated agricultural development and natural resource management,
improved infrastructure development, human resource development and job creation, and
the consolidation of a transparent, accountable and efficient Government. New compared
with the GPRS II is also the consideration in the GSGDA of challenges and opportunities
related to the exploitation of oil and gas reserves starting in 2011 as far as growth, job
creation, the environment and the non-oil sector are concerned. A Joint Bank-Fund Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN) on this new Poverty Reduction Strategy will be shared with the
World Bank Board of Executive Directors in FY11, once the GSGDA monitoring and
evaluation framework, as well as its costing have been completed.

27.     The GSGDA and the new Aid Policy Paper for the period 2011-1517 reiterate the
need for continued official development assistance – and budget support in particular.
Indeed, financing needs to meet Ghana’s aspirations to become a middle income country18
cannot be entirely funded from domestic resources combined with prudent external non
concessional borrowing, even though the limit for the later was recently raised in agreement
with the IMF. And while forthcoming oil revenue could eventually prompt DPs to reduce
their ODA to Ghana, it is the Government’s view that continued support would be needed
in the first years of oil production to limit the potential of the “oil curse” developing in
Ghana, as well as providing additionality to oil revenues. Indeed, risks of political capture,
macroeconomic instability, lost external competitiveness and increased regional inequalities
stemming from oil are significant19, and call for particular attention to public sector reform
(single spine pay reform, decentralization, capacity building, transparency and external
accountability), the enforcement of multi-year macroeconomic frameworks (public
financial management, debt management strategy, medium term expenditure frameworks,
tax collection), macro-economic stabilization (utilities financial recovery, oil stabilization
funds, arrears liquidation, financial sector regulation), the investment climate (urban
development, land regulation, informal labor markets), and rural development (commercial
agriculture, connective infrastructure and social protection in the north, climate change
adaptation and mitigation). Against this background, continued ODA could be particularly
instrumental to secure stable funding, encourage the development of macroeconomic
stabilization mechanisms, continued progress in public financial management,
transparency, executive accountability, capacity building, investment effectiveness, and
overall reform implementation. In this context, general budget support would continue to be
the preferred aid modality, within the aligned and harmonized MDBS.

   The re-basing of national accounts from 1993 to 2006 currently undertaken by the Ghana Statistical
Services is expected to entail a significant upward revision in and GNI per capita levels. Combined with the
development of new economic activities around oil, GNI per capita could surpass the middle income status
threshold before 2015, yet not sufficiently to graduate from IDA given the prerequisite of stability at middle
income status.

        E.       THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND
                             CHALLENGES AHEAD
28.     Agriculture has driven Ghana’s aggregate economic growth in recent years,
and remains the primary livelihood for the majority of the population (of 22.5
million), especially the poorest. Agricultural GDP (AgGDP) grew by around 6 percent per
annum over 2007 – 2010 (Table 5). This continued medium term trends over the previous
two decades, driven largely by liberalization of the sector.20 Recent agricultural growth has
been driven primarily by area expansion rather than productivity gains. In line with the
usual structural transformation of agrarian economies, non-agricultural sectors grew more
rapidly with the result that the share of agriculture in overall economic activity declined.
The recent revision to national accounts has resulted in agriculture now accounting for 30
percent of GDP (from 39 percent under the old measure).

29.     Ghana is reasonably food secure at the national level although household food
insecurity is a concern in certain regions. Significant food imports are rice (400,000
tonnes in 2010) and poultry (with imports of 88,000 tonnes in 2008). Ghana does not face
significant food deficits and enjoys surpluses in certain commodities (see Table 6).
However, in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West, 10 percent, 15 percent and 34

percent of the respective households are food insecure.21 Vulnerability to food insecurity is
also observed in other regions such as Ashanti and Brong Ahafo.

30.     Modernizing agriculture is imperative with the advent of oil and the risks of a
loss of competitiveness associated with real exchange rate appreciation and potential
“Dutch Disease” effects.22 A loss of global agricultural competitiveness has been observed
in other countries that supposedly benefited from the oil booms of the 1970s and 1980s
such as Nigeria, Ecuador, Mexico, Algeria, Iran and Iraq. Even countries such as Chile, that
have imposed safeguards to manage natural resource windfalls, have not been completely
immune. These experiences underline the special challenge confronting Ghana in managing
the emerging oil economy. At the same time, Ghana‘s oil economy presents an unparalleled
opportunity for the agricultural sector and for poverty reduction in particular. Demand for
food, especially higher valued products, such as horticulture and livestock products, will
increase as incomes rise. Urbanization and associated shift in consumer preferences will
increase demand for processed foods with greater domestic value-added. Provided Ghana‘s
tradable sectors can remain competitive, this provides an opportunity for both farming and
the food processing manufacturing sector. Well managed oil revenues can fund
complementary public investment and reverse chronic under-investment in public goods
that has constrained agricultural growth.

31.     Ghana’s modest agricultural growth could be augmented with productivity
gains from more intensive farming practices. There are a number of challenges in
shifting from the current conditions of highly variable low input-low output farming to high
input-high output market oriented agriculture and agri-business. First is the limited use of
new technology (improved seed varieties) and purchased inputs (fertilizer, seed,
agrochemicals).

32.     Like in many other Sub-Saharan African countries, input use in Ghana is low
due to a lack of technology adoption at the farm level, and underdeveloped input
markets. Fertilizer use is low23 by Sub-Saharan Africa standards. MoFA estimates that less
than 20 percent of area under cultivation is planted using certified seed. However, in
contrast to other African countries, there is a substantial, though fragmented private sector
presence in agricultural input retail and distribution markets. Over 3,000 agro-dealers exist,
scattered throughout the country. Early pilot efforts to expand fertilizer usage sought to
build on this, by issuing vouchers to small-holders that had the benefit of deepening
effective fertilizer demand but unfortunately, did not include the much needed
complementary effort of promoting the use of certified seed.

33.     Increased uptake of agricultural input technology by smallholder farmers will
have the potential to achieve rapid and substantial yield gains when certified seed will
be used in conjunction with fertilizer. For example, yield increases for maize and rice of
100-200 percent are not unlikely and will bring about increased farm-level profitability and
raise the competitiveness of Ghanaian producers. To achieve this, efficient input markets
need to be developed where seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals are offered to farmers as a
package rather than sold in isolation through fragmented distribution networks, as is
currently the case. While fertilizer use is being promoted through a subsidy program,

   Estimated at 8 kg/ha, compared to an average of 20 kg/ha in Sub-Saharan Africa (MoFA, 2010).

                                                20
innovation in seed technology has been lagging behind. Implementation of new legislation
will encourage innovation and private sector investment in the seed industry, and
opportunities exist to develop and promote agricultural inputs by applying a more holistic
approach.

34.     Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on Ghana. Although
there will be fluctuations in both annual temperatures and precipitation, the trend for
temperature over the period 2010–50 indicates warming in all regions. The forecast for
precipitation indicates higher variability in rainfall levels, including a drought every decade
or so. The northern and southern Savannah zones are expected to be relatively dry. There is
a need to (a) increase investment in agricultural R&D, backed by extension services, to
develop new crop varieties and livestock; (b) improve water storage capacity to utilize
excess water in wet years and use it when it is needed during dry years; (c) improve
agricultural extension services and marketing networks; and (d) improve irrigation and
water management.24 These policy priorities have been taken into account in the design of
the policy program that the new DPO series supports.

35.     To sustain commercially oriented farmers, they need to be integrated into
commercial value chains rather than depend on haphazard and unpredictable market
opportunities. To build farmers’ ability to engage in business ventures with commercial
firms will require a capacity development and facilitation effort. In turn, commercial firms
will require engagement with rural communities to secure access to land, form out-grower
schemes, and establish a business that derives an important element of its efficiency and
competitiveness from the rural community in the form of a predictable raw material supply
chain. The creation of such business ventures will require a dedicated investment promotion
and facilitation effort (following the principles of responsible investment in agriculture),
including an appropriate tax incentive structure that will offer medium-term tax breaks
rather than front-loaded tax exemptions that will contribute to accelerated achievement of
an investor’s profitability. The provision of commercial finance for investments in
agriculture remains a key constraint and needs to be addressed.

36.     Value chains for locally traded commodities, such as food grains, require
functioning markets that feature limited price volatility in order to encourage seasonal
stockholding and spatial arbitrage. Market functioning and efficiency are affected by
infrastructure, especially rural roads. Hence, feeder road investment decisions need to be
made in a well coordinated manner to ensure that the right priorities are identified. To
further enhance market performance, the introduction of structured trading mechanisms,
such as warehouse receipt systems and forward markets, will offer opportunities for
commercial financing leveraged by commodity-based collateral, which has a real potential
to increase much needed financial liquidity in the agricultural sector. New legislation is
required to facilitate the development of such structured trading mechanisms. Functioning
markets also require transparency and predictability of government actions, such as
purchases and sales of national food buffer stocks.

37.    The design and implementation of a new irrigation master plan, including the
creation of PPPs in large scale irrigation ventures, will further enhance efficiency of
existing irrigation infrastructure and encourage private investments. The existing

irrigation policy and recently submitted technical regulations on irrigation will
accommodate such new public-private irrigation management structures, and will
ultimately require a restructuring of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA).

38.    The fisheries sector provides livelihoods to 2.2 million Ghanaians and requires
reform in order to conserve fish stocks and improve livelihoods. Substantial
productivity gains in marine fisheries can be achieved by rationalizing the commercial fleet,
thus conserving fish stocks and providing economic benefits to a more productive small-
scale marine fisheries sector. Aquaculture on Lake Volta and other water bodies provides
additional opportunities for commercial and small-scale fish production, including out-
grower schemes.

39.     A sector-wide resource allocation, budget management and coordination effort
is required to implement the agriculture sector policy and deliver on the sector
investment program. Ghana signed the African Union’s Maputo Declaration in 2003 and
committed to achieving 6 percent annual agriculture sector growth by spending a minimum
of 10 percent of the annual budget on agriculture following the continent-wide CAADP
framework. It has proven to be a challenge to manage that commitment due to an absence
of sector-wide budgeting and priority setting that goes beyond MoFA’s mandate. However,
opportunities exist to operate a budget management structure that is responsive to the needs
of the CAADP Compact and METASIP.

      III.      THE GOVERNMENT’S AGRICULTURE SECTOR PROGRAM AND
                           PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

40.     Agriculture is a key pillar of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development
Agenda. As the lead Ministry for implementing national programs in the agricultural sector
– with the important exception of cocoa25 – MoFA’s vision for Ghana’s agriculture sector is
“a modernized agriculture culminating in a structurally transformed economy and evident
in food security, employment opportunities and reduced poverty”.

41.     Through an extensive consultative process, Ghana has developed a sector
policy, an investment framework, and has internalized the CAADP agenda26.
Following a sector-wide consultation process on the content of METASIP, the Ghana
CAADP Compact was signed in October 2009 by Government, development partners,
private sector and civil society, thereby committing stakeholders to renewed collective and
individual efforts to support agricultural development. Importantly, CAADP provides an
enhanced framework for scaling up resources to agriculture – in line with G20
commitments at l'Aguila and Pittsburgh – and for improved harmonization and alignment.
Ghana subsequently prepared a national agriculture sector investment program (known
locally as the METASIP), in September 2010. The investment plan spans 2011 – 2015 and
incorporates relevant programs of agriculture-related Ministries and agencies. It also
anticipates activities of the private sector and civil society. Like the CAADP Compact, the

25
   Ghana’s cocoa sector falls under the auspices of the COCOBOD (the Ghana cocoa board) which is an
autonomous agency under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.
26
   CAADP is organized along the following four pillars: (i) Extending the area under sustainable land
management and reliable water control systems; (ii) Improving rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities
for market access; (iii) Increasing food supply and reducing hunger; and (iv) Agricultural research, technology
dissemination and adoption.

                                                      22
investment plan benefitted from a broad consultative process as well as technical inputs
from local experts supported by various development partners. Key stakeholders include
MoFA, other relevant Government bodies, development partners, NGOs, academia, civil
society, farmers and other on-farm and off-farm private sector operators, researchers and
service providers. The consultations resulted in the setting of investment priorities in the
agriculture sector and the development of METASIP. The organizing structure of the
investment plan corresponds with the existing sector policy document (known as FASDEP
II) with programs clustered under six themes. Box 2 provides a summary of key investment
priorities.

42.     Continued stakeholder dialogue has guided the development of programs for
the implementation of METASIP, including this operation. Consultations within the
Agriculture Sector Working Group as well as dialogue with farmers, private sector, and
policy makers during the period September 2010 and March 2011 have enabled the
identification of specific policy areas where focused support is required. As examples,
consultations have assisted in ensuring alignment of the DPO program with METASIP and
other programs. It also helped in the identification of specific issues, such as articulating the
need for a holistic approach for the promotion of agricultural inputs beyond fertilizer (i.e.
including complementary inputs), and the need for Government to support a legal
framework for the development of a warehouse receipt system.

43.     The investment plan and underlying policy priorities define Ghana’s
agricultural policy and planning environment. First, it solidifies the foundation of a
Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) to bring on board sector stakeholders in effective
coordination and participation. Second, it reaffirms the Government’s commitment to spend
at least 10 percent of the national budget on agriculture, consistent with the 2003 Maputo
Declaration.27 Third, by adopting a sector perspective, it seeks to improve coordination
across Government. In this regard, it is notable that the Policy Coordinating and Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit of the Office of the President and the NDPC will play key oversight
roles during implementation. Fourth, is presents the foundation for a substantial scale-up of
public resources to the sector – including additional development assistance.

44.    The incremental investment plan, in addition to existing resources, is costed at
over US$1 billion over five years. To illustrate the cross-sectoral nature, US$ 285.7
million is allocated for upgrading rural roads, to be implemented by the Ministry of Roads
and Highways. Likely sources of funds and the commitment to investment plan are shown
in Table 7. It is estimated that the funding gap for the investment program is about US$
702.2 million over five years.




27
  The Maputo Declaration, made by African leaders in the context of the AU Summit in 2003, calls for 10
percent of national budgets to be allocated to agriculture sector with the aim of achieving 6 percent annual
growth and 5 percent annual labor productivity growth in the sector.

                                                      23
                        Table 7. Proposed METASIP Funding (USD million)




45.     The commitment made by Government to increase resources to the sector is a
major element of the strategy. It is notable that current allocations to the sector are
between 2.5 percent and 9 percent of the budget – short of the Government’s own
commitment of spending 10 percent. (The ambiguity is because there is no clear definition
on what constitutes sector expenditure and a baseline is required to effectively monitor
progress.28 The narrowest definition is spending by MoFA which amounts to 2.5 percent of
public spending. If spending on rural roads, under the Ministry of Transport, and
agricultural research, under Ministry of Science and Technology, are added the ratio
increases. This is increased further to about 9 percent if expenditures by COCOBOD are
added.) Although GoG budget allocations to MoFA29 are declining, a Food and Agriculture
component of the Social Investment Program that appears in the 2011 budget has been
allocated to the Savanna Accelerated Development Agency (SADA) and District
Assemblies in unspecified proportions. Despite an overall increase in resource allocation to
agriculture, the 2011 MoFA budget represents a significant decline in resources for
agricultural investments, against a substantial increase in personal emoluments, including a
decline in donor investments, which would seem to contradict commitments made to the
CAADP process. The total investment budget (item 4 + donors) has declined 30 percent,
from GhC 188m in 2010 to GhC 132m. However, the estimated donor contributions for
2011 do not include funding that is in the pipeline, such as the AgDPO and USAID’s Feed
the Future initiative.




28
   An effort is underway in Ghana to (i) agree at a technical level how to account for multi-use expenditures
that contribute to agriculture sector outcomes (such as spending on rural roads); and (ii) confirm these
protocols within the budget guidelines to promote their consistent application to monitor progress against the
Maputo Declaration.
29
   This excludes MDA expenditure financed by internally generated funds (IGFs), debt relief (HIPC and
MDRI) and donor funding including budget support, which is accounted for separately in Ghana’s chart of
accounts.

                                                      24
                                   Box 2: The Programs of METASIP
Program 1: Food Security and Emergency Preparedness has seven components: (i) Productivity
Improvement, mainly of staple crops (maize, cassava, rice, yam and cowpea); (ii) Improved Nutrition, through
nutrition education and advocacy and food fortification; (iii) Diversification of Livelihood Options for the
Poor, with off-farm activities linked to agriculture; (iv) Food Storage and Distribution, to reduce post-harvest
losses including capacity building of producers in better harvesting, transportation and storage methods,
introduction of grading methods and linkages between producers and markets; (v) Early Warning Systems and
Emergency Preparedness; (vi) Irrigation and Water Management; and (vii) Mechanization Services, to
increase efficiency in include planting, cultivation, harvesting and primary processing.
Program 2: Increased Growth in Incomes is closely related to Program 1, being concerned with increasing
productivity and securing farm production. It has six components: (i) Promotion of Crop, Livestock and
Fishery Production for Cash; (ii) Development of New Products; (iii) Pilot Value Chain Development; (iv)
Intensification of Farmer-based Organizations and Out-grower Concepts; (v) Development of Rural
Infrastructure; and (vi) Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture. The first component is within the major focus of
Government policy of increasing productivity of smallholder agriculture, as the critical step for increasing
incomes. Direct support to farmers to increase productivity is complemented by important activities to
develop effective marketing systems that benefit producers and consumers. Development of new products and
value chains is designed to increase returns to farmers, to generate employment and incomes along value
chains and to improve supply and quality of products reaching consumers. Rural infrastructure will be
developed to enable and assist logistics at all links in supply chains. Substantial markets for higher-value crop
commodities, especially perishables, in cities and towns offer potential to which support for urban and peri-
urban agriculture is directed.
Program 3: Increased Competitiveness and Enhanced Integration into Domestic and International
Markets reflects the changing nature of agriculture sector strategy and policy, bringing attention to expansion
and diversification of markets for farm produce. It has one component: (i) Marketing of Ghanaian Produce in
Domestic and International Markets. Two important challenges for the agriculture sector are efficient delivery
throughout the country of staples produced by smallholder farmers and development of markets for higher-
value products to increase incomes and satisfy consumer demand. These challenges would be met by value
chain development and specific action for market development. Development will be pursued especially for
domestic markets for staple crops and for export markets of non-traditional products of smallholder farmers.
The private sector will be encouraged to seek out and develop new markets for existing products and new
products for potential markets.
Program 4: Sustainable Management of Land and Environment attends to the critical area of maintaining
and improving the land resource on which agricultural production depends. It has a single component:
Awareness Creation and Use of SLM Technologies by Men and Women Farmers. This program would
formulate policies and regulations and improve MOFA's capacity to promote sustainable land management.
Program 5: Science and Technology Applied in Food and Agriculture Development addresses the need
for technology for sustaining and improving agricultural production through two components: (i) Uptake of
Technology along the Value Chain and Application of Biotechnology in Agriculture; and (ii) Agricultural
Research Funding and Management of Agricultural Research Information. Research is to be directed to
supporting increases in productivity and incomes (Programs 1 and 2). Mechanisms for delivering research
results to users on farms and along value chains will be developed as the critical need to ensure that the best
modern technologies are used.
Program 6: Improved Institutional Coordination responds to the need for better management of MoFA's
operations, improved interactions with other ministries and close working relationships with the private
sector. It has four components: (i) Institutional Strengthening for Intra-ministerial Coordination; (ii) Inter-
ministerial Coordination; (iii) Partnership with Private Sector and Civil Society Organizations; and (iv)
Coordination with Development Partners. This program responds to the growing need for integration of the
efforts and resources of Ghana's public and private sectors and international donor partners. The first
component would build MoFA's capacity to identify, plan and implement projects. Partnerships and
consultations with other Government ministries and agencies would ensure maximum efficiency and
effectiveness of public sector effort. Consultations and partnerships with the private sector and civil society
would be broadened and deepened.

46.    The METASIP funding gap that has been identified (approximately US$150
million per year) is substantial and will require commitment from DPs and GoG.
Careful planning and monitoring of funding commitments is required in order to identify
funding priorities and make program adjustments if and when certain program components
are underfunded. With the inauguration of a multi-stakeholder governance structure, the
CAADP Country Team, a coordinated resource mobilization effort will be supported by
program performance monitoring and evidence-based policy making and guide the
programming of donor support.

47.    In addition to support to METASIP, the DPO also recognizes the importance
of consistent and adequate funding for recurrent expenditures, specifically for the
delivery of key public goods such as extension and animal health services that support the
investments under METASIP. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework operated by the
Government would ideally reconcile the sector’s recurrent expenditure and the METASIP
budget, ensuring alignment and complementarities between programs and budgets.

            IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                                      A. LINK TO CAS
48.     The proposed operation is in line with the CAS Progress Report and
contributes to CAS development targets and outcomes. Whereas the CAS envisaged a
series of three operations, the first series was discontinued after the second operation with
the view of developing a new series that would be aligned to a newly emerging policy and
program environment. This AgDPO 3 would be the first of the new series that will respond
to the changed policy and program environment by assisting the Government of Ghana
(GoG) implement the CAADP Compact through the recently formulated METASIP. The
new AgDPO series continues to contribute to CAS outcomes related to Development Target
1.2, Modernizing Agriculture, while it will also contribute to Development Target 1.1,
Financing Private Sector.

                                             26
49.     The AgDPO 3 remains consistent not only with the CAS, but also with the
Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy, and supports the Bank’s commitment to harmonization,
as stated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and, more recently, the Accra
Agenda for Action (AAA). Similarly, the AgDPO helps to implement the Africa Action
Plan in four of the eight focus areas: (i) strengthening the African private sector; (ii)
increasing the economic empowerment of women; (iii) building skills for competitiveness
in the global economy; and (iv) raising agricultural productivity. The AgDPO is part of the
Bank’s action plan to scale up agriculture in Africa and support the Government’s efforts to
establish policies and delivery mechanisms that drive agricultural growth.

                         B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND
                                    OTHER DONORS
50.     Donor coordination in Ghana was launched through the Comprehensive
Development Framework in 1999. Coordination has deepened in accordance with the
Paris Declaration and, more recently, the AAA endorsed at the Third High Level Forum
(HLF) on Aid Effectiveness held in Ghana in September 2008. The Bank is active in the
Agriculture Sector Working Group. Membership includes all the donors active in the sector,
including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA)30, the German agency for technical cooperation
(GIZ), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the French development agency (AFD),
USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency. It includes non-traditional donors too, such as AGRA (with a large
Ghana program and regional office in Accra) and the Brazilian agricultural research and
extension agency (EMBRAPA) which manages a program of south-south cooperation. It
also includes a number of key development agencies, such as IFPRI.

51.     The CAADP Compact, signed by the Bank on behalf of all DPs, has
strengthened the framework for donor collaboration, and includes commitments to
enhance the impact of development assistance. In addition, all DPs signed a secondary
memorandum of understanding (MoU) to indicate clear support among individual DPs for
the commitments embodied in the Compact. Two additional donors not actively engaged in
the sector but supportive of sector objectives through their contributions to the MDBS (the
European Commission and UK’s Department for International Development [DFID]) also
signed the MoU.

52.    The annual MoFA-DP Joint Sector Review (JSR), the next of which is
scheduled for June 2011, is an example of effective coordination. The first JSR was held
in June 2008, and six teams reviewed specific sectoral outcomes. The JSR is an integral
element of a SWAp and reduces the transaction costs of individual DP assessments by
combining them into a single exercise. These collective assessments also facilitate a
consensus on sectoral performance involving all DPs and the Government, and allow
concerns to be highlighted jointly, avoiding fragmentation among donors. The 2010 Review
formed an important part of the identification for the proposed AgDPO series. The AgDPO


30
  CIDA provides sector budget support of CAN$100 million over 2009 – 13 with annual base and
performance payments (75 percent and 25 percent respectively) contingent on meeting ‘trigger-targets’.
Through its Contribution Arrangement with MoFEP, CIDA funds flow through GoG channels using existing
GoG policies and procedures, but funds are allocated to MoFA.

                                                  27
will be able to contribute to an annual budget and expenditure review component of the
JSR.

53.    The AgDPO continues to depend on analytical insights through economic and
sector work (ESW) supported by the Bank and other DPs. The Bank works closely with
USAID and particularly their Governance Strategy Support Program (GSSP), which is
implemented by IFPRI. Coordinated knowledge generation is also a key theme under
CAADP, with the upcoming establishment of the Strategy Analysis and Knowledge
Support System (SAKSS) as part of the newly established CAADP Country Team that will
coordinate the implementation and monitoring of the Ghana CAADP program, i.e.
METASIP.

54.     The AgDPO also relates to the MDBS, which provides co-financed general
budget support. GoG and DPs have agreed on a framework memorandum to guide the
relationship between their sector-specific budget support operations and general budget
support. This has been effective in limiting cross-conditionality and in identifying policy
issues best dealt with through the sectoral operations or policy dialogue and those
appropriate to be ‘elevated’ to the MDBS arena.

                 C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
55.    The new series of agriculture development policy operations constitute an
important complementary instrument to the Bank’s existing and planned program of
investment and non-lending technical assistance operations. Whereas existing general
policy based lending has focused on critical cross-cutting reforms in public financial
management and fiscal reform, investment projects in the sustainable development arena
have not been well suited to supporting essential policy reforms. As articulated in the CAS
Progress Report, the Bank’s strategy is to provide both flexible general budget support,
budget support with a focus in key sectors, including agriculture, focused investment
lending operations to finance major public investments and the like, and non-lending
technical assistance to strengthen policy and analytical capacity.

56.     The new AgDPO series is directly linked with the West Africa Agricultural
Productivity Project (WAAPP; P122065, IDA US$15 million for Ghana) which is
supporting increased small-holder productivity through strengthening the regional
agricultural research systems. In this regard, it is strengthening the research-extension
linkages, and promoting more relevant research and more effective dissemination to
farmers. To sustain project outputs requires continued funding of the research extension
liaison committees, which is a specific policy measure supported by the present operation
under Policy Area 1. The WAAPP is also assisting in the technical aspects of the new
regulatory regime for seed registration to promote the availability of improved seed variety,
supported under Policy Area 1 in the DPO.

57.    Skills development and vocational training in commercial agriculture and
agribusiness is supported under the DPO’s Policy Area 1, and will feature among priority
sectors to be included in the upcoming Skills and Technology Development Project
P118112, IDA US$70 million) which, through its skills development fund, will support
capacity building amongst farmer groups to be effective partners in out-grower schemes
with commercial nucleus farms. The non-lending technical assistance program on
agricultural risk management (P119400, Trust Fund) is building capacity for assessing

                                             28
(and quantifying) agricultural risks and supporting pilot risk management measures
including insurance and other means.

58.     Similarly, by supporting Policy Areas 2 and 3, the DPO is closely linked with
the proposed Commercial Agriculture Project (P114264, IDA US$100 million,) which
will strengthen Government’s efforts to leverage private investment in socially responsible
commercial agriculture and agribusiness, and will support the application of out-grower
schemes. It will build capacity among farmers and their organizations to work with
agribusiness firms, facilitating agribusiness investors in acquiring land and doing business
with the rural farming community, and providing other key public goods and services. A
number of relevant policy and institutional prior actions and triggers that contribute to the
objectives of linking farmers to markets and developing value chains including available
finance through an out-grower fund and more effective investment incentives have been
included in the new AgDPO series. Technical support for improved agricultural tenure
security is also being provided under the second Land Administration Project (P120636;
IDA US$50 million.).

59.     Key policy and institutional reforms of the upcoming Ghana Fisheries Program
(P124775, US$40 million) are captured in the AgDPO under Policy Area 4. The
program is part of the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program, which includes nine coastal
countries from Mauritania to Ghana. The Program is implemented through a series of
operations, each targeting a different group of countries. The investments in Ghana will
focus on strengthened governance and management of fishery resources, as well as
investments to reduce illegal fishing and increase local value added to fish products and
will support the fisheries policy dialogue.

60.     The ongoing Ghana Transport Sector Project (P102000, US$225 million) has
an agricultural feeder road component, and the priority setting and resource allocation
processes are supported under the new AgDPO series. The transport project includes a
component for US$50.5 million to finance the rehabilitation of rural roads, and will
establish a structured process for identifying feeder roads to be rehabilitated, giving priority
to commercial agricultural potential. The AgDPO will support this effort through improved
coordination and management of resources between MoFA and the Ministry of Roads and
Highways under Policy Area 5.

61.     The Bank also has two complementary budget support operations, as
previously mentioned: the EGPRC and its successor PRSC7, and the Natural Resources
and Environmental Governance (NREG) DPO series (FY2009 – FY2011 and subsequent
new series). The PRSC and the MDBS will remain key instruments to motivate cross-
cutting policy and institutional changes. There will be no cross-conditionality between the
NREG, AgDPO and the PRSC. As before, two sector DPOs (i.e. NREG and AgDPO) will
continue to rely on macroeconomic assessments and debt sustainability analysis carried out
under the PRSC. The teams will ensure complementarities between the various DPOs,
recognizing the continued value of sector-DPLs.

          D. LESSONS LEARNED AND DEVELOPMENTS SINCE AGDPO 2
62.    The AgDPO 1 and 2 have encouraged development partners to focus on overall
sector outcomes instead of or in addition to narrow project performance. The JSRs
have proved to be effective instruments in this regard. The AgDPO series, among other

                                              29
support programs, provides an important input into a process of policy dialogue, generates
demand driven policy research for evidence based decision making, and provides a vehicle
for policy adjustments. Moreover, the AgDPO and the CIDA budget support program are
generating a demand for a sector-wide policy agenda, based on which individual DPs can
design support programs. This would also facilitate the implementation of a SWAp.

63.      A Joint Sector Review was completed in May 2010. A number of actions were
recommended, pertaining to the performance of Government programs (such as the
fertilizer subsidy program, food buffer stock operations, and the block farm program),
irrigation policy and strategic plan, support to FBOs, RELCS, human resource
management, and financial management and coordination. A number of key recommended
actions have been included in AgDPO 3.

64.     As per the recommendations in the 2010 JSR, a series of reviews were launched
in November 2010. Assessments are being carried out of the fertilizer subsidy program,
food buffer stock operations, the block farm program, and the farm mechanization program,
all of which involve substantial Government resources in the provision of subsidies and
service delivery to farmers. The reviews are carried out under the SAKSS capability
through a network of Ghanaian research institutions and individual researchers, funded
through and supervised by IFPRI. The reviews in question will most likely become ‘rolling
reviews’, whereby the assessments are updated periodically in order to provide real-time
analytical input in program monitoring and planning.

65.     There is a need to focus on the national budgeting and planning process linking
the ministries and agencies that are involved in agriculture more firmly to the national
processes. Improvements in this area through more sophisticated budget negotiations are
emerging, although confirmation of the evidence will require a longer cycle of observation.
AgDPO 3 places an emphasis on national planning and resource allocation processes that
will also play a key role in the upcoming Commercial Agriculture Project. MoFA has
started a PER exercise that supports the CAADP implementation process from a budgeting
perspective. This technical support, provided by NEPAD and administered by the Bank,
aims to assist Ghana in its agriculture sector resource allocation process to achieve the
CAADP target of allocating 10 percent of the national budget in an optimum manner to
achieve 6 percent annual sector growth. A work plan and terms of reference for a review of
sector-wide agricultural budgets and expenditure is being prepared by MoFA for
implementation during 2011.

66.    The Government is awaiting the outcome of a proposal submitted to the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The proposal, budgeted at US$50
million, focuses on the revival of the poultry value chains (layers and broilers), and the
closely related supply chains for soya and maize. These priorities are consistent with
METASIP investment priorities. If awarded, it is likely that the African Development Bank
will administer the program.

                          E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
67.     A variety of literature has identified agriculture as a current and future driver
of economic growth and poverty reduction in Ghana. For instance, the 2007 Country
Economic Memorandum and studies by IFPRI based on their computable general
equilibrium model identify the significant potential for agricultural growth by closing

                                            30
existing yield gaps as well as additional opportunities for value addition. These studies also
confirm the wider literature on the substantial poverty reducing impact of such growth. At
the same time, the PEIR and ERPFM reports present challenges in expenditure
management and prescribed recommendations for improvements, while the PEFA 2010
report31 presented a snap-shot of expenditure management performance levels at the
national and sub-national levels that would need improvements.

68.     Analysis of the impact of the oil economy has added to the urgency of
improving the performance of agriculture as well as the potential fiscal space created by
sustainable management of revenues. Despite potential risks, Ghana’s oil economy presents
an unparalleled opportunity for the agricultural sector and for poverty reduction in
particular. Demand for food, especially higher valued products, such as horticulture and
livestock products, will increase as incomes rise. Urbanization and urban consumer
preferences will lead to increasing demand for processed and foods with greater domestic
value-added. This provides an opportunity for both farming and the food processing
manufacturing sector; Government revenues for public investment in agricultural sector
will increase and help alleviate chronic under-investment in public goods that has
constrained agricultural growth.32

69.      The program draws from these studies and other specific assessments to
inform the specific measures to be supported. For instance, the USAID-funded AgCLIR
diagnostic,33 (which adopts a similar approach to the Bank’s Doing Business Survey)
identified measures to increase private investment in agriculture, including measures to
promote private sector innovation in the seed industry, and measures that strengthen links
between farmers and out-grower firms. This reinforced previous analytical work that
identified the important contribution to be played by FBOs34 in part as a conduit for
pluralistic extension service delivery funded by the Extension Development Fund35.
Similarly, an assessment of the scale of post-harvest losses36 provided quantitative data on
the costs of product degradation but also the fact that in terms of remedial measures one
size does not fit all – i.e. that the cause and extent of losses differs across commodities and
between value chains.37 A recent (2010) World Bank/IFPRI study on gender and
governance in rural services pointed to the need to improve the management of the
agricultural extension system, in particular with a view of better reaching female farmers. A
study to evaluate the effectiveness of technology transfer from research and extension
services to small-holders was commissioned by MoFA but failed to meet quality standards
and is being redone. FAO assessments38 document the failure of past efforts at expanding
irrigation schemes and in particular the institutional challenges to sustainable management,

   For instance, 60 percent of main-season mango production is lost (almost half of this due to poor storage at
the market). Losses for cereals are much lower, at about 6 percent – 18 percent, with much of this during
harvesting operations. Loss rates for vegetables (between 10 percent – 20 percent) are attributed particularly
to damage during transport.

noting that management by users is associated with better irrigation performance and the
resulting increased incomes benefit all household members.39 Recent analytical work by the
Bank has highlighted the threats to Ghana’s marine fisheries and the urgent need for
improved management of the fishing fleet.40

70.      Several assessments of the implementation of the fertilizer subsidy programs
identified a number of areas for improvement, while also reflecting the differing
positions among stakeholders. Three reviews have been undertaken, in ascending order of
analytical rigor: (i) a one-day workshop among MoFA staff produced an internal report for
management; (ii) a study commissioned by the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana41 was
based on interviews in five Districts; and (iii) a comprehensive description of the operation
of the 2008 scheme published by IFPRI42. While all the assessments commend the initiative
as innovative public-private collaboration, they also cite anecdotal evidence of leakages and
perverse outcomes inconsistent with the intended objectives. The efficiency of targeting is
of key concern: The internal MoFA review argues that the administration costs of
overseeing the targeting is too high and therefore recommends a universal subsidy
applicable at the point of import. The IFPRI analysis identifies some displacement of prior
fertilizer purchases and argues that the absence of clear protocols in voucher distribution
allowed for applying unforeseen procedures that are likely to undermine the program
objectives. These analytical insights together with feedback from the past 2010 fertilizer
subsidy program have helped MoFA refine the program for 2011.

71.      The Bank’s recently completed Poverty Assessment provides a focus on spatial
development and the lagging regions of Northern Ghana. The report concludes that
people could live well from agriculture in Northern Ghana if low productivity was
addressed by a more proactive and spatial approach to addressing infrastructure gaps,
technology and business climate constraints. While providing access within two kilometers
to an all-season road to all Ghanaians might be unaffordable in the short run, cost
requirements to ensure that there is adequate road accessibility to 80 percent of the
agricultural land would be substantially lower. A similar spatial approach could be applied
to small scale irrigation schemes. Improved dissemination of technology, improved
knowledge and facilities for post-harvest handling, in addition to overall improvements in
the value chain, are also needed to reduce post-harvest losses. Moreover, innovative
institutional arrangements such as out-grower schemes and contract farming, which better
link small-holders to markets, and are more dependent on private sector actors, are
promising candidates for scaling up and replication, thus exploiting the large under-utilized
land areas suitable for large-scale agriculture and responding to trading opportunities in
regional markets. These analytical insights are currently helping shape the Commercial
Agriculture Project and a number of the policy and institutional prior actions and triggers of
the new AgDPO series.

72.   The recent study on the economics of climate change in Ghana43 concludes that
Ghana’s response to increasing temperatures suggests prioritizing the development of

projected to have significant impacts on Ghana that require an appropriate policy response.

73.     As part of the CAADP implementation effort, policy analysis and sector
stakeholder dialogue are currently being institutionalized by MoFA. Under the banner
of the CAADP Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (SAKSS), a series of
reviews covering various aspects of the sector, including the fertilizer subsidy,
mechanization, block farm, and irrigation programs of MoFA, are underway. The analysis
will inform the upcoming 2011 Joint Sector Review as well as the new AgDPO series.
Currently, funding support for SAKSS activities is provided through IFPRI, while a number
of DPs are actively engaged in planning the research, including the Bank.

     V.     THE PROPOSED GHANA THIRD AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT
                            POLICY OPERATION

                             A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
74.    The third AgDPO will be the first operation of the proposed second series of
AgDPOs, consisting of three operations (AgDPO 3, AgDPO 4, and AgDPO 5). Although
it was originally foreseen that the first series of AgDPOs would contain three operations,
including AgDPO 3, it was agreed in November 2009 to discontinue this first series and
launch a new series of AgDPOs that: (i) would build on Ghana's Agriculture Sector
Strategy as prepared under the CAADP process and adopted at the CAADP Roundtable in
October 2009; and (ii) would be aligned with Ghana's Medium-Term Agriculture Sector
Investment Plan (METASIP) which aims to translate the adopted Sector Strategy under
CAADP into operational terms. The renewed policy focus and the substantive investment
plan and commitment by stakeholders require the new DPO series to support a more
ambitious agenda of policy and institutional reform with a larger lending amount.

75.     A first draft of METASIP was presented and discussed at the agriculture
sector review meeting in May 2010 and the latest version of the program was finalized
in September 2010. Since September 2010, discussions have been ongoing between GoG
and the Bank to identify policy areas where a new AgDPO series in general, and AgDPO 3
in particular, could generate recognized value-added towards implementation of METASIP.
Policy areas have been identified that can be supported under the proposed AgDPO and
specific actions and measures that would help achieve policy objectives have been
discussed with GoG.




                                            33
76.  The following sector policy areas have been agreed to be covered under the second
AgDPO series:

          i.        Development of and funding for demand-driven agricultural technology for
                    improved on-farm productivity, including extension and education, seed and
                    fertilizer technology adoption and input market development;
         ii.        Improving farmers' market access and market performance, facilitation of
                    out-grower schemes, investment promotion, and finance;
        iii.        Improving irrigated agriculture, including development of new irrigation
                    infrastructure through PPPs, and development of other infrastructure such as
                    feeder roads;
        iv.         Improving the management of the marine and inland fisheries sector,
                    including conservation of fish stock;
         v.         Improving agriculture sector management, priority setting, and resource
                    allocation.

77.    Each of these areas offers significant opportunities to enhance the
competitiveness of Ghanaian agriculture and improve effectiveness and efficiency of
public spending in the agriculture sector. It is with these considerations in mind that
within each of these policy areas a number of concrete policy and institutional actions and
measures have been identified that form a solid platform on which to mount the envisaged
second series of AgDPOs. Policy areas, policy objectives, and measures and actions to
achieve the objectives have been drawn from a wider agriculture sector policy agenda that
is under preparation, and will form an important tool for the Agriculture Sector Working
Group and the CAADP Country Team.44

78.      Government is committed to the current agricultural policy and its
implementation programs and has taken full ownership and leadership. Continuation
of this commitment is required for the successful implementation of the second series
of AgDPOs. The ability to generate impact in terms of sector competitiveness and
effectiveness, and efficiency of public spending, rests on the assumption that FASDEP II,
the CAADP Compact, and METASIP remain the key references for establishing priorities
in the allocation and execution of public expenditures in the agriculture sector. Given that
public expenditures in agriculture go beyond those allocated to and executed by the
Ministry of Food and Agriculture, this assumption extends to other relevant MDAs as well.
Implicit in the CAADP Compact and METASIP, and thereby the proposed policy and
institutional areas to be covered under the second AgDPO series, is the premise that public
facilitation will generate the space and incentives for substantial private investments in
agriculture.




44
     A sector-wide policy matrix is currently under preparation.

                       B. POLICY AREAS TO BE SUPPORTED UNDER
                                    THE OPERATION
79.     The priority policy areas to be supported under AgDPO 3 are consistent with
METASIP and have been confirmed with the Government. They include: (i)
agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity; (ii) market and value chain
development; (iii) irrigation and other infrastructure; (iv) fisheries; and (v) agriculture
sector management. Within each area a number of specific policy objectives have been
specified and agreed. Table 9 presents the prior actions for AgDPO 3, and Table 10
presents the policy matrix.

       Policy Area 1. Agricultural technology for improved on-farm productivity

Policy Objective: Improved research, extension services, skills training and education
in agricultural sciences and farm management

80.     To achieve increased agricultural productivity, development of relevant
technology and its uptake by smallholder farmers is critical, and has proven to be a
major challenge. Farmers are unwilling or unable to adopt improved planting practices and
deploy improved seeds and fertilizer because they are not convinced of the benefits, cannot
afford the inputs, or the inputs are not available. Past efforts at agricultural extension have
been weak, and promotional subsidies on input use have been incomplete and haphazard. In
addition, research and technology development efforts have not always been demand-
driven, and private sector technology innovation and dissemination has been largely stifled
by restrictive legislation and regulations.45 Research and extension functions are housed in
two different ministries and coordination among them is weak.

81.     To support demand-driven research and extension services, the Government
has undertaken to provide funding for agricultural research, based on the research
needs identified by the multi-stakeholder Research Extension Liaison Committees
(RELCs). RELCs form the linkage between the farming community and the Government,
particularly the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) which incorporates a
number of specialized agricultural research institutes. The 2011 allocation to agricultural
research is reflected in the CSIR budget, specifically contributing to demand-driven
research and technology transfer projects that reflect farmer and market needs and
preferences. The budget allocation, and the demand-driven nature of the research it
supports, is a prior action that has been met.46 Going forward, the identification of research
needs will also require continued input from other actors in the value chains, for example
involving emerging commodity associations representing traders, processors and others.
These associations may be solid partners in research and extension planning and may have
an interest in providing funding. In the longer term, improved coordination on public
resource allocation across MDAs will potentially provide a more sustainable solution to the
problem that this prior action seeks to address.


45
   For example, only one international hybrid maize variety has been introduced in Ghana in recent years,
which is currently being promoted, in combination with fertilizer and agrochemicals, among smallholders by a
commercial out-grower firm.
46
   This prior action is consistent with the 2010 trigger applied by CIDA (for their budget support program for
the implementation of FASDEP II) that focuses on disbursement of funds for RELC-identified research.

                                                     35
82.     Coordination and planning is required to ensure that agriculture research and
technology transfer priorities are reflected in budgets and programs, and are
implemented. A new Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy and Development
Program will be developed that reflect an increased focus on: (i) mainstreaming STI into
agriculture sector programs; (ii) demand-driven nature of adaptive research and extension
services; and (iii) regional collaboration. The approval of the STI Policy and Development
Program is a trigger for AgDPO 4. Once developed, agriculture sector STI projects and
activities are to be captured in a national-level STI investment plan, as well as in the
national budget. Efforts will also be needed to improve monitoring and coordination among
farmers, public and private research and technology groups, and public and private
extension capabilities to ensure that demand-driven, innovative, and appropriate technology
is disseminated effectively and adopted by end-users.

83.     In support of scaling up agricultural research and extension, the human
resource base will be developed and maintained. Skills training, education, and research
and technology development would be demand-driven at all levels. Currently, coordination
among training and education providers is poor and capacity to deliver is lacking. Formal
training providers at university, polytechnic and college levels face human and other
capacity constraints. Applied research and technology development is being undertaken by
universities and polytechnics that face several constraints in internal technical capacity and
in knowledge transfer.

84.    An assessment of resource and development needs among research and
training institutions, producer organizations, farmers, and private service providers
would be a next step to develop a capacity building program among key agricultural skills
and technology training/research organizations. Once operational, resources from the Skills
Development Fund, part of the proposed Skills and Technology Development Project, may
be available to support this effort.

Policy Objective: Adoption of agricultural input technology

85.    Arguably the biggest opportunity for the agricultural sector is the achievement
of substantial productivity gains through technology development and dissemination.
The availability and use of certified seed among smallholder farmers in Ghana is extremely
low. The passing of a new seed law, which allows for the implementation of the 2008
ECOWAS regional seed harmonization regulation,47 was quoted in a recent report on the
commercial, legal and institutional environment for agricultural investors in Ghana as a key
measure that could attract significant investment by international seed companies that
would ultimately contribute to substantial yield improvements (BIZCLIR, 2008).

86.     The Government has made considerable progress on the development of new
seed legislation. A new national plants bill was submitted to Parliament and passed in June
2010.48 In tandem with the promotion of fertilizer technology and improved farm
management practices, the new law has the potential to address what is perhaps the most
critical productivity-related constraint among Ghanaian smallholder farmers. It
accommodates the 2008 ECOWAS seed harmonization regulation, the WTO Sanitary and
47
   Regulation C/REG.4/05/2008 (harmonization of the rules governing quality control, certification and
marketing of plant seeds and seedlings in ECOWAS Region)
48
   Ghana Plants and Fertilizer Act, September 2010

                                                     36
Phyto-Sanitary Agreement, and the International Plant Protection Convention, and thus
creates opportunities for the introduction of regional and international seed technology.
Implementation of the new legislation is expected to make it attractive for international
seed companies to invest in Ghana. Approval of the Plants and Fertilizer Bill by Parliament
is a prior action that has been met. The Bill was passed in June 2010 and assented in
September 2010. Dissemination of the new law and the ECOWAS regulation is needed,
including dissemination of the implementation arrangements.

87.     Implementation of the new legislation will require the formation of three
Councils covering the areas of seed, plant protection, and fertilizer. These Councils will
develop a new technical regulatory framework that will change the current structure of the
seed industry dramatically. The Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Department
(PPRSD) at MoFA will provide a secretariat function to all three Councils and will need to
make adjustments to its structure to accommodate these new responsibilities. Establishment
of the three Councils is a trigger for AgDPO 4.

88.     Other institutional reforms will be required. Whereas foundation seed is
currently produced by the Grains and Legumes Board and breeder seed is produced by
CSIR, both as virtual monopolies, private companies will now be able to obtain licenses to
perform these functions. The roles of the Grains and Legumes Board, and CSIR will
therefore change, which will be reflected in their institutional structure.

89.     Achieving the prior action and trigger requires preparatory work to be
undertaken by MoFA and DPs. In particular: Detailed technical work and legal drafting
will be required to produce the regulations to give substance to the Plants and Fertilizer Act.
Agencies such as IFDC have been supporting the Government to do so, with MCA funding,
and this will probably continue. In addition, this could be an area of collaboration with
AGRA. Institutional reform of the Grains and Legumes Board and CSIR to reflect their
new mandate as per the new seed law will require an institutional review to determine how
their roles and functions as regulators and facilitators of plant breeding will be
implemented.

90.     To achieve technology-driven productivity gains at the national level, efficient
input markets need to be developed where seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals are
offered to farmers as a package rather than sold in isolation through fragmented
distribution networks, as is currently the case. As noted above, private sector
participation in seed technology development has been stifled by existing monopolies of
public institutions. Newly introduced seed legislation will remove these monopolies and
allow the seed sector to develop. The ongoing fertilizer subsidy initiative has the potential
to evolve into a program that will encourage further private sector participation in input
markets and make fertilizer and complementary inputs available to more farmers at more
affordable prices. Improved timing of resource availability of such programs will reduce the
risk of late planting and/or late application of fertilizer by farmers, which could result in
significant yield reductions that could potentially render fertilizer use unprofitable.

91.     To improve input marketing and service delivery through the Government’s
fertilizer subsidy program in the short term, the existing public-private partnership
arrangement with the fertilizer industry will be strengthened. The current partnership
arrangement involves private sector fertilizer suppliers that import and distribute fertilizer

                                              37
to farmers for sale at agreed-upon prices. The Government pays an agreed-upon subsidy
component that is reimbursed to the companies after authorized sales have taken place. To
strengthen the program, guidelines for 2011 will be prepared in collaboration with the
fertilizer industry, setting out operational modalities, roles and responsibilities, including a
methodology for determining fertilizer prices for the 2011/12 season. The preparation of
operational guidelines in consultation with the private sector is a prior action that has been
met. Through an open tender, five companies have been identified as potential participants
in the program. As part of the planning and negotiation process, these companies have met
with MoFA staff to discuss and agree on the guidelines for the 2011 program, which will
continue to implement the so-called “waybill system” that ensures tracking of fertilizer
sales and subsequent accounting for payment of the subsidy component to the suppliers.

92.     Fertilizer alone is not the ‘silver bullet’, a fact that needs to be reflected in
future Government programs. To achieve the full productivity potential, fertilizer
application requires the use of improved seed varieties, including the introduction of hybrid
seed, and good farm management skills. Hence, a holistic approach is required that goes
well beyond fertilizer subsidies. Various development agencies, including IFDC and
AGRA, have been supporting a private sector network of some 3,000 agro-dealers as well
as the Ghana Agro-input Dealer Association (GAIDA), the latter providing training and
certification. IFDC has indicated that it will support any Government efforts that aim to
strengthen the level of service and expand the product range provided by agro-dealers.

93.     MoFA, in close consultation with stakeholders, will design a program that will
promote fertilizer use in conjunction with certified seed and extension. The design
phase will focus on: (i) identifying the constraints that explain low use of certified seed,
both traditional/local and hybrid varieties; (ii) identifying opportunities for the promotion of
seed, fertilizer and extension for specific crops; and (iii) identifying distribution modalities
and assessing the potential of focusing the subsidy program on the use of fertilizer in
combination with certified seed varieties to achieve yield gains. As MoFA’s fertilizer
subsidy program evolves into a comprehensive agricultural input support program, the
existing PPP arrangement may be expanded to include the seed industry and service
providers. The design of an agricultural input support program for 2012 will be informed by
findings of a review of 2010 and 2011 fertilizer subsidy programs and is a trigger for
AgDPO 4. The PPP will be an appropriate platform to clarify the policy environment over
the medium term and agree on the direction and ingredients of the agricultural input support
program.

94.     In the medium term, adjustments to the agricultural inputs policy will be
required once the uptake of fertilizer and seed technology starts to result in productivity
gains that in turn translate into increased effective demand for commercially priced inputs
among commercially viable farmers. Under that scenario, the program’s focus could be on
the commercial viability of input markets, which may justify an exit or downsizing strategy
of the subsidy element, and possibly a sustained emphasis on market facilitation and farm
extension. For those farmers who will ultimately not have ‘graduated’ to become
commercially viable, alternative support measures may need to be developed, possibly as
part of a social safety net program.

                 Policy Area 2: Market and Value Chain Development

Policy Objective: Increased participation of smallholders

95.      To increase incomes, farmers need to be integrated into commercial value
chains rather than depend on haphazard and unpredictable market opportunities.
Average farm sizes are very small, and the ability by individual farmers to bring produce to
market, and have the knowledge and information of what to produce for the market, is
highly constrained. Integration into value chains requires coordination amongst small-
holders. To build farmers’ ability to engage in business ventures with commercial firms will
require a capacity development and facilitation effort. There is scope for the Government to
strengthen the role and functioning of farmer-based organizations (FBOs), both through
capacity building and actively facilitating FBOs to be included in commercial out-grower
and contract-farming enterprises. The recently-launched FBO registry can serve as a
mechanism for rolling out a pilot needs assessment among FBOs in 10 districts to guide a
facilitation and capacity building approach that will make smallholder farmers ‘investor-
ready’. This facilitation approach will eventually be institutionalized. Out-grower capacity
building efforts will require mainstreaming into MoFA’s program and budget. GTZ has
provided assistance to the FBO registry and IFPRI has been analyzing the characteristics
and performance of FBOs. MoFA will need to establish a functioning registry, with an on-
line portal, and to engage extension staff or commission consultants to undertake the needs
assessment.

96.     Many agribusiness companies depend largely on smallholder output, and it is
in their interest to establish sustainable business models. These companies will require
formal engagement with rural communities to acquire land, set up out-grower
arrangements, and establish a business that derives an important element of its efficiency
and competitiveness from the rural community in the form of a predictable raw material
supply chain. The creation of such business ventures calls for a dedicated investment
promotion and facilitation effort, including further developing and implementing the ‘land
bank’ approach that seeks to provide investors with suitable land and tenure security. Land
bank initiatives will be launched, involving Customary Land Secretariats, for the
identification of land for out-grower investments, leading to signed land leases.

97.     A comprehensive approach for out-grower investment promotion is required,
encompassing the above elements of facilitation and capacity building at farmer and
investor levels, also adopting the Principles of Responsible Agricultural Investments that
promotes equitable and sustainable business practices. The FBO registry can serve as a
mechanism for fostering out-grower and contract farming schemes by linking interested
investors with capable farmer groups. Facilitating the contract farming and out-grower
arrangement coincides with the Commercial Agriculture Project, so all the technical work
on e.g. an out-grower framework will be supported by that operation. The design of land
bank activities and the out-grower investment framework will be accomplished through the
provision of TA as part of the Commercial Agriculture Project and the Land Administration
Project.

98.    The provision of commercial finance for investments in agriculture remains a
key constraint. Commercial lending is mostly short-term and features interest rates that are
prohibitively high (currently around 20 percent), all of which reflects the high perceived

                                            39
risk of lending to the sector as compared to other sectors or to the government. Commercial
banks typically have a lack of technical understanding of agribusiness enterprises, which
also prevents risk management instruments, such as insurance products, forward
contracting, and collateral management solutions, from being applied and institutionalized.
Even those banks that have risk management instruments available to them, as well as
donor-funded loan guarantee mechanisms, still charge well above the Bank of Ghana’s
monetary policy rate of 13.5 percent.49

99.      Government and DPs are responding to these constraints. AGRA has introduced
a ‘first loss’ loan guarantee that covers 10% of a maximum $25 million loan portfolio with
Stanbic Bank. However, loan disbursements to date have been slow. MoFA, with the
assistance from KfW, is in the process of establishing an Out-grower Value Chain Fund
(OVCF) that will support out-grower activities and expand processing and marketing
capacity. A key feature of the fund is that it meets the needs of agricultural investors who
require medium to long term credit for plantation development, irrigation infrastructure,
pack houses, storage facilities, roads, and processing plants. The OVCF is funded through a
loan from KfW to the Bank of Ghana. The BoG makes funds available to any participating
bank that decides to lend to outgrower-related entities for a minimum of 3 and a maximum
of 7 years. Commercial interest rates charged to farming and processing operations equal
BoG base rate plus 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent respectively. These rates have been agreed
upon with the potential participating banks. Currently, loans to the agricultural sector by
commercial banks rarely exceed a 24 month term. The size of the fund is 32 million Euro
and will be operated by a third party professional fund manager. Although poverty
reduction is an important criterion for the fund, the commercial viability of any loan
application is critical. The World Bank has been involved at the conceptual stage of the
development of the fund through the sector working group and its financial sector discourse
encouraging a commercial approach through outsourcing of fund management and utilizing
commercial banks. The Bank has carried analytical work that confirms that no medium-
long term funding for agriculture is offered by commercial banks at present. The Bank will
remain engaged in monitoring the operations and ensuring that the procedures and
eligibility criteria follow the principles of responsible investment in agriculture.
Establishment of the Out-grower Value Chain Fund is a prior action that has been met.

100. The Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund (EDAIF) will be
another source of agricultural finance. The fund was announced in the 2011 budget and
it will be operational for agribusiness investments in 2012. This has been identified as a
trigger for AgDPO 4.

101. A review of the fiscal incentive structure for investments in agriculture may
identify opportunities. Current incentives include corporate tax-free holidays and other
profit-dependent discounts. However, a recent business climate review (need reference)
found that investors would prefer pre-loaded tax incentives, such as tax-free importation of
capital goods and other measures that can increase the survival chances of a new venture,
and would rather be taxed once the business was established and profitable.



49
   A representative of a leading agribusiness firm narrated how a commercial bank that has access to a donor-
funded loan guarantee facility still charged high rates, and how a more competitive rate was offered by partly
state-owned Agriculture Development Bank.

Policy Objective: Improved performance of grain markets

102. Post harvest losses and a lack of market transparency can be overcome by
supporting the development of structured trading mechanisms. The poor quality of on-
farm storage and the high cost of rented storage mean that many farmers are unable to store
their grain and are forced to sell after harvest before prices increase. In addition to normal
seasonal price variability, intra- and inter-seasonal price volatility caused by a lack of
market transparency, market uncertainty, and resulting inefficiency increases price risk and
undermines investment decisions throughout the value chain.

103. To increase private sector investment, improve market efficiency and reduce
price volatility, Government’s endorsement and support are required to develop a
Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) that will: (a) provide a market place for farmers; (b)
encourage stockholding; (c) stimulate trade; (d) improve market transparency and price
discovery; and (e) provide collateral to leverage commercial credit. The WRS is now driven
by the private sector in the form of the recently established Ghana Grains Council (GGC),
representing FBOs, traders, and processors, some of whom will be managing eight certified
warehouses during the pilot phase. Five banks have expressed interest in the scheme, and
GGC is working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to identify legislation
requirements. In addition, the Government has expressed an interest in establishing a
Commodity Exchange, which would be a logical next step after the successful
implementation of the WRS. The implementation of a Warehouse Receipt System pilot has
been agreed upon by MoFA and the Ghana Grains Council. A WRS Joint Monitoring
Committee has been formed to guide and support the development of the WRS. The
committee has had its inaugural meeting, marking the launch of the pilot. The launch of the
WRS pilot is a prior action that has been met. Further design of the warehouse receipts
system will require technical and legal work, some of which is currently provided by the
ACDI/VOCA-USAID-funded ADVANCE program. This is underway and should be
supported as appropriate.

104. In support of private sector development in grain markets, transparency will
be provided by disseminating the operational procedures of the National Food Buffer
Stock Company, including the setting out the modalities for buffer stock procurement and
conditions of deployment of food reserves before and during the marketing season. This has
been identified as a trigger for AgDPO 4.

105. There should be a focus on analytical work, in line with joint sector review
recommendations, being supported by IFPRI and the Bank. Interventions by the
Government in grain markets may potentially exacerbate market unpredictability and may
increase risk along the value chains. Government has launched a buffer stock program with
that is ostensibly about price stabilization and disaster preparedness, but incorporates
elements of ‘buyer of last resort’ for the staple food grains maize and rice, including a
guaranteed (floor) prices, for farmers. While modest in scale to date (mainly because of
fiscal constraints), a large and poorly managed scheme has the potential to generate
substantial distortions in the market and retard private investment in storage, trading, and
processing, thereby exacerbating the problems it is trying to solve.

106. The analytical work and sector consultations will form the basis for an updated
food marketing and buffer stock policy, aimed at providing incentives for private sector

                                             41
participation in food markets and processing, while maintaining provisions for emergencies,
preferably utilizing market-based mechanisms.

                       Policy Area 3. Irrigation and Other Infrastructure

Policy Objective: Improved irrigated agriculture

107. The irrigation policy that was finally approved in June 2010 marks a new
beginning for irrigation development in Ghana. The policy emphasizes the role of
private, non-state actors in the development and management of large and small scale
irrigation schemes, which is important if irrigation is expected to play a pivotal role in
increasing productivity and supporting agricultural development in Ghana. The creation of
PPPs in large scale, capital intensive irrigation ventures will further enhance private
investments in agriculture, such as the ones envisaged for the Commercial Agriculture
Program. The priority of investing in inland valley development is also recognized. These
measures will make an important contribution to improving performance of the water
management sector, which is currently poor with low coverage, inefficient use of existing
schemes, and low productivity. Less than 2 percent of the land is under formal irrigation.
The land intensity ratio50 is less than one, indicative of dysfunctional schemes and/or
schemes located in inappropriate locations. Early reforms of the state apparatus remain
partial and ineffective.

108. GIDA is gradually reforming its approach by shifting attention to inland valley
development and informal schemes through (i) establishing a database of such schemes as
a basic needs assessment in order to prioritize subsequent interventions; and (ii) engaging in
joint management arrangement with functional WUAs to transfer responsibility to users
while retaining technical backstopping function. Other interventions in irrigation are the
provision on credit of pumps to farmers alongside major rivers and the drilling of boreholes
for inland farmers.

109. To achieve improved performance of the irrigation sector, MoFA has prepared
draft regulations that accommodate new public-private irrigation management
structures. The revised regulations will constitute an important step forward in that they
encourage farmers to take responsibility for the upkeep of infrastructure, and allow larger
scale public-private partnerships to develop. The regulations also address important issues
of land allocation within irrigated areas. The submission of draft new irrigation regulations
(replacing Legislative Instrument No. 1350 (2010)) on the shared responsibilities of
operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes is a prior action that has been met. The
draft new regulations have been submitted by the Minister of Food and Agriculture to the
Ministry of Justice and Attorney General for legal drafting and publishing.

110. Reflecting the irrigation policy, a new irrigation sector master plan will be
prepared, outlining, inter alia, implementation modalities of PPPs for irrigation
investments, the role of Water User Associations (WUAs) in operation and management of
irrigation schemes, and institutional reforms that are required. Pre-feasibility studies of key
irrigation schemes that have commercial potential will be prepared and presented to
investors. The approval of the new irrigation sector master plan is a trigger for AgDPO 4.
50
  This is the ratio of the area cropped divided by the command area of the scheme. Full utilization of the
scheme for double cropping – i.e. efficient use of the infrastructure – would yield a ratio of 2.

                                                      42
The new master plan will make recommendations on the restructuring of the Ghana
Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), recognizing the role of farmers, private
investors, and specific irrigation needs and potential in geographical zones, notably the
North.

111. Investments in rural road infrastructure are essential and need to be
prioritized. To ensure optimum allocation of scarce resources for capital-intensive
investments in road infrastructure, priorities for feeder road investments are to be agreed
upon by the Ministry of Roads and Highways and Ministry of Food and Agriculture.

                                  Policy Area 4. Fisheries

Policy Objective: Improved management of the fisheries sector

112. Ghana’s fisheries sector is in need of drastic measures to protect it from
further decline. Ghana is endowed with significant and valuable stocks of fish, leading to a
tradition and culture of fishing as strong as any other nation in West Africa. Including
aquaculture, the country produces some 440,000 tons of fish from its waters each year,
worth some US$790 million. In terms of the overall economy, the fisheries sector accounts
for at least 4.5 percent of GDP. Furthermore, as many as 2.2 million people are dependent
on the fisheries sector for their livelihoods, including some 135,000 fishers in the marine
sector (of which 92 percent are artisanal fishers). It is estimated that a further 71,000
artisanal fishers operate in Lake Volta. These figures underscore the prominent role that
fisheries currently play in the Ghanaian economy, as they have done for many generations
past. The Fisheries Commission has been empowered by the Government to manage the
sector. The Commission’s Secretariat is housed at MoFA.

113. Given the importance of the sector to the country's economic growth and to
livelihoods, the current evidence of declining returns from the fisheries in Ghana is
alarming. The average income received per canoe in Ghana's important artisanal fishery
has dropped by as much as 40 percent over the last decade. These losses often fall on the
most vulnerable, as many of the coastal communities are based in rural areas that have thus
far remained at the margin of the country's economic growth. Nationally there is little or no
surplus of income over expenditure in Ghana's capture fisheries and where some
profitability remains it is being lost. Taking into consideration Government subsidies to the
sector, it is likely that Ghana is paying more to catch and produce fish than they are worth.
There is therefore a real risk that current GDP contributions from this sector are
unsustainable into the future.

114. Control of access to fisheries resources requires management and enforcement
measures. The root cause of the declining profitability of Ghana's fisheries lies in the
challenge that the Government needs to control access to the resources, so to avoid that
there are too many vessels competing to catch too few fish, with little incentive to invest in
management and value addition. Controlling access requires effective resource
management. However, public sector investment to date has been negligible. Fisheries
management expenditure in Ghana (0.2 percent of total income from the sector) is less than
2 percent of average expenditure in OECD countries (i.e. 17 percent of revenue).



                                             43
115. Despite the fact that the Fisheries Act was passed in 2002, no regulations were
issued to implement the Act. There is a need for regulatory measures that define offenses,
and identify enforcement modalities. A first set of Fisheries Regulations can form the basis
for the regulatory framework needed to improve the management of the fisheries sector.
The issuance of the Fisheries Regulations is a prior action that has been met. A new
Legislative Instrument (LI 1968) was issued by the Minister of Food and Agriculture and
came into force on 3 August 2010. However, the Regulations could have benefited from
further refinement prior to approval, including on the various issues raised by the World
Bank. Due to pressure from the fishing community, who had waited for eight years for the
Regulations, the Government submitted them to Parliament for approval before taking on
board suggestions for refinement. It would therefore be necessary to further review and
improve the regulations in order to ensure full implementation of the Fisheries and
Aquaculture Sector Development Plan. Completion of this additional review exercise
will be a trigger for AgDPO 5. The Ghana Fisheries Project which is currently in
preparation may contribute towards this process of improvements to the Regulations in the
context of the broader review of the legal framework for fisheries.

116. The Ghana Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector Development Plan (2010 - 2015)
will require approval by Cabinet before it can be implemented. The plan has a phased
approach, raising awareness of all stakeholders on the key steps and their potential benefits,
and registering and licensing all fishing vessels in Ghana over the 5 year period. Actions
and costs of implementing the plan will be supported by Ghana Fisheries Project, and by
other development partners. Expected outcomes from a revitalized fisheries sector in Ghana
include: improved sector governance and robust fisheries governance institutions;
environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically profitable fish resources;
reduced illegal fishing through strengthened monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of
fisheries licenses and regulations; and increased value added benefits from fish resources
captured by the country. Approval of the plan is a benchmark for AgDPO 3. The Plan has
undergone stakeholder consultations and is in the process of being finalized by MoFA
before submission to Cabinet.

117. The policy triggers are relevant to the implementation of the Government's
new Development Plan, by supporting formal adoption of the plan and preparation of the
necessary legal and regulatory framework for the issuance of licenses to the canoe fleet and
making these licenses transferrable. Registration and licensing of the fleet is the first and
most essential step in closing access to the resources and restoring profitability and
sustainability to the sector. Registration and licensing, and measures to restrict entry among
the industrial and semi-industrial fishing vessels have been identified as a trigger for
AgDPO 4. Enforcement of the fisheries law, health and safety laws, and licensing
requirements is expected to curtail any illegal operation of trawl vessels by revoking or not
renewing licenses among vessels that are not in compliance. This important enforcement
measure has been identified as a possible trigger in AgDPO 5.

                           Policy Area 5. Sector Coordination

Policy Objective: Enhanced delivery of agriculture sector investment program

118. Ghana has adopted a "New Approach to Public Sector Reform", which seeks
to focus reforms on results, particularly the delivery of the Government's main

                                             44
priorities for (i) job creation; and (ii) food production, distribution and processing.
The impetus for the reform is being led from the center of Government, by the Presidency
and through the strengthening of collective cabinet level coordination, while recognizing
that implementation will continue to be the responsibility of the line Ministries that
typically already have well articulated sector strategies. These sector strategies are largely
consistent with the two main priorities and are supported by Ghana's main international
partners. The new approach emphasizes the need for greater coordination of the
Government's activities, combined with mechanisms to encourage greater performance and
accountability amongst senior managers, combined with innovative partnerships with the
private sector that could help to ease the binding financial constraints.51

119. In a similar manner, the CAADP framework and the sector investment
program, METASIP, call for multi-MDA coordination and private sector involvement
to ensure delivery. The METASIP governance structure provides a management, research
(SAKSS), and dialogue mechanism compatible with the continental CAADP framework.
The CAADP Country Team’s Steering Committee in Ghana is named the METASIP
Steering Committee, representing an expanded group of CAADP Compact signatories as
sector stakeholders, and will oversee and manage the METASIP implementation process.
The establishment of the CAADP governance structure is a prior action and has been met.
The METASIP Steering Committee was inaugurated during the quarterly Agricultural
Sector Working Group meeting held on 16 February 2011 in Accra. Support through the
NEPAD CAADP structure is forthcoming in the form of assistance to SAKSS (through
IFPRI) and an agriculture sector PER exercise (through the Bank).

120. To complement these coordination efforts, sector-wide resource allocation,
budgeting, and expenditure tracking need to be strengthened. MoFA recently
concluded its own Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) of the sector. While
the system is sufficiently robust for successful implementation of a budget support
instrument, a number of areas for improvement could increase the impact of resources
flowing through governmental systems. Of particular concern is the lack of a system that
defines and identifies agriculture spending across MDAs. Also of concern is the declining
proportion of spending on services and investments in the MoFA budget. The combined
share of items 3 and 4 in the MoFA discretionary budget has declined from 39 percent in
2008 and 42 percent in 2009 to 34 percent in 2010 and 22 percent in 2011. This decline can
in part be explained by the introduction of the single spine salary structure, causing the
resource envelope required to meet personal emoluments to escalate. However, the
implementation of METASIP requires increased resource commitments by Government in
support of investment priorities, and the recent decline of the investment and services
budgets would therefore need to be addressed in that context.

121. An agriculture expenditure budget and tracking system will not only introduce
consistency in accounting, it will also provide a mechanism that promotes greater
inter-MDA coordination on priority setting and budgeting. This effort is currently being
supported by the Bank-administered NEPAD PER exercise that supports the CAADP
implementation process. The system will provide the critically important mechanism for
sector coordination and resource allocation and is a trigger for AgDPO 4. It will also

  At the invitation of the President’s Office, the World Bank’s Global Expert Team on public sector
performance held discussions with MDAs within GoG and presented its recommendations in November 2010.

                                                 45
provide an important management tool for the proposed multi-MDA oversight committee
of the MoFA Commercial Agriculture Program (that includes the Bank-funded Commercial
Agriculture Project). It will ultimately produce sector performance reports, evaluating
sector-wide budget allocation and expenditure, and reporting on sector outcomes.52 In
addition to the establishment of agriculture budget and expenditure tracking systems,
capacity needs to be developed within Government for assessing the impact of investments
and interventions, a process that feeds back into program design and budgeting.

122. A summary of the Prior Actions and the overall Policy Matrix for AgDPO 3 are
provided in Tables 9 and 10 below. The policy matrix includes, for completeness, the
triggers for AgDO 4 and AgDPO 5.

                             A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
123. Agricultural growth remains central for poverty reduction. As reported in the
Program Document for AgDPO 1, the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of the
government’s overall agricultural component of the GPRS II identified the most relevant
aspects of the overall strategy from the point of view of poverty and social impacts, and those
policy objectives that risked undermining the status of already disadvantaged groups. The
PSIA on Agriculture identified five categories of farmers: (i) Large Scale Commercial (LSC);
(ii) Small Commercial (SC); (iii) Semi-Commercial (S-C); (iv) Non-Poor Complex Diverse
Risk Prone (NPCDR); and (v) Poor Complex Diverse Risk Prone Farmers (PCDR). The
weakness of FASDEP I, in terms of targeting, was that it failed to recognize the different
categories of farmers and that smallholders are not a homogenous group.

124. The revised FASDEP has responded to the PSIA findings by focusing both on
growth and on poverty, and addresses regional differences in agricultural growth. In the
short-term to medium term, selected commodities (in particular staple crops) are to be
targeted to improve food security and promote income diversification, based on comparative
and competitive advantages, promoting sustainable land management approaches given that
many of the poorer areas are also challenged by difficult agro-ecological conditions. In
addition, smallholder commercialization and linkages to industry for selected indigenous
agricultural commodities has been recognized as a strategy for poverty reduction.

125. It will be important to monitor the impact of policy areas supported by the DPO
on poverty reduction, and a PSIA should be carried out during the course of this
programmatic series. The PSIA should be consultative in nature, involving sector
stakeholders and the existing coordination and consultation mechanisms (including the
METASIP Steering Committee) building on the consultations carried out during the revision
of the FASDEP. The PSIA will use analytical work undertaken by various stakeholders
(including under existing projects in the sector and qualitative or quantitative assessments
done by civil society organizations) and identify how the policy areas supported by the DPO
series are impacting the rural poor, including potential impacts on addressing regional
disparities. It is anticipated that the upcoming Agricultural Census will provide an opportunity
to gain important insights at the household level. The impact of interventions such as the
fertilizer subsidy and future efforts to include other inputs should also be measured. The PSIA
will recommend changes in policy direction as determined by the analysis.

126. At the policy level, METASIP incorporates two notable innovations in
Government policy on targeted beneficiaries. The first is the increased emphasis on the
food crops sector. The second is the parallel effort to scale-up sizeable investments in
commercial agriculture and for these to include out-grower arrangements. Some of the large-
scale commercial farms were identified in the original PSIA which recommended that in
pursuing commercial opportunities, links to small-holders be made.

127. With regard to the specific measures of the operation, positive poverty and social
impacts are expected and while the operation does not have an explicit regional focus, the
operation contributes to the Government’s efforts to target regional disparities. First, by
focusing on measures to improve the productivity of food crops the target beneficiaries are, by
implication, poor small-holder farmers. They dominate the food crop sector; these farmers are

                                              56
the primary beneficiaries of the public extension system and they also suffer the most severe
post-harvest losses. Second, poor subsistence farmers depend more heavily on FBOs – larger
enterprises have sufficient critical mass and managerial capacity themselves – and an
improved legislative environment will promote accountability within these organizations.

128. Given the gendered division of labor in Ghana’s agriculture, gender aspects will
require specific attention. Market access, access to finance, adoption of seed and fertilizer
technology, and the uptake of warehouse receipts are all areas with distinct gender
dimensions. To the extent possible, gender analysis will be incorporated in a number
programs and entities, such as the WRS, water user associations, the OVCF, and more
generally the out-grower schemes. In addition, the new Irrigation Policy that is supported
through the DPO includes provisions relating to women's participation. The manual for
accessing the FBO Development Fund (which was an instrument supported under a
completed agric sector investment project, and which still is used as a framework for
determining what FBOs should look like), "preference is given to groups with representation
of women". Moreover, the District-level FBO Development Fund Steering Committees must
include women representation.

129. Government interventions supported under the operation display a strong focus
on addressing the development challenges of the North. Support to the distribution of
agricultural inputs, by virtue of the focus on food commodities, have covered the northern
regions extensively. The upcoming Commercial Agriculture Project will encompass the
Northern Breadbasket Strategy, and strengthen the capacity of the Savanna Accelerated
Development Authority (SADA).

130. Subsistence farmers are most dependent on rain-fed agriculture, often adopt
unsustainable agricultural practices, and are most at risk from increased weather
variability induced by climate change. Therefore, measures to promote sustainable land
management practices and more efficient and extensive use of small-scale irrigation schemes,
e.g. through inland valley water development, will be of direct benefit. The development and
distribution of drought-tolerant seed varieties is another important aspect of climate change-
related risk management.

131. The magnitude of the fertilizer subsidy in the Government’s program warrants
special attention. The government is committed to scale up the program while improving its
efficiency. If successful, the program has the potential to provide real benefits to small-
holders through improved productivity in key food staples. (These programs typically do not
help the extreme poor who are unable to access even subsidized fertilizer and/or those unable
to farm.) However, as discussed below, the risk displacement of resources from genuine pro-
poor interventions because of escalating costs of the subsidy should be taken into
consideration.

                               B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
132. With reference to OP8.60, the policy measures supported by the operation are
not expected to have significant effects on the environment. There may be beneficial
effects arising from actions aimed at strengthening the management of land, soil and water
and the promotion of good agricultural practices, as per Policy Areas 1, 2 and 3. The low use
of fertilizer is currently causing severe soil nutrient depletion, and increased fertilizer use
combined with improved soil management would contribute to the restoration of soils and the

                                              57
improvement of soil fertility. Also, agricultural intensification would likely result in reduced
encroachment on forests. Improved fisheries management under Policy Area 4 will result in
conservation of fish stocks. The FASDEP policy, as reflected in the METASIP, states the
importance of improving the implementation of sector environmental impact assessments and
strengthening land and water management. This has a bearing not just on environmental
resources and services but also on the productivity of the sector itself and on the well-being of
the people of Ghana. Food safety, good agricultural practices (including careful use of
pesticides, fertilizer, hygienic practices), soil and water management will be emphasized in
policy dialogue and the implementation of the FASDEP through METASIP. A fundamental
focus is on increasing productivity through improved agricultural practices, rather than
increasing production through area expansion. Careful implementation of government policy
will thus have positive effects on the environment.

133. Ghana has a robust environmental institutional framework and considerable
capacities to set environmental management standards. The main frameworks are the
1991 National Environmental Policy, the 1992 National Environmental Action Plan, and the
1994 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act. This framework laws give an adequate
reflection of the national environmental policy objectives, seeking to reconcile economic
development and natural resource conservation. The EPA has since the late 1980s adopted
environmental impact assessment as a management tool to screen undertakings likely to pose
adverse impact on the environment. Environmental screening and assessments became legal
requirements in 1999 with the promulgation of the Environmental Assessment Regulations
(Legislative Instrument 1652) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are applied to
most development projects. Procedures have been established to screen and evaluate all
development projects and programs that may have significant social and environmental
impacts. Under the country's Environmental Assessment Regulations (Legislative Instrument
1652), an EIA is mandatory for seventeen types of activities classified as critical. These
activities include: (i) mining; (ii) petroleum and gas field development and exploration; (iii)
construction of dams, harbors and roads; and (iv) logging and disposal of timber.

134. Sustainable management of Ghana's water and land resources is a critical factor
in sustained agricultural growth. The recognition of this is implicit in various national and
sector policies, strategies and action plans, including the National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP), the Soil Fertility Management Plan, the National Wildlife Policy, the Water Policy
and the National Irrigation Policy. The National Action Program to Combat Drought and
Desertification (NAP) provides a long-term strategy to address land degradation in affected
areas in Ghana. Sustainable natural resource management is an essential component of the
prevailing policy frameworks, including GSGDA, FASDEP II and NEPAD's CAADP. The
development of a Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy is included in the
FASDEP II as an important tool to implement the policy provisions of the Land Policy and
provide an opportunity to better integrate sustainable land management into the existing
policy frameworks. Equally important, the formulation of a Country Investment Framework
for SLM (CSIF) (a benchmark under the NREG DPO) would be an important tool to facilitate
dialogue and inter-ministerial planning around the cross-cutting issue of land degradation.
These are necessary to inform the goal, objectives and policy actions to facilitate increased
attention paid to sustainable land management in Ghana.

                   C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
135. The AgDPO 3 will continue to apply the good practice principles of conditionality
(Box 3). MoFEP and MoFA will be responsible for implementing this operation on behalf of
the Government. IDA will make the credit proceeds available to the Borrower upon: (i)
maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policy framework; (ii) implementation of the
overall program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (iii) completion of policy and
institutional actions as set forth in this Program Document.

136. Bank supervision will continue to be aligned with the activities of other donors, in
particular with CIDA, and with the sector monitoring activities. It will also be aligned the
implementation of the policies being supported by the EGPRS/PRSC/MDBS. MoFEP would
be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed budget support, together with
MoFA.

                          Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The Government of Ghana developed FASDEP II, on the basis of which the previous AgDPO series was agreed
to, and which continues to form the foundation for consultations on issues and challenges of promoting growth
and poverty reduction through agriculture. Ownership is strengthened through implementing the CAADP agenda
at the national level, evidenced by the Round Table, the signing of the Compact in October 2009 by all sector
stakeholders, and the development of the CAADP investment plan, METASIP, in 2010. The AgDPO is
structured explicitly as the Bank’s instrument for supporting CAADP and METASIP implementation, further
reinforcing national ownership.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The AgDPO is part of a concerted effort with DPs grouped around the FASDEP II and the sector investment
plan. The AgDPO aims at reducing the Government’s transaction costs in dealing with development assistance
by ensuring that the support is geared towards the sector strategy and investment plan. Mutual accountability is
strengthened by the MoFA-DPs Joint Sector Review as the forum for reaching consensus on sector performance
and priority measures moving forward.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The proposed operation will continue to increase the share of aid provided through general budget support while
helping to deepen sector level policy dialogue. Supporting the national policy and sector plan within the CAADP
framework diversifies accountability from a project-specific framework to one based upon progress in achieving
CAADP objectives. Notwithstanding current macroeconomic challenges, Ghana continues to be well placed to
adopt budget support instruments. By closing the previous series and starting this new series, the Bank is
responding strategically to changing political environment and emerging policy agendas.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The number of critical actions in the policy matrix for AgDPO 3 being supported by this operation is 10. These
were selected jointly by GoG for their importance in achieving sector objectives, and in order to demonstrate the
importance attached to these reforms within GoG. The policy matrix for the current operation reflects previous
advice to continue to streamline and strengthen prior actions to strategic critical measures.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The new AgDPO series is being aligned with the MoFA-DPs annual sector review process, which will monitor
CAADP implementation, and will be harmonized with the performance assessment of CIDA’s budgetary
support. The reviews will also draw on the MDBS/EGPRC assessments and will be aligned as far as possible
with the timetables of these assessments.



                                                       59
137. The actions to be monitored under the operation are extracted from government
policy and program documents (e.g., METASIP, FASDEP II, the FY2011 budget
statement, and the sector M&E matrix), ensuring this alignment and reducing the transaction
costs of managing budgetary support for the government. Reporting arrangements will
continue as laid out in AgDPO 1. During the period of implementation of the program
supported by the proposed DPO, supervision would draw on: (i) monthly reports on budget
expenditures with breakdown by MDA with a lag of no more than six weeks after the end of
each month, and with the breakdown for Items 1 - 4 of the Ghanaian budget (personnel,
administration, services, investment); (ii) quarterly reports on domestically financed poverty-
related (including financed expenditures financed by the two debt relief initiatives)53, with a
lag of no more than six weeks after the end of each month; (iii) sector progress reports; and
(iv) sector monitoring and evaluation reports.

                         Table 11. DPO Reporting and Responsibility Assignment
                                       Reporting                                           Responsibility
Monthly reports on budget expenditures with breakdown by Ministry, Department and          GoG (from PRSC)
Agency with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each quarter. These reports
will also present the breakdown for Items 1 - 4 of the national budget.
Monthly reports on domestically financed poverty-related (including HIPC financed          GoG (from PRSC)
expenditures), with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each quarter. These
reports would include a breakdown along main poverty-related expenditure programs
and a breakdown for Items 1 – 4 of the national budget (personnel, administration,
services, and investment).

Quarterly and Annual Sector Progress Reports (MoFA)                                        GoG
Monitoring and evaluation reports (MoFA)                                                   GoG

138. The Bank, with partners, will continue to support dialogue on critical policy
issues through the Development Dialogue series. The launch of the 2008 World
Development Report in Accra and Tamale signaled the Bank’s re-engagement with stake-
holders on critical policy and strategy issues in the sector. More recent experience with cross-
cutting themes such as the oil and gas forum (November 2009) reinforces the value of Bank-
sponsored events held on collaboration with Government and other stakeholders. More
recently principles of partnership were confirmed in participation in the CAADP Round Table
and will continue under this process.

139. The sector monitoring framework will continue to serve as the basis for
monitoring sector performance and therefore the results of this operation. The objectives
and targets in the proposed DPO series are aligned with the monitoring framework and are
consistent with FASDEP II objectives and METASIP program components. Expenditure
reporting will be obtained from Government’s submissions to CAADP, which are guided by
the definitions of what constitutes agriculture expenditure (which will be explored under the
AgDPO), as well as data from the Accountant General. There are systemic concerns over the
accuracy of agricultural statistics which feed the M&E system. IFPRI is helping Government
determine areas for improvement in the collection of key agricultural data, and it is expected
that the Bank’s proposed assistance to the national statistical capability under the Ghana
Statistics Development Program will incorporate a capacity building component.

140. The results framework for the new AgDPO will utilize the existing MoFA M&E
framework, but it will also draw on information from decentralized MDA units and the
private sector. The results framework will require updating on the baselines and the targets.
The ministry of agriculture will release 2010 data that will serve as the 2011 baseline in April
2011. With the baseline numbers in place, the targets will have to be calibrated to reflect the
METASIP targets. As such, some targets presented in the matrix will be adjusted.

141. The DPO will support the development of private sector development indicators
that will assist in measuring the impact of METASIP investments and interventions. The
emphasis on private sector development, involving out-grower companies, processors, input
suppliers, seed producers, and banks, as well as many farmers, will require a monitoring
approach that goes beyond national-level statistics. Such indicators could focus on private
investment levels, foreign and domestic, and may include indicators currently under
development by the Doing Agribusiness program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation.

                                    D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
142. The new AgDPO series is designed to enhance sector governance. Agriculture
spending is not well defined and resource allocation to MoFA is heavily skewed towards
personal emoluments and administration rather than investment and services. However, with
the finalization of METASIP, Government has committed to increasing its resource allocation
to investment and services, but this requires improved sector-wide coordination and financial
management. This process is supported by a sector-wide Bank-administered PER, followed
by the design of a methodology that will define and identify agriculture expenditure to
improve budgeting and tracking that is needed for the implementation of METASIP. In
addition, the program supported by the DPO specifically encourages increased private sector
participation and enhanced transparency and accountability in programs such as the fertilizer
subsidy program. Furthermore, the promotion of PPPs and, more generally, private
investment in line with the Principles for Responsible Agro-Investments as developed by the
Bank and other development partners are expected to generate demand for further
transparency and accountability. Support will be provided to the Government by the Bank to
resolve governance issues in the fisheries sector, notably by introducing enforcement of
regulations by third party operators.

143. Public financial management is solid enough to warrant the continuation of
Development Policy Operations. Analytical work undertaken by Development Partners in
collaboration with the Government highlighted the strong foundation being built towards
strengthening PFM in Ghana. PEFA 2010 and the ERPFM 2010 reports, as well as the IMF
FAD report of 2010 confirm that Ghana has built a solid legal and regulatory framework and
foundation for public financial management that performs at an average level and
occasionally above-average standards, see box below. Timeliness in financial reporting,
despite weaknesses in comprehensiveness and gaps in account reconciliation, has improved
markedly, and so were the quality and effectiveness of external audit, and its compliance with
international standards as well coverage. A strong Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee,
reinvigorated since 2009, is currently in place and its proceedings are open to the public and
on both print media and television. A further strengthening of this legislative oversight role,
including a more systematic and aggressive follow up on audit findings will support the
entrenchment of accountability and transparency within the public financial management
realm. Reform successes in the area of public procurement are also quite encouraging as
revealed by the PPA’s use of the Public Procurement Model of Excellence as a self-
assessment tool. As against a target of 80 percent set by EGPRC/MDBS for assessment of
performance of high spending entities in public procurement in 2008, actual performance
realized were 97.6 percent, 95.2 percent, and 81.6 percent respectively for (a) use of
appropriate procurement methods; (b) publication of tender notices; and (c) publication of
award of contracts. A lot more remains to be done in the area of improving public
procurement systems, however. Using the results of an analysis by the Bank, using the
OECD-DAC tool, it has been concluded that Ghana still needs to further improve the
efficiency of the national procurement systems by strengthening the legislative framework,
enhancing institutional development capacity, streamlining operations, and increasing
transparency.

144. But fiduciary issues remain in terms of budget execution. The implementation of
an effective cash management system, the treasury single account, and the full reinstatement
of commitment controls in all MDAs, will lower the risk of expenditure slippages and support
                                              66
the predictability of resource flows to MDAs. The planned transfer of subvented agencies’
payroll to the computerized human resource management system (IPPD-2) will also allow
closer monitoring of the public sector size and improved payroll management and the internal
controls associated with it. Improvements in account reconciliations will equally enhance the
credibility and reliability of the government financial statements.

145. Upgrading, stabilizing, and rolling-out of a fully Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) for budget management is critical to
sustaining success in both the maintenance of fiscal discipline and the effective and
timely monitoring of overall government finances. To this end, the Government has
initiated and approved a new PFM Improvement (Reforms) Charter – called the GIFMIS
Charter – that outlines the framework that the government has adopted, and seeks to
implement on a priority basis, aimed at reversing the key inherent weaknesses in its fiduciary
control environment. The Charter, whose implementation has now commenced through the
GIFMIS project, and has the full government ownership and unflinching commitment at the
highest level, will address the key challenges involved in the budgeting, accounting, and
reporting systems, processes, and practices across government. In addition, to support
improved cash management, the CAGD has implemented a form of ‘treasury realignment’
that provides for integrating the treasuries as part of the administrative control of MDAs and
MMDAs, while retaining the recruitment and posting powers of the core accounting staff.

146. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana in 2009. Under
the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to an
update assessment with respect to a new PRGF arrangement approved July 15 2009; the
assessment, completed on December 2, 2009, followed an initial safeguards assessment from
October 2003. The update assessment found that while the safeguards framework of the BoG
has been strengthened in several areas since then, new risks in governance oversight emerged
with the removal of the former Board in January 2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge,
in the start of the successor Board. Pending the resumption of Board activities some interim
measures have been introduced to provide an independent oversight mechanism. These
include the introduction of an Advisory Panel comprised of three outside members
responsible for the external and internal audit and controls systems. In March 2010, the
authorities have advised staff that a new Board has been appointed. They have also either
committed to or implemented all measures proposed by staff.

147. Overall fiduciary environment: Given the positive PFM improvements, overtime,
amid government’s unflinching commitment to reforms as exemplified by its adoption and
commencement of implementation of a Government-led PFM Reforms Charter (GIFMIS),
and as the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment indicates that Ghana has implemented or is in
the course of implementing the necessary reforms at the BoG, the overall fiduciary risk of the
operation is rated ‘modest’.

                           Box 4: Ghana’s Public Financial Management Systems
Credibility of the Budget. Actual primary expenditure compared with budgeted expenditure shows significant deviations at
both the aggregate level and at the level of individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Aggregate deviation
for 2008 was a high of 34.2% (exacerbated in 2009 by the large arrears that were partly paid in 2009 without a supporting
original budget as their existence and quantum was unknown at budget time). Resulting from the arrears brought forward
from 2008, the expenditure compositional variance for 2009 was also unfavorably impacted. Also, the largely ineffective
establishment control and commitment controls, complicated further by continuing unpredictable budget releases,
undermined efforts to maintain expenditure within budget ceilings. In essence the high expenditure arrears, discovered at
mid-term budget review (2009), have contributed immensely to further weakening the credibility of the budget.
Notwithstanding, the improved realism in revenue budgeting was however reported to have cushioned the impact of reduced
overall budget credibility.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. While the budget documentation is fairly complete, comprehensible
and comprehensive, and is made publicly available, the budget classification system was, up to 2009, not yet fully GFS
compliant and is incapable of directly supporting a functional outcome budget management process. This is notwithstanding
the fact that the categorization of the administrative classification elements allows some linkage to the National Development
Strategic Framework. Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations also requires improvement.
Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years – in as much as the approaches
instituted remain severely constrained – Ghana’s performance is held back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of
effective wage bill planning, the absence of a transparent link between planned and executed budget activities, and the lack
of an effective feedback mechanism. The underlying institutional arrangements to support a policy based budget process are
absent despite the adoption of a single stage coordinated budget process for recurrent and development budgets. In spite of
the underlying weaknesses in its implementation experience, the Government has adopted a three-year Medium Term
Expenditure Framework for its budgetary processes. Going forward, the government has committed itself to adopting and
implementing a program-based budgeting framework, commencing with a pilot for some MDAs for the fiscal year budget
2011.
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. While Ghana’s central government scores well overall with respect to
some aspects of revenue administration, debt management, payroll management and procurement, overall predictability and
control in budget execution remains an area of concern. The areas of concern include the discretionary elements of the legal
and regulatory framework for revenue management, the controls in the taxpayer registration system, the predictability in the
availability of funds for the commitment of expenditures, the extent of consolidation of the government’s bank cash balances,
the effectiveness of the establishment control, and the effectiveness of the commitment control. Cash management remains a
particular challenge to the PFM systems as well as the apparent lack of effective procurement planning as part of the budget
process. Although the legal and regulatory framework is clear on the controls for each of the main steps of the procurement
and expenditure cycle, these are not applied uniformly across all MDAs. The internal audit units are well structured although
their focus continues to include pre-audit functions as well – a factor that undermines their independence.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Within 4 – 6 weeks after each month-end, the CAGD-managed bank accounts are
reconciled, following clear guidelines and procedures contained in the Accounting Manual. For the other government
accounts, the retained IGF bank accounts, statutory funds, and those related to development partner funded projects, these
remain outside this arrangement. The retained IGF accounts are reconciled quarterly in some ministries but at least annually
for all in the preparation of the final accounts. Suspense accounts are also reconciled and cleared, but annually, as part of the
year-end closing of accounts. Data integrity however remains a source of concern, especially in the absence of full
consolidation of all government fund types. The monthly financial statements produced, within 4 – 6 weeks after month-end,
do not report on expenditure at the time of commitment but only when actual expenditures have been made. This form of
presentation permits only a partial (non-consolidated) comparison of revenues and expenditures to the original budget
appropriations. Timeless in preparing the Public Accounts (Consolidated Fund) is achieved as they are submitted within 3
months of end of fiscal year, and the accounts are largely consistent with the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial reporting. Accounting, recording, and reporting are predominantly paper-based.
External Scrutiny and Audit. Submission of audit reports to the legislature is now timely – within 3 months and 6 to 9
months after receipt of draft accounts for the consolidated fund and the MDAs’ accounts respectively. The scope and nature
of audits performed is satisfactory, although much of risk-based focus is required despite audits being largely compliant with
international standards. Effective follow up on audit reports is only just beginning. With procedures for review of budget
documentation by the legislature being firmly established and respected in terms of available review time, the scope of the
scrutiny as well as the failure in respecting the rules for in-year budget adjustments hampers performance against this PFM
dimension. Examination and completion of reviews of audit reports by the Public Accounts Committee remain untimely
notwithstanding the presence of a more aggressive parliamentary public accounts committee.

                              E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
148. Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed operation is a one-tranche IDA
credit of SDR 36 (US$57 million equivalent). The credit disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The administration of this credit
will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

149. Funds flow arrangements. The Government of Ghana shall identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with the Bank of Ghana and which forms part of the country’s official
foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed upon
meeting the agreed prior actions and upon credit effectiveness. The Ghana Cedi equivalent of
the funds in the Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated
Fund of the Government of Ghana, and the amount recorded appropriately in the financial
management system of the Government of Ghana.

150. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Ghana shall
not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be
needed. The proceeds of the credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in
the negative list as defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of
the credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the
Financing Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA
upon such request shall be cancelled from the credit.

151. Assurance Requirements. Based on the modest fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the credit in terms of
a requirement for an audit. However, within seven days of the disbursement of the credit by
IDA, the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning Ghana shall
provide a written confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Ghana Cedi equivalent of
the credit into the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Ghana, the number of
the account, the date of the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the credit
currency into Ghana Cedi, and confirming that the said amount has been appropriately
accounted for in the recipient’s financial management system. In addition, as the Controller
and Auditor General Department is required by law to submit its annual report and the audited
accounts on the public consolidated fund to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the
fiscal year, a copy of the said reports and accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month
after the lapse of the 6 month period. The Government shall equally ensure that the annual
entity financial statements of the Bank of Ghana (BoG), audited in accordance with
international standards on auditing as promulgated by the International Federation of
Accountants, are publicly available.

152. The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the receipt
and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the Borrower.
Upon the Association’s request, the Borrower shall: (i) have the account and the recording of
amounts of the credit into the Borrower’s budget management system audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently applied auditing
standards acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as soon as available,
but in any case no later than four months after the date of the Association’s request for such
audit, a certified copy of the audit report by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as
the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association such other
                                               69
information concerning the said account and recording of credit amounts into the budget
management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably
requested.

                             F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
153. As in many other countries, a departure from the prevailing agriculture policy
underpinning the AgDPO series may be a potential risk. The Government has endorsed
CAADP, has committed to spending 10 percent of its budget on the agriculture sector by
signing the Africa Union Maputo Declaration in 2003, has confirmed the sector investment
plan, METASIP, and has thus reaffirmed its commitment to achieving private sector-led,
Government-facilitated agriculture sector growth. However, Government has commenced a
number of programs that are characterized by direct interventions in markets that could
otherwise be developed and operated by the private sector, such as the fertilizer subsidy
program and the block farm program linked to food buffer stock operations. With the dual
objective of developing a private sector-led agriculture sector and to reduce the risk of policy
inconsistency, the DPO will assist the Government to remain consistent in its policies and
programs by further developing these programs to become financially and otherwise
sustainable by including the private sector and adopting market principles. The fertilizer
subsidy program has undergone positive changes in 2010 and is expected to improve further
with support provided under the DPO. In addition to the Bank’s support, the Agriculture
Sector Working Group and its Joint Sector Review, and the multi-stakeholder METASIP
Steering Committee with its policy dialogue function and SAKSS capability will make
important contributions towards mitigating the risk of policy inconsistency.

154. A prevailing risk is an uncertain macro-economic environment. As reported in
Section II, progress to correct macroeconomic imbalance is substantial, but risks remain. In
the short term, the fiscal deficit may further constrain already low agriculture sector resource
allocation. In the medium term, poorly managed oil revenues could undermine agriculture
sector growth. These risks are being mitigated by Bank support that addresses the fiscal
deficit (i.e. EGPRS and a new PRSC) and through an IMF program. Management of oil
revenues in the medium term requires continued policy consistency and continued dialogue,
as discussed above. In the context of shrinking fiscal space, risks of declining Government
allocations to MoFA should be protected as part of the efforts to preserve pro-poor spending.
It is noteworthy that according to the Government’s own classification over 80 percent of
MoFA spending is pro-poor compared to an average across all Ministries, Departments and
Agencies of just 25 percent. Furthermore, at less than 3 percent of total government spending
and with under-spending relative to objectives for agricultural growth, MoFA’s allocation
offers little scope for budgetary savings.

155. Weaknesses in PFM undermine the effectiveness of Government spending and
risk weakening the expected outcomes from sector budget support. This is a risk across
all MDAs and is being effectively mitigated by substantial support to roll-out improved
financial management systems. Annual ERPFMs provide updated diagnostics and
recommended priority reforms are incorporated in the MDBS policy framework. At the sector
level, risks are mitigated through MoFA-specific diagnostics (i.e. the Bank-administered
NEPAD support to CAADP budget implementation, including a sector-wide PER and the
development of a methodology that identifies, budgets, and tracks sector-wide agriculture
expenditure, and measures impact), measures to restore and improve oversight systems (e.g.
the various budget and procurement committees, as called for under the CIDA budget
                                              70
support) and ongoing technical assistance to the MoFA Financial Controller’s Office from the
Government of Japan.

156. Ghana’s exposure to climate change is a risk that is managed by implementing the
mitigation strategy of the WB/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR). Ghana is one of the 20 WB/GFDDR priority countries and a comprehensive
Disaster Risk Management Country Program is being implemented by the Government.
Coordination is required to ensure that the policy objectives supported under the AgDPO are
supportive of the Disaster Risk Management Country Program.

157. Finally, a key objective of the AgDPO is to contribute to improved harmonization
and alignment which could be undermined without further progress towards the SWAp.
Implementation of CAADP, the signing of the Compact, and the implementation of
METASIP provides a clear mechanism for improved coordination, not just among donors but
a wider group of stakeholders. Completion of the SWAp is expected to deepen alignment and
harmonization among development partners’ activities in the sector.

                          Annex 3: FUND RELATIONS NOTE
                      Ghana—Assessment Letter for the World Bank

                                      December 30, 2010

Introduction

1.     This letter provides the IMF staff assessment of recent economic developments and
prospects in Ghana. It reflects discussions with the authorities during staff missions to Accra
in September and December 2010 relating to performance in 2010 under the ECF
arrangement and the government’s macroeconomic policies for 2011 and the medium term.
Discussions are continuing with the government on policies that could be supported by the
Fund under the ECF arrangement with Ghana.

2.      The ECF arrangement was approved on July 15, 2009, with access of SDR 387.45
million (105 percent of quota; about $600 million). Policies supported by the arrangement
focus on (a) fiscal consolidation to address large budget imbalances that emerged in 2007–08;
(b) reforms to budget institutions to help avoid future such slippages; and (c) development of
a policy framework for managing the transition to oil producer status. The first review under
the arrangement was delayed by discussions on budget policies for 2010 and was completed
with the second review on June 9, 2010.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Program Performance

3.       Some aspects of Ghana’s economic situation have improved over the past year. The
start of oil production in December 2010 was on schedule; growth appears to be recovering
robustly; gross reserve cover has been strengthened; key export prices remain high; and with
revisions to national income, Ghana’s debt-GDP ratio is more closely in line with peer
countries than earlier estimated.

4.      Ghana weathered the global financial crisis well, achieving growth of 4.7 percent in
2009, buoyed by favorable terms of trade and good rainfalls. For 2010, preliminary indicators
point to growth in the 5½-6 percent range, with a rebound in construction and strong growth
in business services. Consumer price inflation has stabilized at 9-9½ percent since June 2010,
in line with the Bank of Ghana’s end-2010 inflation target.

5.      Rebased national accounts were published in late-2010 following a review of the
underlying statistical methodology by IMF advisors. The revised data included upward
revisions approaching 1 percent to recent annual growth rates, and show the 2009 level of
nominal GDP as nearly 70 percent higher than earlier estimates. With the new data, GDP per
capita was about $1,100 in 2009 (formerly around $650), bringing Ghana into the lower
middle-income country grouping. With the start of oil production in 2011, GDP per capita is
projected to exceed $1,400.

6.      On the new national accounts, the fiscal deficit has been revised downwards in
relation to GDP. For example, the 2008 deficit formerly recorded as 14.5 percent of GDP is

                                               82
now shown as 8.5 percent of GDP. But this does not diminish the adverse economic impact of
Ghana’s large deficits. The new data do not detract from the macroeconomic instability that
emerged in 2008–09 on account of large deficits, or from the risks in delaying the move to
fiscal and debt sustainability.

7.      On the rebased accounts, the 2010 cash fiscal deficit is projected at 7.3 percent of
GDP, compared to an adjusted program target of 5.8 percent of GDP (Text Table 1).55
Revenue collections are projected to be broadly on track by end-2010, with the deficit over-
run reflecting shortfalls in grants (0.7 percent of GDP) as well as higher than budgeted
recurrent spending (1.0 per cent of GDP). At the same time, the government is projected to
have accumulated domestic arrears equivalent to about 1.6 percent of GDP as capital
spending on roads and energy projects ran above appropriated levels.

        1/ Program adjusted for loan and grant shortfalls/excesses.
        2/ Cash deficit plus new arrears accumulated, minus arrears settled.

8.     Reflecting these trends, the deficit widened on both a cash and commitment basis in
2010, marking a setback to the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts. This reflected
shortcomings in expenditure discipline, overly ambitious targets for restraining investment
spending, and delays in tightening policies in response to emerging fiscal pressures. The
government also noted that an unexpected slippage of budget support into 2011 provided no
opportunity to rein in the spending that these loans had been intended to finance, contributing
to new arrears accumulation.

9.      On the new national accounts, public financial liabilities at end-2010 are projected at
52 percent of GDP, comprising 44 percentage points of GDP of formal debt and 8 percentage
points of GDP in respect of domestic arrears and obligations for public enterprise debts.
Public debt (including arrears) is now broadly twice the level in 2006 after debt relief
(26 percent of GDP). An updated debt sustainability assessment shows Ghana to be at
somewhat lower risk of debt distress than in the assessment prepared for the June 2010 review
of the ECF arrangement. Assuming a successful multi-year reduction in the fiscal deficit and
with nonconcessional borrowing kept to modest levels, key indicators of debt distress are
55
  The original program target of 4.8 percent of GDP (cash basis) has been revised upwards to reflect higher than
programmed project loans and the associated foreign-financed investment outlays. This additional financing was
only partly offset by shortfalls in program/budget loans.

                                                       83
projected to remain well below threshold levels. A key improvement from the June 2010
assessment is in regard to the debt-GDP ratio, which now remains below the threshold, even
for standardized shocks to the baseline. This improvement reflects the lower starting point for
this indicator following the upward revision of the re-based national accounts.

10.     In the financial sector, private sector credit has been sluggish until recently, as banks
pulled back after a sharp rise in nonperforming loans. However, with signs of more robust
economic activity in 2010, currency growth picked up in the second half of the year, and a
modest strengthening is evident in private sector credit. Liquidity conditions remain
accommodating, reflecting Bank of Ghana policy easing during 2009–10 and as a result of
balance of payments inflows that have not been fully sterilized. Gross reserve levels rose to
$4.4 billion in November 2010 (about 3.3 months of imports of goods and services).

11.     Program performance has been favorable in regards to inflation and reserve cover, but
much less robust on the fiscal front. Fiscal deficit targets were missed through 2010, and end-
year targets are also expected to be missed for domestic arrears and net domestic financing.
Nonconcessional borrowing is reportedly within program limits, and data are being verified

12.      Macroeconomic projections for 2011–13 are provided in Tables 1–2. With a projected
rise in oil production to 80,000 barrels per day in 2011 and more than 110,000 in 2012, GDP
growth is projected to exceed 12 percent in 2011 and 8 percent in 2012. With spillovers from
the oil sector, the non-oil economy is projected to grow at around 6½ percent, notwithstanding
assumed tighter fiscal policies in 2011–12.


13.     Despite a small decline in the projected terms of trade, the balance of payments is
projected to remain strong, with buoyant gold and cocoa exports supplemented by the start of
petroleum exports. Private capital inflows are also projected to remain strong. Reflecting
these factors, gross reserves are projected to rise to around $5 billion at end-2011 (3.5 months
of import cover).

The 2011 budget and fiscal policies

14.     The attached macroeconomic projections assume that the government is successful in
its determination to re-launch its fiscal consolidation program in 2011–12, drawing on the
lessons from slippages in 2010. Oil revenues are projected to rise to about 2½ percent of GDP
in 2012–13, up from about 1 percent of GDP in 2011. This is reinforced by projected efforts
to boost tax effort from the non-oil economy (see below). Disciplined expenditure
management is assumed to keep overall outlays broadly unchanged in relation to GDP in
2011, notwithstanding higher interest and wage outlays and the need for a realistic provision
for capital spending. Modest reductions in spending relative to GDP are projected for
2012-13. Pending the completion of a plan for an upfront regularization of domestic arrears
and other liabilities (below), the projections in Table 1 show a phased multi-year clearance of

                                                84
arrears. Comprehensive front-loaded arrears regularization would be associated with a larger
fiscal deficit and a larger rise in debt in the short-term, but stronger fiscal balances in
subsequent years.

15.    In developing the near-term fiscal adjustment program, the government intends to
focus on four key themes, as outlined below:


   Stronger tax revenue performance. Tax revenues are equivalent to just 15 percent of
    rebased GDP, compared to ratios of 20–25 percent in peer countries. The initial tax yield
    from oil production has been revised down, largely reflecting higher than previously
    expected tax offsets in the initial years of production. The 2011 budget will strengthen
    revenue collections by delimiting and better controlling some tax exemptions, and by
    extending through 2011 the temporary national stabilization levy (corporate profit tax).
    To supplement the 2011 budget, the government has indicated its intention to boost
    revenue collections by additional measures yielding an additional 1.3 percent of GDP in
    2011.
   Strengthened public expenditure management. The continuing accumulation of
    domestic arrears is having a corrosive effect on budget discipline, private sector liquidity,
    and the loan books of the banking system. The government has indicated that it will
    reinforce expenditure management to minimize future arrears accumulation. The
    requirement for ministries, departments, and agencies to obtain commencement
    certificates before initiating spending has been reinforced by a Presidential Circular. The
    government is also requesting IMF technical assistance on arrears management and
    related public expenditure management issues as a priority in early 2011. They are also
    developing in cooperation with the IMF a comprehensive strategy to regularize the
    projected end-2010 balance of GHc 3.5 billion of domestic arrears and public obligations
    in regard of state enterprise debts, and plan to launch this clearance program during 2011
    after the necessary audits and verification processes. Fund staff have cautioned against
    using a new sovereign bond issue to clear domestic arrears until plans are developed to
    limit the domestic liquidity impact of bond-financed arrears payments.
   Careful public payroll management. The government believes that the budget wage
    provision for 2011 is adequate to finance the new “single spine” pay structure. The
    precise cost is subject to uncertainty, depending on how the 520,000 public sector
    employees are mapped from the old to the new pay structure and on the treatment of
    some former allowances, which will be integrated into base pay. To ensure that the new
    structure is affordable, the government will seek to minimize any additional cost
    pressures in the 2011 pay budget, including by maintaining existing pay relativities
    unchanged in the new pay structure to avoid any further steepening of the pay line in
    2011.
   Value-for-money in public investment and debt management. The government gives
    a high priority to strengthening Ghana’s infrastructure. Overall investment levels are not
    low, at least as a share of GDP and in comparison to peer countries. Accordingly, they
    intend first to explore the prioritization and efficiency of existing investment, including
    through the findings of the forthcoming World Bank Public Expenditure Review. If this
    review suggests that additional financing is needed, the intention, as a first resort, is to
    rely on domestic fiscal space created by a stronger tax revenue effort and future tax

                                              85
        income from the oil sector, supplemented by concessional loans from development
        partners (for which there remains a large undisbursed balance). Nonconcessional
        borrowing will be kept to low levels, focused on the commercial needs of the national oil
        company and a few high-priority government projects for which concessional financing
        is not available. A list of potential projects for nonconcessional financing, ranked by
        priority, has been discussed with Fund staff. A short-list of projects to proceed in 2011
        and 2012 will be finalized shortly, based on the agreed limits on nonconcessional
        borrowing under the adjustment program.
16.     The 2011 budget targets a fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP,56 corresponding to a
commitment basis deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP. This outcome, if achieved, would mark a
substantial improvement from 2010, though the deficit would remain higher than envisaged at
the time of the last ECF review (the commitment basis deficit was formerly projected as 2.5
percent of GDP in 2011). Discussions are continuing on the fiscal policies and fiscal targets
for 2011 and the medium term that could be supported under the ECF. The fiscal situation
will be strengthened relative to the budget by the proposed additional tax measures noted
above. At the same time, the realism of some expenditure allocations may need to be
revisited, and the budget does not yet reflect the impact of the comprehensive arrears
regularization exercise that is planned for 2011.

Structural reforms

17.        Progress on structural reforms has been mixed, as outlined below.

18.     Revenue and expenditure management. The roll out of the new automated financial
management system (GIFMIS) has faced technical delays and financing shortfalls. On
revenue administration, a substantial increase in the VAT threshold has been approved by
parliament, and a tax regime for small businesses will be developed shortly with IMF
technical assistance. The appointment of senior management in the new integrated revenue
authority is proceeding, albeit more slowly than planned. A study of tax exemptions led to a
narrowing of certain exemptions in the 2011 budget. The anticipated parliamentary passage in
early-2011of the Oil Revenue Management Bill will provide welcome clarity on the
associated fiscal regime.

19.      Payroll management. Migration of public agency staffing to the centralized public
payroll continues to lag, with ongoing discussions on some agency-specific allowances. As a
result, a considerable part of the public payroll continues to be paid to agencies as a lump
sum, without verifiable data on staffing, grade structures, etc. An independent audit of public
staffing on the centralized payroll is being contracted for 2011.

20.      Debt and project management. Good progress has been made in developing a debt
management strategy, which will be finalized in the coming weeks; and a framework for
appraising and prioritizing public investment projects and associated borrowing has been
developed and will be submitted for Cabinet discussion shortly. A new project evaluation unit
is also to be established in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

                                                           86
21.      Public enterprise reforms. In the state enterprise sector, the increase in power tariffs in
mid-2010 re-established cost recovery pricing, contributing to enhanced financial viability of
power generation and distribution companies. The announced intention to ensure quarterly
tariff reviews to sustain cost recovery pricing will be important to avoid new subsidy needs.
Transparency on the usage of oil revenues retained by the national oil company to finance its
commercial investments will be important to sustain confidence in oil revenue management.

Steps to address banking sector vulnerability

22.     The banking system remains vulnerable on account of high nonperforming loans,
excessive borrower concentration for a few banks, a high cost structure, and a strong public
presence in some banks, which hampers their commercial activities. Reflecting these factors,
the cost of borrowing remains high, particularly for small and medium borrowers. Stress tests
suggest that a few small banks are vulnerable to potential deterioration in their loan portfolios.
While the pick-up in economic activity is beneficial for banks, the planned resolution of
domestic arrears to contractors will be critical to reducing their nonperforming loans portfolio.

Risks and vulnerabilities

23.     Fiscal performance remains a source of major macroeconomic vulnerability. Unless
the fiscal deficit is substantially reduced in 2011 and beyond, it will be difficult to avoid
continued accumulation of domestic arrears and heavy borrowing from the banking system.
This would risk sapping the emerging growth recovery, and could rekindle the exchange rate
and inflation pressures seen in 2008.

24.     Key risks relate to weak program implementation and shortcomings in expenditure
management. The authorities’ expressed commitment to a more forceful approach to tax
revenue mobilization, public expenditure control, and payroll management is welcome.
However, credibility has been tested by the government’s missed fiscal adjustment goals in
2009 and 2010, the latter notwithstanding an easing of the 2010 program at the time of the
July 2010 ECF review. A credible reinforcement of policies should include early
implementation of key measures, backed by clear public communication of why policy
correction is needed.

25.      As regards the 2011 budget, the revenue and grant projections appear broadly realistic,
based on current policies. But as noted above, the tax revenue effort remains very low, by
peer country standards, and is a key source of budget vulnerability. A high priority should be
given reinforcing tax administration, broadening the tax base, and eliminating tax exemptions.
This will require a sustained multi-year effort. With oil revenues projected to be modest in the
initial years of production, careful management of public expectations will remain important.

26.     On the expenditure side, the wage bill has been subject to repeated over-runs, and the
costing for the new pay structure remains subject to an uncomfortable margin of uncertainty.
Efforts will be needed to ensure that the roll out of the new pay structure is within the
confines of the budget pay provision. Even on this basis, the cost of public administration will


                                                87
have increased substantially in recent years, and efforts to streamline the public payroll will
need to be given more priority going forward.

27.     Expenditures in the capital budget also need better management. The budget provision
for capital spending appears on the low side, and a more realistic budget appropriation,
combined with better within-year spending oversight, may be needed to avoid the emergence
of further arrears in 2011.

28.      More generally, the government should be more proactive in managing budget
pressures during the course of the year. Where new spending pressures emerge, these should
be managed through cuts elsewhere in the budget or by through new revenue mobilization
efforts. New policy commitments should be resisted unless they are fully funded.

29.     On petroleum products, prices have shown limited flexibility over the past year, and
the budget is bearing the costs of a new price hedging regime. Continued inflexibility in
pricing would be inconsistent with adjustment to changing global market conditions and risks
giving rise to new calls for budget subsidies. If the hedging regime is continued, costs should
be borne by consumers.

30.     On monetary and exchange rate policy, Ghana is experiencing a strong balance of
payments position that will improve further with full-scale oil production. This may intensify
the dilemma that is starting to emerge, in managing the liquidity consequences within an
inflation targeting framework. While currency appreciation would ameliorate inflationary
pressures, this would raise concerns regarding competitiveness, in light of the real
appreciation of the cedi through 2010.
