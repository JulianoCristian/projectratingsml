                                                      SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                                                   Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                                               May 26, 2011


      Executive Directors approved the Ghana Third Agriculture Development Policy Operation
in the amount of SDR 36 million (US $57 million equivalent) on the payment terms and
conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (IDA/R2011-0141).

      Executive Directors expressed support for the DPL and its objectives of enhancing
Ghana’s productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture sector. They noted that the proposed
operation is country owned, and aligned with the government’s Food and Agriculture
Development Policy, with the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program
(CAADP) process, and with its Medium Term Agricultural Sector Investment Plan (METASIP).

      While Directors agreed that the macroeconomic environment was adequate for the
operation they urged continued attention to budgetary discipline. The importance of gender
mainstreaming was also emphasized.

       Directors noted the collaboration among development partners, government, and other
stakeholders in the sector. They encouraged the Bank to continue catalyzing donor funding and
to continue involving civil society in the program.
