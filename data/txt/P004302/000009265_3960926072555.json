The time-slice is estimated as necessary for FRIM\n            to become proficient in new fields of research.\n            Specifically, the project funds an agreed program of\n            research and development activities through the engagement\n            of scientists and experts, on a consulting basis, to\n            supplement the cadre of 50 professional staff already\n            working in FRIM.  The project also funds vehicles,\n            scientific equipment, and infrastructure, including\n            laboratories, office buildings and roads, required to\n            strengthen FRIM's ability to sustain its R & D\n            program, and staff training. The research program has been\n            defined in detail and supports the government's shift\n            in forest research priority away from logging for export to\n            one of conservation, reforestation, environmental protection\n            and domestic processing of timber."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
