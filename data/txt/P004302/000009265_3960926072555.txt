Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Malaysia
Beneficiary:       Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM)
Loan Amount:       US$9 million equivalent
Terms:             Repayable in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project            Malaysia's forests are among the richest in the world in
Description:     terms of species diversity, area of virgin tropical rain
forest, and timber value, but they are being exploited
faster than natural regeneration occurs. Government policy
focus has appropriately shifted from control of logging to
vigorous conservation, intensified natural resource manage-
ment and accelerated investment in reforestation. The
project's objective is to aid this shift by providing fund-
ing end technical assistance to FRIM to support a national
program of applied research.
The project would support this new institution an4 an
internationally accepted program of specific research
activities into forest ecology, silviculture, agroforestry,
rehabilitation of degraded soils, wood chemistry, timber
utilization, and natural forest management for multiple
uses, plus supporting equipment and infrastructure over the
1987-92 period.
The benefits of the project would be the generation of an
adequate information base and analytical framework on which
to base policy and investment decisions in forestry. The
major risk would be a possible shortfall in Government
funding in the early years of the program. However, Gov-
ernment has reaffirmed the priority it gives to the proj-
ect.

NATIONAL FORESTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Forestry Sector
1.1       Malaysia's forests contain more tree species than any other ecosys-
tem in the world. Timber production and exports have been major contributors
to the economy. However, development policy has given priority to agriculture
and mining in the allocation of land and forest resources have declined pre-
cipitously. Nevertheless, in terms of exports and contributions to state
revenues, forestry remains a major sector.
1.2       Malaysia'a topography and well distributed rainfall are eminently
suited to forestry. Of the total land area of 33 million ha, about 20 million
ha or 62% are covered by natural forest (Table 1.1). Although much of the
forest is secondary growth, Malaysia retains one of the largest areas of trop-
ical rain forest in the world. These are noted for their rich species diver-
sity and the high value of the timber. However, the "timber boom" of 1974-84
saw large areas cut over by loggers and much forest land planted to tree
crops, particularly oil palm. During this decade, the Peninsular States lost
almost 1 million ha, and Sabah State almost 2 million ha of forest (Table
1.1). Because of steep and swampy terrain, Sarawak State suffered little
depletion while lower cost log alternatives remained, particularly in Sabah.

Production and Trade
1.3       Malaysia is one of the world's largest producers and exporte3rs of
tropical timbers.  Annual output is a out 36 million cubic meters (Mm ) of
timber products.  Of this, sole 23 Mm  are exp3rted annually, mostly 3as logs.
In 1985, for example, 18.8 Mm of logs, 2.0 Mm of timber and 0.6 Mm of ply-
woods and veneers were exported. Production grew at 10% per year until 1982
and has subsequently declined slightly (Table 1.2) due to weak demand, the
depletion of easily accessible timber supplies, and conservation measures
under the National Forest Policy (para. 1.23).

1.4       Export earnings from forestry in 1986 (M$4,200 million) exceeded
those of palm oil (M$3,400 million), as timber prices rose and palm oil prices
fell. Timber is now second only to petroleum oil in generating foreign
exchange. As shova in Table 1.2, there is much scope for increasing export
value without increasing total production through increasing domestic value
added. For example, only 14 local manufacturers out of 2,000 firms export
furniture. The Bank is endeavoring to assist by providing technical assis-
tance and funds through the Small Scale Industries Project (Loan No. 2471-MA).
Employment
1.5       The Peninsular States, Sabah and Sarawak each produce about one-
third of total timber output. Most processed timber comes from the Peninsula,
where export of most logs is banned. Although direct employment in forestry
is only some 200,000 people or 10% of agricultural employment, indirect
employment generation is much greater. Forestry is the mainstay of the rural
economies of the sparsely populated States of Sabah and Sarawak. In East
Malaysia, forestry activities not captured in employment statistics are
central to the livelihood of indigenous groups.



-3-
Institutions
1.6       Federal and State Forest Departments.  Under the Malaysian Constitu-
tion, land is a State matter within the jurisdiction of each of the 13 States
and Federal Territory that constitutes the federation of Malaysia. As such,
each State is empowered to enact forestry laws and to formulate forest policy
independently. The executive authority of the Federal Government only extends
to research and maintenance of experimental and demonstration stations, train-
ing and advice and technical assistance to the States.
1.7       In Peninsular Malaysia, the Federal Forestry Department, under the
Ministry of Primary Industries and headed by a Director-General, is responsi-
ble for all aspects of forestry development, technical advice and services and
triining. Each State Forestry Department is headed by a Director and is
responsible for the administration and management of the State's timber
resources, law enforcement and revenue collection. Each State is divided into
a number of forest districts under the charge of District Forest Officers.
1.8       The Sabah Conservator of Forest and the Sarawak Director of Forestry
are responsible to their respective State Governments for all aspects of
forest management, planning and development, as well as wildlife conservation.
1.9       Forestry activities of the Federal and State Forestry Departments
are financed by the Federal and State Governments respectively. The State
Governments, in addition to royalties and premiums also collect a cess from
log exporters to finance forest development. Federal Government loans with
the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have been provided to some
States to establish large-scale forest plantations of fast-growing hardwoods.
Malaysian Timber Industry Board
1.10      The Malaysian Timber Industry Board, established in 1973, is
responsible for regulating timber exports and promotion. Its activities are
financed by a cess imposed on the exports of timber products.
Forestry Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM)
1.11      From the 1920s up to 1984 the Forest Research Institute (FRI) ope-
rated as a subdivision of the Federal Forest Department. The main achieve-
ments were the classification and timber testing of over 200 species of tropi-
cal hardwoods and management of lowland dipterocarp forest. Its development
of grading rules for tropical hardwood timber was instrumental in enabling the
acceptance of Malaysian processed timber exports on world markets. As timber
resources began to decline, the demand for research services expanded and
shifted towards conservation and reafforestation with a particular focus for
economic and policy analysis. In response, the Government, assisted by the
FAO/UNDP, studied the institutional changes required. Subsequently, under the
Malaysian Forestry Research and Development Board Act, 1985, a statutory body
called the Malaysian Forest Research and Development Board (MFRDB) was formed.
This Board reorganized FRI into the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia
(FRIM). The Act also made the Institute a statutory body, managed by the
MFRDB, responsible to the Minister of Primary Industries. Details of FRIM's
new organizational structure are given in para. 3.1.



- 4 -
1.12      The objectives of FRIM, under the MFRDB Act, include the following:
(a)  to conduct and promote research into forest development including
the production, extraction, processing, storage, transportation and
utilization of forest produce and rubberwood, and other fields
appropriate to the continued developmnt of the forestry sector and
the conservation of the resource base;
(b) to collect, collate and disseminate information relating to forest
management and development, forest produce and forest product utili-
zation; and
(c) to coordinate activities within Malaysia relating to research and
development, publicity and other matters relating to forest develop-
ment and forest industries and to liaise with bodies outside
Malaysia concerned with these matters.
1.13      In addition to forestry research, FRIM provides a variety of fores-
try services. Technical consultancy services are provided on a range of
forestry topicr and utilization of forest products. As an apex institution,
FRIM provides forestry extension services to state forestry departments and
the private sector. FRIM conducts training courses, provides genetically
superior planting material to state forestry departments and to the public,
and maintains a collection of forest species. In addition, FRIM publishes
periodicals and bulletins reporting research results and on specific topics of
relevance to the timber industry.
Issues in Forestry Sector Development
1.14      The major issues in the forestry sector can be summarized as
follows, and are discussed in subsequent paragraphs:
(a) the constitutional preeminence of individual states in forestry
matters;
(b) forest conservation versus forest utilization;
(c) reforestation versus natural regeneration; and
(d) marketing of forest products.
1.15      State Authority.  Under the Constitution, land and forests belong to
individual states. Forest taxes form the most important source of state reve-
nue in non-oil producing states and are second only to oil in the others. As
a result, state autonomy in forestry institutions, policies and practices, is
carefully preserved. This leads to difficulties in implementing a national
policy with uniform standards which riay affect the flow of state forestry
funds. More importantly, the institutional fragmentation has led to irrecon-
cilable statistics on forest inventory, procuction and other data on which to
base planning and policies.



-5-
1.16      Conservation and Utilization.  Forest conservation bas become an
important issue, as Peninsular Malaysia will become a net importer of timber
by the mid-1990s if current logging rates continue, and since Sabah has lost
its accessible supplies of quality timber. Part of Malaysia's unique tropical
plant and wildlife ecosystems will disappear in the coming decade unless
timely remedial action is taken. The Government's 1984 National Forestry Act
which has been ratified by the States, aims to strengthen forest conservation
through legislation, management and planning. The Act unifies legislation
among States with regard to timber concessions, tax levels and royalties and
makes provision for 14 million ha of permanent forests to be reserved for
environmental protection, research and sustained production.
1.17      Malaysia is a participant in the International Tropical Forestry
Action Plan sponsored by the Bank, FAO and other institutions. The Action
Plan being developed at specific country levels looks at land use, conserva-
tion of tropical forests, forest-based industrial development, fuetwooa pro-
duction and forestry institutions. The FRIM is studying research issues and
options under the Action Plan for Malaysia.
1.18      The trade-off between production and conservation is likely to
become an issue as an appreciation of the ecological value of Malaysia's
forests becomes more widespread; dermand for recreational and scientific use of
these resources increases; and increasing international attention is paid to
preserving tropical forests. Allied to this is the question of indigenous
forest dwellers, particularly in Sarawak, as possible destruction of their
habitat by loggers is already a political issue.
1.19      Reforestation.  Until recently, Malaysia relied on managed regenera-
tion of natural forests after logging. But in practice, only a small area was
so managed. The forest species are slow growing, taking 60-80 years to matur-
ity giving a low annual sustainable output of about 5 m /ha/year compared with
20 m/ha/year for plantations of fast-growing species. Although the fast-
growing species are of inferior quality, production in large volume for util-
ity timber purposes would relieve pressure on natural forests. The major
problem is that plantation forestry is virtually unknown in Malaysia, and
there is a dearth of information on the silviculture, pathology, site suita-
bility, management and marketing of fast-growing species.
1.20      In 1985, the Government started, with ADB assistance, a Compensatory
Plantation Program of about 180,000 ha of fast growing hardwoods to be estab-
lished over 15 years to meet domestic requirements. The only comparable plan-
tation is in Sabah where a joint-venture operation has established some
20,000 ha of similar species which are currently being harvested and exported
at ten years of age. Mixed experience from these operations highlights the
need for integrated research and development. For example, in Sabah the
problems tncountered included genetically unsuited planting material and poor
site selection.
1.21      The Bank recognized this need and is assisting plantation research
through the Sabah Forestry Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2550-MA of 1986)
which includes a 500-ha research plantation, a commercial pilot plantation of
3,000 ha, 500 ha of smallholder private tree farming and, marketing, proces-



sing, and other studies under Sabah conditions. FRIM is providing technical
assistance to the Sabah Forest Department for the project research component.
1.22      Marketing.  Utilization of forest products is a major issue.  As
shown in Table 1.2, Malaysia has been traditionally an exporter of raw materi-
als. In East Malaysia the common practice has been to truck logs to the
nearest beach to float them out to waiting ships. But despite utilization
policies, processed items remain less than 10% of total timber exports. Poli-
cies include a 25Z-50% variable log export tax in Sabah, a 50X royalty rebate
in Sarawak for companies processing logs berore export, a ban on log exports
from the Peninsula and a wide range of tax concessions to processors plus
technical assistance. The main problem affecting these policies is increased
competition in processed products from neighboring countries.
Forest Policy
1.23      The forest policy goals are (a) coordination of States; (b) environ-
mental conservation; (c) establishment of plantations for timber; (d) rehabi-
litation of degraded forests; and (e) increased domestic processing.
1.24      To implement these policy goals, Malaysia has made the following
arrangements and legislative framework. Land policy is made by the National
Land Council with Federal and State Cabinet representation.   A subgroup, the
National Forestry Council, drafts forestry policy for Land Council approvel.
The National Land Code (1965) ratifies individual state authority over lands
and forests. The National Forestry Policy (1978) sets guidelines for the
States to ensure protection of soil and water resources, maintenance of a sus-
tainable timber supply and the provision of adequate reserves for recreation
and wildlife preservation. The National Park Act (1980) provides for preser-
vation of lands of historical, ethnological, scientific and scenic interest.
The National Forestry Act (1984) unifies the individual state laws.
1.25      The Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90) emphasizes that the National
Forestry Policy (1978) will continue to provide the basis for rational devel-
opment of the sector. Conservation of forest resources is stressed as the
primary policy goal.  Output o  unprocessed sawlog  is projected to decline
about 2t: per year from 31.3 Mm in 1985 to 28.3 Mm in 1990. Output of sawn
timber is also projected to decline by about 0.7% per year during the same
period as measures of increase conservation, rehabilitation and local proces-
sing take hold.
1.26      Rehabilitation of degraded forest land will be achieved through
plantation establishment based on short-term rotations. The plantation timber
is to compensate for the projected shortfall in the supply of general utility
logs for domestic consumption. The Permanent Forest Estate (para. 1.16) will
provide the Government with security of tenure for effective management and
for watershed protection.
1.27           Policy-based assistance is given to local timber processors under
the Wood-Based Industries Act (1984) which provides guidelines and incentives
for processing including the use of lesser-known species. Measures include
assistance for relocation and modernization of plant, assistance for



-7-
establishment of integrated manufacturing complexes, and promotion of small-
scale wood based enterprises. Under the MFRDB Act, FRIM is constituted to
undertake research in all matters relating to the policy and to advise on
policy formulation.
B. Project Origin
1.28      In 1982, the Bank received a request to finance some 36,500 ha of
fast-growing plantation species at Bengkoka in Sabah. Because of major uncer-
tainties on the marketing, management and silviculture of the species the Bank
eventually agreed to finance a smaller (3,000 ha) technical assistance project
(Sabah Forestry Technical Assistance Project, Loan 2550-MA), approved in May
1985. It was designed to research the areas of uncertainty and to develop the
basis for a larger project, if warranted, in that State. The project is pro-
gressing satisfactorily with 1,100 ha of trial plantation and 200 ha of pri-
vate tree smallholder plantings established. Marketing and other studies are
under way. Experience with tree establishment and management confirm that the
larger project proposal was premature. While the pilot project is providing
information specific to Sabah and a small range of plantation species, it
highlights the need for an expanded, wide ranging research program for the
whole of Malaysia.
1.29      As mentioned earlier, the Government commissioned an FAO/UNDP study
of Malaysia's forest research in 1984 and accepted a report recommending major
institutional changes. The principal recommendation was to change the status
of the Forest Department's research division, the Forest Research Institute,
to a statutory body, in line with the Rubber Research Institute and the Palm
Oil Research Institute. Subsequently, the 1985 Forestry Research and Develop-
ment Board Act (para. 1.11) reconstituted FRIM as a statutory body to under-
take forestry research and development and to coordinate State research
activities. Support to FRIM was identified as being suitable for Bank assis-
tance in the Agricultural Assessment Report (No. 6226-MA) of September 1986,
when the Government requested 7ank funding for the new program.  The Bank
accepted the FAO/UNDP report - as project preparation since it involved
detailed analysis of existing and future research priorities and redeployment
of staff and the need for increased resources. Preparation was completed by a
preappraisal mission in October 1986, with appraisal in February 1987.
Negotiations took place in Kuala Lumpur in May 1987.
1.30      The proposed project would be the third in the forestry subsector
financed by the Bank. The loan for the Jengka Forestry Project (Loan 673-MA
for US$8.5 million) was signed in May 1970 and closed, fully disbursed, in
December 1974. The project was part of the Jengka Triangle land settlement
program (Loans 533, 672, and 885-MA) and its objective was to improve the
recovery and utilization of timber removed under the settlement operation and
to encourage Bumiputra participation in industry. A government corporation

was established to manage the project which consisted of (a) a sawmill; (b) a
plywood mill; (c) logging equipment; and (d) necessari administration quarters
and equipment. The Project Performance Audit Report _ concluded that the
project failed to reach a satisfactory rate of return because of management
deficiencies, inadequate technical assistance, poor marketing arrangements,
and deficiencies in factory design. While the lessons of the Jengka Forestry
Project are important and relevant, they essentially address different issues
and the experience with the Sabah Forestry Project indicates that the Bank can
now play a more substantial role in assisting the Government address nation-
wide forestry and environmental issues by supporting FRIM.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Description
2.1       The proposed project comprises a five-year (1987-91) time-slice of
FRIM's worR program. The time-slice is estimated as necessary for PRIM to
become proficient in new fields of research. Specifically, the project would
fund an agreed program of research and development activities through the
engagement of scientists and experts, on a consulting basis, to supplement the
cadre of 50 professional staff already working in FRIM. The project would
also fund vehicles, scientific equipment, and infrastructure, including labo-
ratories, office buildings and roads, required to strengthen FRIM's ability to
sustain its R&D program, and, staff training. The research program has been
defined in detail and supports the gover1¶ment's shift in forest research
priority away from logging for export to one of conservation, reforestation,
environmental protection and domestic processing of timber.
B. Detailed Description
Research Program Support
2.2       Prior to 1986, FRIM's research program comprised over 100 individual
projects broadly grouped by major topics, but without establishing priorities.
Following three external reviews of the research program between 1983 and
1986, the program was reorganized into eight priority areas, which have been
reviewl   y We Bank and by the Research Advisory Committee (RAC) of the
MFRDB.-  Z! -  The RAC consists of members from the private sector and Gov-
ernment institutions with expertise in all facets of forestry and forest

industries. The function of the RAC is to critically review FRIM's research
program.
2.3       The project would support approved ongoing and proposed research
programs, including unidentified programs which would be reviiewed by the RAC
and Bank review missions. This component includes the cost of scientific
staff and the establishment and maintenance of forest research plots. The
cost of this component is expected to be about US$28.7 million over five
years, including contingencies (Annex 3).
2.4       The priority objectives of the research program which underline the
ongoing and proposed specific activities and against which future ones would
be selected are:
(a) environmental science - to develop management practices for multiple
use of forest resources on a sustained basis;
(b) natural forest management - to develop systems of preservation, uti-
lization and rehabilitation of the permanent forest estate;
(c) forest science - to determine the biology of pathogens in forest
systems, to determine the reproductive behavior of natural forest
tree species;
(d) plantation forestry - to improve the species choice, establishment
techniques and management practices of reafforestation with fast-
growing species;
(e) timber utilization - to improve processing technology to increase
value added before export;
(f) forestry economics - to analyze the economics of forestry develop-
ment and timber utilization;
(g) diversification - to promote the use of rubberwood and oil palm tree
trunks as commercial timber; to develop commercial techniques for
growing and p:ocessing rattan; and
(h) rehabilitation of coastal forests - to preserve and restore coastal
protective forests.
2.5       The Research Program.  The current prcgram comprises 128 research
proiects, of which 89 have been initiated (Annex 9). Within the environmental
science program there are 12 projects, wkich focus on watershed management of
forests, soil conservation in logged catchments and conservation of species
composition. The natural forest management program contains 11 projects which
look at rehabilitation of natural forests following logging, enrichment plant-
ing techniques, and sustainable tree felling systers.



- 10 -
2.6       The forest science program coneists of 13 projects, involving plant
pathology, taxonomy and propagation of forest species. The taxonomy projects
are particularly important in classifying tropical rain forest plants unique
to Malaysia as the basis for conservation programs. One of the largest pro-
grams is for plantation forestry in which 25 projects address key items of
interest in establishment and management of plantations of rattan, bamboo and
trees of introduced and indigenous species. Malaysia's former forestry man-
agement implicitly assumed an inexhaustible supply of logs from natural for-
ests and hence plantation forestry received comparatively little attention in
research and development. With the realization that natural timber reserves
are not being sustained, policy has shifted to plantations but the stock of
knowledge about plantation silvirulture is inadequate to support a major pro-
gram. The plantation forestry research projects investigate soil suitability
classification, genetic improvement of planting material, propagation and
establishment, disease control and growth performance.
2.7       The timber utilization program has 32 projects if direct relevance
to private industry processors. The projects include development of technical
standards for furniture, stress testing of plywood, timber seasoning and pres-
ervation. An important aspect of the program is research into the suitability
of fast-growing tropical hardwood plantation species for higher-valued end-
use. One of the difficulties associated with fast-growing tropical planta-
tions has been the unsuitability of much of the wood for other than low-grade
utility purposes because of low fiber density and strength. The consequent
low value of many of the timber species imposes limitations on economic via-
bility in a similar way to that imposed by the slow growth of high-value indi-
genous species. Changes in end-use of timber species can be made with
advanced processing technology and would be the focus of the utilization
program.
2.8       The forestry economics program includes 16 projects involving
economic evaluation of the other programs, such as the economics of plantation
forestry and the use of variable logging tax rates to control the rate of
logging, and the production costs of processed timber products. The diversi-
fication program includes 14 projects which involve intercropping farm crops
with trees for commercial use, the use of rubberwood, coconut, and oil palm
trunks as timber sources, and the growth of minor forest products such as
bamboo, rattan and resins. Before 1980 the use of rubber wood as timber was
almost unknown. As a result of research begun by the previous FRI, prior to
reorganization as FRIM, rubberwood is increasingly being used for furniture.
Export of these products has grown to over 3 Mm , in 1985. To fully utilize
the va't quantities of rubberwood available each year through replanting or
land clearing investigations will continue into removing residual rubber, kiln
drying and pesticide treatment. The coastal forest program includes 5 proj-
ects for rehabilitation of mangrove forests and for establishment of salt-
tolerant tree species along exposed shorelines. The clearing of coastal
forest has led to increased erosion from wave action and flooding and has
decreased fish breeding sites. At negotiations, agreement was reached would
be sought that research activities would ae changed or selected in accordance
with objectives satisfactory to the Bank [para. 5.1(a)].



- 11 -
2.9       Staffing.  The major cost of research programs would be staff sala-
ries including the cost of experts and consultants whom FRIM has engaged, or
in future would engage, to ensure the high caliber of its research programs.
The FAO preparation report examined the level and composition of FRI staff and
recommended redeployment of existing staff, an increase in staff, and a change
in the disciplinary mix to carry out the FRIM research programs. The restruc-
tured organization is shown in Annex 8. the major changes are establishment
of the Environmental Science and Economics Branches, and the creation of
specialized units with well-defined terms-of-reference. The reorganization
requires hiring of skills for new branches and the upgrading of generalists
skills in other units. In 1986, FRIM's research staff numbered 50, including
6 PhDs and 11 MScs. The project staff development program would upgrade some
of the existing staff and increase the total professional staff (scientists,
economists and others) from 50 to 160 by 1991. There is a sufficient pool of
appropriately qualified professionals available in the Malaysia public and
private sector, to meet FRIM's staffing needs under competitive terms and
conditions. Other costs under support to the research program would be for
office services and supplies, operation and maintenance of equipment, tree
planting, and consulting services. About 1,500 ha would be planted with trees
on state forestry land for applied research trials (Annex 2).
2.10      Consulting Services.  Consultants would be engaged to assist FRIM to
develop the training program for FRIM and State Forestry Departmert foresters
and to establish the expanded research programs, particularly in new areas
such as forestry economics, forestry policy analysis, plantation forestry,
utilization and marketing of small-size timber and ecology. These consultants
would be required for specific tasks over five years. A total of some 70 man-
months would be required at a cost of US$10,000 per man-month; a total cost of
US$0.7 million (Annex 2), including contingencies.
Civil Works
2.11      FRIM is located oil 600 ha of experimental plantations, arboreta and
natural orests at Bukit Kepong some 20 km north of Kuala Lumpur, using the
facilities occupied by FRI since 1929. Under the project, FRIM would rehabi-
litate, expand and upgrade these facilities. The existing central building
complex would be renovated for offices and modern laboratories.  An auditorium
would be built to accommodate scientific presentations, training courses and
meetings of the expanded staffing. A mLseum building would be built to house
the botanical collection and library, which would be available fcr research as
well as for public use. A fire tower would be built together with a new boun-
dary road around the research station. Basic amenities would be provided at
the three field stations FRIM maintains at Rantau Abang, Posoh, and Mata Air.
Workshops would be constructed. As part of the timber utilization program a
number of houses would be built to test wood materials subjected to different
treatments against borers, fire and other destructive agents. The total cost
of this component would be US$3.4 million including contingencies (Annex 3).



- 12 -
Vehicles and Equipment
2.12      A total of 47 new vehicles would be provided for land preparation
and transport of equipment and personnel. Vehicles provided would be 27
4-wheel drives, 10 cars, 3 light trucks, 3 agricultural tractors, and 4 buses
(Annmex 10) Equipment would be purchased for field and laboratory studies.
Examples of scientific equipment to be bought would be microcomputers, soil
tensiometers, insect breeding chambers, kiln driers, wood-testing machines,
wood-working machines and chemical autoanalyzers (Annex 11). The total cost
of this component would be US$3.6 million, including contingencies (Annex 3).
Training
2.13      The staff development plan consists of training programs with local
and overseas universities and forestry institutions, research fellowships and
training courses at FRIM. This would strengthen FRIM by exposing staff to
international forestry concerns, analysis, techniques, and other expertise.
In addition, it would allow staff to improve their own career prospects. The
training and fellowship programs would provide for 100 nlaces at an average
cost of US$15,000 each, under which all PRIM research staff would be expected
to undertake research in areas cof identified priority while pursuing higher
degrees. The fellowships and courses would be of varying duration and in
Malaysia as well as abroad and would be spread over five years.  The cost of
fellowship and courses would be US$1.5 million including contingencies
(Annex 2).
2.14      Status of Preparation.  The proposed forestry reaearch programs
represent an expenditure time slice of an ongoing activity with 70X of the
programs already under way. All aspects of FRIM's organization and terms-of-
reference have been considered and reorganization is essentially completed.
Proposed civil works are minor and are not complex in design. Civil works
design is essentially complete.
C. Project Costs
2.15      Project costs include all FRIM's estimated expenditures during the
period 1987-91. Total project costs would amount to US$37.3 million including
US$0.8 million in duties and taxes, based on March 1987 prices (Table 2.1).
Foreign exchange costs would be about US$9.0 million (24% of total). Physical
contingencies have been calculated at 10% of the cost of civil works. Price
contingencies have been calculated at 3Z for 1987, 1% for 1988-90, and 3.5%
thereafter for both local and foreign costs. Physical contingencies amount to
1Z of base costs and price contingencies amount to 5% of base costs. Detailed
costs are given in Annex 2.

D. Financing
2.16      The proposed Bank loan of US$9.0 million would finance the equiva-
lent of the foreign exchange requirements of the project. Retroactive finan-
cing to January 1, 1987 would be allowed up to a maximum of US$0.9 million.
The Government's contribution would be provided through an annual budgetary
allocation to FRIM (Table 2.2). The Government would be the borrower as
although the MFRDB Act empowers FRIM to borrow, FRIM's revenue projections
(para. 4.4) would not support a direct loan of the size proposed.

2.18      Civil Works.  The civil works are small and dispersed over time.
The largest contract would be about US$1.2 million, for the auditorium, and
would not be large enough for ICB. Consequently, civil works for the audito-
rium and office block would be carried out under contracts to be awarded fol-
lowing local competitive bidding procedures (LCB), which are satisfactory to
the Bank and in which interested foreign bidders would be eligible to partici-
pate. All LCB bidders would be prequalified by PWD to standards acceptable to
the Bank. Other civil works, including the fire tower, electrical rewiring,
modifications to existing buildings, fencing, a perimeter road, minor works,
and plantation establishment and maintenance would be constructed by the
Public Works Department (PWD) under force account or under contract following
local procurement practices satisfactory to the Bank. Detailed design is
complete.



- 15 -
2.19      Goods and Services.  Purchases of equipment and vehicles costing
US$3.6 million in total would, to the extent practicable, be grouped into
packages of at Least US$250,000 each for procurement under ICB procedures with
a 15% preference for local suppliers in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Purchase of goods grouped in packages costing the equivalent of US$250,000 or
less each would be by LCB procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Small off-the-shelf items dispersed in time and nature and costing less than
US$50,000 each and totalling not more than US$0.5 million would be procured by
local shopping with at least three bids and in accordance with normal Govern-
ment procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Consultant services would
also be obtained in accordance with Bank guidelines. The scope, terms of ref-
erence, and schedules of the consultancy assignments would be agreed with the
Bank prior to engagement of consultants. Fellowships would be awarded to
staff members selected by the Director General of FRIM in accordance with the
guidelines of the Research Advisory Committee.
2.20      Contract Review.  No civil works contracts are expected to reach the
prior review threshold. Supply contracts over US$0.25 million would be sub-
ject to prior review by the Bank. Other contracts would be subject to selec-
tive post-award review.
F. Disbursements
2.21      Disbursements of the proposed loan over five years against contracts
and Statements of Expenditure would be as follows: (a) 37% of the cost of
civil works; (b) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equip-
ment and vehicles, 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured items,
net of taxes, and 75% of the cost of imported items procured locally; (c) 50%
of the cost of fellowships; (d) 100% of the cost of consultant services; and
(e) 10% of direct expenditures on research programs. For civil works con-
tracts of value less than US$10,000, for items of operation and maintenance,
and for fellowships, disbursement would be made against Statements of Expendi-
ture. For disbursements made against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), docu-
mentation would be retained by FRIM for Bank review and scrutiny by auditors.
The loan is expected to be disbursed over five years according to the schedule
of disbursements shown in Annex 4. The disbursements would be much faster
than those for the standard profile for agricultural projects in Malaysia as
the project is an expenditure time slice of an ongoing operation. Disburse-
ments against fellowships would be made only after approval by the Bank of the
standard fellowship agreement form and selection criteria.
C. Accounts and Audits
2.22      FRIM is subject to normal Government control and audit procedures.
Assurances were obtained that FRIM would maintain separate project accounts,
that the project accounts including the SOEs would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that the auditors' reports
would be furnished to the Bank within nine months of the end of the
Government's fiscal year [para. 5.1(k)].

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
3.1       Project Organization.  Details of forestry institutions, and their
objectives, organization and policy are given in paras. 1.5 through 1.13. The
project would be implemented by FRIM under the direction of the MFRDB, which
is responsible to the Minister of Primary Industries. No special arrangements
would be required as the project would work through FRIM's recently adopted
organization configuration (Annex 8). FRIM consists of four divisions, Fores-
try, Economic and Advisory Services, Administration and Finance, and Forest
Products, each with a Director reporting to the Director-General and his
Deputy. Independent of these divisions is a Research Evaluation Unit, respon-
sible for evaluation of research, reporting to the Director-General of FRIN
who is a member of MFRDB. The Board in turn sets research policy and approves
all research programs.
3.2       Project Management.  Each research division is responsible for an
approved program with the collaboration of other divisions. Visiting scien-
tists (consultants, research fellows) would assist in (a) initiating research
in fields requiring strengthening; (b) implementing and evaluation of ongoing
work, and; (c) training in research methodology and the other relevant
aspects.
B. Project Scheduling
3.3       The project would be implemented over five years from 1987 to 1991
according to the schedule shown in Annex 4 and in the action plan given in
Annex 5 which lists key dates for critical actions. The completion date would
be December 31, 1991, and the closing date June 30, 1992. Although reorgani-
zation of PRIM has occurred administratively, filling of authorized positions
and further development of the research programs would take place over the
project period. It is important that key positions be filled early so that
those responsible for the program are able to influence staff selection and
program formulation. The four Department Directors (Annex 8) would need to be
recruited by December 31, 1987, and their Branch Heads (Division Chiefs) by
June 30, 1988. The Branch Heads in consultation with Department Directors
would prepare a detailed report on work completed and in progress and a long-
term program for the rest of the project period by December 31, 1988. The
program proposed together with the associated staffing and budget requirements
would be submitted to the Director General for MFRDB approval and to the Bank
(para. 5.1(c)]. Annual programming and budgeting would be made with reference
to this long-run plan as would an external review (para. 3.5). At negotia-
tions assurances were given that directors and branch heads would be recruited
by the above dates [para. 5.1(d)], that the research plan would be submitted
to the Bank by December 31, 1988 fpara. 5.1(c)], and that the research program
would be implemented according to the agreed action plan (para. 5.1(b)].
3.4       Consultants to assist in implementing new research, in development
of long-run plans and implementing the training proposals would need to be
engaged by June 30, 1988. Agreement was reached to this effect
(para. 5.1(e)]. Final terms of reference for these consultants would need to



- 17 -
be prepared by March 31, 1988. Civil works would be constructed during 1987
and 1988 with priority to be given to laboratories. Purchase of equipment and
vehicles would be in parallel with increases in staff. At negotiations
assurances were given that the details of the training program and the trainee
selection criteria would be submitted to the Bank for approval [(para. 5.1(f)
and (g).
C. Research Evaluation
3.5       A mid-term evaluation of the Institute and work completed, in prog-
ress and proposed would be made by a panel of experts external to FRIM and the
MFRDB to ensure high research standards. The evaluation, or site review,
would examine the administration of the overall research program, the adequacy
and utilization of facilities, the applicability of research results, and the
performance of individual research projects with respect to the long-run plan
(para. 3.3) and to accepted performance indicators. The review panel would
consist of local and international scientists and/or research administrators
and would be invited by the borrower under terms-of-reference approved by the
Bank and these expenditures would be eligible for reimbursement under consul-
tancy services (Annex 12). The mid-term review would be undertaken by June 1,
1989. A second site review would be made at project closing as part of the
project completion report and would be made by September 1, 1991. During
negotiations agreement was reached for the two site reviews [para. 5.1(h)].
D. Progress Reporting
3.6       The Director-General's office would prepare consolidated quarterly
progress reports and submit them to the MFRDB and the Bank. The reports would
summarize the physical and financial progress during the previous period. A
project completion report would be prepared by the borrower within six months
of the loan closing date.
IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
4.1       The proposed project would have long-term benefits by providing a
data base and an analytical framework to (a) reverse the decline in Malaysia's
natural forest resources; (b) make best economic use of timber stocks through
developing sustained yield management systems, and (c) promote high value-
added wood utilization. The project would lead to further development of the
rubberwood industry which previously was not considered feasible. Urgent
measures are needed to protect and manage remaining forests and to establish
forest plantations which require considerable investment. Without the FRIM
program, the information necessary for policy and investment decisions would
be inadequate. In addition, the project would have major external benefits in
terms of environmental protection and recreational use of forests. An immed-
iate and more direct benefit would be the institutional strengthening of FRIM.
4.2       Research results are adequately disseminated by the methods
described earlier (para. 1.13). These arrangements would continue to be used.



- 18 -
B. Project Risks and Environmental Impact
4.3       The project's environmental impact would be positive since it would
establish techniques to rehabilitate degraded forest land, control overexploi-
tation of timber stands and preserve a permanent forest estate for multiple
use.  The results would provide the basis for environmental policy.  The major
risk would be inadequacy of Government funding arising from budgetary diffi-
culties. Without the project, the risk of irreversible environmental damage
through continued fragmentation of forest policies, legislation and analytical
capacity, is high.
C. Cost Recovery
4.4       The MFRDB Act provides for a cess to be levied on forest produce and
forms part of the policy measures designed to increase domestic processing
(para. 1.22). Part of this cess would accrue to FRIM to defray the annual
cost of forestry research amounting to about M$20 million. Cess income to
FRIM is expected to rise to M$6 million per year by 1989 after which it would
cecline steadily as the policy of restructuring takes effect. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached to ensure that proceeds of the cess collected
under the Act would be allocated to forestry research issues (para. 5.1(j)].
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1       During negotiations assurances were obtained on the following:
(a) FRIM shall select research projects in accordance with objectives
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.8);
(b) FRIM shall implement research projects in accordance with an action
plan and time schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.3);
(c) FRIM shall furnish to the Bank, by December 31, 1988, a long-term
research plan with staffing and budgetary requirements (para. 3.3);
(d) FRIM shall appoint persons with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to the Bank:
(i) by December 31, 1987 as FRIM Department Directors; and
(ii) by June 30, 1988 as FRIM Branch Heads (para. 3.3);
(e) FRIM shall employ by June 30, 1988 consultants to assist in
implementation of research projects and staff training (para. 3.4);
(f) FRIM shall implement training in accordance with a program satisfac-
tory to the Bank (para. 3.4);
(g) FRIM shall select trainees in accordance with criteria satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 3.4);



- 19 -
(h) The borrower shall, by March 31, 1989 and by July 31, 1991, appoint
a panel of experts with composition and terms of reference satisfac-
tory to the Bank (para. 3.5);
(i) The Borrower shall cause to be completed in accordance with criteria
satisfactory to the Bank:
(i) by the first panel of experts, a mid-term review of the FRIM
research program by June 30, 1989; and
(ii) by the second panel of experts, a final review by December 31,
1991 (para. 3.5);
(j) The Borrower shall take all measuwes necessary within its means to
ensure that proceeds of the cess collected pursuant to the Act is
allocated to forestry research activities (para. 4.4); and
(k) FRIM would maintain separate project accounts which would be audited
annually, together with the SOEs, by auditors acceptable to the
Bank; the auditors' reports would be sent to the lank within nine
months of the close of the Government's fiscal year (para. 2.22).
5.2       With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$9.0 million to Malaysia. The loan would have a repay-
ment period of 15 years, including a grace period of three years at the
standard variable interest rate.

Mid-Term and Final Review - Draft Terms of Reference
1.        Purpose. A mid-term evaluation of the Institute would be made by a
panel of experts external to FRIM and the MERDB to ensure high research Stan-
dards. The evaluation, or site review, would examitne the administration of
the overall research program, the adequacy and utilization of facilities, the
relevance and applicability of research results, and the performance of indi-
vidual research projects with respect to the long-run plan and to accepted
performance indicators.
2.        Composition.  The review panel would consist of local and interna-
tional scientists and/or research administrators and would be invited by the
borrower under final terms of reference approved by the Bank and these expen-
ditures would be eligible for reimbursement under consultancy services. A
second site review would be made at project closing as part of the project
completion report. The panel would consist of three to four members with
internationally recognized proficiency in research evaluation. The team com-
position would be such as to contain expertise in the fields of environmental
science, natural forest management, forest science, plantation forestry, tim-
ber utilization, forestry economics, and research administration.
3.        The team leader would coordinate the work of the panel, allocate
tasks, and be responsible for producing the report. A broad knowledge of for-
estry research administration, with a background in one of the research fields
mentioned above, would be required. The leader would be responsible for
assessing the effects of the project on improving PRIM's administrative proce-
dures. He would examine the procedures for selecting research activities and
the operation of FRIM's internal system for monitoring research progress. He
would also examine the personnel composition, terms and conditions of employ-
ment and staff development, and programming and budgeting.
4.        The other panel members would review progress of individual programs
specific to their expertise. The criteria to be used include the adequacy of
professional and support staff, the instrumentation available, the adequacy of
operating funds, the number of abandoned and modified projects with respect to
the number of completed projects, and other criteria normally used in research
program evaluation.
5.        One panel member or the team leader should have a strong background
in forestry economics and policy analysis. He will be responsible for examin-
ing the work of the Economics Branch of PRIM with respect to its methodology,
content and relevance to the Institute's total program and to national forest
policy formulation and implementation.
6.        Reporting and Timing.  The team would spend about four weeks in
Malaysia. Before departure, they would produce a preliminary report outlining



AM= 12
- 36 -                         Page 2
the developments under the project, the professionalism of the staff, and the
adequacy and relevance of work completed, ongoing and proposed. The mission
will make draft rsco,mmendations for changes in project desigp, program content
and other relevant matters for discussion with the ?FlDB and with Government.
A draft final report should be produced within eight weeks of departure of the
panel for submission to Government and, through Government, to the Bank for
finalization. The mid-term review would be undertaken by June 1, 1989 and the
final review would be undertaken by September 1, 1991.

Summary of National Forest Policy
1.        Recognizing the importance of forestry and forest-based industries
in national economic life and the unique character of Malaysia's forests as
one of the world's largest and most diverse areas of rain forest, the Govern-
ment of Malaysia has formulated its National Forestry Policy (1978). The NFP
contains three major elements. These are forest conservation, forest rehabil-
itation and forest products utilization.
2.        To ensure security of tenure for effective management, a Permanent
Forest Estate is being established under the National Forestry Act of 1984
which strengthens and coordinates state legislation on conservation and man-
agement. It is proposed to retain about 14 million ha of the remaining
20 million ha in the Estate, part of which will be retained as ecological
reserves and for watershed protection.
3.        Rehabilitation of degraded forest land will be accomplished through
plantation establishment based on short-term rotations. The plantation timber
is to compensate for the projected shortfall in the supply of general utility
logo for domestic consumption and export.
4.        Forest products utilization is guided by the Wood-Based ladustries
Act 1984. The Act provides guidelines and incentives for proper utilization
including increased local timber processing and the use of lesser-known
species, wood wastes and rubberwood. Among the steps taken to further enhance
timber processing are: banning of export of logs from West Malaysia, assis-
tance for relocation and modernization of existing wood-based industry, estab-
lishment of Integrated Timber Manufacturing Complexes, and promotion of small-
scale enterprises for secondary and tertiary processing.
5.        Recognizing the need for more intensive research to support the
policy, the Covernment passed the Malaysian Forestry Research and Development
Board Act, 1985, establishing A statutory body to guide forestry research and
development. Under the MFRDB Act, the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia
is constituted to undertake forestry research and development in all matters
related to conservation, production, rehabilitation and utilization and to
advise on policy formulation.
