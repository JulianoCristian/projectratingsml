The time-slice is estimated as necessary for FRIM\n            to become proficient in new fields of research.\n            Specifically, the project funds an agreed program of\n            research and development activities through the engagement\n            of scientists and experts, on a consulting basis, to\n            supplement the cadre of 50 professional staff already\n            working in FRIM.
