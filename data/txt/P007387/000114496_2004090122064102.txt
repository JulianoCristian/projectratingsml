Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated April 11, 1996 entered 
into between the Republic of Honduras (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (the Association), as amended.
In response to the Borrower’s request to extend the disbursement deadline set 
forth in paragraph (g) of Section 2.02 of the Development Credit Agreement, the 
Association hereby agrees to amend such Section as follows:
“(g) After a date twelve months (or such later date as the 
Association shall establish and promptly notify to the Borrower) from 
the date of 
the Second Amending Agreement, no withdrawals shall be made 
and no commitment 
shall be entered into to pay amounts to or on the 
order of the Borrower in respect 
of expenditures to be financed out of 
the proceeds of the Second Additional 
Financing.  At any time after such 
date, the Association may, by notice to the 
Borrower, cancel the 
unwithdrawn amount of the Second Additional Financing 
from the Credit 
Account or any part thereof.”.
This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original.  Upon receipt by the Association of one fully executed original of 
this Amendment Letter, this amendment will be effective as of the date first above 
written.  Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and 
dating the two counterparts of this Amendment Letter.
