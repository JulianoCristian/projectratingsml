outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and institutional\n            development impacts are substantial. Lessons reinforce that\n            government commitment is key in ensuring success, reflected\n            in this operation in the Borrower's own priorities\n            being ensured by government support, even in the face of\n            great challenges, such as the devastation brought by\n            Hurricane Mitch. Moreover, in this case, the use of multiple\n            instruments to support Bank interventions, built on the\n            foundations of exhaustive sector work, provided diagnosis on\n            the challenges the country's public sector had to face;\n            and as well, was enhanced by a companion technical\n            assistance loan, focused on the groundwork of policy actions\n            pursued by the project. However, given the complexity, and\n            specific know-how of the reforms supported by the project,\n            several operations could have been used to increase the\n            focus of individual reforms. For example, implementation of\n            the financial administration system, could have been\n            accomplished using a physical investment loan, while\n            similarly, sector-specific adjustment loans may be more\n            effective in supporting ambitious reforms. Further lessons\n            specify the need for well defined loan conditionality; for\n            adequate supervision, and close monitoring of the overall\n            country situation; to adequately consider the complexity of\n            legal frameworks, and regulatory bodies for sustainable\n            privatization, and concessions; and, for coordinating with\n            other international financial institutions, to ensure\n            consistent policy approach towards borrowers."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
