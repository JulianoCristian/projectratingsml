Emphasis is\n            placed upon reform of the enterprise sector, including\n            privatization, enterprise restructuring and corporate\n            governance, private sector development, pro-competition and\n            anti-monopoly policies, and the banking sector. Actions in\n            these areas will be complemented by further liberalization\n            of price and trade policies and by strengthening the system\n            of social protection. This credit will be instrumental in\n            assisting the Government in the implementation of\n            market-oriented reforms. The credit will help sustain\n            minimum import capacity during the period of transition."}, "docdt": "1995-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
