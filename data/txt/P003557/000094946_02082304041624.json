The lessons learned form the project design\n            and implementation include: 1) Close correlation from the\n            borrower's priorities is the foundation of the project.\n            2) The strong linkage of research and extension with\n            planting activities was critical to technology transfer. 3)\n            Centralized procurement of fertilizers and pesticides is not\n            appropriate for multi-provinces forestry projects, where the\n            project participants are widely dispersed. 4) Further study\n            will be necessary to assess market condition and new\n            policies such as logging ban related issues. 5) Watershed\n            management will be more effectively carried out as\n            integrated land management approach with treatments not only\n            for forest zones. 6) Bank projects have raised awareness of\n            the potential of production forestry."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
