Community-Based Ecosystem Management (ICEMA) Project for\n            Namibia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            global environment outcome was moderate; Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: conservancies\n            operate in large, open systems with highly variable climatic\n            conditions. Rainfall is extremely sporadic. Ungulates move\n            over vast areas in accordance with their availability for\n            grazing and browsing; predators roam in search of prey and;\n            elephants follow ancient migration routes. The effects of\n            climate change are likely to increase this variability.\n            Adaptive management that takes changing circumstances into\n            account is vital in such systems. ICEMA has filled important\n            gaps in natural resource management thanks to the adoption\n            of the Integrated-Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach by the\n            Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program.\n            To succeed with IEM, it is important to: (i) introduce\n            standardized business development approaches based on a\n            vision of sustainability using a categorization of\n            conservancies and an integrated planning and implementation\n            approach; (ii) strengthen governance through compliance\n            systems, local level monitoring and financial management;\n            and (iii) strengthen the concept and capacity to carry and\n            implement ecological and economic zoning within each\n            conservancy including monitoring of the zoning rules by\n            internal and external conservancy users. Large scale\n            translocations of fauna to conservancies within differing\n            biomes and with different biodiversity, income-generating\n            and development needs were, until the inception of ICEMA,\n            largely untried and untested. Planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation are core aspects of conservancy activities, as\n            they allow for adaptive management through the strategic use\n            of gathered information. A number of Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems were put in place by Ministry\n            of Environment and Tourism (MET) and its development partners."}, "docdt": "2011-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
