Develop viable income generating and livelihood\n            diversifying options among target groups.

To encourage community\n            empowerment and power-sharing arrangements with the private\n            sector, provide training and facilitation to conservancies.\n            To control biophysical impacts resulting from tourism, like\n            the increased use of natural resources, groundwater and\n            river contamination, more of-road driving, and interference\n            with wildlife, develop land-use zoning and development\n            guidelines, monitor environmental compliance, strengthen\n            staff skills, and pass laws enforcing policy. To prevent\n            causing harmful impacts because of profit maximization,\n            promote a sustainable development approach. Carry out a\n            training needs assessment for each individual conservancy.\n            Develop a water management/water use plan. When\n            translocating game, enable livestock owners to access\n            alternative grazing areas and reintroduce predators only if\n            the benefits outweigh the costs.
