Executive summary


The ESMF is developed as a practical tool that provides background to ICEMA, guidelines on
how to develop subprojects and, consolidates all Safeguard Instruments relevant to the Project. It
aims to inform Extension staff (MET, other line ministries) and Support Organisation staff (field-
based NGOs) of the aims and objectives of ICEMA, the rationale for the Community Funding
Facility (CFF) and the implementation of Safeguard Instruments during the planning and
implementation of subprojects. As far possible, with the help of the ESMF, ICEMA will try to make
the implementation of and compliance with Safeguard as smooth as possible ­ cooperation from
partners is crucial.

Some issues, concepts and phrases are repeated throughout the document in various related
sections and serve the purpose of emphasising an important point that needs to be considered
during the planning stages of a subproject. For e.g., community participation is mandatory during
subproject planning and implementation but, ICEMA is aware that communities have, in some
instances, entrusted Conservancy Committees as their voice and representation for decision
making. The importance of Management Plans is also stressed as the long-term developmental
guide for a conservancy and should serve as a guiding document when ideas for subprojects are
considered.

Extension and Support Organisation staff members are encouraged to contact the ICEMA Project
Office during technical assistance delivery to conservancies/ community forests for subproject
planning and implementation. The prompt address of constraints can assure faster appraisal and
approval of proposals and implementation of subprojects.

Section A of the ESMF introduces the Framework and elaborates its purpose and objectives. The
purpose of the Framework is overall to provide ICEMA Project partners, the MET, CBOs and
support organisations, with a guideline for subproject planning and development. The overall
objective of the Framework is to present the ICEMA project and its coordination and institutional
arrangements and, provide all information about a Safeguard Instruments and their
implementation and the National Environmental Management framework for Namibia.

Section B, is important to read and revisit as it outlines subproject criteria. This can ensure that
time and effort is not wasted generating a subproject proposal that is not eligible under CFF
funding, although it might be eligible for funding somewhere else.

Section C tackles environmental management; planning at conservancy level, following Namibia's
Environmental Assessment policy and the development of Environmental Management Plans
(EMP) when deemed necessary. Under section E, environmental and social management
requirements, the ESMF introduces the World Bank Operational Policies, the safeguard relevant
to ICEMA and emphasises the need for compliance with national environmental management
requirements.

Section D elaborates the preparation, approval and implementation of subprojects; providing
guidelines and strongly encouraging community participation.

Section E provides information about Namibia's policy provisions for environmental management;
it describes the need and use of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and addresses

issues related to Cultural Property and Natural Habitats and Forest Areas with regard to
subproject planning and development.
Sections F to G provide more information about the use of safeguards under ICEMA and the CFF
with strong emphasis on available guidelines and technical assistance. The Resettlement Policy
Framework is addressed as subprojects may acquire land for use and in that remove/restrict
access to resources or involuntarily resettle people. Procedures for incorporating this under a
subproject and guidance for the planning of resettlement and compensation are elaborated.
Under section G the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) is elaborated with emphasis
on the inclusion of the San peoples in a subproject. It is important that San communities in
conservancies and community forests participate in subproject planning, implementation and
monitoring and evaluation.

This document is intended to provide practical guidelines and assistance in the development of
subproject proposals, we thus encourage you to please comment on its usefulness and make
recommendations for its improvement.

A      Introduction

Introduction
       The Namibian approach towards Community-Based Natural Resource Management
       (CBNRM) is embedded in an initial policy and legal framework, that grants rights over
       wildlife and tourism management and uses to communities on their lands once they are
       organized as "conservancies." A communal conservancy consists in setting aside part or all
       of the land of a given community, with the intention to conserve and valorise wildlife
       through its sustainable consumptive and non-consumptive uses within nature-related
       activities. Namibia is leading this kind of enterprise even though other neighbouring
       countries have embarked in similar ventures.
       The national CBNRM/Conservancy programme responds to national development and
       environmental priorities by:
       - supporting sustainable use and conservation of Namibia's unique ecosystems and
            related biodiversity (the majority of biodiversity is found outside the National Park
            network);
       - promoting appropriate land management schemes in an environment where availability
            of water and suitable rangeland as well as land degradation are the key limiting factors
            to sustainable management of scarce resources;
       - contributing to reduce poverty in rural areas by providing diversified livelihood strategies
            through responsibility over local resources, thereby addressing the root causes of
            threats to unsustainable ecosystem management; and
       - promoting participatory, accountable and democratic systems of local and regional
            governance.

Purpose of ESMF
       The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) details agreed policies,
       guidelines, and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the ICEMA Project
       in target conservancies and community forests in Namibia. The Project will support the
       Government of Namibia, through its Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), with
       development of CBNRM to improve the livelihoods of rural people by enabling ecosystem-
       based income generation activities and conservation. The project is expected to be
       implemented over a five-year period. The project has been prepared in accordance with
       the World Bank's Operational Policies re: Indigenous People's Safeguard Policy (OD 4.10),
       Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).

       The project consists of 4 components and will support: (i) ecosystem-based income
       generating activities; (ii) sustainable ecosystem management; (iii) targeted institutional
       support (MET and conservancies) and; (iv) project management. The ICEMA Project is
       also being supported by the French Global Environment Facility1 with funding directed
       toward high-value plant and animal species' interventions.

       Good environmental and social management practice is a well-established element of
       project preparation and implementation. It is important in the context of a community-based
       project where technical skill is required for guidance in subproject planning and
       implementation and, impact and strategic assessments of environmental and social impact.

       Development of the ESMF therefore, attempts to provide a framework, covering all World
       Bank policies relevant to ICEMA, which must be used by MET officials, conservancies and
       support organizations during Project and subproject planning and implementation. The
       ESMF aims to:
       a. Set the scene for implementation of World Bank Safeguard Policies relevant to ICEMA;
       b. Enhance positive and sustainable environmental and social outcomes associated with
             Project implementation;
       c. Support the integration of environmental and social aspects (associated with the
             subprojects) into the planning and decision making process;
       d. Support the development of the San in conservancies and community forests and
             facilitate their improved roles and advancement in CBNRM and, benefits from CBNRM;
       e. Avoid or minimize negative environmental and social impacts;
       f.    Minimize environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their
             cumulative effects;
       g. Minimize/ avoid involuntary resettlement;
       h. Protect human health;
       i.    Minimize impacts on cultural property.

       Implementation of the ESMF in Namibia supports and assists with the achievement of
       compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with relevant Bank policies on
       environment and social development issues.

Objectives of ESMF
       The Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) provides an independent assessment of
       the ICEMA Project. The ESMF is based on recommendations from the ESA and
       incorporates the legislation of Namibia and the Operational Policies of the World Bank.


       The ESA was requested by the Bank to ensure that the proposed project is carried out in
       line with Namibia's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) policy, the emerging
       Environmental Management Bill, and the applicable World Bank Safeguard Policies. An
       initial internal review by the World Bank classified the project as a category B project
       according to Bank standards. Impacts of category B projects are likely to be site-specific,
       relatively easy to mitigate and reversible within reason.

       At the time of project preparation, on-the-ground activities (sub-projects) had not been
       identified. Thus, the appropriate safeguard instrument to prepare prior to project appraisal
       is the ESMF. It is expected that during project implementation detailed Environmental
       Management Plans (EMPs) will be prepared for sub-projects following guidelines in the
       ESMF. It remains the responsibility of the MET, as project implementing authority in
       Namibia, to ensure that necessary plans are developed, and the project implementers to
       ensure that they are adhered to


       The objectives of this Environmental and Social Management Framework are:
       a.    To establish clear procedures and methodologies for the environmental and social
             planning, review, approval and implementation of subprojects to be financed under the
             Project;
       b.    To specify appropriate roles and responsibilities, and outline the necessary reporting
             procedures, for managing and monitoring environmental and social concerns related
             to subprojects;

       c.    To determine the training, capacity building and technical assistance needed to
             successfully implement the provisions of the ESMF;
       d.    To establish the project funding required to implement the ESMF requirements;
       e.    To provide practical resources for implementing the ESMF.

Project scope
       The scope of the Project has been defined with the Government of Namibia and is
       articulated in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The CBNRM Programme in
       Namibia is multi-sectoral and encourages the integration of natural resources use or
       ecosystem-based approaches to resource utilisation and creation of income generating
       activities. The ESMF takes cognisance of this characteristic of CBNRM and caters for
       individual sectors as well as bi-sectoral or multi-sectoral approaches in subproject
       planning, development and implementation.
       The MET must ensure that Government stakeholders from different sectors participate in
       subproject development where more than one sector is involved.
       The ICEMA Project's ESMF is developed for CBNRM interventions under the Project's four
       components and will be operational at all times when ICEMA provides financial support.
       Therefore, the ESMF is triggered and becomes a mandatory operational framework even
       when ICEMA co-funds an initiative with another project or support organisation.

B      Project description

       Background and purpose of the ICEMA Project
       The project's on-the-ground activities will target communally managed lands represented
       through Namibia's "communal conservancy network". Therefore, the project also provides
       direct institutional support to the MET, which is the country's lead governmental agency
       responsible for guiding and overseeing the communal conservancy network under its
       "National Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Programme" (see
       annex 2 for more details on CBNRM Programme and communal conservancies).

       The CBNRM Programme in Namibia is based on an initial policy and legal framework
       which grants rights over wildlife and tourism management and uses to communities on
       their lands, once they are organized as "conservancies". Conservancies are multiple-use
       zones with legal status, registered with the authorities (Ministry of Environment and
       Tourism), where residents currently continue farming, but collectively manage wildlife in
       order to benefit both from better natural resource management practice, and from capturing
       tourism revenues. A communal conservancy consists in setting aside part or all of the land
       of a given community, with the intention to conserve and valorise wildlife, through its
       sustainable consumptive and non-consumptive uses within ecosystem-related activities.
       The committees that run conservancies aim to be multifunctional, serving as management
       structures for natural resources utilization and benefit distribution. The establishment of
       communal conservancies is seen as a fundamental step in improving local management
       capacity and linking it to benefits for communities in communal areas, promoting
       sustainable environmental management and rural development. The changes associated
       with the National CBNRM Programme are expected to impact differently on rural
       households depending on individual and communal factors like income levels, livestock
       wealth, tourism income, wild resource income, cash income, conservancy involvement,
       degree of common property management, employment and education as well as resource-
       based factors.

       The project targets registered and emerging communal conservancies as well as selected
       community forests.

       GEF and FFEM (French GEF) provide incremental financing for the ICEMA Project's four
       inter-related components that together serve to consolidate, add value to and build on the
       achievements of the National CBNRM Programme. It will also foster the shift from
       traditional natural resource management (mainly wildlife) to an integrated ecosystem
       management approach in targeted conservancies/community forests thereby enhancing
       globally significant biodiversity conservation and reducing land degradation. ICEMA will
       support targeted conservancies/community forests of global environmental priority
       complying with MET's and ICEMA's defined strategic criteria and confirmed through
       detailed stakeholder consultations.

       Project objectives
       Project Development Objective: Community-based integrated ecosystem management
          practices are supported by the national CBNRM framework and used by targeted
          conservancies
       Project Global Objective: To restore, secure and enhance key ecosystem processes in
          targeted conservancies with biodiversity and land conservation and sustainable use as a
          goal

       Component of the project that will finance subprojects

       Component 1: Ecosystem Based Income Generating Activities

       Conservancies are meant to benefit all community members through enabling managed
       access to natural resources based on micro-enterprise development, capacity in
       ecosystem management, income generation and access to employment. This component
       is concerned with sustainable use of natural resources and ecosystem services through
       provision of funds to communities for barrier removal to small-scale community-based
       economic activities, related capacity and governance building that generate equitable
       benefits to conservancies' members. It builds on the encouraging achievements of the first
       phase of the National CBNRM Programme related to community-based wildlife
       management activities and focuses on a broader range of sustainable ecosystem based
       livelihood options that can generate long term benefits.

       The barriers at local level have been identified as lack of grant funding accessible to poor
       emerging conservancies, lack of capacity, of knowledge, and of technical and financial
       support. Broader conducive incentive and policy framework will be addressed under
       component 3.
       Its overall objective: to contribute to increased economic benefits to community members
       from the sustainable use of their rich and diverse ecosystems.
       Specific objectives: This component will support the demonstration, development,
       implementation and monitoring of conservancy business frameworks and investments as
       part of their overall conservancy management plans. It specifically aims to:
       - provide resources for direct financing of community demand-driven ecosystem-based
            income-generating activities;
       - increase the viability of activities through tailored business planning, feasibility support,
            training and mentoring;
       - promote mechanisms for equitable sharing of costs and benefits;
       - develop and disseminate best practices for replication and up-scaling through
            monitoring and evaluation processes; and
       - contribute to improved participation in development planning processes at local and
            regional level.
       The two closely inter-related sub-components are the:
       a. Community Funding Facility (CFF): The sub-component focuses on the financing of
             subprojects to eligible (see selection criteria under B3) registered conservancies. CFF
             funded activities will target a diversity of aspects related to wildlife, tourism, forestry,
             and multi-sector with emphasis on community ownership.
       b. Capacity Building and Technical Assistance: This sub-component focuses on
             supporting the CFF through the following three sub-components:
             - developing clear procedures and disseminating information to eligible communities,
                with a view to informing them of the CFF and providing guidance on accessing the
                CFF.
             - technical support for strategic business planning at the conservancy level as part of
                the conservancy ecosystem management planning process, including a mechanism
                for benefit sharing at the conservancy level.
             - facilitation support for subproject development which will include:
                  i. technical support for subproject development including a mechanism for benefit
                     sharing. Feasibility studies will identify and assess costs and benefits for new
                     income-generating opportunities as well as provide guidance based on
                     marketing and management study results;

                      (TA) for training and mentoring to further strengthen capacity of local
                      stakeholders, and to ensure desired quality and standards of subprojects; and
                iii. follow-up support including management advice, knowledge management and
                      replication activities at local and national level. Through all these areas, the
                      facilitation support will also include provisions for ensuring that World Bank
                      safeguard policies relating to environmental assessment, resettlement, and
                      indigenous people are addressed.


The primary beneficiaries of this component are the CBOs in target conservancies, and the
constituent members of those conservancies.


Anticipated subproject types
          a. Primary activities:
              All subprojects will be demand-driven but any one subproject may include the
              following "primary activities" or some combination thereof:
               - Forestry ­ community woodlots, nurseries for indigenous plants, agro-forestry,
                    post harvest infrastructure (e.g. Devil's claw), crop cultivation for supply to
                    lodges/community halls, schools
               - Tourism ­ camps, lodges, trophy hunting/mounting, premium hunting, safaris
               - Homestead production ­ fish, venison, tannery/leather making, biltong, bee
                    keeping, wild silk, etc.
          b. Rehabilitation:
              - Rehabilitation of eco-tourism infrastructure
              - Rehabilitation of tourism access infrastructure re: feeder roads, bridges, culverts,
                  viewing sites and sign posts
              - Reclamation of degraded land in support of an eligible associated income
                  generation opportunity
              - Soil erosion control in support of an eligible associated income generating
                  opportunity
          c. Incidental social infrastructure
              Social Infrastructure typically includes publicly accessible facilities that would by
              themselves provide no direct income generating benefits. A subproject may include
              such infrastructure, however, provided that the cost of it is not greater than 25% of
              the entire subproject proposal and that such infrastructure is directly connected to the
              principle activity supported by the subproject. Examples of such infrastructure might
              include:
              - Publicly accessible water supply or associated water points.
              - Publicly accessible latrines or similar.
              - Local publicly accessible recreational facilities of benefit to local communities and
                  visitors
              - Public use educational facilities, such as an environmental awareness training
                  facility. Schools are not eligible.
          d. Non ecosystem-based income generating activities
              Many income generating activities are not directly connected to the ecosystem
              (providing neither positive nor negative impacts on the ecosystem), but they may
              nonetheless have positive indirect benefits because they reduce poverty and directly
              support investments that promote sustainable management of the important
              ecosystem targeted by this project. A subproject will not wholly fund such activities,

              but may include them provided that their cost is not greater than 25% of the entire
              subproject proposal. Examples of activities might include:
              -   Establishment of professional contracting services (accounting, legal, consulting,
                  marketing).
              -   Establishment of secondary service industries (laundry, maintenance, gardening,
                  bakery, sewing).
              -   Brick making.

Subproject exclusions
            a. Social infrastructure unless it falls within the 25% guideline as noted above.
            b. Income generating activities that are not connected to ecosystem services or
                resources, unless such activities fall within the 25% guideline as noted above.
            c. Agriculture: activities that would result in a net loss of forests, agricultural
                expansion, large scale agricultural activities (commercial logging).
            d. Forestry production activities especially conversion of forest land to other land use
            e. Large scale drainage and Irrigation including:
                - Construction of dams and reservoirs.
                - Artificial enlargement of lakes with surface areas of 20ha or more.
                - Drainage of wetland wildlife habitat or of virgin forest covering an area of 5ha or
                   more.
                - Irrigation schemes covering an area of 50ha or more per community.
            f.  Activities that would negatively impact cultural property (e.g. land clearance for
                cultivation).
            g. Acquisition of land (whether individually or communally owned).
            h. However, if land is needed for construction of a subproject it would be seen as part
                of the community contribution and the CBO would need to provide written
                confirmation that standards and guidance set forth in the Resettlement Action Plan
                were followed and affected individuals have been adequately compensated.
            i.  Rehabilitation/ construction and industry:
                -    Housing development
                - Large scale industrial plants and industrial estates including major expansion
                - Rehabilitation or modification.
                - New land development
                - New construction or major upgrading of roads or highways
                - Construction of ports
                - Mining or quarries
                - Construction of railways
                - Construction or rehabilitation of places of worship
                - Power generation and transmission.
            j.  River basin development (i.e., large scale development and construction in riparian
                areas that would impact downstream systems).
            k. Manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous and/or toxic
                materials.
            l.  Firewood production or briquette manufacture
            m. Any form of physical resettlement
            n. Waste treatment and disposal of the following types:
                - Hazardous waste management.
                - Construction of incineration plant.
                - Construction of recovery plant (off-site).
                - Construction of waste water treatment plant (off-site).

Other criteria
          a. Community "Self Help" Contribution
                Every subproject proposal must contain an estimate of the community contribution
                to the activity in qualitative and monetary terms. As a general guideline, the
                valuation of this contribution should not be less than 10% of the subproject amount
                applied for (example: for a N$200,000 application, the local contribution should
                have a cash or in-kind value of at least N$20,000).
          b. Thresholds
                The normal threshold for subprojects will be N$500,000. Subprojects above these
                thresholds will be considered but will be subject to the following additional
                constraints:
                - GEF-ICEMA funds will be available for at most two such subprojects. These
                    subprojects will be subject to prior review through standard WB Supervision
                    protocols.
                - Subproject financial management and procurement will be more closely
                    scrutinized by the MET/PO with the same prior review thresholds to those for
                    the ICEMA project as a whole.
                - The community ownership proposals for such subprojects (see below) must
                    include explicit discussion of the ownership structure and, if 100% of the
                    investment is not owned by the community at turn-over, the plan must include a
                    mechanism that specifies the period and means for assuring eventual 100%
                    community ownership.
          c. Primary activity
                Normally, the positive list permits a subproject to have up to 25% social
                infrastructure or 25% non ecosystem-based income generating activities. This
                would imply that the primary activity must therefore, constitute at least one-half of
                the sub-proposal investment. However, a working guideline for any subproject shall
                be that no less than 70% of that subproject's investments will apply to the primary
                activity (implying that not both the 25% limits can be taken advantage of in any
                given subproject). In special circumstances, this guideline may be waived.
          d. Ownership proposal
                Each subproject proposal will include an ownership statement that affirms that the
                beneficiary of the subproject is the CBO and that 100% ownership of any
                equipment, works or other property (including intellectual property) resides with the
                CBO upon subproject closure. If the subproject contribution is for a joint venture
                arrangement (with the private sector), the ownership proposal must detail the
                ownership structure of the JV. Such JVs will only be considered for subproject
                requests in excess of N$250,000; subprojects below this threshold must show
                100% ownership by the CBO.
          e. Conflicting positive and negative selection criteria
                The negative list takes precedence over the positive list. Subprojects that may
                have elements that are on both lists will be rejected.
          f.  Distribution of subprojects
                The intent of ICEMA is to develop a diversity of subprojects across a broad
                spectrum of potential tourism, wildlife, and forestry opportunities. For the first year,
                no specific targeting is included but such targeting may be introduced in later years
                of the ICEMA project (years 2 ­ 5) if the portfolio of subprojects does not exhibit an
                adequate distribution. Such targeting criteria may be introduced at the time of the
                annual work plan.

          g. Replication of subprojects
                The intent of ICEMA is to provide replication opportunities for successful subproject
                activities. A Replication Plan (RP) will be developed for the project as a whole at
                the time of mid-term review (Year 2.5). At that stage, the RP may ­ based on
                lessons learned from the first 2 project years ­ call for the introduction of additional
                criteria to ensure successful replication of successful activities.

Project coordination and implementation
       The below information details stakeholders involved in the coordination and implementation
       of ICEMA.

       MET ­ is the national executing agency responsible for the overall implementation of the
       ICEMA Project. The Permanent Secretary of MET is the chairperson of the ICEMA
       Steering Committee with all directors being members. MET is responsible for ensuring the
       smooth and efficient implementation of the project's various technical programmes. MET's
       directorates (including DSS, DPWM, DoT and DEA and others as necessary) cooperate
       through a Steering Committee that provides guidance to the technical aspects of all project
       activities; individual directorates may take the lead on some activities but in general all
       directorates potentially contribute to providing technical input for all project sub-
       components.
       Environmental Assessment (EA) Unit ­ Is the entry point for the consideration of an EIA for
       a subproject. Through the EA Unit, MET will fulfil the role of the competent authority, or
       appoint the competent authority, as outlined in section C4 above.

       Directorate of Forestry, MAWF ­ The Directorate of Forestry (DoF) is the lead Government
       agency dealing with forestry and related resource issues. The DoF was still under MET
       when ICEMA was designed, appraised and approved for GEF/World Bank funding.
       Consequently, DoF is mentioned as the responsible agency for the implementation and
       coordination of forest and fire integration and management and will take the lead in this
       arena.

       ICEMA PO ­ The PO is established by the MET under the lead of the Permanent
       Secretary. The PO provides technical support for all day to day activities of project
       implementation. This includes coordination of all project planning (work plans, etc.), and
       execution of all procurement and financial management and project reporting. It provides
       secretariat services (meeting organization, agenda, etc.) to the MET Steering Committee.
       The PO also coordinates project performance monitoring. It is directly responsible for
       accepting, reviewing, and awarding subproject proposals under the CFF; and providing
       oversight of the subproject funds awarded to individual community-based organisations.
       The PO will provide technical assistance funds to communities for subproject planning,
       feasibility studies and business planning under the CFF funding modalities.

       Technical and Scientific Advisory Roster (TSAR) - The role of the TSAR is to act as a
       resource available to the MET and the PO for quality control, due diligence, and risk
       mitigation. The role is not to engage in the oversight of the project. The Steering
       Committee will have access to inputs as needed upon contracting specific inputs from one
       or more individuals on the Roster. The Steering Committee may recommend contracting a
       specific advisor through an honorarium arrangement (i.e., through payment of professional
       fees to someone on the roster of experts to be maintained by the PO). The advisor may in

       term recommend a longer term research study that is supported under the Research
       component of ICEMA.
       Members on the roster will be categorized by areas of expertise to facilitate their
       identification for needed tasks. Areas of designated expertise will include those associated
       with project safeguard (environmental, resettlement, indigenous people) and will, for
       example, thus include at least one expert on social issues.

       Communities ­ are essential to the process of subproject identification and the subproject
       cycle. As mentioned earlier, conservancy members must be at the forefront of all the
       planning that results in a CMP; providing the framework for developments and decision
       making. Planning of activities under the CMP must already consider possible negative
       impacts on the environment so that communities are aware of the possibility that an activity
       might be reconsidered at higher level. It must be emphasised that all interested and
       affected parties (I&AP) must participate in community consultations regarding proposed
       developments.

       Government extension staff ­ is field based and in many cases play a similar role as
       support organisations. Extension staff knows and understand the legal framework within
       which conservancies operate and can thus guide communities on the possibility of potential
       subprojects. They also have technical knowledge about the resources they work with and
       can contribute immense value to management planning (zonation of resources, migratory
       routes, seasonality, etc) as well as judging the merit of an idea for a subproject. Extension
       staff can play an important role in subproject planning, environmental and social screening
       and, planning prevention or mitigatory measures.

       Support organisations and WIMSA ­ are NGOs operating at local level and provides wide
       support assistance and possible avenues for funding to conservancies. Support
       organisations (SOs) have been and are still very helpful with assistance in management
       planning, institutional/governance issues and other livelihood related matters. If a
       community so chooses, the technical assistance from a local NGO can be sourced to
       facilitate the identification and development of a subproject proposal. The community's
       ideas and aspirations must be at the forefront while the support organisation guides with
       technical input for e.g., what is possible, what is feasible, potential negative social and/or
       environmental impacts, long-term sustainability, etc.
       The Working group for Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) is appointed as
       the Indigenous Peoples (IP) Association for ICEMA, directly targeting San communities in
       conservancies and community forests. WIMSA's core technical assistance will be; 1) to
       improve technical capacities of IPs, through resource mobilisation, to participate actively in
       CBNRM, 2) facilitate the representation of IPs in all decision making bodies of the relevant
       conservancies, community forests and the CFF and, 3) sensitise IPs on the risk of losing
       traditional knowledge, culture and livelihood patterns. WIMSA will liaise closely with
       communities, extension staff and support organisations in delivering their technical
       assistance to communities.

       Other ­ may be Land Boards, Local Authorities, EIA experts, social experts, etc. When
       deemed necessary the ICEMA PO will source input from relevant stakeholders for the
       appraisal and approval of a subproject.

Criteria for ICEMA project target areas
            The project will support selected conservancies and community-forests (part of or
            adjacent to conservancies):
            - with global environmentally important assets (in or around biodiversity hotspots
                and/or national parks and/or key ecosystem types);
            - with strong community-driven demand and ownership for the move from a
                community-based wildlife management (present) to an Integrated Ecosystem
                Management (long-term) approach;
            - with strong potential for sustainability (socio-economic, financial and institutional);
            - where GEF catalytic role leads to additional leverage of resources addressing root
                causes and other local development needs (partnering with other projects and
                programmes adding value to the National Programme) and where funds are limited
                but financial viability is expected over time;
            - contributing to the development of best practices (e.g., through partnerships
                between conservancies and other natural resource managers and users);
            - in localities where community-based organizations are in place or emerging;
            - where scaling-up and replication is facilitated within National CBNRM Programme;
                and
            - where it favours an integrated landscape approach and a mix of ecosystem types.

C      Environmental and social management requirements

The World Bank has developed a number of Safeguard Operational Policies to ensure that all
possible negative impacts are considered and mitigation measures are spelled out prior to the
implementation of any proposed project. These policies ensure that the quality of operations is
uniform across different settings worldwide. If the decision is taken that a Safeguard Policy should
be applied, mitigation measures and plans must be developed and in place before the
implementation of a proposed project. In the case of the ICEMA Project three Safeguard Policies
were triggered. These are Environment Assessment (OP 4.01); Involuntary Resettlement (OP
4.12); and Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). The appropriate safeguards instruments prepared by
the ICEMA project to address these triggered policies include an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF), an Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan (IPDP), and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).

The ICEMA PO will do its utmost to facilitate required capacity and understanding about the
Safeguard Instruments, their implementation and access to information. The Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) Specialist of the PO will screen subprojects to see whether any of the
Instruments are triggered. If a policy is triggered the PO will provide or source technical
assistance to conservancies/ community forests with regard to compliance, planning and
mitigation measures. The ESMF provides guidance for appropriate responses to Safeguards.
Below following are descriptions of the policies preceded by brief contextualisation under the
World Bank.

World Bank Operational Policies

       Environmental Assessment Operational Policy (OP 4.01)
       Environmental Assessment (EA) is one of the 10 environmental, social, and legal
       Safeguard Operational Policies of the World Bank. The Bank uses EA to identify, avoid,
       and mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts associated with Bank (lending)
       operations. The purpose of EA is to improve decision making, to ensure that project
       options under consideration are sound and sustainable, and that potentially affected people
       have been properly consulted.

       EA evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence
       (i.e. national CBNRM environment and conservancies specifically); examines project
       alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection, planning, design, and
       implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse
       environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of
       mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project (subproject)
       implementation. The Bank favours preventive measures over mitigatory or compensatory
       measures, whenever feasible.

       EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and
       safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property);
       and transboundary and global environmental aspects. EA considers natural and social
       aspects in an integrated way. It also takes into account the variations in project and country
       conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national environmental action
       plans; the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional
       capabilities related to the environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country,
       pertaining to project activities, under relevant international environmental treaties and
       agreements. EA is initiated as early as possible in project processing and is integrated


Copyright © ICEMA Project ­ MET/GEF/WB            12

       closely with the economic, financial, institutional, social, and technical analyses of a
       proposed project. Hence, ICEMA's Environmental and Social Assessment.

       The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project to determine the
       appropriate extent and type of EA. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of
       four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and
       the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. ICEMA is categorised as
       a Category B project re: these impacts are site-specific; few if any of them are irreversible;
       and in most cases mitigatory measures can be designed more readily.

       During project implementation, the following need to be reported to the Bank:
       a.     compliance with measures agreed with the Bank on the basis of the findings and
       results of the EA, including implementation of any Environmental Management Plan (EMP),
       as set out in the project documents;
       b.     the status of mitigatory measures; and
       c.     the findings of monitoring programmes.

       Indigenous Peoples Operational Policy (OP 4.10)
       The Indigenous Peoples Policy contributes to the Bank's mission to reduce poverty and
       promote sustainable development by ensuring that Indigenous People's (IP) human rights,
       dignity, cultures and economies are fully respected. Through this policy, the Bank
       recognises that IP's identities and cultures are inextricably linked to the lands on which
       they live and the natural resources they are dependent on. These distinct characteristics
       and circumstances make IPs vulnerable to different types of risks, and levels of impacts
       from development projects. Such risks include loss of identity, culture and customary
       livelihoods as well as exposure to negative health impacts (disease). IPs are often
       characterised by identities distinct from that of the dominant groups in their national
       society, and are thus, frequently among the most marginalised and vulnerable parts of the
       population. As a result, their capacities are often times limited by low economic, social and
       legal status to defend their interests in, and rights to lands, territories and other resources.
       Their overall status in society also restricts their ability to participate in, and benefit from
       development. The Bank recognises the vital role that IPs play in sustainable development
       and the fact that their rights receive increasing attention and action under domestic and
       international law.

       In light of the above, this Policy includes measures to;
       i.     Avoid potentially adverse effects on the Indigenous People's communities; or
       ii.    When avoidance is not feasible, minimise, mitigate or compensate for such effects.

       ICEMA's Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) targets the San peoples of
       Namibia. ICEMA will strive to better the San people's positions in conservancies/
       community forests by encouraging their roles in decision making and overall participation,
       especially in subproject planning and implementation.

       See section H on Indigenous Peoples and ICEMA's Indigenous Peoples Development Plan
       (IPDP) for elaborate information about the Project's position on indigenous peoples in
       target areas.


       Other indigenous peoples in Namibia
       There are other groups in Namibia whose identities and cultures are inextricably linked to
       the lands on which they live and the natural resources they are dependent on; who are also

       vulnerable to risks such as loss of identity, culture and customary livelihoods as well as
       exposure to negative health impacts (disease). These groups, such as the Himba and
       Tjimba, are also characterised by having identities distinct from that of the dominant groups
       in the Namibian national society, and are among the most marginalised and vulnerable
       parts of the Namibian population. Although the World Bank has not recognised these
       groups as "Indigenous Peoples" it will be important for ICEMA and the MET to ensure that
       these groups are not negatively affected by project activities. It will be important to ensure
       that in conservancies where they are in a minority, their role in decision-making is
       promoted.


       Involuntary Resettlement Operational Policy (OP 4.12)
       World Bank experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development projects,
       if unmitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and environmental risks:
       production systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment when their productive
       assets or income sources are lost; people are relocated to environments where their
       productive skills may be less applicable and the competition for resources greater;
       community institutions and social networks are weakened; kin groups are dispersed; and
       cultural identity, traditional authority, and the potential for mutual help are diminished or
       lost. This policy includes safeguard to address and mitigate these impoverishment risks.

       Involuntary resettlement applies not only to the physical relocation but also if there is an
       impact on assets or loss of livelihood as well as access to natural resources.

       Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term hardship, impoverishment, and
       environmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out.
       For these reasons, the overall objectives of the Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement
       are the following:
       i.    Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all
             viable alternative project designs.
       ii. Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
             conceived and executed as sustainable development programmes, providing sufficient
             investment resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project
             benefits. Displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have
             opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programmes.
       iii. Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
             standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels
             or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is
             higher.

       In the context of the ICEMA Project it is unlikely that involuntary resettlement will take place
       as a result of project activities. The main activities that could lead to some form of
       resettlement are the following:

          - Establishment of core wildlife areas or game camps where no settlement is allowed
          - Zoning of an area by a conservancy exclusively for tourism
          - Establishment of tourism facilities such as camp sites or lodges

       In all of these cases such developments are most likely to take place in areas of the
       conservancy where there is no permanent settlement. The most likely impact on local
       people would be loss of access to the resources in these areas. Where ICEMA is involved
       in activities that result in such impacts, the project and MET will ensure that all those

       affected have been involved in the decision-making and that measures are taken to provide
       adequate compensation for the loss of such resources. Actual examples of such
       compensation used by conservancies include giving preference to those most negatively
       affected for jobs in tourism facilities established in the areas to which people have lost
       access. Other examples include the negotiation of access to these areas for emergency
       grazing.

       In cases where resettlement becomes necessary, it is part of the responsibility of the
       conservancy to ensure that such resettlement is negotiated and is voluntary. If a family
       does not want to move, the first response will be to see whether the boundaries of the
       proposed area cannot be amended. Another measure will be to see whether that family
       cannot be incorporated into the development e.g. employed in the campsite, or to look after
       the wildlife in a game camp. It is difficult to envisage a situation in the ICEMA context
       where involuntary resettlement, impact on assets, or loss of livelihood might actually take
       place. If for some unforeseen reason this becomes necessary then ICEMA and MET will
       ensure that a Resettlement Action Plan is developed in line with World Bank guidelines.

National Environmental Management Requirements
       Namibia has an Environmental Assessment (EA) policy that stipulates the process that
       should be followed in conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) (see Annex
       4). The policy has given rise to the drafting of the Environmental Management Bill (EMB),
       which has not yet been gazetted. The EMB recognizes that the agency in charge of the
       EIA process is the MET, although it requires the MET to work in close collaboration with
       the line ministry responsible for the type of activity envisaged. These ministries are referred
       to in the EMB as the competent authority. For example, whilst tourism and wildlife related
       activities are the responsibility of MET itself, the drilling of boreholes and livestock related
       issues fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF),
       while the resettlement of people is controlled by the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and
       Rehabilitation (MLRR). Most EIAs are triggered by the need for a developer to obtain a
       permit from a competent authority, but in some cases (e.g. resettlement) there is no need
       for a permit even though an EIA might be required.

       Once it comes into force the EMB will effectively replace the EA policy. As noted earlier in
       this ESMF, an EIA need not be undertaken for every project that is initiated by the
       conservancy. On the contrary, smaller projects should be able to go ahead without an EIA
       being done at all, as long as they have been well planned, thoroughly screened for impact
       and carefully-considered mitigation measures have been incorporated into the project
       design. The key to good planning is considering all the issues and consulting Interested
       and Affected Parties (I&AP) early in the planning process ­ when the conservancy is
       developing its CMP. Nevertheless, the conservancy should be aware of the contents of the
       EA policy and they should still indicate to MET what projects they want to implement. MET
       will then be in a position to decide whether an EIA is necessary or not.

       ICEMA will adhere to, and ensure compliance with the EIA Policy for subproject proposing,
       planning and implementation pending the gazetting of the EMB.

       ICEMA will seek to enhance conservancy management planning and, subproject
       identification and planning by ensuring that communities have technical resources
       available to identify potential negative impacts of a proposed subproject.

D      Subproject preparation, approval and implementation

       This section outlines generic steps that the PO will facilitate, coordinate and oversee for
       subproject identification, preparation, approval and implementation using institutional
       arrangements and procedures outlined by the CFF. The typical project cycle includes three
       phases re: Phase 1 ­ identification and planning (1 ­ 6 months), Phase 2 ­ implementation
       (6 ­ 24 months), Phase 3 ­ management and operation (ongoing).

Preparation and application
       A conservancy will have a Conservancy Management Plan in place prior to identifying and
       preparing a subproject application. Like with the CMP, the preparation of a subproject
       proposal should be consultative/ participatory and can be done in consultation with
       extension teams and/or a SO chosen by the conservancy. Technical guidance and input is
       crucial to ensure that all environmental and social concerns are thoroughly considered from
       the start of the identification and planning process. To facilitate environmental and social
       screening the ESMF provides a checklist for screening (Annex 1) and, information on
       typical project impacts and mitigation measures (Annex 2). The checklist will assist
       communities and extension/ SO staff with the identification of potential impacts based on
       available knowledge and field investigations. Once the checklist is completed, it serves as
       certification by the community and a technical assistance team (extension and/or SO staff),
       that the subproject funding application addressed all potential impacts and prescribes
       measures necessary to avoid or minimise adverse environmental and social impacts. In the
       event that initial screening of subproject applications suggests that environmental or social
       concerns are significant, procedures outlined in the ESMF will be followed to plan for
       minimisation or mitigation. Such procedures, for example, may include site-specific EIAs,
       pro-active participatory planning involving outreach to disadvantaged groups, or redesign
       of subproject proposals to provide adequate compensation for, or involvement by
       disadvantaged groups.

       Some subproject situations and mitigation measures will need to be specified more
       precisely and in detail than others, either in the application or as an annex. Such subproject
       situations include;
       a. Land must be acquired, assets are impacted, someone's access to resources is
             restricted/ has changed, or loss of livelihood results for a subproject: The need for a
             RAP must be determined and, if needed, prepared according to guidelines appearing
             in the RPF of ICEMA.
       b. A subproject may affect a natural habitat or forest area: The application must describe
             how this subproject will avoid causing adverse effects on the area/habitat, as outlined
             in section F of this document.
       c. An indigenous people may be adversely affected by a subproject, or could benefit from
             it: The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) of ICEMA needs to be consulted
             and technical assistance sourced where necessary.

       Special planning reports
       Serious negative environmental and/or social impacts may necessitate one of the following
       Special Planning Reports; Environmental Management Plan (EMP ­ also see section D) ­
       detailing monitoring and assessment of (cumulative) impacts and, mitigatory actions;
       and/or a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) ­ detailing reasons for proposed resettlement,
       the proposed consultation plan with affected parties and a plan for actual implementation of
       proposed involuntary resettlement under the subproject. The ESMF provides guidelines for
       such planning reports but ICEMA discourages the need for any Special Planning Reports

Copyright © ICEMA Project ­ MET/GEF/WB            17

       under subprojects. In the event that a subproject proposal of high quality and potential
       necessitates special planning, ICEMA will source and avail technical assistance to the
       conservancy.


To ensure most effective use of resources a subproject application can be approved in principle
on the condition that additional planning reports will be provided to the PO. In such situations this
ESMF emphasises that; a subproject cannot be finally approved and funded until such reports are
received, approved and disclosed.


       A subproject application will not be considered if full community participation (or
       representation thereof) was not part of the subproject identification and preparation
       processes.

Appraisal and approval
       Subproject appraisal and approval will follow the process as outlined below. It is essential
       that all CBNRM stakeholders, especially conservancy members are familiar with this
       process and know and understand the roles and responsibilities of various
       authorities/technical people at different levels as appropriate.

       ICEMA PO serves as the review and approval authority for final (desk/field) appraisal and
       approval.

       The ESMF is mindful of the Namibian conservancy context and does not commit
       subproject appraisal and approval to a rigid process. Each subproject application will be
       considered based on its scope, nature and potential impact. Two scenarios are elaborated
       below to demonstrate the flexibility and pragmatism of the approach.

       A relatively large subproject, e.g. community lodge, may require higher level technical input
       (re: quantity surveying, architectural, construction), approval from authorities (access to
       land/other resources), an EIA, an EMP, a RAP where necessary and a rigorous monitoring
       programme. In this situation, the PO will identify and attract relevant technical expertise to
       assist communities and, the appraisal and approval process will take longer. In this
       situation, the PO will identify and attract relevant technical expertise to assist communities
       and, the appraisal and approval process will take longer. In contrast, a community may
       apply for once-off funding for equipment to start an activity, e.g. an electrical saw for wood
       production. The CFF funding is thus sourced for procurement and resource mobilisation
       and not operational cost. In this instance, the activity may not pose severe environmental
       (collection of dead wood) and social (no resettlement and/or exclusion of minorities) harm,
       will not trigger any safeguard and no higher level technical input is necessary. The PO thus
       follows standard procurement procedure for the equipment. In this scenario, very little time
       is lost and communities can as soon as possible engage in their proposed activity. For
       such small funding applications the community must still demonstrate involvement, benefit
       sharing and the potential future sustainability of the activity.
       Appraisal
       Once the community has finalised the application it is submitted to the PO for appraisal and
       approval.
       The first step in a desk appraisal is to determine if all relevant information has been
       provided, and if it is adequate.
       From an environmental and social point of view, the PO will determine whether the
       community and extension team have thoroughly considered all the potential adverse


Copyright © ICEMA Project ­ MET/GEF/WB             18

       effects of the subproject, and included measures in the subproject plan to adequately
       address them. This will be based on a certified checklist submitted to the PO (Annex 1).

       If the desk appraisal finds that environmental and social impacts were not adequately
       considered, or meets specific criteria as indicated in Annex 3, the PO requires a field
       appraisal before the application will be considered further. The PO will source necessary
       expertise to embark on a field visit to determine the extent of potential environmental and
       social impact by the subproject. Such expertise can be sourced from the TSAR or
       elsewhere. The field appraisal will make reference to the checklists completed and certified
       by the community and extension team and, will make recommendations for special
       planning based on new findings.
       Following the field appraisal the PO will, when relevant/necessary, prescribe conditions of
       approval. If such a condition is the production of a Special Planning Report, a timeline will
       be agreed for its production and submission. The subproject application can only be finally
       approved upon receipt thereof.

       Approval
       When the PO finds a subproject application satisfactory in terms of the guidelines,
       conditions and procedures in this ESMF the application will be approved and communities
       will engage in a grant agreement with ICEMA.

Disclosure of subproject information
       Before a subproject is approved the PO will make Special Planning Reports (IPDP, EIA,
       EMP, RAP) available for public review at a place accessible to local people and in a form,
       manner and language they can understand. The general public will be invited to comment
       on these reports prior to their approval.

Reports
       As a general rule, subprojects with a lifespan of one year or more will report to the ICEMA
       PO on a quarterly basis. Subprojects with a lifespan of three months to one year will report
       to the ICEMA PO on a monthly basis. Depending on the scope and nature of the
       subproject the PO and conservancy can agree on different reporting modalities.

Mid-term review
       The ICEMA Project and this ESMF will be reviewed by an independent consultant 36
       months after ICEMA became effective. The purpose of the reviews is;
       For ICEMA
       - Management performance: project response to community demands, efficiency in
            procurement, disbursement, accounting practices and subproject cost control;
       - Physical implementation of project targets, implementation rate and investment spread
            across sites
       For the ESMF
       - to assess compliance with ESMF procedures, learn lessons, and improve future ESMF
            performance; and
       - to assess the occurrence of, and potential for, cumulative impacts due to Project-funded
            activities.

E      Environmental management

       Through the CFF, ICEMA promotes income generation through sustainable integrated
       ecosystem management (IEM) activities. As much as a subproject demonstrates long term
       economic sustainability it must at all times avoid adverse environmental impacts.
       "Environment" in this context encompasses the natural environment and human health and
       safety. Conservancies and community forests are encouraged to bear safeguard, social
       and environmental impacts in mind once an idea has been formalised and agreed upon for
       a subproject. This ESMF has checklists annexed that will facilitate impact screening but the
       ICEMA PO can avail technical assistance, when needed, to communities for impact
       screening early in the development of a subproject proposal.

Planning at conservancy level
       The ICEMA Project encourages conservancies to undertake as much of the planning and
       decision-making as possible at the local level, since this is an important aspect of capacity
       building and empowerment. However, it is also necessary that the conservancy maintains
       a direct line of communication with the MET, especially on issues that are likely to require
       higher level planning, such as an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
       Conservancies must develop their own Conservancy Management Plans (CMPs). This
       must be done in consultation with all the conservancy members (inclusive of all Interested
       and Affected Parties) and relevant stakeholders so that a consensus-based plan can be
       produced. Participation by extension staff of government ministries (especially MET) and
       SOs can be extremely beneficial through provision of technical advice. The CMP serves as
       framework for all future decision making and sets out clearly what will be allowed to
       happen in each area. It should clearly identify;
       - All individual projects that are likely to be implemented;
       - how the land in the conservancy will be used (zonation), and by whom;
       - who is responsible for undertaking the various tasks; and
       - how decisions will be communicated to the members and residents of the conservancy;
          and to support organizations that might be working with the conservancy.
       Thus, the above must be in place when a conservancy develops a subproject application
       for funding by the CFF. ICEMA makes funds available for technical assistance to
       conservancies for the development of CMPs. Based on information in the CMP about
       future proposed activities, preliminary environmental and social screening can be done.

                                       Formal EIA Process




 Figure 2: Demonstrates a Management Planning process for a conservancy (ESA 2003)

 Environmental impact assessment (EIA)
        Namibia's Environmental Assessment policy is clear on the process that must be followed
        in the mitigation of impacts through conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).
        However, long before an EIA is contemplated or done; the planning system within the
        conservancies needs to be followed (Figure 2).
        EIAs will be conducted very pragmatically to ensure that the implementation of subprojects
        with negligible impacts is not slowed down and that ones with serious potential negative
        impact are thoroughly screened and assessed prior to funding approval.

 Environmental management plan (EMP)
        Certain activities will have explicit impact on the natural environment and thus require a
        specific plan to institute and monitor mitigation measures and take desired actions as
        timely as possible. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) at conservancy/ community
        forest level must be kept as simple as possible, clearly describing adverse impacts and
        mitigation actions that are easy to implement. The scale of the subproject will determine
        the length of the EMP. A small-scale subproject's EMP can be elaborated in a few
        paragraphs or in tabular format (Annex 5 as example), keeping it as simple as possible
        with concrete mitigation actions, timelines and responsible persons. The basic elements of
        an EMP are;
        a. A description of the possible adverse effects that the EMP is intended to deal with;
        b. A description of planned mitigation measures, and how and when they will be
              implemented;
        c. A programme for monitoring the environmental effects of the project ­ both positive
              and negative;
        d. A description of who will be responsible for implementing the EMP; and

       e. A cost estimate and source of funds

       The community must participate in the development of the EMP since local knowledge is
       important in identifying, designing and planning the implementation. In addition, the
       success of the implementation of the EMP will depend on community support and action;
       ownership is essential.

Cultural property
       The World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.11) defines cultural property as; "...including
       sites having archaeological (prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious, and unique
       natural values". It thus includes both remains left by previous human inhabitants (e.g.
       middens, shrines, rock art and battlegrounds) and unique natural environmental features
       such as canyons and waterfalls.

       The EIA Policy considers biophysical, social, archaeological and cultural issues as all being
       part of the environment. Hence, impact screening for a subproject must include firstly,
       identifying the presence of cultural property (as defined above) and secondly, determining
       whether the proposed subproject may damage such property. ICEMA will establish contact
       with the National Monuments Council to solicit their cooperation with regard to the
       identification of cultural property within conservancies/ community forests.

Natural habitats and forest areas
       The World Bank's Operational Policy (OP 4.04) defines natural habitat as land and water
       areas where i) the ecosystem's biological communities are formed largely by native plant
       and animal species, and ii) human activity has not essentially modified the area's primary
       ecological functions. The operational policy also distinguishes between;
       a. Critical natural habitats (e.g. existing protected areas and areas officially proposed by
            Governments as protected areas, areas initially recognised as protected by traditional
            local communities (e.g. sacred graves), and sites that maintain conditions vital for the
            viability of these protected areas (as determined by the EIA process).
       b. Significant conversion is the elimination or severe diminution of the integrity of a critical
            or other natural habitat caused by a major, long-term change in land or water use (e.g.
            land clearing; replacement of natural vegetation; permanent flooding; drainage,
            dredging, filling, or channelisation of wetlands; or surface mining).
       c. Degradation is modification of a critical or other natural habitat that substantially
            reduces the habitat's ability to maintain viable populations of its native species.


       Subprojects cannot be funded if they involve the significant conversion or degradation of
       natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives (including the subproject site) and
       the overall benefits from the subproject substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If a
       subproject would significantly convert or degrade a natural habitat, the ESMF specifies that
       the subproject needs to incorporate acceptable mitigation measures such as minimizing
       habitat loss and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar area.


       One of the aims of the conservancy approach is to halt or reduce further modification and
       maintain areas of natural habitat within the conservancy. Management planning (in
       conservancies and community forests), through the zonation of land use and resources,
       aid in spatially defining important areas and prompt the need, through technical assistance
       (TA), for ongoing monitoring and conservation of natural habitats and forest areas. TA,
       provided by government extension and/or support organisation staff, can play a vital role
       during the visioning and management planning exercise to provide communities with


Copyright © ICEMA Project ­ MET/GEF/WB            - 22 -

       pertinent information about the occurrence and importance of natural habitats and forest
       areas. Where management plans are not coarsely accurate in the zonation of natural
       habitat and forest area ICEMA can provide resources for updates.

       The above must be considered during a subproject's impact screening and if/when an EIA
       is necessary it will be considered explicitly during the scoping stage (see Annex 4 for EIA
       Process).

       Annex 6 provides guidance for subproject planning with respect to natural habitat and
       forest area.

F      Land acquisition and access to resources

Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
       The World Bank's policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) applies to all land
       acquisition, impact on assets, or loss of livelihood and any changes in access. The policy
       applies whether or not affected persons must move to another location. The Bank
       describes all these processes and outcomes as "involuntary resettlement," or simply
       resettlement, even when people are not forced to move.

       Involuntary resettlement ­ if affected people do not have the option to retain the livelihood
       situation that they have before a subproject begins. The Bank's policy on involuntary
       resettlement requires a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for any subproject that
       involuntarily displaces people from land or productive resources, and the displacement
       results in:
       i.    relocation, the loss of shelter, the loss of assets or access to assets important to
             production;
       ii.   the loss of income sources or means of livelihood; or
       iii. the loss of access to locations that provide higher incomes or lower expenditures to
             businesses or persons.

       The Bank's overall objectives when dealing with involuntary resettlement:
       a. Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all
            viable alternative project designs.
       b. Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
            conceived and executed as sustainable development programmes, providing sufficient
            investment resources to enable the persons affected by the project to share in project
            benefits. Affected persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have
            opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programmes.
       c. Affected persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
            standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels
            or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is
            higher.

       The Conservancy Committee (with TA) is responsible for developing a RAP and the
       process must be consultative and transparent. Annex 7 provides guidance for i) identifying
       the need for a RAP and ii) if necessary, developing the RAP. Once the RAP is developed it
       will undergo the below steps toward approval.
       a. The RAP must be submitted to the Land Board for the region within which the
             conservancy is based, and the board should provide its opinion about the
             appropriateness of the RAP (figure 3, p. 33).
       b. The presence of all the key government ministries on the Land Board (which is chaired
             by the Governor) enables multi-sector input and screening at local level.
       c. Thereafter, the Land Board submits the RAP, together with recommendations, to the
             Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) who in turn invite comments from the
             World Bank.
       d. Once these are received, the MET and the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and
             Rehabilitation (MLRR) jointly evaluate the RAP, taking account of the comments made
             by the Land Board and the World Bank.
       e. Once they approve of the RAP, the MLRR formally communicates this decision to the
             conservancy, providing a copy of its approval to the Land Board. It is thereafter the


Copyright © ICEMA Project ­ MET/GEF/WB            - 24 -

             responsibility of the conservancy to implement the RAP, and to provide feedback (on
             the basis of an agreed monitoring and evaluation plan) to MET.

       The conservancy committee is obliged, through its management plan in the first instance
       and the RAP in the second, to keep a record of all the communications and decisions and,
       to produce a final report on the RAP after three years after its implementation. The
       structure of the final report should be guided by the review criteria below.
       The review by both the World Bank and Namibian government will be identical, and will be
       based on the following checklist:


     CRITERIA                                                                                              Y/N
     1.   Is there a clearly articulated need for resettlement, based on the conservancy management plan
          and zonation map?
     2.   Is the plan constitutional, in accordance with Namibian laws and policies and, World Bank
          Policies?
     3.   Have the affected people been fully involved in the process of developing the RAP and is there
          evidence that their concerns have been taken into account?
     4.   Will the affected people enjoy an equal or better lifestyle in the place to which they will be
          resettled, compared to that which they enjoyed previously?
     5.   Are the measures necessary to re-establish and protect their economic and social structures, in
          place?
     6.   Is there a clear and realistic timetable of activities?
     7.   Is there a defined budget for financing the activities involved?
     8.   Is the source of funds identified and are the funds available?
     9.   Are the institutions responsible for implementing the required steps and activities, including
          monitoring follow-up, and adjustments if necessary, to ensure that the needs of resettled people
          are being met and respected, in place?


       If these questions are answered satisfactorily, the World Bank and the Namibian
       Government approve the RAP and authorize its implementation.

G      Indigenous peoples

Indigenous peoples are defined by the Bank's policy as a group with a social and cultural identity,
distinct from the dominant society, which makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the
development process.

The San people are identified by the World Bank's Policy on Indigenous Peoples as the only
Indigenous Peoples in southern Africa. The ICEMA Project will impact San people occurring
inside conservancies or community forests.

Subprojects that may benefit or adversely affect indigenous people must include components or
provisions to ensure they do not suffer adverse effects, and they receive culturally compatible
social and economic benefits. ICEMA will avail resources for capacity building of the San, to
effectively participate in planning and decision making in conservancies and community forests.
In addition, ICEMA will contract WIMSA as the Indigenous Peoples Association, to assist with
sensitisations, capacity building and empowerment, as well as, generating awareness among the
San about the importance of preserving their language and culture. Conservancies and
community forests, where San people occur, are encouraged to involve the San in decision
making, planning and general consultative processes. The process of discussing and
consequently developing a subproject for funding with ICEMA must include the San from the very
beginning. Subproject proposals will be screened for the inclusion of the San people with explicit
attention given to their active involvement in the development of the proposal and, measures to
ensure they benefit in a culturally compatible social and economic manner from the subproject.
The latter is essential especially when the subproject is likely to adversely affect the San. In this
case a subproject proposal must clearly outline measures to be taken to compensate San
peoples based on agreed terms and conditions.

The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) and Implementation Guidelines elaborate on
specific activities that will be incorporated and monitored under project implementation.

Annex 2: Typical Impacts and Mitigation Measures


Small Irrigation Schemes

Scope of Projects
Small irrigation schemes can serve a few families or an entire community. They can involve new
irrigation for existing rain-fed agriculture, the development of uncultivated areas, and changes or
expansions to existing schemes. Water may be pumped from lakes, ponds or underground, or be
diverted from streams or rivers. Pipes, channels or ditches carry the water to farmers' fields where it is
distributed to crops by gravity on the soil surface, by hand, or by other means.

Irrigated agriculture involves complex soil-water-plant relationships, and should not be undertaken without
thorough, informed planning, even at a small scale. While the benefits of irrigation can be obvious and
impressive, the adverse environmental effects can be significant, long-term, and perhaps permanent.

The most significant environmental issues with small irrigation schemes concern threats to human health
and soil productivity. Health effects arise from stagnant water in canals, ditches or fields that provide
habitats for water-borne disease carriers. Losses of soil productivity result from over-irrigation or poor soil
drainage. These lead to waterlogging and salinization of the soils, and a reduction or complete loss of
their usefulness for cropping. Salinization is the build-up of mineral salts in the soil as water evaporates
from the soil surface.

Community Forestry

Scope of Projects
Community forestry projects may be undertaken for a variety of reasons including timber and fuelwood
production, soil and water conservation, and micro-watershed protection. They may also include tree
nurseries or elements of agro-forestry that yield forest products besides wood (e.g fruits, nuts). They
typically involve afforestation and not existing forests. Reforestation, upgrading and management of
existing forests and forestry operations are not considered in this resources sheet.

Clearly, such projects can provide substantial economic and environmental benefits. At the same time, if
they are not planned and carried out sensitively, they can also create environmental problems,
particularly soil erosion and conflicts over land use and the distribution of project benefits.

Environmental Concerns

Human Environment

Small-Scale Aquaculture

Scope of Projects
Aquaculture projects raise aquatic organisms in fresh, brackish or salt marine waters for part or all of their
life, and then harvest them for human consumption. The organisms may be fish (e.g. trout, salmon, carp,
tilapia), crustaceans (e.g. fresh water crayfish, shrimp, prawns), or molluscs (e.g. oysters, mussels,
clams).

Culture methods vary considerably. Intensive methods raise high-value organisms in large numbers in
man-made structures. With ponds, fresh or seawater is channelled or pumped in, and old water is
discharged through ditches or canals. Use of groundwater may lower water tables. Artificially produced
seed, specially made feed, antibiotics to control disease, chemicals to inhibit plant growth, and high initial
costs are typical. Waste water and bottom sludge can become toxic and, if not properly treated and
managed, can contaminate soil, water and marine resources.

At the other end of the scale are extensive methods that tend to use traditional, low-technology cultivation
methods, wild seed stock and naturally available feed.     Input and output levels, and start-up costs, are
much lower than with intensive methods. Extensive aquaculture is frequently developed to satisfy local
fish protein needs rather than commercial markets, and is the focus of this resources sheet. The
products may be distributed fresh or dried.

Leather Processing

Scope of Projects
The processing of hides (tanning) from domestic animals such as cattle, pigs and goats is often
associated with meat processing operations. Though it is often illegal, skins from wild animals may also
be processed.

Leather processing involves several steps from initial soaking of the raw hides through removing hair,
chrome tanning and finishing. It can produce highly unpleasant odours. It also requires large amounts of
water that becomes contaminated and perhaps toxic with high concentrations of chemicals and organic
matter. If disposed of on land, liquid wastes can contaminate soils and groundwater. When released to
watercourses, the wastes can deplete oxygen levels, poison and disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and cause
fish kills. They can also lead to serious health problems for workers and local people.

Tanneries can evidently place a quite heavy burden on the environment if not developed properly.
Sensitive plant location and effective management of water use and liquid and solid wastes are key to
mitigating adverse environmental effects. Sound waste management and pollution control methods at
tanneries can require strong technical knowledge not covered in this resources sheet2. The sheet does
give direction on the kind of environmental effects that need to be considered, and approaches to
addressing them.

Food Processing

Scope of Projects
Small-scale food processing may be home-based or small enterprises that use a wide variety of
processes and technologies to convert animal and plant products into human food.

Food processing of all kinds can create environmental problems if not managed properly. Solid and/or
liquid wastes can be highly polluting and create offensive odours. Water use can place excessive
demands on local supplies. Wastewater containing organic and other wastes can degrade streams and
rivers, and contaminate groundwater. Stagnant pools of polluted water can be highly odorous and
provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Community Healthcare Facilities

Scope of Projects
Community healthcare facilities can include small hospitals, health centres, clinics, surgeries, dentists,
veterinary practices, laboratories and nursing/residential homes. These facilities can have the same
environmental concerns as any structure or building. By far the most significant concern is the hazardous
nature of many types of healthcare waste, and this resource sheet focuses on this issue alone. Types of
health waste can include:
· Human tissue and blood;
· Soiled surgical dressings and swabs;
· Discarded syringe needles;
· Other contaminated sharp instruments;
· Microbiological cultures and potentially infected wastes from laboratories;
· Excretions; and
· Drugs and other pharmaceutical products.

Radioactive wastes need to be managed and treated separately from other healthcare wastes, and are
not covered here.

The many different potential sources and types of healthcare wastes make it important to carefully plan
healthcare projects to improve waste management, and thus minimize human exposure to the wastes
and risks to public health. In particular, the sources and types of waste need to be identified, and the
current waste management methods identified and assessed. In most cases, the risks of hazardous
healthcare waste in communities can be greatly reduced through low-cost, affordable operational
measures such as improved handling, segregation and safe storage. These measures minimize the risks
of exposure. A key aspect of these measures is to carry out extensive training and awareness raising.

Annex 4: Namibia's Environmental Assessment (EA) Process


Pre-feasibility study and screening

Before an EIA is done, the developer usually does his/her "homework" through conducting a
study to see whether the project is viable from a financial point of view. In the case of tourism, the
study will determine whether there is a good enough tourism product in the area, whether s/he
will be able to compete in the market and realize a profit and return on investment. At this early
stage, it is important to see whether the project is in line with the vision in the tourism Master plan
or Conservancy Management Plan. S/he will then complete the environmental questionnaire so
that a decision can be taken on whether an EIA is needed or not. This stage is generally known
as screening. The questionnaire should be completed by the developer early in the planning
process.

This decision to do and EIA or not must be taken carefully, and the size of the project may not be
the best criteria. For example, the construction of a small campsite will probably not require an
EIA, but if it is to be placed near an important spring, at a village or close to game migration
paths, then an EIA should be done.

The screening process should, ideally involve consultation between all affected stakeholders so
that the final decision is collective rather than unilateral.
If the initial analysis is positive and the impacts seem likely to be minimal, the authorities will
probably issue an Environmental Clearance and set conditions for the implementation of the
project without an EIA being done. Alternatively, a full EIA might be triggered.

Scoping

The next step is scoping, which proceeds after a decision has been taken that an EIA is required.
Scoping is the process of identifying from a broad range of potential problems, a number of
priority issues to be addressed by an EIA. Scoping is extremely important, because an EIA study
can easily become disoriented in trying to find out a little about everything instead of as much as
possible about the most important impacts likely to result from the proposed development.

Most EIAs are conducted under time pressure, since the developers inevitably want to proceed
as soon as possible with their projects. It is thus vital to focus the study from the start. There are
many ways to conduct a scoping exercise, but recent experience suggests that one of the best
ways is to consult stakeholders, especially people living in the project area. Locals are more likely
than anyone else to correctly identify potential impacts and their perspective is essential in
assessing the significance of these impacts.
A successful scoping exercise results in
- a prioritized list of potential impacts,
- an inventory of stakeholders,
- sources of information and a clearer idea of what to study, why and how.
Many practitioners summarize this information in a matrix, where a list of project related activities,
the receiving environment and a preliminary assessment of impact severity and significance, are
presented in tabular format for ease of reference.

The EA study

The actual EIA study only commences once screening and scoping have been completed.
The study is usually carried out by a "team of experts" who are competent in all the relevant
fields. These typically include sociology, ecology and other natural sciences. More recently,
anthropologists, landscape architects, lawyers, health experts and economists have played a
more prominent role as EIA has become a more integrated process.




                                                  - 46 -

The EIA team should ideally work in tandem with other components of the planning process, such
as design and economic modelling, so that the disciplines can influence each other in an iterative
fashion.
A best-case scenario is achieved when an EIA and the other studies jointly explore alternatives
and collectively design a "least cost" project. Least cost in this case includes maximum economic
returns and minimal environmental impacts and opportunity costs.
The complexity, length and detail of each EIA depend on the subject being studied and the
interrelationships between the issues.

Usually, the EIA study results in the compilation of a report which is delivered to the proponent
(referred to as an EIA report or Environmental Impact Statement). Many jurisdictions specify a
minimum standard for the form and content of the report, which should at least provide an
executive summary of the findings and key recommendations, the process that was followed, the
stakeholders consulted, the main issues and findings, and detailed recommendations for impact
mitigation.

Modern EIA systems also require consultants to advise on how project benefits can be enhanced,
thereby addressing the concern that EIA is a fault-finding exercise.
Specific tasks to be undertaken in conducting the EIA study

Task1: Description of the proposed project and its sub-components

Describe the relevant parts of each phase of the project (i.e. those that are likely to cause
significant environmental impacts).

The EIA should also analyze the alternatives to the project, and explain why the proposed project
is superior to the alternatives, including the no-project alternative.

Task 2: Description of the environment

Provide a brief but concise description and analysis of the following components of the affected
environment.
Institutional environment: Characteristics of the relevant sectors in local government (including
capacity to offer support), NACSO and the CBNRM support network.
Natural environment: an overview (not a comprehensive biodiversity inventory) of the current
status of the natural capital within the focus area (especially water and wildlife), planned
development activities versus current use to see if there will be considerably more requirements
for land and natural resources in the future; conflicts between wildlife and humans, suitability of
the areas for other forms of land use, etc. A statement on the current "state of the environment"
will be useful, especially as a benchmark for future monitoring. Any particularly sensitive areas or
areas of important biodiversity should be highlighted.

Socio-cultural environment in the focus area: population and demographics; community structure;
employment; public health (including sexually transmitted diseases); aspirations and attitudes
(regarding the project), decision making and management structures within the focus area,
administrative systems, and relations with neighbours. Highlight the known (or expected)
occurrence of sites of cultural importance in the focus area.

Economic environment: general overview of the current land use and livelihood profile in the
focus area, the investments to date (through other projects and by the communities themselves)
and the returns on these. The assessment should consider the plans of other sectors in the area
(e.g. mining and agriculture) and note plans for infrastructure development (e.g. roads).

Task 3: Legislative and regulatory considerations

Briefly describe and analyse the pertinent national, regional and local authority policies and
legislation regarding land use and natural resource management (and planning).
This needs to be linked to the anticipated activities of the project and CBNRM in general.

                                                - 47 -

It is not necessary to provide a summary of all the relevant laws and policies ­ rather analyse
their relevance to the project and assess the extent to which the project will need to comply with
these and what licensing permits will be needed.

Task 4: Determination of the potential impacts of the proposed project

In this analysis, distinguish between significant positive and negative impacts, direct and indirect
impacts, and immediate and long-term impacts.
Identify impacts which are unavoidable or irreversible.
Characterize the extent and quality of available data, explaining significant information
deficiencies and any uncertainties associated with predictions of impact.
It is strongly urged that the EIA focus on the 5 most important issues so that time, money and
paper are not wasted on insignificant issues.
Once the consultant has a list of key issues, s/he should meet with the client and the appropriate
communities and authorities to agree on the priorities.

An important issue for the EIA to consider is who will use the data that is generated concerning
potential social and cultural impacts.
When considering the potential impacts of a development on the physical environment, the issue
of whether an impact is negative or positive is fairly straightforward. If a development removes the
last remaining habitat of an endemic species, then it can be predicted that the species will
become extinct. It is a valid conclusion that the loss of this species will have a negative impact on
biodiversity.

When considering social and cultural issues, the determination of what is a negative or positive
impact is more difficult. If those carrying out an EIA do not belong to the culture of the people
affected, they are not in a position to determine whether a specific impact is positive or negative.
Given such potential differences in perception of culture and cultural change, the issue of who
interprets the nature of potential impacts becomes crucial. The EIA process needs to ensure that
the residents of an area where a development takes place are the people who decide whether
potential impacts will be of a positive nature or a negative nature. In order for this to happen, a
process of consultation and discussion with residents needs to be undertaken by the assessment
team once potential impacts have been identified. The potential impacts need to be presented to
residents for discussion. Residents can then decide whether the impacts are desirable or
undesirable.

It will be necessary for the assessment team to note varying attitudes between different social
groupings and the residents should be encouraged to find consensus if differences emerge. If
consensus cannot be found, this should be noted in the report and the different attitudes
recorded. Only once residents have stated their views on the nature of specific impacts, will it be
possible to decide which impacts should be completely avoided from a social and cultural
perspective and which require mitigating action. The process of identifying mitigating actions
should also be carried out through the strong participation of local residents. It should be
recognized that what might be acceptable to residents of one area, might not be acceptable to
their immediate neighbours.

Generally many of the potential social impacts that might be considered negative might be
acceptable to residents, if there has been a process of consultation with residents in the
development of the plans for the lodge. Also many of the potential negative impacts could be
avoided, if there has been a process of joint planning. For example, resentment about the import
of outside labour for construction or operation of the lodge can be pre-empted if there are
agreements in place that the lodge will hire local labour except where skills are not available
locally. Further the agreement could stipulate that where skills are not available locally, residents
will be trained to develop these skills.




                                                - 48 -

In assessing the impacts of the project, the EIA should consider whether alternative designs or
ways of implementing the project could reduce negative impacts whilst enhancing the benefits.
This analysis should result in a series of practical and feasible mitigation measures, which can
later be used to develop an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The development of the
EMP might be included in the project specific TOR as work to be done by the consultant, but in
some cases the EMP might be a separate consultancy.

Task 5: EIA Report

The EIA report should be concise (no more than 50 pages ­ excluding appendices) and shall
focus on the significant environmental, social and economic issues.
The main text should highlight the findings, conclusions and recommended mitigation actions.
The report should be easy to read and easily understood by a layperson, but at the same time it
should contain data (where available) and it must be scientifically sound.
The text should be complimented by graphs, tables, illustrations and maps that help the reader to
better understand the message that is being conveyed.

Task 6: Review and decision making

In Namibia, the authority for reviewing an EIA report is the Directorate of Environmental Affairs
(DEA) in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET).
However, it would be good practice if the conservancy (or other community structure) and the
local MET office reviews the EIA first, before it is sent to Windhoek.

After the review, the authorities (be they local, regional or national) either authorize or deny the
proposed activity.
Authorization is usually conditional on compliance with a set of conditions, which are generally
based on the recommendations of the EIA and the review.
These conditions should be incorporated into an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The
EMP should consist of a strategy for reducing negative impacts, enhancing benefits and
monitoring progress. It must thus include a monitoring programme and indicators by which to
measure both changes within the environment and progress towards achieving objectives.

Task 7: Monitoring and auditing

It is important that we learn from experience gained during implementation; there is thus a need
to include a feedback mechanism in the EIA system.
This is usually achieved through regular monitoring and audits.
As noted earlier, the monitoring system is sometimes published as a separate EMP or
Environmental Management System (EMS).
Ideally, the lessons learnt through implementation should provide the basis for reviewing the
conditions of approval, and the authorities and proponent should constantly be updating these
crucial documents.

Annex 6: Natural Habitats and Forests


The ESMF specifies that natural habitats need to be conserved when planning and implementing
subprojects. These are land and water areas whose ecological functions have not been
essentially modified by human activities. They include natural forests. Subprojects cannot be
funded if they involve the significant conversion or degradation of natural habitats. If a subproject
would significantly convert or degrade a natural habitat, the ESMF specifies that the subproject
needs to incorporate acceptable mitigation measures such as minimizing habitat loss and
establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar area.

Significant conversion means eliminating or severely reducing the integrity of a natural habitat
through long-term change in land or water use. It may include, for example, land clearing;
replacement of natural vegetation; permanent flooding; and drainage, dredging, filling, or
channelization of wetlands. It can occur as the result of severe pollution. And, it can result directly
from subproject activities or indirectly (e.g. through induced settlement along a road).
Degradation means substantially reducing the ability of a natural habitat to maintain viable
populations of its native species.

Moreover, the ESMF specifies that subprojects involving the significant conversion or degradation
of critical natural habitats (including forests) cannot be funded. These are natural habitats that:
- are protected by government (e.g. parks, World Heritage Sites) or by tradition (e.g. sacred
    groves); or
- have known high suitability for biodiversity conservation; or
- are critical for rare, vulnerable, migratory, or endangered species.

Subprojects designed to support community-based forest management and development needs
to take into account:
- the extent to which the livelihoods of local communities depend on and use trees in the
    subproject and adjacent area;
- the participation of indigenous people and poor people in the management of the trees and
    forests included in the subproject area; and
- forest product and forest service issues relevant to indigenous people and poor people living
    in or near forests in the subproject area, as well as opportunities for promoting the
    involvement                                         of                                    women.

Subprojects involving forest restoration or plantation development need to address the following
issues:
- the potential of forest restoration to improve biodiversity and ecosystem functions;
- the potential to establish plantations on non-forest lands that do not contain critical natural
    habitats;
- the need to avoid conversion or degradation of natural habitats; and
- the capacities of the government, nongovernmental organizations, and other private entities to
    cooperate in the forest restoration and plantation development.

Annex 7: Criteria for determining the need for a RAP and guidelines for
developing a RAP


Determining the Need for a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

This section provides criteria for determining the need for a RAP if any of the questions in Social
and Environmental Screening checklist (Annex 1) are answered "Yes". The criteria are:

1. A RAP is NOT required if land needs to be acquired and will be donated voluntarily or
    purchased on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis. The conditions of the land acquisition
    must be documented in the subproject application. All voluntary donations and purchases will
    be evaluated to ensure owners and users were not coerced into providing land.

2. A RAP is required if land needs to be acquired, but not under the conditions described in #1
    above, such that people are displaced from land or productive resources and the
    displacement results in:
     a. relocation, the loss of shelter, the loss of assets or access to assets important to
         production;
     b. the loss of income sources or means of livelihood; or
     c. the loss of access to locations that provide higher incomes or lower expenditures to
         businesses or persons.

Preparing a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

A RAP is a detailed action plan for treating a given set of people; for example, those who will lose
land to the construction of a campsite, those whose lives will be affected by developing a nearby
charcoal production plant, or those who will be excluded from land they occupy or enter to graze
their livestock or operate their business.

Please note; the content of a RAP depends on the degree of resettlement impact. The ESMF
specifies that, where impacts are minor (no physical displacement and less than 10% of
productive assets are lost) or fewer that 200 people are displaced, a subproject RAP will cover, at
minimum:
- the nature of the subproject and the required resettlement;
- a census of the affected people and a valuation of their assets;
- a matrix that shows ­ in the same terms as the RPF ­ the entitlements of the categories of
   affected people;
- the resettlement sites and programs for improvement or restoration of livelihoods and
   standards of living;
- the responsibilities and arrangements for implementation, grievance redress, and monitoring;
- the resettlement timetable and budget; and
- a commitment to follow the ESMF and/or RPF guidance and requirements in all general
   matters.

ICEMA's RPF makes available a RAP preparation guide that provides a step-by-step procedure,
including consultation methods, typical questions to ask, checklists and forms, for completing a
subproject RAP. The guide includes the minimum information needed to complement what has
already been decided at the Project level through the Resettlement Policy Framework.

Insofar as possible, the ESMF shows any further information that may be needed during Project
implementation, or where the general issues need to be supplemented due to differing local laws,
special situations or effects on people, or the additional contributions of specialists to the
individual RAP preparation.

Annex 8: Construction (E.g., Conservancy offices, campsites and
community facilities)


Scope of Projects

Subprojects may include the construction of buildings notably markets and grain storage facilities.
Markets will include ancillary facilities such as sanitation, drainage, and access. Although the
envisaged construction is small-scale and likely to have localized environmental impact, there are
some precautionary measures requiring consideration in the planning, construction and
operational phases of the project cycle.

Environmental Concern

Planning/design Phase

In rural areas communities are typically distributed along transport routes where the immediate
environment is largely transformed and dominated by small-scale farms and secondary
vegetation but also in close proximity to untransformed habitats. In this context civil works
construction should be planned in a way that its impact on primary vegetation (clearing the site for
construction) should be avoided or minimized.

In peri-urban areas, however, the natural habitats have generally been much modified by human
activity but productive land may be a premium (for grazing or small scale plots for maize,
vegetables, etc.) and any loss of productive land and assets due to location of infrastructure will
constitute a negative socio-economic impact.

Other factors that also need to be considered include ground contours (steep topography will
result in erosion during construction and operational phases) water table and seasonal patterns of
inundation (to prevent water logging).

Local knowledge will be invaluable in deciding on appropriate locations for location of sites for
construction or building construction in order to avoid destruction of primary or sensitive habitats,
loss of productive land, soil erosion and water logging.

Construction Phase

There will be limited range of localised environmental impacts occurring during construction (local
pollution). Contractual obligations (of the contractor) must include clauses regarding
environmental protection focusing specifically on site clean up after construction, waste
management during construction, and possibly the rehabilitation of land disturbed during
construction.

Impacts occurring during construction phase include:

·    Construction activities such as the circulation of heavy machinery and the chopping down of
     trees by the workforce for fuel can result in the destruction of intact vegetation such as
     shade or fruit trees, stream bank vegetation etc.       Shade trees play an important role
     (especially in peri-urban areas and school play grounds) once the project is operational.

·    Localized soil and water (if a small stream is nearby) pollution from incorrect storage and
     handling of diesel fuel and used engine oil may occur.

·    The accumulation of solid wastes due to construction activities and workforce during
     construction creates health risks and negative aesthetic impacts.
Operational Phase


                                               - 53 -

 A main concern will be to maintain hygienic conditions at markets during the operational phase,
 notably:

 ·    Adequate solid waste storage/disposal (e.g. in bins/containers with lids to keep flies away).
      Solid waste disposal is treated in more detail below
 ·    Maintenance of sanitary conditions, provision of latrines etc.
 ·    Adequate water supply to maintain hygienic conditions
 ·    Ensure proper drainage from stalls.

 Again, these are essentially common sense day-to-day management practices, which need to be
 promoted and reinforced through environmental awareness campaigns.
