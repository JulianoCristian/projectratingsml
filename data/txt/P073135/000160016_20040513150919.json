       biodiversity and land conservation and sustainable use as a\n            goal.\"  The project's four inter-related\n            components together serve to consolidate, add value to, and\n            build on the previous achievements o f the National CBNRM\n            (Community Based Natural Resource Management)  Program. It\n            will foster the shift from traditional natural resource\n            management (mainly wildlife) to an integrated ecosystem\n            management approach in targeted conservancies thereby\n            enhancing globally significant biodiversity conservation and\n            reducing !and degradation while at the same time providing\n            increased income-generating activities. The project supports\n            targeted conservancies on communal lands complying with the\n            project's defined strategic criteria. The project also\n            provides institutional support to the Ministry o f\n            Environment and Tourism (MET), which is the governmental\n            lead agency responsible for implementing the CBNRM Program.\n            Project components 1 \"Ecosystem-based Income-Generating\n            Activities\" and 2 \"Sustainable Ecosystem\n            Management\" support site-specific on-the-ground\n            activities. Project component 3 \"Targeted Institutional\n            Support\" focuses on priority issues of the\n            institutional, policy, and financial CBNRM framework. All\n            three components are expected to provide replicable lessons\n            for the remaining conservancy network. Project component 4\n            \"Project Management Support\" aims to strengthen\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism to\n            manage and supervise project activities."}, "docdt": "2004-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
