She\n            is a soft-spoken 32-year old Bulgarian but the French she\n            learned at Sofia University is good enough for the Belgian\n            customers at the other end of the line. \"At most, they\n            ask if I'm Flemish,\" says Vassileva. Vassileva is\n            one of 300 multilingual Bulgarian tele-marketers employed by\n            IMRO, a Belgian call center that opened for business in\n            April 2003 in the outskirts of Sofia and is planning a major\n            expansion this fall. Her job reflects Bulgaria's\n            growing appeal to foreign investors as the country sheds its\n            communist past and transforms into a competitive market\n            economy. Foreign companies invested a record $ 2.5 billion\n            in Bulgaria in 2004, amounting to 10.1 percent of the\n            country's GDP. In the past few years the Bulgarian\n            private sector has also grown dramatically and unemployment\n            has plunged from 19 percent in 2001 to 12.7 percent in March 2005."}, "docdt": "2006-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
