for Philippines were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory: risk to global environment\n            outcome was moderate; bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: (i) use of\n            country systems in national program support operations to\n            ensure ownership and continuity of reforms; (ii)\n            strengthening results and policy focus of national program\n            support; (iii) increased capacity building to ensure that\n            decentralized services respond to supply and demand; (iv)\n            strengthening  Monitoring And Evaluation (M&E)\n            focus;(v) the need for monitoring and sharing of information\n            to make a useful contribution to mainstreaming  improvements\n            of healthcare delivery; (vi) strengthening central-local\n            relations, particularly in promoting the introduction of\n            national programs ; and  (vii) in the process of devolution\n            for a country like the Philippines, third party verification\n            should also comprise performance and management audits to\n            better inform and resolve issues of implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
