                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Trust Fund is to increase utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in participating
                         localities through the progressive implementation of the Philippine Government's Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). The project consists of two components: (i)
                         provide local health system reform grants to six (6) selected Convergence Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon, Misamis Occidental and Nueva
                         Viscaya) to support activities set forth in their province-wide investment plans for the health sector. (ii) strengthen DOH#s capacity in the area of public financial
                         management, internal audit, information management, procurement and performance mornitoring under local government scorecards, through provision of training,
                         technical assistance, and required computer hardware and software.

                         (Note: this was original PDO in first IBTF, and is not yet amended to reflect Mindanao Provinces pending new Grant Agreement)
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         FYI, the grant agreement was amended last June 2010 with the total project funds increased to EUR 13,450,000 and the expansion of the participating localities from the original six
                         provinces to include ARMM and nine other provinces and cities in Mindanao. However, despite multiple request to include this update in the system, this has not yet taken place.

                         The grant was able to achieve a set number of activities. However, delays plagued project implementation, particularly with regard to the development and establishment of

                         investment plans, operation plans, procurement plans, and subsequently the Service Level Agreements (SLA) which acted as performance contracts between the DOH and the
                         Local Government Units (LGU) at the provincial level. Capacity has been built over time, with the added benefit of institutionalizing the SLAs to all provinces in the country. However,
                         target indicators were not met for the most part (DPT3 coverage, TB cure rate, TB case detection rate). However, the number of indigent families enrolled in PHIC increased to 26
                         million which is due to the National Government's development of the National Household Targettng System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR). Coverage of services and impact of
                         those services is difficult to determine due to lack of a robust monitoring and evaluation system, and tracking of expenditures. In addition, oversight and management of health sector
                         delivery remains weak due to the current structural organization which is reactive and having to constantly adjust to ongoing reforms (example is from formula 1 for health to
                         universal health care).
