                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


     A. SUMMARY

1.     The proposed changes are intended to enable the Recipient’s implementing
agency, the Department of Health (DOH), to complete the implementation of their work
plans and the Local Government Units (LGUs) participating in the project to implement
the community-based grant component of the project. This will require two actions:

        a. reallocation of proceeds from Consultants’ Services to Local Health Systems
           Reform Grants. In particular, it is proposed that Euro 626,800 be reallocated
           from the former to latter, and

        b. an extension of the project closing date from June 30, 2012 to October 31,
           2012.

     B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was fully funded by grants from the European Union, established as a
Trust Fund 090182 totaling Euro 6,412,500. It was approved on June 4, 2007, with the
original closing date of December 31, 2010. One extension of 18 months was granted to
accommodate additional financing of Euro 6,268,000 provided by the donor for the
project.

3.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase utilization of affordable
and financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in
participating localities through the progressive implementation of the Philippine
Government's Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). This PDO remains achievable
with the additional time requested by the Client. The DOH has committed to an action
plan that will ensure the completion of all project activities within the extension period.
The latest Implementation Status Report (ISR) states that the progress towards
achievement of the PDO and the Overall Implementation Progress are both Moderately
Satisfactory.

4.     Overall project disbursement is at 77% as of June 8, 2012. The project has fully
disbursed the allocated LGU grants under Parts A (Support to selected provinces) and B.2
(support to conflict-affected areas in Mindanao region – outside the Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) provinces). The DOH has already obligated 65% of Part
C (Support to DOH).

5.      The remaining activities under the project are the following:

        a. procurement and training activities in the DOH workplan under Part C,

                                             4
        b. the procurement of medical goods and equipment for ARMM (being
           undertaken by DOH on behalf of ARMM as agreed upon under the project),
           and

        c. implementation by LGUs of the community-based grants for indigenous
           peoples and other disadvantaged groups.

6.      The DOH would need additional time to fully implement its planned activities, to
finish the procurement process for ARMM and to help LGUs utilize the community-
based grants.

   C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.     Reallocations. It is proposed to reallocate grant proceeds in the amount of Euro
626,800 from Consultants’ Services to Local Health System Reform Grants. This would
reduce the Consultants’ Services from Euro 776,800 to Euro 150,000 and would increase
the Local Health System Reform Grants allocation from Euro 11,053,700 to Euro
11,680,500.

TOTAL AMOUNT                   12,680,500.00   12,680,500.00

8.      The DOH has requested the reallocation of unutilized funds under Consultants’
Services to the Local Health Systems Reform Grants. This would enable the DOH to
provide additional grants to LGUs for IPs and those in GIDAs. The DOH’s Bureau of
Local Health Development (BLHD) (tasked with liaising with LGUs) is working with the
DOH Centers for Health Development (regional offices) that has already screened project
proposals that will utilize said grants. The DOH BLHD will come out with guidelines on
the use of the grants and the corresponding funds flow arrangements.

9.    Extension of Closing Date. The closing date is proposed to be extended by four
months from June 30, 2012 to October 31, 2012.

10.    The proposed extension is necessary to enable the DOH to fully implement its
planned activities, to finish the procurement process for ARMM and to help LGUs utilize
the community-based grants. The DOH has an action plan covering the above activities.
