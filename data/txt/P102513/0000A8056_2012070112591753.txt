                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Trust Fund is to increase utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in participating
                         localities through the progressive implementation of the Philippine Government's Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). The project consists of two components: (i)
                         provide local health system reform grants to six (6) selected Convergence Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon, Misamis Occidental and Nueva
                         Viscaya) to support activities set forth in their province-wide investment plans for the health sector. (ii) strengthen DOH#s capacity in the area of public financial
                         management, internal audit, information management, procurement and performance mornitoring under local government scorecards, through provision of training,
                         technical assistance, and required computer hardware and software.

                         (Note: this was original PDO in first IBTF, and is not yet amended to reflect Mindanao Provinces pending new Grant Agreement)

                         The grant agreement was amended last June 2010 with the total project funds increased to EUR 13,450,000 and the expansion of the participating localities from the original six
                         provinces to include ARMM and nine other provinces and cities in Mindanao. Grants to these new localities had been disbursed with the respective procurement plans about to be
                         completed. The procurement for ARMM is being undertaken by the DOH central office while the community health grants are to be given to LGUs based on approved submitted plans
                         based on their bottoms up planning exercise.
