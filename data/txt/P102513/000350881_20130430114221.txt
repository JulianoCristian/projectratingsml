﻿F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives
The objective of the Trust Fund is to increase utilization of affordable and financially
sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in participating localities
through the progressive implementation of the Philippine Government's Health Sector
Reform Agenda (HSRA). The project consists of three components: (i) provide local
health system reform grants to six (6) selected Convergence Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos
Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon, Misamis Occidental and Nueva Viscaya) to support
activities set forth in their province-wide investment plans for the health sector; (ii)
strengthen DOH's capacity in the area of public financial management, internal audit,
information management, procurement and performance mornitoring under local
government scorecards, through provision of training, technical assistance, and required
computer hardware and software; and (iii) supervision of the grant which received
separate funding under a Bank-executed Trust Fund.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO were revised in December 2007 to read as follows: assist the Recipient to
increase utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health
services by the poor in participating localities (the selected Convergence Provinces and
conflict affected areas) through progressive implementation of the Recipient's Health
Sector Reform Agenda.

H. Restructuring (if any)
The Grant was restructured in December 2007 to include the addition of the following
sub-components and components: B1 to support to conflict-affected areas in the
Mindanao; B2 to provide local health system reform grants to the conflict-affected areas
in the ARMM provinces. Part B was renamed Part C, and Part C was renamed Part D for
incremental supervision and project appraisal activities. The scope of intervention was
expanded to conflict-affected areas in Mindanao including the ARMM provinces with
additional financing provided by the European Commission (EC). A second restructuring
took place in June of 2012 for fund reallocation, and an extension of the closing date
from June 30, 2012 to October 31, 2012.

﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1   Context at Appraisal
1.    At the time of grant preparation, and the associated project to which this Grant
was linked to -- the National Sector Support for Health Reform Project - NSSHRP -
(P075464) -- the Philippines had embarked on a number of reforms to deal with major
disparities in health outcomes (across provinces, and across income quintiles). Overall
health expenditures, as well as public expenditures on health were lower than the average
for other middle income countries. Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments as a percentage of
total health expenditures (THE), was high at 54 percent, leading households into
unsustainable expenditures (catastrophic payments). The country was grappling with the
impacts of two previous reform programs - the 1991 decentralization of health services
to Local Government Units (LGUs) and the 1995 enactment of the National Health
Insurance Program (NHIP), scaling up health insurance for the population and the
establishment of the Philippines Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) or PhilHealth. The
decentralization reforms led to fragmentation in health financing and the delivery of care.
Health services provided by the public sector are shared between the Department of
Health (DOH) and the local government units (LGUs). While the 1995 national health
insurance reforms addressed some of this fragmentation, as well as providing funds
through PhilHealth, progress in providing healthcare for the poor was limited.
2.    The Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) of 1998-2004, had begun to address
the problems described above. But progress was slower than expected. In 2005, the
HSRA reinvigorated its focus on the reform framework: FOURmula One for Health (Fl)
which had four pillars:
*  Pillar I: Health Financing through increased financial protection for the poor and
sick;
*  Pillar II: Health Service Delivery through supply-side measures to upgrade
public health facilities in all communities to meet PhilHealth's accreditation
standards;
*  Pillar III: Health Regulation for more effective regulation of the health sector and
of drugs and commodities; and
*  Pillar IV: Good Governance for a stronger results focus and coordination
between DOH and LGUs in delivering public health programs.
3.    As implementation of the HSRA's recommendations was deemed to be too slow,
the DOH adopted a phased implementation strategy in 2002, beginning with select
''convergence" provinces (designated as priority provinces for the implementation of the
Health Sector Reform Agenda by DOH Administrative Order No. 12005-0023), and
sought development partner assistance to support the HSRA in these sites.  Fl was
expected to focus on results through the National Objectives of Health (NOH) of 2005-
2010 and in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as with the
Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) of 2004-2010. The goals of Fl
1


﻿are to improve health outcomes, health system, equity in health care financing, especially
for the poor and vulnerable populations. Using the medium-term Health Sector
Expenditure Framework (HSEF), the annual budgeting process, and a performance
monitoring framework for DOH, PhilHealth and convergence provinces should be able to
link budgeting and resource allocation to outputs and intermediate results. These links
were intended to reduce obstacles to reform. With regard to fragmentation in financing,
Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH) was adopted under Fl to align
development partners-supported reform activities across the entire health sector under a
single national implementation plan and under harmonized local health investment plans
in each convergence province.
4.    It was recognized that the HSRA had partial success due to: (1) limitations in
prioritizing a complex reform agenda and translating it into do-able, fiscally realistic
action plans, (2) limited coordination between DOH and PhilHealth over reform strategy,
(3) limited capacity in results-based management, (4) excessively cautious behaviour by
PhilHealth in scaling up the NHIP, (5) fragmented donor support, and (6) constrained
fiscal space.
5.    In addition, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006-2008 focused on
supporting public expenditure management reform, improved governance, and better
targeting of public expenditure at a time when the country's fiscal situation was fragile.
The approach of the new CAS was well suited to supporting the F 1 strategy of linking the
health budget with reforms to health expenditure management.
6.    The context outlined above led to the design of the Bank project NSSHRP
(National Sector Support for Health Reform), and a budget support Grant of Euro 48.5
million from the European Commission (EC) for the Health Sector Policy Support
Programmes to assist the government in areas of good governance, health financing,
health service delivery, and regulation, specifically of drugs and medicines. The EC TF
Grant under review was but a small slice of the total support provided by the Bank and
the EC, and targeted six convergent provinces. These provinces did not meet the
standard fiduciary requirements, and therefore required oversight, for which the EC
requested Bank management of the Grant. It was also agreed at the time of Grant
development, that the project's outcome measures were to be based on the overall sector
outcomes, rather than outcomes specific to the Grant.
1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.    The objective of the Trust Fund was to increase utilization of affordable and
financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in participating
localities through the progressive implementation of the Philippine Government's Health
Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). The project consisted of two operational components,
to: (i) provide local health system reform grants to six (6) selected Convergence
Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon, Misamis Occidental and
Nueva Viscaya) to support activities set forth in their province-wide investment plans for
the health sector, and (ii) strengthen DOH's capacity in the area of public financial
management, internal audit, information management, procurement and performance
2


﻿monitoring under local government scorecards, through provision of training, technical
assistance, and required computer hardware and software. The third component was the
management of the Grant which received separate funding.
8.    Key indicators were:
(a) Births attended by skilled health professional at a health facility increased by 5
percent of baseline;
(b) DPT 3 vaccine coverage increased by 5 percent from baseline;
(c) Measles vaccine coverage increased by 5 percent from baseline;
(d) TB cure rate increased by 5 percent from baseline;
(e) TB case detection rate increased by 5 percent from baseline.
9.    The intermediate results indicators can be found in Annex 2.
1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The PDO were revised in December 2007 to read as follows: assist the Recipient to
increase utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health
services by the poor in participating localities (the selected Convergence Provinces and
conflict affected areas) through progressive implementation of the Recipient's Health
Sector Reform Agenda.
1.4   Main Beneficiaries
10.   The primary beneficiaries of the project were poor households in the Convergence
Provinces, starting with the first six: 1) Ilocos Norte, 2) Nueva Vizcaya, 3) Ifugao, 4)
Romblon, 5) South Leyte, and 6) Misamis Occidental. In early October 2007, the EU
Delegation requested the Bank to amend the existing Trust Fund Administration
Agreement to include additional provinces in conflict affected areas of Mindanao and the
Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in support of the upscaling of the
implementation of the health sector reforms under the Fl for Health. These additional
Mindanao provinces were: 7) Isabela City, 8) Zamboanga del Sur, 9) Zamboanga del
Norte, 10) Zamboanga Sibugay, 11) Compostela Valley, 12) Davao Oriental, 13) Lanao
del Norte, 14) Sarangani, 15) Sultan Kudarat, 16) ARMM (Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur,
Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi)
1.5   Original Components
11.   Part A: Recipient-Executed activities: Support to selected provinces/Local system
reform grants. The component would provide local health system reform grants to six (6)
selected Convergence Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon,
Misamis Occidental and Nueva Viscaya) to support activities set forth in their province-
wide investment plans for the health sector. These plans would aim at developing and
implementing the four goals of the government's health sector reform agenda, namely:
financing, regulation, health services delivery and good governance.
3


﻿12.   Part B: Recipient-Executed activities: Support to DOH/Strengthening DOH's
capacity. This component would strengthen DOH's capacity in the area of public
financial management, internal audit, information management, procurement and
performance monitoring under local government scorecards, through provision of
training, technical assistance, and required computer hardware and software.
13.   Part C: Bank-Executed activities: Incremental supervision activities.  The
component would finance direct incremental costs incurred by the Bank in supervising
the Recipient-executed activities under the grant.
1.6   Revised Components
14.   The components were restructured in December 2007 to include the
implementation of the EU's Mindanao Health Sector Policy Support Programme
(MHSPSP) through an amendment to the Administration Agreement as follows: a new
Part B was added: B1 would support to conflict-affected areas in the Mindanao; B2
would provide local health system reform grants to the conflict-affected areas in the
ARMM provinces. Part B was renamed Part C, and Part C was renamed Part D for
incremental supervision and project appraisal activities. The scope of intervention was
expanded to conflict-affected areas in Mindanao including the ARMM provinces with
additional financing provided by the European Commission (EC), and an amendment to
the existing Grant Agreement (TF070600). A second restructuring took place in June of
2012 that was approved for fund reallocation, and an extension of the closing date from
June 30, 2012 to October 31, 2012 to allow certain key activities to be completed.
1.7   Other significant changes
15.   The original EC Grant was for EUR 6.75 million, signed in April 2007 (EUR 5.75
million for the convergence provinces and EUR 1.0 million for DOH). The EC provided
additional funding of EUR 6.7 million, bringing total EC grant to EUR 13.45 million, to
include the ARMM and select Mindanao provinces which expanded the scope of the
project, and put a heavier burden on the DOH to manage the project. Each province had
to put in place Province-wide Investment Plans for Health (PIPH) followed by annual
operational and procurement plans, together with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
These would be reviewed by the Joint Appraisal Committee (JAC). The implementation
set-up and the need for rigorous control were appreciated, but with Local Government
Units (LGUs) at differing levels of capacity, this required substantial capacity building.
16.   The supervision missions were carried out through the Joint Assessment and
Planning Initiative (JAPI), which is a forum of partners in health. The JAPI met two
times a year to carry out the implementation of the Grant and made recommendations on
implementation issues. However, the JAPI supervisions may have been insufficient
given some of the issues that emerged during implementation, and closer and more field
visits may have been warranted.

﻿2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.   The Grant was provided by the EC to support the government's health reforms
through the Fl for health strategy, on areas such as service delivery (e.g. health
facilities/infrastructures), governance (e.g. improvement of the public financial
management), information system (including the monitoring system) with the aim of
bringing quality improvement of health services in the convergence provinces.  The
Grant under review is but a small slice of a larger grant financed by the EC through
budget support to the government. The Grant itself focused on six provinces which had
weaker fiduciary systems and required more intensive capacity building and oversight,
leading to the subsequent agreement with the World Bank to manage this Grant. The
activities were subsequently expanded to include the Mindanao and ARMM provinces.
The focus was to improve service delivery for the poor and develop and/or improve
management tools of the DOH. The DOH, responsible for overall policy and regulation,
devolved oversight for implementation of the policies and strategies to the decentralized
level, which in turn devolved the tasks to the regional offices - from the Centers for
Health Development (CHDs) to the Local Government Units (LGUs) responsible for
service delivery. Capacity among the CHDs varied and was uneven. The capacity of
LGUs also varied and some required much more capacity building than others. The Grant
placed emphasis on capacity building with the development and use of standardized tools
to ensure consistency among the CHDs and the LGUs. The Grant relied on the same
structure as the NSSHRP to facilitate implementation.   However, the Project
Development Objectives (PDO) and the monitoring indicators were not appropriate for
this Grant, since the activities under the Grant were much smaller in scale and much more
localized. For example, the Grant indicators do not fully measure the "increased
utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health services
by the poor in participating localities". Usage was measured by skilled attendants and
vaccine coverage, however, affordability was not measured, nor were measures available
to evaluate financial sustainability. Quality was measured through the availability of
essential drugs and vaccines and accreditation of health facilities. Both the Grant PDO
and indicators were over ambitious and reflected national level data, but not for the
convergent provinces.
18.   Unforeseen during the design phase, was the active role required by the DOH to
provide more intensive guidance to the CHDs and to the LGUs in implementing the
reform. The devolution of the health sector was not as robust as was expected, and
certain LGUs had difficulty in fulfilling the requirements under the Grant and
implementing the reform. With regard to the identification of the poor, the LGUs were
not willing to use the government's proxy means testing tool, and did not agree to
financially support the payment of premium of the poor identified by the government's
NHTS, which, for all intents and purposes, was a far more improved tool to the system
used by the LGUs. The LGU system had a roster of households which did not fall under
the NHTS definition of the poor. These refer to LGU-sponsored "poor" before the
implementation of NHTS, whereby the LGU social worker filled out a checklist/intake
5


﻿form and ascertained whether a family qualified as poor or not. Other LGUs implemented
a Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) or some other proxy means test
methodology.
19.   Oversight of the Grant and review/approvals of the PHIPs and AOPs was
provided by the JAC, which ensured that these were aligned with the national reforms.
The JAC also served as an advisory body to the DOH and Fl provinces. The JAC
reviewed and approved the Province-wide Investment Plan for Health (PIPHs). The
Operational Manual for Local Health Systems Reform Grants described the method by
which the grants provided to the LGUs would be dispensed, the purpose of improving
performance, and the Project Operation Manual governed the grants provided to the DOH
to improve the financial and procurement management of the reform and the Grant.
Standard operational and procurement plans were developed with the Annual Service
Level Agreements (SLAs), and training was provided to the LGUs.
20.   The model of using PIPHs and Annual Operation Plans (AOP) for ensuring
implementation of the reform at LGU level was deemed effective on focusing the
attention of the total 16 convergence provinces on healthcare delivery, prioritizing
program activities, and funding (such as the provision of birthing facilities to ensure
coverage and outreach). The municipalities were involved in the development of the
PIPH with Memorandum of Understandings established between municipalities and
provinces.
21.   In establishing the above, the design could have been reinforced to better manage
the capacity issues which emerged at multiple levels of the Grant structure, and which led
to serious delays in the launch of activities. The learning curve was steep in (a) preparing
operational and procurement plans on a realistic and manageable basis (PIPH
development took almost two years to prepare for the 16 provinces); (b) the time needed
for reviews by the JAC, which became quite lengthy; (c) the need for extended exchanges
between the field and the central level in finalizing the documentation; (d) the time
needed to prepare the PIPHs, followed by the AOPs; and finally (e) the preparation of the
SLAs which were contracts that needed to be abided to in order to receive funds. The
DOH and the LGUs adhered to the Government Procurement Reform Act and which the
Bank likewise subscribed to -- thus there was no conflict on the procurement system and
methodologies to be used under the Grant. Both the LGUs and the DOH procured goods
and equipment. However, the DOH had the responsibility for procuring consultant
services, and which they were not as familiar with procedures and guidelines. In the case
of ARMM, the agreement was that the DOH Central Office would undertake the
procurement process with inputs from ARMM DOH with regard to the preparation of the
bidding documents and inputs to the technical specifications
22.   The other aspect that led to delays was the process of accreditation of LGUs by
which LGUs could avail of PhilHealth reimbursements, and setting up a scorecard system
which rated LGU performance and ability to receive the variable tranches (disbursements
based on meeting targets). In addition, the CHDs needed to be trained in the PhilHealth
6


﻿Benchbook Standards for Out-Patient Services, for which DOH had oversight
responsibility.
23.   The Grant could have strengthened the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
framework in how data was to be collected, the responsible entity in charge of that data,
frequency of data collection, and how the outcomes related to funding or funds expended
(an example is TB coverage--amount expended), as well as regular reporting. The Grant
could have improved the M&E system by identifying indicators which better matched the
activities being undertaken under the Grant and ensure that the PDOs were better aligned
with the objectives of the Grant rather than the overall reform program.
24.   The above issues could have benefitted from a quality at entry process so that the
problems noted above could have been resolved early on. For example, it is noted below
that the annual SLAs took quite some time to be processed which delayed Grant activities.
2.2   Implementation
25.   Originally, the EC Grant was to fund six provinces. This was expanded to select
Mindanao and ARMM provinces, in which the Fl would be implemented. The DOH was
responsible for overall implementation. The mechanisms described above were put in
place to that effect.
26.   The first annual SLAs between the LGUs and DOH were not signed until May
2007, and the Annual Operation Plans for CY2007 were approved only in March 2008.
The Operational Manual for Local Health Systems Reform Grants (which became the Fl
Operations Manual for Convergence Provinces: Implementation of the Province-wide
Investment Plan for Health) was finalized in November 2007, and the Project Operation
Manual was not approved till May 2009.
27.   Procurement orientation workshops were held in March 2007, however not till
late in 2007 did the first six provinces have their bidding documents ready. There were
engineering and architectural design issues which proved contentious for the six
provinces. In addition, clarity of roles could have been better managed to avoid
misunderstanding within DOH as to the responsibility it held with regard to the
procurement process under the Grant, which then led to delays in procurement processing
and approval of procurement packages. This was also compounded by an insufficient
number of human resources to undertake the procurement activities at the DOH level,
given that DOH was managing a multitude of activities in parallel. Funding was
available under the Grant to strengthen DOH capacity, which was not fully used during
the Grant period. The financial management review of October 2007 found that financial
management capacity could have been strengthened, systems improved to adequately
implement the project, and increases in human resources to manage the Grant overall. In
addition, during a critical time, the DOH was unable to focus on the task at hand due to
the rationalization plan being carried out in parallel by the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM) which required DOH staff time and which took their attention away
from project implementation. It is worth mentioning that the rationalization plan has not
yet been adopted by the DBM. It was also noted that the process of clearing the LGU
7


﻿work plans and SLAs was negatively impacted by the above, which led to further delays
in the final submission and approvals of the provincial Annual Operation Plans and
Provincial Procurement Plans. A more proactive approach from DOH might have
resolved some of the above. Nevertheless, once the learning curve was overcome, the
SLAs became institutionalized and are now being implemented nationwide.
28.   Up to September 2008 it was noted that the DOH had not yet finalized the M&E
of the sector reform. Data collection mechanisms had not been defined, nor quality
control of data, data analysis, and use of the data for improved decision-making.
Baseline data was collected, but given the validity question of the data it is unclear
whether real progress has been made.
29.   A rather more serious impact was the inconsistent reporting on progress and the
submission to the Bank (and the EC) on both progress and procurement reports. Delays
in submission of the audit report were also regular occurrences.
30.   Overall, the Grant would have benefitted from increased oversight, focus on
results, reduced bureaucracy, and clearer flow of decision making, to ensure that funds
were timely disbursed and indicators better monitored.
2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
31.   The ME3 is the M&E system which the DOH used, and within the ME3 was the
scorecard system that was being used under the Grant. The scorecard was to align LGU
activities among all LGUs and compare LGU performance. The ME3 included data on
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which was part of the design, and the data
selected was in response to the four pillars of the HSRP. However, the design of the
M&E and indicators selected were for a more national high-level approach, which did not
take into account the local context and whether the indicators identified and selected were
currently being collected, or could be collected. The SLAs were a framework to assist
the LGUs in collecting standardized national data which would feed into the process of
determining the effects of the reform. However, the "standardized" tool did not respond
to the reality on the ground as certain LGUs could not collect the data, not having a
mechanism to do so. Some of the SLA indicators were subsequently modified to allow
the LGUs to collect and report on data that they could collect. However, that meant that
comparability between the LGUs could not take place, and LGUs could not be evaluated
on the same basis. SLAs were later improved for uniformity and comparability. This
modification benefitted the LGUs, as they received variable tranche awards for good
performance (which was on the basis of what they could collect and analyze), but with
little effort in putting in place a mechanism to collect more useful data that could inform
decision makers on the key health issues of the province, or on required national data.
32.   The M&E framework was subsequently revised to include standard indicators for
all LGUs. Data in the last Implementation Status Report (ISR) does not reflect accurate
data. Therefore, this review corrects that data based on the Field Health Service
Information System (FHSIS) reports received for 2007, 2010, and 2011. A review of the
data shows a wide variation, bringing into question the validity of the data and the
8


﻿verification process of the data. For example, under the rubric "Births attended by skilled
health professional at a health facility", Ilocos Norte shows a jump from 35.0 percent in
2007 to 74.6 percent in 2010; Misamis Occidental shows a jump of 17.0 percent in 2007
to 50.5 percent in 2010, and Sulu a drop from 7.9 percent in 2007 to 2.8 percent in 2010.
It is unclear whether there is an issue with the definition of the indicator (the FHSIS
reports for Normal Type Deliveries and Other Type Deliveries in Health facilities. The
question is whether both types of deliveries are being reported or only one. In addition,
there may be an issue of the denominator, period of reporting, self-reports, and potential
disconnect of data flow from the provinces to DOH. Data on delivery attendant does not
specify the locale, only the health professional providing the service. The 2010 Field
Health Services Information System also changed the reporting format which makes it
difficult to compare data between different years. Determining LGU performance
through the SLAs does not lead to clarity on what was achieved as far as making
healthcare delivery accessible to the most vulnerable.  Attribution is therefore difficult
to ascertain given the above, and there is disconnect between the high-level indicators
and local implementation.
2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
33.   The safeguards were rated Category B. There were a number of caveats which
the team was to ensure compliance:
34.   Civil Works. It was agreed that the Country Systems Approach, using the
environmental regulations and procedures already in place in the Philippines, was
satisfactory to address the issues under the project. There was no new construction
planned; and assurances were provided that issues such as noise, dust, worker safety, and
isolation of work area would be addressed for the rehabilitation of existing buildings.
35.   The environmental and healthcare waste management guidelines developed for
the 2nd Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project in the Philippines would be used to
satisfactorily address the healthcare waste issues in this Grant. It was noted that an
Administrative Order which covers medical waste, and the guidelines and manual were
endorsed by the safeguards team. The DOH reported general compliance with agreed
environmental management plans. The DOH enforced the proper management of Health
Care Waste through its technical guidelines. The Department of Environment and
Natural Resources also monitors compliance with these guidelines. There were no
significant environmental safeguards issues in the project.
36.   Indigenous People: Most of the target provinces had indigenous minority
populations, thereby triggering the policy. An Indigenous People's Policy Framework
(IPPF) was prepared for the NSSHRP, and was found to be satisfactory. The project has
invested in goods, equipment, and systems to make a contribution to healthcare access to
indigenous people, but there is no concrete data that can provide a more substantial
assessment.
37.   Per a Bank mission report of February 2011, the DOH documented and assessed
the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples' (IP) Plan in Surigao del Sur, the results of
9


﻿which were to inform the development of a broader policy for enhancing delivery of
health services in indigenous communities. The DOH stated that there were various
initiatives by different DOH Field Offices related to IP-focused health delivery, and the
findings were to be synthesized for lessons learned and toward the development of a
policy framework or guidelines to be disseminated. The government has prepared with
the EC a targeted IP project which is under implementation.
38.   Financial and procurement management were issues under the Grant as the DOH
and the LGUs were unfamiliar with procurement procedures and processes. Despite
training provided, there needed close follow-up of the full process, in light of inadequate
or appropriate reporting of financial and procurement processes, recurrent delays in the
receipt of Financial Monitoring Reports, overdue audit reports, tracking of expenditures
at both the DOH and decentralized levels, and the inability to obtain progress and
procurement reports as requested by the World Bank. There were also problems with
reconciliation of accounts, separate book keeping, inaccurate use of forms, etc. The
release of funds by the DOH to the provinces, and usage of funds for DOH's own
capacity building program, was also problematic due to bureaucratic processes both
within and outside of the DOH, staff turnover, adequate knowledge of internal
procedures, and the need for a more proactive approach by relevant budgetary agencies to
resolve problems.
39.   In addition, the delays in procurement were due to the difficulty that LGUs had in
following the procedures required (World Bank and government had harmonized the
bidding procedures), and the LGUs found themselves overwhelmed by the large program
they had to implement. The learning curve was steep for all parties concerned in getting
the activities off the ground. In addition, there were issues surrounding shopping
procedures requiring at least three quotes; this was difficult to obtain in certain
environments due to distance and lack of interest. Given the problems encountered in
being able to garner more bidder interest and participation, and to improve
implementation, acceptance of a minimum of two quotes was approved for the DOH on
an exceptional basis for specific procurement packages. Once the learning curve was
achieved, the LGUs appreciated the structure and organization they had to follow, and
were able to comply with procedures.
2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
40.   The health reform  will continue under the Government's commitment to
Universal Health Care. The government expects that membership of NHTS households
into NHIP will increase with enhanced NHIP benefits package being implemented, as
well as service delivery transformations to support a reformed NHIP. The DOH could
also benefit from increased support, particularly in the field of monitoring and evaluation,
to ensure that the programs being implemented result in outputs and outcomes that
inform policy. In addition, additional work on the validity and quality of data would be
beneficial to better inform trends, progress, and policies in the sector.  Several
Development Partners are working on a number of fronts to strengthen health service
delivery.
10


﻿3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
41.    The Project Development Objectives (PDO), though overly ambitious for this
Grant, remain highly relevant for the Philippines as the government strives to achieve
UHC by 2016. The government continues to push ahead with the enrolment of the
poorest families in the Philippines into PhilHealth's Sponsored Program. Prior to the
NSSHRP and the Grant, the different instruments used by the LGUs to target the poor
were not satisfactory, and instead resulted in the politicization of enrolment of the poor.
The Grant achieved a certain measure of success, though direct attribution is difficult to
ascertain. Poor families are being enrolled in the national program, but the quality of
services is not reflected in the indicators which remain unmet (vaccination coverage,
accreditation of Rural Health Units), and the capacity of DOH requires further
strengthening. In addition, closer attention to absorptive capacity and government system
at the design stage might have identified some of the issues that were raised during
implementation.
42.    The design of the Grant was also relevant in providing much needed additional
equipment and technical assistance to solidify aspects of the reform, and provided needed
tools to improve the efficiency of public financing in the health sector, toward a more
results-oriented system. However, given the above, the design of the Grant should have
been strengthened to take into account weaknesses encountered under implementation.
The Grant tied in with the CAS on supporting public expenditure management reform,
improved governance, and targeting of public expenditure. An outcome is that the
current CAS has adopted the National Program Support (NPS) model as one of the key
instruments for support to social sectors.
43.    The Grant tagged onto the same implementation arrangement as the NSSHRP.
As it turned out, implementation was fraught with issues due to the fragmentation of
decentralization, lack of firm oversight, bureaucratic delays and the need to apply rules
and procedures that implementers were not familiar with, including procedures for
quality data collection and usage. Without a good tracking system, it was difficult to tie
in expenditure with outcomes under the PIPHs, SLAs, and other contractual
arrangements.
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
44.    The Project Development Objectives of increasing utilization of affordable and
financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor was
overambitious for this Grant and therefore difficult to assess given the weak incremental
changes in baseline to actual figures, or even in some cases regression in outcomes. The
rating is therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Despite the government making
great efforts under the NSSHRP to purchase needed vaccines, vaccination coverage
remained low for the 16 provinces. However, the findings of a 2008 review noted a
number of issues, such as a high volume of drugs and vaccines that had expired before
11


﻿even being dispensed, poor inventory and consumption reports on distribution of vaccines
and drugs, and minimal use of inventory cards and inconsistent information.
* measles vaccination decreased;
* small incremental changes in DPT3 vaccine coverage;
* no improvement in TB case detection rates;
* systemic stock-outs and lack of monitoring for the availability of essential drugs
and vaccines at facility level.
45.     However, some data obtained suggests that there have been improvements over
time for other health issues, such as improvements to morbidity rates of acute lower
respiratory tract infection and pneumonia, filariasis morbidity rates, and malaria
morbidity rates.

﻿46.    In addition, the Rural Health Units (RHUs) did not meet all their targets as
reflected in the table below: 28/49 RHUs were accredited for Maternity Care Package;
69/100 RHUs were accredited for Tuberculosis Package; and 99/102 RHUs were
accredited for Out-Patient Package. Some of the key reasons of non-accreditation were
to do with issues of non-compliance with physical space requirements (TB-DOTs, MCP),
necessary and needed equipment, and qualified trained personnel.

47.    In a 2008 DOH Accomplishment Report, the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate
(CPR) was stated to have increased by 6 percent in all 16 provinces through the provision
of family planning commodities, family planning reproductive health grants, Voluntary
Surgical Contraception (VSC), and drugs and supplies. However, the 2010 Field Health
Services Information System (FHSIS) uses different tables between the 2010 and the
2007 and 2008 FHSIS, which distorts comparability. If we take the data provided in the
DOH report of 2009, and review the FHSIS of 2007, 2008, and 2010, there is wide
variation in the data, as seen below.

﻿48.   The 2011 Family Health Survey notes a 2011 national CPR rate accomplishment
of 48.9 percent, which was the same rate assessed under the National Demographic and
Household Survey (NDHS) in 2003 (48.9 percent), whereas the 2008 NDHS noted 50.7
percent.
49.   Data for birth attendance by a skilled health professional at a health facility also
highlights the need for data validation and improvements in data collection and reporting.
For example, one non-ARMM province shows improvements in the indicator, but data
provided from provincial reports differ from the data reported in the FHSIS. This may be
due to the definition of the indicator (only normal deliveries in hospitals or inclusion of
other deliveries in hospital), denominator, reporting period, etc.

50.   It is noted that coverage by PhilHealth for the poor increased substantially with
the introduction of the NHTS-Poverty Reduction method. This comprises the poorest
families who had not been enrolled under the original LGU targeted program. The
NHTS data covered 48.5 percent of the poor in the 16 provinces. However, what is
difficult to determine is the quality of coverage under UHC or the quality of health
services received by that population group which could be strengthened through
qualitative and quantitative surveys.
51.   Given the lack of progress reports, it is difficult to attribute progress under the EC
TF Grant. A substantial amount of policy, regulation and legislation has been approved
over the intervening years, yet the applicability and implementation of these is not known
or fully assessed. Some of these are related to the Quality Medicine Act of 2008 (where
enforcement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is of concern); the Philippine
National Drug Formulary which was incorporated under the Generics Act (before the
Grant implementation period) to promote rational drug use and which formed the basis
for claim reimbursement for drugs and medicines from PhilHealth; and many others. Of
note is the recently signed Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012
by the President of the Philippines.
52.   In parallel, achievements are noted in use of generic drugs (47 percent in 2003 to
60 percent in 2010); facility based deliveries, reduction of chronic disease medication,
increased number of nurses for community health services, performance monitoring
through scorecards and standardization, among others. The Grant financed needed
equipment and training, established the Inter-Local Health Zones (ILHZ) to make service
delivery access more efficient, and rehabilitated a number of health centers. The 2012
EC evaluation states that the health mapping exercise (rationalization plans) was less
effective as patients were assigned to health centers which proved to be farther afield than
a health center next door.
14


﻿53.    Another indicator was the LGU scorecard performance for the 16 provinces being
funded under the Grant. The project looked at three scorecard indicators: TB case
detection rate, TB cure rate and fully immunized child. The trend was positive for certain
LGUs, from 2006 up to 2011. Those that started off on a lower level almost remained
where they were at the end of the period. The table below describes the status of the
scorecard indicators: the first column shows an upward arrow--positive trend from 2010
to 2011. The tab Rated Green means on target, tab Rated Yellow means off target but
better than the baseline while tab Rated Red means off target and below baseline levels.

(but lOweF than 2011 Taret) 2006 National Averate
54.    With regard to the four pillars of Fl, the Health Financing pillar progress is
mixed. The DOH overall appropriation in FY12 was 42.2 PhP billion, versus 33.8 in
2010. Given the existing weaknesses in monitoring, there is no clear picture of fund
distribution at the provincial and municipal levels. The Health Service Delivery pillar
led to national dissemination of the tools undertaken with this Grant: PIPH, Annual
Operations Plan (AOP), and SLAs. Health facility accreditation under PhilHealth's
different programs is ongoing (48.9 percent of RHUs were accredited under the Grant).
However, more can be done to improve immunization coverage, outreach, quality of care,
and monitoring and evaluation. As mentioned above, much has been done under the
Health Regulation pillar, but the enforcement of these policies and guidelines cannot be
assessed due to lack of information. One aspect of the pharmaceutical policy is the
expansion of the Botika ng Barangays (BnBs) to increase the access to cheaper and
quality drugs in rural areas. But long-term access to medicines under this program may
15


﻿only be sustainable with increased investments, routine supervision, monitoring and
support systems. The Good Governance pillar was successful in standardizing and
institutionalizing the PIPHs, the AOPs, and the rationalization process of the health
systems. The Grant further developed on the Expenditure Tracking System (which still
remains at a more central level), and the Electronic National Government Accounting
System (e-NGAS), was still being used at the decentralized level. Separately, the EC
funded additional work on public financial management at both the national and local
levels through separate funding. These included work with DBM on implementing PEFA
at the sub-national levels and assisting Grant LGUs come with their own PFM
development plans.
3.3   Efficiency
55.   Net present value, economic and financial rate of return, or cost-effectiveness was
not calculated a priori for the grant. Nevertheless, overall national health spending
provides a mixed picture. Out-of-Pocket (OOP) spending continues to be the largest
source of health spending (54 percent). However, since the election of the new
government, there is a strong commitment to increasing health spending with a related
increase in the DOH's budget which has risen significantly- from PhP 31 billion in 2011,
to PhP 42 billion in 2012, and PhP 53.8 billion in 2013. An increasingly larger share of
DOH's budget goes to financing premium for indigents - from PhP 3 billion in 2011 to
PhP 12.6 billion in 2012. There is also an increase of financing share of public health
program out of total government health spending (33.7 percent in CY2007 to 44.7
percent in CY2013). Prior to the grant, the share of public health program out of the
government health spending (excluding staff salary) was 25 percent, while 65 percent
went into hospital operations.
56.   The efficiency of grant execution through the measurement of disbursement was
high, given the block grant nature of the disbursement tranches. However, efficiency was
dampened by the DOH's inability to disburse the amounts in a timely manner and these
varied between the provinces (disbursement to the ARMM provinces was much delayed)
given the processes impacting project supervision outlined earlier). In addition, the DOH
was not able to fully track expenditures with associated outcomes.
3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
57.   The overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory based on substantial
relevance, modest efficacy, and modest efficiency. While the Grant supported
improvements to health delivery and LGU performance through the use of scorecards,
including capacity building efforts at the DOH, there is a lack of data that shows higher
utilization of health services by the poor. Nor is there data to indicate that OOP payments
have been reduced. Poor households were only enrolled in April 2011 and PhilHealth has
only recently enhanced its benefits packages which would ensure better financial
protection. In addition, though the NSSHRP and the Grant made available needed public
health goods, data for the priority public health targets were not fully met. Tools
16


﻿developed under the Grant were semi-institutionalized, but more will be required,
particularly in linking performance with outcome.
3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58.   The Grant focused on making healthcare accessible to the poor in convergence
provinces. Despite the lack of progress reports from the Recipient's side, activities were
carried out for the most part: healthcare was strengthened through renovation of
healthcare facilities; training; purchase of needed equipment was allocated at service
delivery entry points; and Basic, and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn
Care (BEmONC/CEmONC) services were reinforced. Equipment for blood banks was
provided, dental services, and basic healthcare packages were provided through
PhilHealth allowing the most vulnerable to gain access to primary care. The EC
evaluation report notes that IP were not sufficiently consulted on their needs, and data
from a Catchment and Case Flow Analysis carried out by the EC TA team shows that the
IPs have less access to primary health care, however the report does not state how many
provinces this was carried out in.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
59.   The Grant contributed to strengthening the delivery of health services through the
rehabilitation of health care centers, and funded training and needed equipment and
goods. The Grant also provided variable tranche releases to award good performing
LGUs, increasing competition to improve service delivery, and institutionalized the use
of planning and implementation tools, which increased cooperation and collaboration
between the LGUs and the DOH. However, several weaknesses remain. There are
insufficient funds for the maintenance of the health system overall, and more particularly
in infrastructure. The rationale behind the DOH implementing the Health Facility
Enhancement Program (HFEP) was as a one-time capital investment to complement the
increased financing provided by PhilHealth. There is a need to increase the focus and
effort on prioritizing activities, and providing a more robust rationale for investment in
the sector based on solid data. The DOH would need to make more efficient use of
resources, responding more to demand rather than supply. In addition, a focus on actual
health delivery rather than on health infrastructure, and increased performance through
impact evaluation so that the information can be used for sound policy and decision-
making would be warranted. Funding was available under the Grant to strengthen
DOH's capacity; however, there was a missed opportunity as funds were not used to
strengthen procurement capacity, or to strengthen the M&E system.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
60.   The original design of the project incorporated a means test to identify the poor:
Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS). The Department of Social Welfare and
Development (DSWD) also had a means testing system. The LGUs defined who the poor
were using the systems they had. However, when PhilHealth scaled-up health insurance
17


﻿for poor families, using the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction
(NHTS-PR), the LGUs resisted as the list of the poor did not match between the NHTS-
PR and the list provided by each LGU. This has caused some deep seated sensitivity in
having to remove the non-NHTS-PR beneficiaries from the LGU list. This was the first
time in the Philippines that a refined targeting mechanism, based on well-accepted proxy
means test (PMT) methodology was available, and was disseminated to all social
assistance programs. PhilHealth had to cross-match the list generated through the NHTS
with the existing list of sponsored members. Other issues had to be resolved such as the
LGU cost sharing arrangement under the NHIP.
61.   This was a significant policy success as it led to enrolment of around 5.2 million
families (approximately 20 percent of the population). Use of the NHTS also paved the
way for the government's scale-up of universal health care (UHC).
3.6   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial (S)
62.   The government is committed to UHC, and the law No. 10351 "An Act
Restructuring the Excise Tax on Alcohol and Tobacco Products", was signed in late
December 2012. The additional revenues from the Sin Tax Bill are expected to be used
to fund UHC enrolment and health expenditures for prevention and promotion. In
addition, the DOH budget was increased by 44 percent from 2010 to 2011 to cover an
enhanced premium of PhP 2400 (US$54) for all National Household Targeting System -
Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) targeted poor households. The 2013 budget includes PhP
13.8 billion (approximately US$305 million) to cover the remaining households under the
NHTS-PR. The LGUs now need to be convinced that the NHTS-PR method will
correctly identify the most vulnerable populations. The DOH needs to better organize its
role and accountability in light of the experience under the Grant, and solidify the tools
developed, and improve efficiency and effectiveness of services to the population.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance
5.1   Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
63.   The Grant was in supplement to the NSSHRP. Therefore a Quality at Entry
assessment was not carried out as the Grant tagged onto the same institutional and
implementation arrangements that were in place under the NSSHRP, through a Grant
Agreement. The Grant was targeted originally to six provinces to pilot the reform of F 1,
and the Bank was contracted by the Donor to carry out the supervision as those provinces
required closer financial and procurement management. The Administration Agreement
was signed between the EC and the World Bank in April 2007. There was no preparation
18


﻿phase per se, as both the NSSHRP and the Grant were being prepared and implemented
during the same period (NSSHRP was under implementation since March of 2007 and
the Grant became effective in June 2007). The Grant applied the same implementation
format as the NSSHRP. Both the project and the Grant experienced serious delays. As in
both the project and the Grant, there was insufficient attention to how implementation
would be undertaken. The Grant relied on the existing governmental structure and
decentralization of service delivery, but there was insufficient attention to the existing
capacity of both the DOH and PhilHealth in implementing the reform program.
64.   In addition, there was little assessment as to the participation of the LGUs, their
capacity and willingness to participate in the reform process, particularly in light of what
occurred on the ground with the use of the CBMS and the national program using NHTS-
PR.
65.   The Bank carried out a financial and procurement assessment of the ARMM
provinces in 2008, which was delayed due to the resurgence of conflict, but was
subsequently completed in October 2009. These delays meant that the ARMM provinces
were unable to complete their 2011/12 SLAs in time as the closing date was not extended
and closed in October 2012.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
66.   There were shortcomings in the quality of the Bank's supervision. The team
carried out detailed supervision reviews of the Grant in early 2008 and 2009, raising
some of the more serious concerns and requesting government response. However, this
attention became less concentrated with the changes in Bank task management over the
lifetime of the Grant. There was a notable shift from detailed supervision of activities to
a focus on disbursement of Grant proceeds, with increased assistance in procurement
support to the detriment of closer operational supervision. The team did not avail of the
tools at its disposal when faced with non-compliance of fiduciary aspects, which might
have triggered a respect for the legal clauses in the Grant Agreement (submission of
timely audits, and financial management reports, procurement reports, and progress
reports). There are no government/Implementing Agency progress reports in the files.
Based on an EC report of November 2010, the provincial Annual Operations Plans
(AOP) approvals had improved substantially over time and the 2010 AOPs for the 16
provinces were endorsed in December 2009.    The EC delegation mission noted
improvements in results as outlined in the SLAs (TB detection rate partly achieved at 89
percent for 6/10 provinces; TB cure rate of which 7 provinces had performed better than
the national average; breastfeeding within one hour after birth was partly achieved with 7
provinces outperforming from the national average).
67.   The joint missions that took place could have been further strengthened with
individual missions and more in-depth reporting, particularly in the latter part of the
implementation period. The last progress report from the World Bank to the EC
identified in the files was dated September 30, 2011. The status primarily relies on
financial information rather than a progress report on activities, outputs, and outcomes.
19


﻿68.   There was detailed follow-up by the fiduciary teams on financial and procurement
management and the files are populated with approved procurement plans, AOPs, IFRs,
etc. However, procurement reports lack an in-depth description of what was achieved.
The third party verification focused primarily on scorecard performance and assessment
of procurement and financial management systems.    Workshops were held on
procurement orientation following the new and revised harmonized procurement
documents (Resolution No. 06-2010). Nevertheless, it was noted that turn-around time of
procurement undertaken by the LGUs was quite long and drawn out, requiring multiple
levels of review (LGU to CHD, submitted to DOH through the Bureau of International
Health Center) and finally to the Bank for prior review, taking a total of 3-6 months or
longer to complete the cycle. The restructuring could have tried to mitigate some of the
issues, particularly if a Mid-Term Review of the Grant had been held in mid-course.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
69.   UHC had not been a national policy at the time of the Grant, and therefore, the
objective of expanding the Fl reform to key provinces was justified, particularly with
additional assistance to DOH to put in standards and tools for prioritization and
rationalization of services. Following the Mindanao peace process, it was logical to
include ARMM provinces in the Grant activities. The assessment on feasibility of success
relied on the preparation and implementation arrangements of the NSSHRP. Both the
project and the Grant suffered from the same weaknesses with lack of reporting and
follow-up on outcomes, and more in-depth supervision.
5.2   Recipient Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
70.   The government made a decision to adopt NHTS and introduced it nationally.
This had an impact on the ability to pilot and learn from implementation of the reform.
In parallel, the LGUs argued to retain their own methods of identifying the poor, and
were paying for premiums out of public funds. PhilHealth attempted to convince the
LGUs to adopt the NHTS with little success. There was an unsatisfactory compromise
between the LGU and the government, and currently, two parallel systems exist to cover
two sets of populations. The premium of the poor identified by NHTS is paid for by the
government, while the premium of the "poor" identified by LGU method is paid for by
LGUs, though the target population is not the most vulnerable. The decentralization did
not lend itself to successful achievement of health delivery services, and though 5.2
million households have been reached by PhilHealth, there is no clear evidence how
UHC is improving the health of the most vulnerable.
20


﻿(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
71.   Decentralization brought its own challenges, and both the DOH and the LGUs,
through the CHDs, were unable to tackle some of the more contentious issues. The DOH
had problems in its own organization to be effective, and human resource constraints and
absorptive capacity led to many delays in project implementation. The DOH ran into
difficulties with the DBM, due to lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities (the DOH
dealt with two offices in the DBM: a bureau in charge of the DOH as a whole, and a
separate Project Management Office in charge of the EC Grant), which led to further
confusion on the interpretation of issuances, response to DOH requests, etc.. In addition,
personnel changes within the DBM led to implementation difficulties. Several issues
were raised early in the project by both the EC and the World Bank. But due to lack of
reporting from DOH on progress on the ground, questionable data and evaluation
methods, it is not clear how problems were addressed and resolved. Audit report
recommendations describe a wide array of issues. As an example, in a 2010 audit report,
it was noted that for the 2008 AOP, 67 percent of activities had not been completed
(enrollment of indigents, procurement of TB laboratory equipment, rabies vaccines,
among others). On a number of levels, the audit report reiterated the need for DOH to
review its ability to manage a large influx of funds, and the need to timely release funds
so that the provinces could provide the benefits needed to their population and fulfill their
SLAs. One province received funds for the 2008 SLA which were budgeted under a
request for Supplemental Budget 2009, and only received in December 2009. One of the
audits found that there were also anomalies in dispensing funds at the provincial level,
with Medical Officers acting as Special Disbursement Officers, which was contrary to
sound practices.
72.   In addition, it is difficult to determine the participatory approach that occurred as
polarization between the LGUs and government/PhilHealth methods led to a conflict of
scope and result which has not been resolved to date. It was noted that the DOH did
involve the CHDs later on in the approval process of LGU plans, but not in the process of
the initial PIPH development, which may have caused some confusion initially. The
DOH did not carry out sufficient overall supervision of the Grant activities in the
provinces and municipalities. In addition, the coverage and impact of services were
difficult to determine due to the weakness of the monitoring and evaluation system, and
tracking of expenditures. Oversight and management of health sector delivery remained
weak due to the structural organization which was reactive, having to constantly adjust to
reform parameters.
73.   Weak communication in imparting the requirements of the reform led to delays in
LGUs fulfilling and accurately preparing their SLAs. This became clearer once scores
provided on achievements of the SLA performance targets were provided with their
corresponding tranches. In 2008, LGUs were allowed by the DOH to select some of the
SLA indicators. Several LGUs admitted that selected indicators were based on what was
most doable and achievable. This led to a standardization of indicators to be monitored
starting in 2009. A noted problem was the selection of indicators and inconsistency with
21


﻿what was actually being collected in the field. In addition, and as noted above, there
were also delays in disbursement/tranche release which led to delays in implementation
and achievements of SLA targets (particularly for large provinces like Pangasinan[not a
project site but part of the original 16 convergence provinces], with 44 municipalities and
4 cities, placing them at a disadvantage since it took them longer to implement province-
wide interventions).
74.    The latter years have seen much work done with regard to procuring needed
medical equipment, commodities, training of staff, organization of services, and
identification and incorporation of the poor into PhilHealth. However, with no record of
progress report on the Recipient's side, it is difficult to determine the extent these
activities have had on service delivery.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
75.    The Grant was seriously delayed in implementation. Once the bottlenecks were
cleared, implementation started at full steam, though there were still some issues
surrounding the realism and achievability of the SLAs and PIPHs. The delays also meant
that provinces, particularly ARMM provinces, were urgently trying to complete all
activities before Grant closure. Overall governance could have been improved and tools
more systematized in order to monitor and evaluate progress and quality of data.
6.     Lessons Learned
76.    Use of country systems in National Program Support Operations to ensure
ownership and continuity of reforms: The Grant under review was provided to the World
Bank as a fiduciary agent for a work program that required closer follow-up and
monitoring. The instruments used under the Grant required a steep learning curve,
compounded by the complication of learning new systems (financial and procurement
management of an entity outside of governmental agencies), and lack of a coherent
national implementation framework. Due to the devolution of delivery of healthcare
services, and the reigning political and social contexts, the DOH could have used a
portion of the Grant to ensure compliance with country systems through increased
training and supervision, while strengthening ownership of the reforms as well as
accountability. Ownership and accountability need to be served by robust systems of
management, oversight, and monitoring and evaluation in order to benefit the continuity
of services and reforms engaged under this Grant. The M&E framework needs to be
developed with full partnership of all agencies to make it a viable system, and which can
be further developed and strengthened over time.
77.    Strengthening results and policy focus of National Program Support: Budget
support operations provide the opportunity to link policy dialogue with outcomes and
results when well managed. However, in the case of the Grant, variable tranche releases
were used to promote results achieved, and putting agencies in competition to increase
performance and apply, in this case, national policies to improve access to health for the
22


﻿poorest populations. This was less successful under the Grant due to a weakened
governance structure. However, the framework and model introduced new behaviours
and challenged implementing agencies to look toward a more goal oriented approach,
rather than a short-term physical approach.
78.   Increased capacity building to ensure that decentralized services respond to
supply and demand. The Grant was provided through the DOH which funneled the funds
to the LGUs at the decentralized level. A clearer capacity and institutional assessment
would have highlighted the issues surrounding the absorptive and implementation
capacities of both the DOH and LGUs in implementing the Grant and the national
reforms. The Grant allocation could have better served the institutions involved in
building up their capacity through managerial, implementation, and monitoring and
evaluation training so that Grant proceeds could have had more of an impact.
79.   Strenjtheninj M&E focus: As mentioned above, the M&E framework requires a
full participatory approach so that indicators that are relevant to monitor results and
outcomes are owned by those who will use them. A lesson from this Grant is how to
design and build a robust M&E system in an environment of decentralization, autonomy,
and devolution of service delivery, where reporting is required for national programs
such as Universal Health Coverage, and more particularly when baseline was not
available at the start of the operation. The Grant did not fully explore the data feedback
loop which requires concerted consultations with health professionals, administrators,
financiers, and civil society, to engage in a dialogue on the baseline of health status, the
inputs required to positively increase health outcomes, and to monitor the compact of
reaching those outcomes. The Grant did not outline methods of collection and quality
control of data.
80.   The need for monitoring and sharing of information to make a useful contribution
to mainstreaminZ improvements of healthcare delivery. The Grant was especially weak
on reporting by governmental entities on implementation progress. Though reporting is
likely done internally through the health sector, sharing of that information and the
quality of that information with other agencies and partners has led to perceived
fragmentation of efforts and results. One aspect is the interpretation of indicators for
improved service delivery, when sights were focused on the physical aspects, and less on
quality of care. Quality improvement models look at how services are being done, gaps
in delivery of quality care, and remedial actions to improve service delivery. These need
not be purely physical, but more organizational, bottoms-up approach, participative, and
owned by those directly involved in the delivery of care. On the other hand, agencies
involved in oversight/implementation are responsible for close monitoring and
supervision of technical and qualitative aspects of a project/grant, in order to glean
lessons and prompt feedback to improve delivery of services and exchanges to improve
the technical quality of supervision.
81.   Strenthenin central-local relations, particularly in promoting the introduction
of national programs: Any reform requires clear roles, rules and procedures so that all
levels of government agencies can work together within a clearly defined framework,
23


﻿regardless of internal changes. Lack of clarity and accountability weakened the potential
of the Grant outcomes. Strong organization, management, and absorptive capacity will
allow for better mainstreaming of activities as part of day-to-day business, particularly in
the context of major reforms. One innovation was LGU scorecards which provided the
opportunity for healthy competition in service delivery; but without clear and transparent
rules of business, this can be derailed, particularly if the incentives are not the right ones.
82.   In the process of devolution for a country like the Philippines, third party
verification should also comprise performance and management audits to better inform
and resolve issues of implementation. The third party verification was a financial audit.
This could have been supplemented with a performance and management audit to
determine where the bottlenecks were, issues to be resolved, and improvements made to
implementation. The number of governing bodies, and the autonomous set-up of LGUs,
did not lend to full cooperation and collaboration. A performance and management audit
could have brought together the parties toward a more proactive solution to
implementation.
7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies
83.   Comments were not received from the DOH as of the date of this report.
(b) Cofinanciers/Donors
84.   The mission met with EU representatives on October 18, 2012. The following are
comments made.
a) Validity of the data received is in question given differing numbers from various
sources. The trend is consistently poor on quality of data. An example is the
Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), though there has been little progress in the last
decade. Provincial data does not collect for MMR. A proxy indicator would be
births by skilled attendant. However, this may be underreported.
b) Government would need to do a yearly verification for quality of data.
c) Surveys do not always disaggregate by province (only by regions).
d) Improved scorecard for certain provinces. The efforts made had some positive
effects.
e) Political commitment matters in order to ensure good capacity building for the
LGUs. LGU performance varies greatly.
f) Little effort in a feedback loop to ensure that performance is discussed and
improved.
g) Province-wide Investment Plans for Health were bottom-up. Needs assessments
could have been strengthened at the municipal level to ensure that the Province-
wide Investment Plans responded to actual needs. Politics intrude in the good
functioning of this approach.
h) The PIPH process could have been improved with greater attention and focus on
the priorities, with full participation from all stakeholders.
24


﻿i) Provinces that had access to the EC technical assistance fared better than those
that did not due to proximity of expertise.
j) The EC technical assistance had a positive effect in being the communication
links between the LGUs and the DOH.
k) An absorption capacity at the level of DOH was noted. DOH has engaged into
too many initiatives, without regard to the number of staff needed to carry out
those tasks. There has been a severe reduction of DOH staff in the last year.
1) DOH managers are far too preoccupied with other activities to be able to focus on
the core functions required by the DOH.
m) Despite the reorganization, the internal environment is not conducive for effective
working relationships or results, nor with donor coordination, but priorities lie
elsewhere, which leads to ineffective use of funds or outcomes.
n) Donors need to engage in a broader spectrum of activities rather than focus on
each individual agenda, so as to be able to promote a more coordinated and
coherent approach. However, the DOH needs to be in the driver's seat for this to
effectively happen.
o) Infrastructure is poor which is why the Grant financed rehabilitation, but there is
in parallel little maintenance of the infrastructure, differing designs, lack of
standards, and lack of resources to maintain the infrastructure overall.
p) The health mapping exercise was not used by all provinces, with little follow-up
to ensure consistency of use and application.
q) Despite good relations with the World Bank, there was little information
exchange (only two reports were received: 2009/20 10 and in 2011). Financial
reports were received but with little substance. Province audits were not received.
There was also lack of technical support to the DOH to facilitate implementation
of program activities.
r) Operational meetings were held between the World Bank the EC, and the DOH
from the start of the project. The technical coordination meeting minutes were
shared. There was an open dialogue. However, all of this could have been
facilitated through better reporting.
s) A recommendation was to share aide-memoire with partner agencies.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Progress reports on the Recipient side have thus far been unavailable to complete this
section with detail
What this section can speak to is that Part A banked on the strength of Fl as a more
comprehensive approach to health reforms which were aligned with public expenditure
management and governance reform. Using the medium-term Health Sector Expenditure
Framework (HSEF), and the annual budgeting process, a performance monitoring
framework for DOH, PhilHealth and convergence provinces linked budgeting and
resource allocation to outputs and intermediate results. These links were intended to
reduce obstacles to reform. With regard to fragmentation in financing, Sector
Development Approach for Health (SDAH) was adopted under Fl to align development
partners-supported reform activities across the entire health sector under a single national
implementation plan and under harmonized local health investment plans in each
convergence provision.
Investment plans took three years to develop (started 2006). Once these were completed,
the SLAs were established in 2008. However, the LGU investment plans were by then
outdated but the "approved" activities not amended, and these activities were funded
(except for facility upgrades and equipment which underwent a re-review). The DOH
conducted an analysis on the problems and issued guidelines on how best to prepare
PIPH for the future.
Procurement Plans (PP) were established for each region. As there are no progress
reports from the Recipient side, one can review each provincial PP for what was intended
to be purchased and approved under the Grant. Without going into great detail for each
of the provincial PP as these are exhaustive and were prepared and approved on a yearly
basis, key items under the PPs were for information technology equipment, medical
equipment, dental equipment, obstetric medical equipment, civil works, maintenance
equipment, office equipment, general goods, community-based grants (workshops for
skilled and birth attendants, course on community-IMCI, courses on child care and
nutrition, workshop on adolescent reproductive health...), laboratory equipment, medical
supplies, etc.
The government took the not-yet-implemented pilot and scaled it up to 23 provinces in
2008 and then to 81 provinces in 2009. The JAC was overloaded. In 2007, the EC
requested the Bank to include additional provinces (ARMM). This led to a burden for the
DOH to manage the Grant.
DOH was provided with funding under Part B to implement public financial management
(PFM), and capacity building in fiduciary areas. DOH was responsible for tracking the
performance of LGUs through mechanisms established under the reform (investment
plans, annual operation plans, training plans, project procurement and management plans,
and Service Level Agreements). However, this took a substantial amount of time to
develop, establish, approve, and institutionalize, which led to serious delays in
27


﻿implementation. Capacity for DOH on financial and procurement management was not
substantially improved as bottlenecks remained unresolved and also due to problems with
issuance of obligation authorities and bureaucratic processes to utilize funds. Decision
making was slow which further negatively impacted efficient implementation of the grant
proceeds. Nevertheless, there was progress made in the development of Expenditure
Tracking System (ETS) though this is still in a development stage. The Office of the
Internal Audit (reporting directly to the Office of the Secretary) was established and staff
was trained. The Electronic National Government Accounting System is being rolled out
by the DOH to the regions by providing hardware/software and technical assistance. The
A reorganization process was supposed to take place in DOH but was never realized.
Other donors are also involved in the sector and are providing institutional support in the
areas of policy research, policy formulation, M&E, health communication, health
promotion, MIS, planning and governance, and management system tools.

Comments: Target not met (just under 5%). Private sector reporting not included in the FHSIS
report which is the source of data. The National TB Program provided data that captures the
private sector. Even though private sector data is included in the data, DOH did not reach
the 80% target case detection rate and 85% cure rate. The treatment success rate is being
used as a parameter to monitor the TB cases that completed the prescribed six month
treatment.
