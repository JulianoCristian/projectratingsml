                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Trust Fund is to increase utilization of affordable and financially sustainable, good quality essential health services by the poor in
                         participating localities through the progressive implementation of the Philippine Government's Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA). The project consists of
                         two components: (i) provide local health system reform grants to six (6) selected Convergence Provinces (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Southern Leyte, Romblon,
                         Misamis Occidental and Nueva Viscaya) to support activities set forth in their province-wide investment plans for the health sector. (ii) strengthen DOH#s
                         capacity in the area of public financial management, internal audit, information management, procurement and performance mornitoring under local government
                         scorecards, through provision of training, technical assistance, and required computer hardware and software.

                         (Note: this was original PDO in first IBTF, and is not yet amended to reflect Mindanao Provinces pending new Grant Agreement)
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
