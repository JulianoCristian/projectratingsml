both\n            projects is satisfactory. However, several sub-components of\n            the locomotive and rolling stock system of the Fifth Railway\n            Project were technically not met. Furthermore, the Strategic\n            Plan Study under the Fourth Railway Project, intended to\n            promote a broad-based dialogue between the Bank and the\n            Ministry of Railways (MOR), was narrowly defined. The\n            lessons learned suggest that, since previous lending\n            policies appear to impact fundamentally on both the Bank and\n            MOR's approach, particularly that of the Fifth Railway\n            Project, regarded as a transitional operation, special\n            attention should be given to future operations, upon\n            evaluation, and whether meaningful cooperation with MOR was\n            achieved. Similarly, the challenge posed to MOR, of\n            extensive studies in order to visualize future investment\n            requirements, was ambitious. Therefore, evaluations should\n            consider whether they really enhanced MOR's\n            contribution to the transport sector. Complex operations,\n            requiring highly professional skills, may cause unexpected\n            expenses, or further contribute to inadequate\n            implementation. The suggestion is, to specifically target\n            the assistance to transport objectives, and attain\n            efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, MOR's\n            reluctance to an involvement in broader strategic planning,\n            namely technical assistance, should be brought to terms, for\n            full support and commitment."}, "docdt": "1999-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
