It will also further develop the Ministry of\n            Railway's (MR's) technical and managerial\n            capabilities and contribute to the overall economic growth\n            of the country.  The project consists of four components:\n            (a) double-tracking and partial electrification of the 492\n            km single-track line between Yueshan in Henan province and\n            Xiangan in Hubei province; (b) expanding capacity and\n            improving quality of manufacture in three locomotive and\n            rolling stock factories, one near Beijing, and the others in\n            Sifang and Qiqihar; and (c) a study to develop a strategic\n            plan in the areas of telecommunications and computerization,\n            to be pilot-tested on the Beijing-Shanghai railway corridor.\n            Finally, the project entails (d) training and technical\n            assistance related to the Factory Modernization component\n            and to the Strategic Plan Study."}, "docdt": "1988-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
