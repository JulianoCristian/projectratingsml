F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overarching objective of the Reform Program in the Financial Sector is to support the
renewed efforts of His Majesty's Government of Nepal to improve the sector in order to
                                                  ii
bring macroeconomic stability and promote private-sector-led economic growth. The
project will focus on:
  (a) helping to restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank - NRB),
so that it can effectively perform its key central banking functions;
  (b) commencing commercial banking reform in the two large ailing commercial banks
that dominate the sector (Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL))
-- by introducing stronger bank management that protects the financial integrity of the
two banks and would take on a conservator role to prepare the banks for the next steps of
restructuring; and
  (c) supporting a better environment for financial sector reform in areas such as
enhanced credit information, better financial news reporting, and better training for staff
in financial institutions.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO as approved on April 1, 2011, was to assist the borrower in:
(i) developing the capacity of NRB staff to effectively perform key central banking
functions; (ii) implementing restructuring program of RBB and carrying out diagnostic
review of NBL to prepare these state owned commercial banks for the next steps of
restructuring; and (iii) creating an enabling environment for financial sector development,
specifically in the area of credit information bureau, secured transaction registry and
financial news reporting.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.1.1 When the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTAP) was being
designed, Nepal had a population of 24 million, and, with a Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita of US$220, it was one of the poorest countries in the world. The
transition to multi-party democracy, which began in 1991, had resulted in a high degree
of political instability, with numerous changes in government between 1991 and 2001.
Its social indicators also deteriorated during the decade long conflict in the country,
which came to an end in 2006.

1.1.2 Until the mid-1980’s, all financial sector activity was dominated by two state-
owned commercial banks; Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL).
Following financial sector liberalization in the 1980s, the sector became more diversified,
and by 2002, it had grown to include five commercial banks, eight development banks,
five regional rural development banks, one postal savings bank, forty eight finance
companies, thirty non-government microfinance institutions, and thirty-five non-
government cooperative societies involved in limited banking activities. In the absence of
a strong regulatory framework and sound technical capacities of the regulators, this
diversity proved problematic. By 2002, the financial sector was grappling with serious
governance issues, rising non-performing loans (NPLs), political interference in banking
activities, and weak institutional management. The overall legal and regulatory
framework for the sector was outdated, and had serious shortcomings in the areas of
collateral, credit activity and bankruptcy laws. These factors were contributing to a build-
up of systemic risks and potential fiscal costs that called for immediate redressal
measures.

1.1.3 The two largest state owned commercial banks, RBB and NBL accounted for 50
percent of banking sector assets and were in a precarious financial position. The RBB,
which represented 27 percent of commercial banking sector assets, had 71 percent NPLs.
Both banks were characterized by overstaffing, strong and politicized staff unions, poor
financial information systems, and a tradition of non-repayment of loans. A
KPMG/Barents report completed in 2000 estimated the cumulative losses in these two
institutions were between US$368 million and US$426 million. This was equivalent to
approximately 8 percent of Nepal’s GDP and 40-46 percent of the country’s budget. The
magnitude of these losses clearly demanded the attention of the Government of Nepal
(GON).

1.1.4 The KPMG/Barents report recommended a number of steps to reform the
financial sector, which included a clear statement of GON’s commitment to financial
reforms, bringing in qualified management teams to run the two large state-owned banks,



                                             1
and ultimately recapitalizing and privatizing RBB and NBL after turning them into
saleable entities.

1.1.5 In response to the prevailing distress in the banking sector, GON embarked on
institutional reforms and released a Financial Sector Strategy Statement (FSSS) in 2000.
FSSS made a case for a strengthened financial sector supervisory and regulatory regime
to ensure financial discipline, improved legislation, and strong corporate governance. It
envisioned a modern Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and advocated for a new NRB Act that
could provide sufficient autonomy in NRB’s conduct of monetary policy, banking system
regulation and supervision, and the licensing of banks and non banking financial
institutions. It also aimed at restructuring NRB and RBB, and ultimately recapitalizing
them and diluting GON’s ownership in the banks.

1.1.6 Until January, 2002, when the new NRB Act 2002 was passed into law, the
Central Bank fell under the direct authority of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). This lack
of autonomy hindered NRB’s ability to properly regulate and supervise the state-
dominated banking system. In addition, NRB had been only partially successful in
developing its core central banking functions, and required a complete re-engineering.
The areas that required strengthening included human resource management, banking
supervision and regulation, accounting and auditing, research and monetary policy
analysis, information technology and internal audit.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

1.1.7 FSSS and the measures adopted by GON sent a clear message to stakeholders that
GON would support financial sector reforms going forward. GON approached the Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UK’s Department for International
Development (DFID), seeking financial and technical assistance (TA) for implementing
its reform agenda.

1.1.8 The Bank completed an assessment of Nepal’s financial sector in 2002, which
made a strong case for providing support to the sector to stem the mounting losses of the
public sector banks, to strengthen the Central Bank and its supervisory function, and to
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework of the financial system. Its findings
endorsed the need for a financial sector TA operation to support GON’s reforms. These
findings, coupled with the GON’s commitment to financial sector reforms (outlined in
the 2000 FSSS and demonstrated by GON’s initial reform measures), provided the
rationale for Bank assistance to the sector.

1.1.9 At the same time, the Bank recognized the risks inherent in the proposed financial
sector reform program, given political uncertainty and limited implementation capacity.
A history of weak coalitions and frequent changes in government increased the risk of
policy reversals that could jeopardize project outcomes. As a result, a decision was made
to undertake support for the reform program in three phases. FSTAP was conceived
under Phase I. This TA was to focus on the re-engineering of NRB; restructuring of RBB
and NBL; and improving the enabling environment for financial sector development.

                                           2
The projects under Phase II and III were to complement the activities under the FSTAP,
with the objective of recapitalizing and privatizing NBL and RBB.

1.1.10 FSTAP was in line with the Bank’s 1998 Nepal Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) that emphasized structural reforms in four key areas; (i) restructuring/privatization
of RBB and NBL; (ii) the development of NRB’s regulatory and supervisory capacity;
(iii) development of a uniform legal framework for Nepal’s financial system; and (iv)
establishment of additional private financial institutions supported by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC).

1.1.11 Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) – 2003: Soon after the effectiveness
of the FSTAP, a US$70 million PRSC was approved by the Bank. The prior actions for
the financial sector under PRSC, which mirrored the objectives of FSTAP, were as
follows:

(i)     Dissolve boards of RBB and NBL, introduce new professional management teams
        at RBB and NBL – (PRSC I prior action)
(ii)    Implement scheme to rationalize excess staff at NRB, NBL and RBB – (PRSC II
        Indicative action expected by September 2004).

The first prior action was implemented when GON appointed the management team at
NBL and a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at RBB in 2002. The second action was
supported through FSTAP and the Phase II Reform Project, the Financial Sector
Restructuring Project (FSRP)1 which became effective in 2004.

Co-financing Arrangements with DFID and GON

1.1.12 DFID also endorsed GON’s financial sector reform agenda and agreed to provide
financial and technical support to FSTAP. It committed a US$10 million grant to
supplement the International Development Association (IDA) credit. A Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) was signed in 2003 between the Bank and DFID, and it was
decided that the funds would be disbursed in the proportion of 62 percent IDA and 38
percent DFID 2 . The grant was to be administered according to IDA’s financial
management (FM), disbursement and procurement guidelines. GON was to contribute the
balance of US$4.1 million to this project.



1
  The US$7.0 million FSRP was the second operation under the Bank’s financial sector reform program for
GON. The main objective of FSRP was to improve corporate governance by providing management
support to NBL and RBB in order to move them into the private sector, and to sustain the banking reforms.
The project also financed Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) schemes at the two banks. The
undisbursed funds equivalent to SDR13.7 million, under FSRP, were cancelled at the request of GON in
two steps in May 2008 and March 2009, and the project closed on September 30, 2009.

  This was subsequently changed. Subsequent governments expressed a reluctance to borrow for TA, and
consequently much of the TA work was funded under the DFID grant.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The overarching objective of FSTAP is to support efforts of GON to improve the
sector in order to bring macroeconomic stability and to promote private sector led
economic growth. Specifically, the project will focus on: (a) helping to restructure and re-
engineer the Central Bank (NRB), so that it can effectively perform its key central
banking functions; (b) commencing the restructuring of RBB and NBL by introducing
stronger bank management that protects the financial integrity of the two banks and
would take on a conservator role to prepare the banks for the next steps of restructuring;
and (c) supporting a better environment for financial sector reform in areas such as credit
information and secured transactions, better financial news reporting, and better training
for staff in financial institutions.

Key Indicators

1.2.3 The PDO level key indicators were: (i) timely and effective intervention by NRB
to enforce prudential regulations and relevant banking legislation; (ii) a record of timely,
effective, and independent implementation of central banking policies; (iii) increased
share of financial system owned and operated by private sector players; and (iv) increase
in the range and sophistication of financial instruments and services available at
competitive prices.

This ICR assesses the performance of the project against the original PDO and revised
PDO and outcome indicators. All of these have been tabulated and evaluated in the
Results Framework Analysis, Section F, of this ICR’s datasheet.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO was revised in April 2011 as a result of a Level-1 restructuring that also
included cancellation of funds equivalent to SDR615,000 (IDA) and GBP1.964 million
(DFID Grant). The detailed background of this restructuring is given in section 1.7 of this
document.

1.3.2 The revised PDO was to strengthen the financial sector, notably the NRB and the
state controlled banks, and to create an enabling environment for financial sector
development. The project was to assist GON in (i) developing the capacity of the NRB
staff to effectively perform key central banking functions; (ii) implementing the planned
restructuring program of RBB and carrying out a diagnostic review of NBL to prepare
NBL and RBB for the next steps of their restructuring; and (iii) creating an enabling
environment for financial sector development, specifically in the areas of the Credit
Information Bureau (CIB), Secured Transactions Registry (STR) and financial news
reporting. The intermediate results indicators were also revised accordingly.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

1.4.1 The main beneficiaries or the primary target group of this project were NRB,
RBB and NBL. The actions implemented under the project were expected to foster a
sound commercial banking system, with oversight provided by a modern, effective, and
technically competent central bank. The FSTAP also aimed at creating a financially
sound, prudent, and effectively regulated financial sector, that could contribute to
macroeconomic stability and growth. This could not be achieved without strengthening
the Central Bank and the country’s two largest banks, RBB and NBL.

NRB: Although NRB had been able to develop some core central banking functions, it
was handicapped by a lack of autonomy, an inadequate and outdated legal framework,
and a large number of poorly trained and unproductive staff.

NBL and RBB: Established in 1938, NBL is the oldest bank in Nepal. GON is the
largest shareholder, with 41 percent ownership. The remaining shares are held 49 percent
by private businessmen and 10 percent by the public 3 . RBB, established as a 100%
government-owned bank in 1966, is Nepal’s largest commercial bank. At project
inception, both banks were overstaffed, suffered serious shortfalls in governance,
management and operations, and had negative net worth.

1.4.2 A key benefit of the project was to be the emergence of a more dynamic and
competitive banking system that would support private-sector led growth for the benefit
of Nepali enterprises and the general public.

1.5.2 Component 1: Re-engineering NRB (US$4.68 million): The specific activities
envisaged under this component included hiring of a Human Resource (HR) professional

  GON had owned 51 percent of the NBL, but sold 10 percent to the public in 1998 through a listing on the
stock exchange. At the time of listing, NBL had a negative net-worth of US$85-140 million which is in
violation of the listing rules of the exchange. New management hired under FSTAP requested the de-listing
of the NBL in 2003.


                                                   5
who would revise the HR policies, identifying staff for retrenchment, designing the VRS,
and computerizing the HR function. Additionally, this component aimed at strengthening
NRB’s supervisory capacities by training its staff and by hiring experienced bank
supervisors to assist with the implementation of NRB’s plan for regulatory development.
This component also envisaged improving the quality and efficiency of NRB’s
Accounting and Auditing Department, strengthening the Research Department, and
providing IT support. Some funding was also allocated to strengthening the Legal and
Internal Audit Departments, and providing training to NRB staff involved in these
functions. Finally, the FSTAP envisaged providing support to NRB to engage legal
experts to review the legislative and regulatory framework, and finalize the Central Bank
Act and the Banking and Financial Institution Act (BFIA).

1.5.3 Component 2: Restructuring RBB and NBL (US$24.43 million): The
restructuring of these two institutions was to be accomplished under the supervision of
professional management teams who were to take complete control of the day to day
operations of these banks, immediately stabilize their financial and operational positions,
and strengthen their accounting, Management Information System (MIS) and HR
functions. The ultimate objective of these efforts was to stem the losses being incurred by
these banks and prepare NBL and RBB for recapitalization and ultimately privatization or
liquidation.

1.5.4 Component 3: Capacity Building in the Financial Sector (US$0.99 million):
The activities under this component were to support reforms introduced through the first
two components and improve the environment for financial intermediation. Specific
activities included; (a) support for the Bankers’ Training Center; (b) strengthening the
processes of the CIB; (c) developing the capacities of the financial journalists to improve
the quality of reports on financial sector issues; and (d) financing the cost of the
Coordination Support team (CST) while strengthening its project management
capabilities.

1.5.5 Implementation Arrangements: GON agreed with the Bank that the financial
sector program would be overseen by three Government bodies, namely the MoF, NRB
and the National Planning Commission (NPC). For implementation of activities at the
project level, a dedicated unit called CST was formed within the Banking Operations
Department (BOD) of NRB. The CST was supported by a team comprising the Executive
Director of BOD, a Financial Management Specialist (FMS), a Procurement Specialist
and requisite ancillary staff. FSTAP funded the operating costs of CST on a declining
cost basis over the period of project’s implementation. It was also agreed to centralize the
procurement function within the CST and equip it with the desired resources to ensure an
effective implementation of the project’s procurement plan.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 At the request of GON in June 2008, the FSTAP was assigned certain additional
activities that had not been implemented under the Phase II project, FSRP, prior to
closure. As the PDOs of FSRP remained largely unachieved, it was decided to close that
project in August 2008, ahead of its closing date of September 2009. Due to some
                                             6
pending payments of already incurred expenditures under the project, the FSRP’s closing
eventually occurred in September 2009.

1.6.2 The activities that were transferred to FSTAP included; (i) strengthening NRB’s
supervision capacity by hiring a Supervision Expert with focus on risk based supervision;
(ii) hiring of a Bank Restructuring Advisor for the end game resolution of NBL and RBB;
(iii) strengthening the capacity of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT); and
(iv) establishing STR. While the PDO remained unchanged, new outcome indicators
were added for the new components which were; (i) final resolution of NBL and RBB
through either sale or closure; (ii) number of court cases resolved in a period and average
number of days taken for resolution of a case by DRT; and (iii) full functioning of STR.

1.6.3 Later, at the request of GON, the original components of the project were
downsized during the April 2011 restructuring, based on what was possible to achieve
within the revised Project Closing Date (PCD) of December 31, 2011. The following
activities were dropped under each component:

Component 1: Re-engineering of NRB:
  (i)   Recruitment of Supervision Expert: It was agreed that the IMF would take on
        the recruitment of two Resident Advisors for one year to strengthen the Bank
        Supervision and Financial Institutions Supervision departments.
  (ii)  HR Expert: After an initial consultant completed his assignment, NRB
        indicated that it wanted to utilize in-house expertise rather than external
        consultants.
  (iii) Procurement Expert: NRB did not see the need for this expert as no new
        procurement was planned.
  (iv)  Public Relations Officer: This was also dropped as NRB wanted to use its
        own resources.

Component 2: Management Contracts for Restructuring NBL and RBB:
  (i)   CEO of NBL: NBL decided not to recruit a new CEO using project funds
  (ii)  Bank Restructuring (sales) Advisor: NRB decided against hiring an Advisor,
        as GON was still divided over the ultimate disposition of GON’s shares in
        NBL and RBB.

Component 3: Other Financial Sector Assistance:
  (i)   DRT: NRB did not receive any new requests from DRT for the procurement
        of goods and training, hence this was dropped.

At the same time, the following activity was added at the request of GON:

   (i)     Diagnostic Assessment of NBL: NRB wanted to conduct a fast track
           diagnostic assessment of NBL’s situation to help GON decide on next
           restructuring steps for the Bank.




                                            7
As noted above, three out of the four activities allocated to FSTAP from the FSRP were
dropped during the April 2011 restructuring, as no progress had been made between 2008
and 2011 due to procurement issues and NRB’s reluctance to pursue certain institutional
reforms.



1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 FSTAP was restructured four times in a span of four years (2007-2011), including
a level-one restructuring, three cancellations of funds, and two extensions in the PCD.

1.7.2 Significant progress had been made under the project during the period 2003-
2006, especially on the restructuring of RBB and NBL. By mid-2007 however, FSTAP
started to suffer from the adverse impacts of successive changes in GON and the post-
conflict transition, which resulted in an extremely difficult political environment for
reforms in the banking sector. Although the restructuring of NBL and RBB was broadly
on track, there was increasing political resistance to privatization.

June 2007 Restructuring:

1.7.3 The first extension in PCD was requested by GON in March 2007 as NRB wanted
to hire three local experts for NBL in addition to extending the contract of the
management team at NBL which was due to expire in July 2007.

1.7.4 In order to sustain progress made on restructuring NBL and RBB, the Bank
extended the PCD to December 31, 2008 with an agreement that the NRB would make
progress on the pending recruitment of sales advisors and bank supervisors. The approval
for this extension was granted by the Country Management of the Bank in June 2007.
Consequently, the budget was also reallocated, as DFID agreed to fund the second
extension of the management contracts for another eighteen months.

August 2008 Restructuring:

1.7.5 Following the 2007 restructuring, a major setback occurred when a case for
fraudulent procurement was filed against the Governor and Executive Director (ED) of
NRB by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The case,
which involved procurement under the Bank funded FSRP, took two years to be resolved
in favor of the Governor and ED, brought reform and procurement activities within NRB
to a virtual standstill.

1.7.6 At about the same time, there was a major change in the political landscape as
Maoists had agreed to a cease fire and to participate in the Constituent Assembly
elections planned for April 2008. Due to these political developments, the final
resolution of the two banks had to be postponed in order to seek political consensus.
However, it was felt that it was important to continue with restructuring efforts until a
decision on the final resolution was reached. Stepping away from these institutions could
                                           8
have resulted in a reversal of the significant gains that had been achieved over the
previous five years.

1.7.7 GON requested closing FSRP and reallocating some of its activities to FSTAP. At
that time, the disbursements of FSTAP lagged Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
projections by approximately 35 percent largely due to significant savings on the
management contracts of NBL and RBB. The Bank therefore restructured the project
again in August 2008 to reallocate US$10.11 million (IDA: US$3.77 million and DFID
Grant: US$6.34 million) from FSTAP towards three activities of the FSRP. The Bank
also cancelled funds equivalent to SDR4 million from FSTAP. The Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) was amended accordingly, and the PCD was extended a second time,
to December 31, 2011.

April 2011 Level-1 Restructuring:

1.7.8 Even with this restructuring in August 2008, the project could not make
satisfactory progress on implementation and disbursements. Procurement and procedural
delays intensified, especially as NRB was reluctant to initiate sensitive reforms in the two
banks. During its supervision missions, the Bank recorded these developments in the
project Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and flagged the issues while
downgrading the project ratings during the period Jun 2010 – Jan 2012.

1.7.9 DFID’s Cancellation of Funds: When the Bank downgraded the project
‘Implementation Progress’ and ‘achievement of development objectives’ from
Moderately Satisfactory (MS) to a Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) in July 2010, DFID
made a decision to close its grant in March 2011 before the revised PCD. With that,
US$3.16 million (GBP2.17 million) was cancelled by DFID from the total committed
funds of US$10 (GBP6.86 million). At the time of cancellation, a total of US$7.49
million (GBP4.51 million) had been disbursed by the project from the DFID Grant.

1.7.10 The Bank team, however, believed it would still be possible to complete some of
the uncontroversial reforms, notably the automation of the Credit Information Center
Limited (CICL) and STR. In light of this, a Restructuring Paper was submitted to the
Bank Board in January 2011 at the request of GON. It was approved in April 2011, just 8
months before the revised PCD. This restructuring resulted in the cancellation of a
number of politically sensitive activities (listed in section 1.6.3 of this ICR), a revision
in the PDO, and amendments to the results and monitoring framework, project costs,
financing plan and procurement plan.

December 2011 Restructuring:

1.7.11 As the PCD approached, it became clear the NBL diagnostic and automation of
CICL and STR could not be completed by December 31, 2011. Project funds equivalent
to SDR1.198 million were therefore cancelled in December 2011 and returned to IDA for
allocation to other Bank projects in Nepal.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The Bank team designed this project after undertaking one identification and three
appraisal missions between the 2000 and 2002, during which discussions were held with
the stakeholder group comprising NRB, RBB, NBL, MoF, DFID, Asian Development
Bank (ADB), and IMF. The project design benefitted from the 1998 CAS for Nepal and
the Bank’s 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Report on Nepal. Between the Project
Concept Note approval in 1999 and project effectiveness in 2003, a
Project Preparation Facility (PPF)4 of US$1.15 million was made available to NRB in
two stages. The first PPF of US$550,000 supported the consultancy services in the area
of banking supervision and training activities. The second PPF advance of US$ 600,000
financed the NBL Management Team and consultancies at RBB. The PPF was refinanced
as part of the total credit amount of FSTAP. Therefore, implementation of key activities
under FSTAP had begun prior to project approval.

2.1.2 The PAD correctly identified the risk of policy reversal under the project (rated as
High Risk). However, it did not specifically factor in the conflict between the objectives
of FSTAP and those of the staff unions in NBL and RBB, which predictably opposed
many of the reforms envisaged. It also failed to identify risks associated with the lack of
capacity of the judicial system to deal with enforcement of financial contracts and
insolvency, though it did note that taking defaulted borrowers to court would be
controversial.

2.1.3 The PAD indicated that there had been (unspecified) problems with procurement
in the past, and noted that NRB had no experience with conducting procurement in
accordance with World Bank rules. The team proposed the recruitment and training of an
experienced procurement expert for the CST, which was done. The severe procurement
issues which arose as a result of the CIAA case were not foreseeable.

2.1.4 Project alternatives considered included both a broader and narrower project focus.
The project team, DFID and IMF all concurred that focusing on the two large commercial
banks and the Central Bank represented the minimum required to address critical
problems in the sector, while a broader program was ill-advised given capacity
constraints.

2.1.5 The team appropriately drew on lessons learned from an earlier Structural
Adjustment Credit that had focused on the financial sector by requiring that commitment
and action be taken up-front by GON—starting with the placing of external management
teams in the two banks. This was done while FSTAP was being prepared. Other lessons
learned and which were reflected in project design included, inter-alia, (i) the need to

necessary to achieve readiness for project effectiveness and implementation.


                                                 10
enhance the autonomy and skills of the regulator to sustain banking sector reforms; (ii)
the necessity for requisite legal reforms; (iii) the importance of sequencing reforms and
focusing on a limited number of activities; (iv) that commercial banks should not be
recapitalized without fundamental changes in ownership and governance; and, (v) strong
borrower commitment to the reforms is needed, as reforms forced from the outside are
not always sustainable.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Implementation of FSTAP began quite smoothly and enjoyed strong support from
MoF and NRB during the first four years of its implementation, particularly for
Component 2. When the new management teams were appointed at NBL and RBB in
2003, both banks had accumulated huge losses and were insolvent, and neither had
proper MIS, financial reporting, internal controls or credit procedures. By 2006, both
banks were profitable, NPLs had declined quite significantly, MIS systems, internal
controls and credit procedures were in place, and the banks were producing regular and
timely financial statements.

2.2.2 Mid-term review (MTR): The Bank undertook two supervision missions
(September 18-29, 2006 and November 6-8, 2006) to conduct the MTR, close to the
original closing date of June 30, 2007. This delay in the MTR was due to discussions
between GON and Bank to decide the fate of FSRP. Both projects were running in
parallel, and the Bank was considering transferring some FSRP components to FSTAP,
which was eventually done. Eventually the MTR was completed in November 2006. It
observed that the restructuring of NBL and RBB had progressed well, and an increasing
share of the financial system was owned and operated by the private sector, in line with
project objectives. The share of banking sector assets owned by NBL and RBB had
declined from 51 percent in 2002 to 32 percent in FY 2006. The management teams in
the two banks were performing well and their contracts were due to expire in 2007. At
that time, GON was committed to maintaining external management teams at NBL and
RBB until the point of sale to strategic investors.

2.2.3 The MTR also observed that there was considerable work required to strengthen
the capacity of the Banking Supervision Department within NRB, and additional support
to accomplish this was being provided through FSRP. It recommended that in order for
DRT to function smoothly, additional resources should be extended under the project for
office equipment and staff training.

2.2.4 Despite progress made on all components under FSTAP, at the time of the MTR,
disbursements lagged projections by 35 percent. This was mainly due to the savings in
restructuring of NBL/RBB (US$7.2 million) and under-spending of the training
component for NRB (US$1.7 million). Otherwise, procurement and disbursement of
equipment and consultancy services were largely on track. The MTR recommended that
the Project should be extended with the savings reallocated, and that the management
contracts for NBL and RBB should be extended to ensure continuity of reforms.



                                           11
2.2.5 Finally, it was recommended that the GON expedite its application for an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant which came through towards the end of 2006.
The Bank approved the IDF Grant of US$405,000 in April 2007 for Nepal’s Supreme
Court. The Grant was to complement the objectives of the ongoing FSTAP and FSRP.
Specifically, it aimed to build the capacity of the judiciary in or to enable it to provide
dispute resolution services in banking and commercial matters, to strengthen the
commercial bench, and to facilitate data collection and analysis.5

2.2.6 The success of the reforms undertaken in NBL and RBB encouraged NRB to
consider replacing international consultants with local management teams after 2007. The
higher than anticipated profitability of the banks perhaps also initiated a change in the
attitude of NRB and GON towards recapitalization of the two banks, as they began to
believe that recapitalization could be achieved over time through retained earnings.
However, after the departure of the international management team from NBL in July
2007, progress on the second component of FSTAP slowed. NRB was unable to identify
and recruit an appropriate local management team for NBL after the contract of the
international management team expired in July 2007. After a delay of 7-8 months,
NBL’s management was handed over to a team from within NRB.

2.2.7 In addition to the disruption caused by the departure of the management teams,
progress on all components stalled following the CIAA corruption case and forced
resignations of the Governor and ED of NRB in July 2007. Despite subsequent attempts
by the Bank to expedite implementation, NRB officials were understandably reluctant to
take decisions on procurement, fearing a reaction from CIAA. The individuals were
subsequently cleared of all charges and re-instated, but virtually all procurement under
the project ground to a halt after mid 2007. Critical procurement, including the
appointment of a replacement management team at NBL, hiring of an IT consultant for
NRB, and procurement of IT systems for the automation of STR and CICL were not
completed despite two extensions to the PCD. The Bank’s 2008 implementation support
mission observed that 58 percent of the IDA Credit under FSTAP remained undisbursed,
mainly due to the lack of progress in procurement. Moreover, after mid-2007, the Bank
team noted a considerable deterioration in GON’s commitment towards the privatization
of RBB and NBL. Earlier GON had fully endorsed the need for resolving governance
issues within NBL and RBB through privatization in its Letter of Development Policy.




5
  The Grant closed in August 2010 and could not fully achieve its development objective due to narrow
focus on commercial courts and absence of performance benchmarks for commercial benches. Despite that
there were some accomplishments during the implementation of this IDF. For instance the Supreme Court
profited from the partially automated case management system, the legal library, the training, and the
exchange of experience with other courts in the region. The commercial benches received technology,
reading material on law, and benefitted from training and consultations on procedural designs and
management of judiciary.




                                                 12
2.2.8 The re-engineering of NRB was also falling short of expectations. project
activities and disbursements were severely affected by NRB’s inability to procure and
hire consultants. The recruitment of Bank Supervisors for NRB and Sales/Restructuring
Advisors for NBL and RBB was postponed several times. Between 2007 and 2010, the
Bank pursued the matter with GoN and NRB on numerous occasions but to no avail.
Ultimately, these components were dropped in the 2011 restructuring.

2.2.9 This project went through four restructurings between 2007 and 2011 including
two extensions in PCD and two restructurings in 2011. The last restructuring, in
December, 2011 led to a cancellation of SDR1.198 million which was reallocated to
other IDA operations in Nepal.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E under this project was regularly conducted through the Bank’s
implementation support missions, some of which were conducted jointly for FSTAP and
FSRP. The MTR was conducted in September 2006. The Bank team used the project
results indicators and results framework to measure performance of NRB during these
missions. Aide Memoires were shared with the GON, MoF and NRB management
towards the end of the each mission. Correspondence between Bank management and
MoF after 2007 sought to expedite implementation and obtain GON’s renewed
commitment towards privatization as the overall objective for NBL and RBB.

2.3.2 CST administered FSTAP and thus was in-charge of M&E implementation. The
absence of a strong MIS within CST prevented the smooth flow of information and
effective monitoring of project results. Consequently CST was unable to provide coherent
and organized data to the Bank team during implementation. Similarly, no periodic
supervision was conducted at the project level by NRB, MoF and NPC to monitor
progress towards the achievement of PDOs.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement:

2.4.1   The overall Procurement Rating is Unsatisfactory.

2.4.2 An assessment of NRB at appraisal identified that its staff had almost no
experience of public procurement, and no knowledge or experience in Bank procurement
procedures. In addition, the internal decision-making chain at NRB, which often required
Governor level approval, took time. Thus, many planned procurement activities were
delayed, including the initial procurement of management teams for NBL and RBB. The
team thus recommended that CST include an experienced individual Procurement Expert
who, in addition to assisting NRB with carrying out project related procurement, would
also provide on-the-job training to some key staff. Though the expert was placed in CST,


                                           13
this did not result in any major improvement in the timeliness of procurement, and his
services were discontinued in 2006.

2.4.3 The slow pace of procurement came to a standstill from 2007 when the CIAA
filed cases against the Governor and ED related to procurement of consultants under
FSRP. Even though both officials were ultimately exonerated, the fear of further CIAA
investigations persisted. This gravely affected several critical procurement activities such
as the appointment of a replacement management team at NBL, hiring of an IT consultant
for NRB, and procurement of IT systems for the automation of STR and CICL.

Financial Management (FM):

2.4.4   The FM rating for this Project is Moderately Satisfactory.

2.4.5 Project Financial Management: The dedicated project implementation unit (CST)
was responsible for the FM of the project and overall FM was rated MS. Although there
were some start-up delays, the project took the initiative to maintain a reliable FM
information system which resulted in timely generation of financial reports and audit
reports. Trimester Implementation Progress Reports which included Financial Monitoring
Reports were submitted relatively on time. Over the period of implementation, the
quality of financial reports improved. Audit reports were submitted on time. There were
no major issues with staffing as the staff deputed to the project was of high caliber.

2.4.6 Entity Financial Management: Over the life of the project, there was little
improvement in NRB’s FM capability and inadequate attention by NRB Board and
management to address the weaknesses in FM which were repeatedly highlighted in the
qualified entity annual audit reports of the NRB and through Bank supervision. Major
issues and weaknesses in the entity's FM included:

   Non-compliance with NRB Act 2002 - NRB's audit reports were never completed
    within four months of the end of the fiscal year;
   Non-compliance with International Accounting Standards;
   Establishing computerized FM systems within a reasonable time period;
   Establishing systems for assets management;
   Control weaknesses in banking transactions and accounting systems; and
   Weaknesses in internal control and internal audit.

2.4.7 Frequent changes of staffing in the Finance Division restricted any action being
taken and the limited measures to improve FM by some individuals did not have major
impact. There were provisions under FSRP to provide funding for FM improvements but
NRB declined to make use of this provision.

Safeguards:

2.4.8 This was an Environmental Category ‘C’, project hence none of the environment
and safeguards policies were triggered.

                                            14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The proposed third phase of Bank assistance to GON for financial sector reforms
was intended to support the financial re-engineering of banks (re-capitalization) at the
point of sale after satisfactory changes in governance arrangements and cost restructuring
had taken place. Given the lack of political will to privatize, the Bank did not pursue this,
and did not launch Phase III. However, the Bank is pursuing discussions with GON on a
Development Policy Credit (DPC) for FY13 to address the macroeconomic and financial
sector vulnerability in Nepal. The Bank and GON have reached an in-principle agreement
to a set of indicative prior actions for DPC1 and DPC2, which include a series of
measures intended to support a more robust and inclusive financial sector. These include
full recapitalization of RBB and NBL, a decision to transfer shares of NBL to a reputable
strategic investor, and diagnostic audits of a selection of financial institutions. At end
June 2012, the Cabinet announced a decision to inject equity into the two state controlled
banks. RBB received NPR4.32 billion and NBL received NPR1.37 billion. However,
even after these announced capital injections, both banks will still fall short of minimum
capital requirement as per Central Bank guidelines.

2.5.2 While the positions of NBL and RBB improved significantly over the life of this
project, the financial condition of other banks in Nepal has deteriorated due, inter-alia, to
large exposure to a collapsing real estate market. Strengthening of the legal and
regulatory framework for effective bank resolution is therefore a key prior action under
discussion with GON for the DPC.

2.5.3 According to DFID’s assessment of FSTAP completed in March 2011, any future
intervention in the financial sector of the country should factor in the highly fragile
governance environment in the country and GON’s involvement in the economy. DFID is
providing TA in conjunction with preparation of the proposed DPC. As DFID has the
flexibility to carry out own procurement under TA grants, a program which combines TA
support from DFID and budget support from the Bank, it is unlikely to encounter the
procurement problems that plagued FSTAP.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 Both the original and revised PDOs of this project are still relevant to the financial
sector development of Nepal. Restructuring of NBL and RBB remain incomplete, and
both banks remain insolvent. NRB still requires strengthening to perform its core Central
Bank functions, and the financial sector as a whole is quite fragile. A few years after the
project commenced, the priorities of GON changed, and privatization lost its importance
in front of other reforms. For the same reason, the original PDO i.e. improving the
macroeconomic stability and achieving private sector led economic growth was revised
to a more realistic PDO in 2011. One can hope that the planned financial sector DPC
enables GON to effectively deal with the distressed financial sector institutions.

                                             15
3.1.2 On a positive note, FSTAP managed a commendable turnaround in the two banks,
and some important progress was made in each component. The project resulted, inter-
alia, in greater financial discipline in the banking sector, a strengthened legal and
regulatory framework, and greatly improved financial disclosure and credit information.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 This section primarily details the performance on the revised PDOs and
downsized components of FSTAP. The achievements against the original PDO indicators
and intermediate outcome indicators have been tabulated in section F (Results
Framework Analysis) of the ICR datasheet.

Restructuring the two big state controlled banks (NBL and RBB):

3.2.2 The targeted outcomes for the restructuring of NBL and RBB were achieved to a
great extent. The banks have been profitable and have been reporting positive cash flows
for seven years in a row. When the project initiated its activities, these banks were
incurring substantial losses. The number of staff within NBL and RBB was reduced from
5,652 and 5,522 to 2,342 and 2,555 respectively.

3.2.3 The banks have also made considerable progress in automation and financial
reporting. The computerization of RBB branches met targets with 95 percent of deposits
and 98 percent of loans automated and on-line. A total of 46 Automated Teller Machines
(ATMs) were installed at various locations including markets and other public places.
The quarterly financial statements and annual audited financial statements are published
in a timely manner. NBL’s 58 branches were automated and 77 percent of deposit base
and 88 percent of loans were covered by the IT platform.

3.2.4 Asset quality at the two banks has improved significantly. Since July 2003
NPLs have decreased from 58 percent for NBL and 60 percent for RBB to 5.29 percent
and 10.9 percent respectively as of mid-October 2011.

Reengineering NRB:

3.2.5 The objectives of this component were not achieved to a satisfactory level. The
supervisory capacity of NRB has improved somewhat as a result of TA provided;
however the agreed outcomes remained incomplete at PCD. The Central Bank did not
recruit the international supervision experts needed to strengthen NRBs supervisory
capacity. The project did achieve results on improving the regulatory framework as the
NRB Act was enacted for the first time and BFIA was amended. However, the
amendments to BFIA are still pending with the Parliament.

3.2.6 The PRO hired by NRB also proved very effective while he was in place as he
implemented NRB’s communication strategy with the objective of informing the public
on the restructuring efforts and their significance for the economy. Some progress was
also made in HR policy reform.
                                          16
Capacity Building in the Financial Sector:

3.2.7 The objectives under this component were partially achieved, with mixed results
on the various activities.

3.2.8 CICL and STR: The project funded a consultant to draft a business plan for
CICL’s establishment and operations. At the start of the project in 2003, Nepal’s CIB
was a very basic structure within NRB that had limited resources and manual data entry
systems. During the lifetime of FSTAP, it turned around completely as the private sector
took over CICL’s management with an independent board. CICL now generates the
requested credit reports within 24 hours, which has facilitated lending decisions by
commercial banks. STR was established in 2010, but is not yet operational due to the
failure to procure the requisite systems. Its management was outsourced to CICL by
MoF; however there has been no action on this decision.

3.2.9 DRT: The project enhanced the capacity of DRT through training programs
and exposure visits of DRT staff to similar institutions in other South Asian countries.
The Bank has received positive feedback on the performance of DRT from commercial
banks, who indicate that DRT has helped in debt recovery efforts.

3.2.10 In addition, FSTAP also contributed to the Banker’s Training Center by
supporting its automation, enhancing its capacities to train professionals, and developing
a strategic plan for the Center.

3.2.11 Training of Journalists: The project organized international training for 44
financial journalists, and financial reporting in the press appears to have improved as a
result. More factual and accurate financial reporting has ensured greater public awareness
of what is happening in the financial sector, and has contributed to greater credit
discipline. As a result of press reports, for example, a former Prime Minister was made to
repay a loan taken by friends (with his guarantee).


3.3 Efficiency

Due to the nature of project activities and the mix of results accomplished under FSTAP
(and FSRP), it has not been possible to calculate an accurate Net Present Value (NPV) or
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for this intervention. While many of the ultimate results
expected, including the recapitalization of NBL and RBB, have not yet been achieved,
there has been a number of significant cost savings realized. The two restructured public
banks have generated NPR30 billion (US$400 million) in operating profits since 2003,
when they were losing US$80 million per annum before restructuring efforts began under
FSTAP. While some of the savings and turnaround can also be attributed to the 2nd phase
FSRP (or indeed other factors), assuming the losses had continued at the same rate, the
fiscal savings to GON exceed US$1 billion (losses of US$640 million over 8 years versus
profits of US$400 million). Total expenditures for both projects were approximately only
US$78 million. While the net worth of the two banks remain negative, the deficit has

declined significantly, thereby substantially reducing the ultimate fiscal cost of
recapitalizing the banks.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.1 The original and revised PDOs of FSTAP are still relevant to Nepal’s financial
sector development. NRB should be strengthened to assume its core Central Bank and
regulatory functions. Similarly in order to sustain the progress made in reforming RBB
and NBL, there needs to be a resolution to the ownership and negative capital position of
the public banks, as originally envisaged in FSSS. The change in the political economy
for financial sector reform, coupled with the unfortunate prosecution of senior NRB
officials for mis-procurement, brought progress under the project to a virtual stand-still
from 2007 onwards. The following review of outcomes under the project components
substantiates the rating:

3.4.2 Restructuring of RBB and NBL: This is the centerpiece of the project, and
efforts to restructure and improve the performance of RBB and NBL showed very
significant results. The project achieved virtually all of the targets and outcomes during
the first five years of its implementation. Both banks were incurring losses until 2003 and
were subsequently turned around by the management teams, proper procedures and
financial reporting were put in place, and NPLs were brought down from 61 percent and
60 percent to 5.3 percent and 10.9 percent for NBL and RBB respectively by PCD. More
than 80 percent of the deposit base was computerized. The overall staff levels were
reduced by 48 percent and 44 percent in NBL and RBB respectively by July 2007, largely
due to the VRS funded through FSRP. The ultimate outcome of strengthening corporate
governance of the banks cannot be achieved until there is a final resolution of the
ownership and negative net worth of the two banks, but these were not objectives of
FSTAP. Recognizing the risk of a policy reversal, the program was designed in three
phases, and the first phase FSTAP had limited objectives of restructuring the banks and
preparing them for eventual recapitalization and privatization or liquidation. This was
largely achieved, though its sustainability cannot be assured until there is a more lasting
resolution of the ownership, governance and management of the banks.

3.4.3 Developing the capacity of NRB staff to effectively perform key central
banking functions: This outcome has not been achieved to a significant degree. Needed
financial legislation was prepared under the project but has not been enacted due to the
current political situation in Nepal (BFIA approval pending). The objective of
strengthening the supervision capacity of NRB was not achieved. A consulting firm was
recruited in 2006 for this assignment but left Nepal abruptly due to the security situation.
While NRB was trying to replace the team in 2007 the Governor was charged by CIAA.
Subsequent efforts to recruit banking supervision experts failed, though, as noted above,
the Bank and IMF both sought to provide support through alternative arrangements which
did not require NRB procurement i.e. through First Initiative and IMF TA. The current


                                              18
fragile state of Nepal’s banking system demonstrates that NRB’s regulatory and
supervisory capacity remains weak, however.

3.4.4 Creating an enabling environment for the financial sector development: The
key elements of this component were either not achieved or only partially achieved, due,
inter-alia, to NRB’s inability to procure the requisite goods and services. While some
progress was made on credit discipline through the establishment of DRT, and financial
reporting and credit information improved, outcomes have fallen short of expectations in
key respects. Nepal still does not have a modern and fully automated STR or CIB, both of
which are critical pieces of the country’s financial infrastructure. Similarly, the diagnostic
of NBL, which was to provide a road map for the resolution of the bank, had to be
dropped due to procurement issues.

3.4.5 Considering the above, the outcomes of FSTAP have been rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not Applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.1 The local staff of NBL and RBB was trained by the management teams and
international consultants. Most of these staff are still working in these institutions and are
making significant contributions. However, due to their inability to influence the policy
level decisions or overall governance, the institutional strengthening efforts of FSTAP
may not be sustainable.

3.5.2 It is encouraging to note that with very limited financial assistance, FSTAP
provided an impetus to the establishment of CICL as a successful private sector concern.
CICL is now planning to complete its automation and expand the scope of its services
with support from ADB and IFC. The commercial banks in Nepal are highly appreciative
of the improvement in the service offered.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.3 It is worth noting that two activities were carried out by NRB with Bank
assistance outside of the Project which contributed to the achievement of the PDO. The
first was the assistance provided to NRB by the State Bank of Pakistan to carry out stress
testing. This enabled NRB to identify vulnerable banks and manage these vulnerabilities.
The second activity was the development of a Contingency Framework for managing
potential crises in the sector. This was much needed in light of credit and liquidity
distress in the banking sector. The TA was delivered through the FIRST Initiative, which
is a Bank-executed trust fund. This obviated the need for NRB to procure consultancy
services.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

4.1     The expected development outcomes, including the revised PDO and intermediate
results indicators, could not be achieved by FSTAP to a satisfactory level. While the
performance of NBL and RBB has improved significantly, both banks still have a
negative net worth and remain fragile. Furthermore, without a change in ownership or
governance, they may well revert to their previous management practices. Indeed there
are some worrisome trends emerging, where staff costs are increasing rapidly following a
costly and protracted VRS that was partially funded under FSRP. Recent discussions
around a potential financial sector DPC for Nepal have included discussions on
recapitalization of the banks. However, recapitalization without dealing with the
underlying governance and management issues is fraught with risks.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (QAE)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1 FSTAP was designed and prepared after lengthy deliberations with the GON,
MoF, NRB, NPC, development partners (including IMF, DFID) and other stakeholders,
and took more than 40 months to prepare. A major driving force behind this ambitious
lending operation was the willingness of GON to introduce reforms in the financial sector
and the fact that it had demonstrated this commitment by initiating measures to overhaul
NBL and RBB.

5.1.2 At the time of project preparation, FSTAP appeared to be the right intervention
for the sector and enjoyed tremendous support from the development partners including
DFID and IMF. In addition, the Bank’s own 2002 report on Nepal’s financial sector
outlined the difficulties faced by the economy due to the rapidly deteriorating financial
sector, and the immediate need to address that.

5.1.3 Recognizing the risk of a policy reversal, a phased approach was adopted.
However, this may have inadvertently increased the chances of such a reversal as it
envisaged a rather protracted process for recapitalizing the banks. The Bank could have
looked at alternative resolution mechanisms, such as good bank/bad bank splits, which
would have resulted in an irreversible resolution of the problem banks up-front while
there was the political will to tackle the issue. Furthermore, the design of the project
might in retrospect have been too complex given capacity constraints and the political
environment. There was a bundling of diverse and loosely related activities under the

                                           20
various components, and significant involvement of GON’s procurement function. A
project which focused, for example, solely on the rapid resolution of RBB and NBL and
strengthening banking supervision may have encountered fewer implementation
problems.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank team conducted regular supervision of the project through; (a) regular
supervision from the Country Office in Nepal except for few months during 2008 when
the Task Team Leader (TTL) was based in Washington D.C.; (b) periodic supervision
missions; and (c) a MTR in 2006. DFID also joined a few supervision missions. The
implementation progress of the project was successful in the initial years, especially on
Component 2 due to the effective management teams in place at NBL and RBB.

5.1.5 The project counterparts and donors are of the view that the Bank team provided
tremendous support and guidance to ensure smooth implementation of project activities.
In addition, during the initial years of implementation senior management of the Bank
was engaged in an active dialogue with the country’s financial sector stakeholders,
including MoF and the Central Bank. However, with changes in senior management at
the Bank and government officials, this engagement was not sustained over the long
duration of FSTAP. The project team, however, remained very actively engaged with
counterparts throughout.

5.1.6 As noted above, a difficult political economy, coupled with the charges against
the Governor, adversely affected both project disbursements and outcomes. One obvious
example is NRB’s unwillingness to recruit the services of the bank supervisors who could
have played a crucial role in strengthening the Central Bank’s supervisory capacity
through staff training and institutional reforms. The project team remained in close
contact with NRB and GON throughout project implementation, and tried unsuccessfully
to un-block the situation, including proposing the appointment of an external agent to
handle procurement (this proposal was eventually rejected by GoN). Senior management
of the Bank (at the Vice-President level), also tried, unsuccessfully, to get the project
back on track. In the face of these obstacles, the team sought alternative solutions, such as
bringing in supervisors from State Bank of Pakistan to assist NRB with stress testing.

5.1.7 The Bank should have decided to close this project in 2008 or in early 2009 as
progress on the major components had ceased. However it still went ahead with
restructurings and extension in the PCD.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.8 Overall Bank performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Bank provided
relevant and technical advice to the counterparts and also to the management teams in the
two banks. Senior management was involved in an active dialogue with GON and NRB

                                             21
during the project design and implementation. However, given conflict, political risks and
capacity constraints, which were acknowledged up-front, the project design and
components were perhaps too ambitious and there was no provision in the project design
to mitigate against the changing political scenario in a timely fashion. Further, the Bank
unnecessarily escalated its commitment to this project despite lagging disbursements and
slowdown in implementation performance. The problems inherent in the changing
political economy could not be resolved by the Bank, despite repeated interactions with
GON and MoF. Although it strived very hard to get renewed commitment towards the
reforms, this commitment never materialized. Despite these fundamental obstacles, the
PCD was extended twice and the Project was restructured twice in its final year.

5.1.9 While the initial project extension made sense as it was requested at a time when
FSTAP was showing considerable results, the later extension and restructurings appear
more difficult to justify. It took almost four years from 2007 to 2011 for the project to
disburse just US$0.17 million and with very little achieved under the PDOs. The project
should have been either: (i) fundamentally restructured with PDOs and results indicators
revised, as was belatedly recommended (but not implemented) by the Bank supervision
team in September 2009; or (ii) closed due to the change in GON’s reform priorities, and
the lack of progress on procurement, disbursement and outcomes. The project team’s
rationale for keeping the project open through 2011 is that it provided the Bank with a
platform for continued engagement in the financial sector, which has been going through
turbulent times in the past few years. Bank management was apparently unwilling to
provide the requisite budgetary resources to maintain a financial sector dialogue other
than through extensions of the project. In the absence of progress on project
implementation, the project team pursued an active engagement with NRB on stress
testing and crisis preparedness through South-South cooperation and a First-funded
project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1 The performance of GON was Moderately Unsatisfactory. It provided tremendous
support to the Bank team during project appraisal and design stages and introduced
supportive reforms in the financial sector prior to the effectiveness of FSTAP. However,
due to the political environment, GON was unable to provide timely support to NRB to
enable it to address delays in project implementation. Also, despite several attempts by
the Bank, the GON did not move on the implementation of the actions laid out in FSSS.
This had a direct impact on the PDOs of both FSRP and FSTAP, and consequently the
idea of Phase III reforms was dropped, and DFID pulled out of FSTAP before PCD.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2 The strengthening of the NRB was a critical part of the reform process, with a
focus on enhancing its credibility and enforcement capacity. FSTAP provided the

                                           22
resources to GON and NRB to support NRB’s transition from compliance based to more
risk focused supervision, for automation of key functions such as CICL and STR, and for
capacity building of banking sector professionals. However, the opportunity was lost due
to issues with procurement, and NRB’s inability to hire Bank Supervisors and other
important experts. Consequently, IDA-allocated funds equivalent to SDR1.198 million
were cancelled. In addition, progress on other components of FSTAP suffered severe
delays at the hands of NRB, for example the diagnostic study of NBL and the
appointment of replacement management teams at RBB and NBL. These delays proved
detrimental to the outcome of the Project, as the PDOs could not be achieved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.3 Overall the performance of GON under this project was Moderately
Unsatisfactory. This has been determined based on: (i) a change in the attitude towards
the financial sector reforms during the course of project implementation; (ii) lack of
progress on banking sector legislation, including the approval of BFIA; (iii) inability to
achieve results on the reengineering of NRB due to, inter-alia, procurement issues and;
(iv) lack of supervision of crucial activities such as NRB’s hiring of Bank Restructuring
Advisor for NBL and RBB, despite having signed the amendment to the DCA in 2008.
As a result, these activities could not be completed.



6. Lessons Learned

6.1     Banking sector reforms, particularly privatization, require sustained
commitment and political will, which cannot be imposed by external parties. The
Bank therefore needs to carefully weigh the pros and cons of supporting such projects in
countries prone to political instability, such as Nepal. In this case, the political will
appeared to be present at project inception, and the potential rewards were no doubt
worth the risks, given the huge losses and systemic risks building in the system. And,
despite later policy reversals, much was achieved in terms of restructuring the public
sector banks. However, given Nepal’s history, and the recognized high political risks of
the project, the team should have considered restructuring/privatization options that could
have been implemented more rapidly, thereby reducing the risk of policy reversals over
time.

6.2     It is difficult to sustain implementation progress over a very long period,
particularly in a fragile and conflict state. This project went on for more than eight
years, many of which were characterized by conflict, and saw many changes within the
teams of the Bank and of the project counterparts. The long duration made it very
difficult to sustain the performance beyond the initial years, especially as the individuals
involved in project preparation and early implementation moved on to other positions.
This posed several challenges to their successors in an environment emerging from
conflict. Successive governments faced a broad range of post conflict issues, and it
became clear that difficult financial sector reforms were not a high priority.
                                            23
6.3     The Bank should act decisively when it becomes clear that the client is no
longer committed to project objectives. Problems associated with the post conflict
environment and changing political economy of Nepal were exacerbated by the
procurement charges brought against senior NRB officials. It should have been clear to
the project team and Bank management well before the 2011 project restructurings that
these factors had irrevocably undermined the likelihood of achieving project objectives.
Bank management should have urged the project team to fundamentally restructure or
close FSTAP earlier, and provided the necessary resources to maintain an ongoing
dialogue on critical financial sector issues in the absence of a project.

6.4     The Bank needs to be particularly vigilant to ensure a measured sequencing
of reforms in fragile countries and conflict prone environments. The design and
objectives of FSTAP were no doubt overly ambitious, complex, and time-consuming
given the post conflict situation in Nepal. A project which focused more narrowly on key
objectives, for example, the rapid resolution of RBB and NBL, might have had more
sustainable results.

6.5     The GON’s communications strategy plays a crucial role in securing public
approval on difficult reforms such as bank restructuring and privatization. In its
initial years, the project benefitted tremendously from the PRO placed at NRB as an
advisor to the Governor. However, when the Governor was suspended, the PRO’s
contract was neither renewed nor a replacement hired. Politically sensitive reforms in
any sector require a buy-in of the employees’ unions and associations and of the general
public. A continued communications strategy might have helped sustain the reform
efforts, and would have complemented the training program for financial journalists that
was being implemented.

6.6     The team approach towards the restructuring of NBL worked very well. One
firm was recruited to undertake the restructuring and it brought in a team of very strong
professionals each matched with the intended role. Whereas, following the withdrawal of
the firm selected to manage RBB, a CEO and individual consultants were hired in order
to expedite hiring. The CEO faced considerable challenges in building his team as the
individual TORs did not fully match the requirements of RBB at the time.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1    The Borrower’s ICR has been received by the Bank and is attached as Annex 7


(b) Cofinanciers (Detailed comments are in Annex 8)

7.2    DFID pulled out of this project in March 2011, a year earlier than initially
planned and also cancelled some of the Grant amount once the Bank downgraded the

                                           24
ratings on implementation progress and PDO to Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
responsible team member at DFID completed a summary of the project results in March
2011. The report noted that there was a need for a continuous political economy analysis
to inform target setting and program design. It endorses the Bank’s views that around
2006-2007 the GON commitment to the reform program faded. In DFID’s opinion, the
project should have been redesigned or suspended at that point instead of being extended.

7.3     DFID has shared its own experiences on this project (Annex 8) and from those it
is clear that it acknowledges the strong supervision support extended to GON and NRB
by the Bank. However the report also notes that it would have been better for the Bank to
address the underlying causes of the problems rather than treating the symptoms. NRB
was generally reluctant to continue implementation of the reforms after the 2007 incident
of CIAA charging the Governor. Further, it also showed lack of interest towards
following alternate arrangements for procurement that could have addressed the delays in
disbursements under the project. Going forward, it would be important to have a broad
based political agreement and bureaucratic support prior to embarking on financial sector
reforms.

                                                                       27
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Due to the nature of Project activities and the mix of results accomplished under the
FSTAP (and FSRP), it has not been possible to calculate an accurate Net Present Value
(NPV) or Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for this intervention. FSTAP achieved
significant results during the initial years of its implementation but not much was
accomplished in the last 3-4 years despite extensions and restructuring. While many of
the ultimate results expected, including the recapitalization of NBL and RBB, have not
yet been achieved, there have been a number of significant cost savings realized.

The management teams hired under the Project supervised the effective implementation
of the VRS schemes for NBL and RBB which were funded by the Phase II FSRP. The
institutions recorded annual cost savings of US$2.67 million from FY04 until FY09 with
45 percent financial IRR and a payback period of just four years6. The two restructured
public banks have generated NPR 30 billion (US$400 million) in operating profits since
2003, when they were losing US$80 million per annum before restructuring efforts began
under the FSTAP. While some of the savings (including those from the VRS) and
turnaround can also be attributed to the Phase II FSRP (or indeed other factors), assuming
the losses had continued at the same rate, the fiscal savings to the GON exceed
US$ 1.0 billion (losses of US$640 million over 8 years versus profits of US$ 400 million).
Total expenditures for both projects were approximately only US$78 million.

While the net worth of the two banks remain negative (NPR4.24 billion for NBL and
NPR87.5 billion for RBB), the deficit has declined significantly from NPR10.02 billion
(NBL) and NPR22.39 billion (RBB), thereby substantially reducing the ultimate fiscal
cost of recapitalizing the banks.

Additionally the gross non-performing loans levels decreased for both banks from
approximately 60 percent in year 2003 to 5.29 percent for NBL and 10.90 percent for
RBB in year 2011.

     agreement:

       1. Strengthening Nepal Rastra Bank's human resource management capabilities;
       2. Strengthening Nepal Rastra Bank's supervisory and regulatory capacity with respect to
          banks and non-banking financial institution ;
       3. Supporting Nepal Rastra Bank's comprehensive legislative and regulatory reform efforts
          in the financial sector;
       4. Supporting Nepal Rastra Bank's research activities, including, among other things,
          computerizing and developing Nepal Rastra Bank's library services;
       5. Strengthening Nepal Rastra Bank's accounting and auditing capabilities to produce
          better quality and more timely financial and accounting information;
       6. Strengthening information technology solutions of Nepal Rastra Bank;



                                                35
    7. Conducting a training program for professional development of Nepal Rastra Bank staff
       including in-house training and attendance at external seminars and conferences;

       Among the programs under re-engineering of Nepal Rastra Bank works completed are as
       follows:

      Selection and Employment of International Consultants
       For providing the consultancy services, the contract was signed with the consulting firm
       M/S IEF Inc. in association with KPMG, Sri Lanka on February 06, 2006 for the
       positions of four Bank Examiners, two Non-bank Examiners, one Off-site Supervisor
       .However, the consulting firm had changed individual consultants many times rather than
       originally proposed consultants. As a result, Board of Director of Nepal Rastra Bank
       decided to terminate the contract.
      Team of Chartered Accountants to prepare accounting manual :
       A team of 7 Chartered Accountants from Nepal Rastra Bank was formed to prepare
       accounting manual, internal audit manual, budget directive, annual and periodically
       financial reporting format. The team submitted the final report on February 10, 2008.
       Nepal Rastra Bank has been gradually implementing manuals prepared by the team.

       Advisor from June 26, 2005, to provide advice to restructure NRB's Human Resource
       Management.The tenor of the consultant expired on June 25, 2008. Management of

       assumed his assignment as IT Expert to upgrade Nepal Rastra Bank's Information
       Technology System. Although, the contract was extended for few times up to October
       2005, the consultant did not response on the issues raised by NRB regarding the need of
       information technology in NRB. That's why, the management of NRB terminated the
       contract and the upgradation of the information technology of NRB has been
       implemented through its internal resources.

      Training of the Employees of Nepal Rastra Bank:

       Training to the employees of Nepal Rastra Bank had been provided in core and non-core

                                             36
   1. Implementing a restructuring program for each of Rastriya Banijya Bank and Nepal Bank
      Limited with a view to :
      (a) controlling bank day-to day operations :
      (b) stabilizing their operational and financial positions:

          program, a retrenchment program, and a revised remuneration package for bank
          staff: and

       Among the above set targets, the works done in these two banks are as follows:

      Rastriya Banijya Bank Limited (RBBL):
       Under the restructuring of Management of RBBL, Mr.Bruce F. Henderson was appointed
       as Chief Executive Officer of the Management Team on December 21, 2002 and
       continued until January 15, 2008. After his term, Nepal Rastra Bank hired management
       team of two consultants, Mr. Janardan Acharya, as a CEO and Mr. Om Bindu Lal
       Rajbhandari, as IT Manager. The contract with Mr. Acharya expired on March 31, 2011.
       Further, as a part of restructuring, all branches of the bank have been computerized. Forty
       branches of RBBL deployed with Pumari Software and 75 branches with RBBSYS
       software. Any Branch Banking Services (ABBS) have been provided in major branches
       of RBBL.

       in NBL from July 22, 2002 to July 21, 2007. After the expiry of the contract with the
       ICC Consulting Ireland Limited, Nepal Rastra Bank deputed its personnel for
       management.
       During the period of restructuring, almost all branches had been computerized and
       deployed with Newton Software and major branches started Any Branch Banking
       Services (ABBS).

   conveying financial and business news and issue to the public.
4. Supporting the Coordination Support Team in implementing and supervising the
   Project,especially in relation to financial management, procurement and coordination
   capabilities.
      Among the above reform programs, the main activities performed are :
     Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)
      FSTAP supported capacity building of employees of DRT. The in-house training
      program was conducted in the office of DRT. The officials of DRT made couple of study
      visit programs in South Asian countries to discuss the best practice of Tribunal business.
      First, the team of DRT officials and officials from Ministry of Finance and Nepal Rastra
      Bank visited Bangladesh as well as tribunals in different Indian cities. The other visit
      program was the Debt Recovery Tribunal of Sri Lanka. Also, the project supported the
      automation of DRT to enhance the efficiency of the tribunal activities
     Financial Journalism
      FSTAP assisted in the training of 48 financial journalists. The project provided support
      for training of financial journalists in Reuters in United Kingdom and the United States of
      America. Also, the trainings were conducted in Banglore and Asian Institute of
      Technology (AIT), Bangkok.


V.        Achievement of Project
    The main objective of the project are to assist the borrower in (i) re-engineering the Nepal
    Rastra Bank for it to effectively perform key central banking functions;(ii) implementing
    reforms in the commercial banking sector that will focus initially on restructuring Rastriya
    Banijya Bank Limited and Nepal Bank Limited; and(iii) improving the environment for
    financial sector reforms in areas such as credit information and financial news reporting
    through specialized training and capacity building. The major achievements of the project
    are;
     Both the public sector banks, Nepal Bank Limited and Rastriya Banijya Bank Limited
      were in deep financial trouble before the commencement of the project. Both banks have
      made a satisfactory progress in their financial indicators. The Non-Performing loan was
      reduced from 60 percent to 7.93 percent and 10.85 percent, negative net-worth of
      Rs.10.02 billion and Rs.22.39 billion to negative of Rs.4.24 billion and negative of
      Rs.8.75 billion, number of employees from 5652 and 5522 to 2342 and 2555 in Nepal
      Bank Limited and Rastriya Banijya Bank Limited respectively from Mid July 2003 to
      Mid January 2011.
     As a part of restructuring of Nepal Bank Limited almost all branches had been
      computerized and deployed with Newton Software and major branches started to provide



                                             38
    with Any Branch Banking Services (ABBS). Similarly, in Rastriya Banijya Bank
    Limited, all branches of the bank have been computerized. Forty branches of RBBL
    deployed with Pumari Software and 75 branches with RBBSYS software. Any Branch
    Banking Services (ABBS) have been provided in major branches of RBBL.
   As a part of restructuring of NBL, the managementof Nepal Bank Limited was made
    strong through the contract between the Nepal Bank Limited and ICC Consulting Bank of
    Scotland (Ireland), who worked in NBL for five years. Similarly, in RBBL the contract
    was signed with Mr. Bruce F. Henderson, Chief Executive Officer of the Management
    Team which expired on Jan 15, 2008. Nepal Rastra Bank hired management team of two
    consultants, Mr. Janardan Acharya, as a CEO and Mr. Om Bindu Lal Rajbhandari, as IT
    Manager. The contract with Mr. Acharya expired on March 31, 2011.
   The Project supported in the capacity building of employees of DRT. The in-house
    training program was conducted in the office of DRT and made couple of study visit
    programs in South Asian countries to discuss the best practice of Tribunal business. The
    team of DRT officials and officials from Ministry of Finance and Nepal Rastra Bank
    visited Bangladesh as well as tribunals in different Indian cities.
   FSTAP assisted in the training of 48 financial journalists. The project provided support
    for training of financial journalists in Reuters in United Kingdom and the United States of
    America. Also, the trainings were conducted in Banglore and Asian Institute of
    Technology (AIT), Bangkok.
   As a part of re-engineering of Nepal Rastra Bank, a team of 7 Chartered Accountants
    from NRB was formed to prepare accounting manual, internal audit manual, budget
    directive, annual and periodically financial reporting format. The team submitted the final
    report on February 10, 2008. Nepal Rastra Bank has been gradually implementing
    manuals prepared by the team.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers – DFID

Following inputs were received from DFID’s office in Nepal in response to Bank’s
questions:

Overall experience on FSTAP especially your interaction with the counterparts
(NRB)

Given that we closed this project after nine years (i.e. 6 years longer than intended
programming) and it still have not reached most of its objectives our overall experience
was not positive. The main problem is that this intervention was designed in a different
political context to the one which it tried to deliver in. Issues around privatisation and
restructuring of state owned banks became too difficult an issue for the authorities to deal
with.

There were of course other issues especially to do with the politicisation of the NRB and
the issues around the dismissal, imprisonment, and then re-instatement of the former
Governor which created an environment where senior officials were not prepared to deal
with any difficult or controversial issues. At the same time they were not prepared to
admit this even in private and allow alternative delivery and procurement mechanisms to
be used. In this context our interactions with the NRB we not particularly useful or
helpful in ensuring delivery. They were always polite but not productive. This also had
serious knock on effects on component not to be delivered by NRB, but dependent on
their procurement, such as the work with the Credit Bureau which was effectively starved
of funds and could not expand.

In many ways this could not have been for seen at the time of design. But where the
project failed was not changing direction or even closing earlier – the period around the
end of 2005 would have been critical in this regard. The project really failed to grasp the
underlying political economy of the NRB and the financial sector more broadly and the
wide ranging political changes sweeping across Nepal which drove these.

Experience of collaboration with the Bank group, what worked and how things
could have been improved or done in a better way.

In general this was highly positive and always best when there was a task team leader
based in-country (and this was not always the case). I only took on responsibility for this
in its last 12-months and collaboration with the Bank Group was strong during this
period. We jointly tried to re-design the programme to deal with the NRB reluctance to
take on any major procurement issues – doing this together and sending joint messages to
the authorities – this was a model approach from our perspective.

When it became apparent that we were not going to be able to resolve this DFID decided
to terminate its support with an appropriate notice period. This was discussed with the
WBG is a highly collegiate manner and we fully agreed the messaging to be given to the
authorities and the media (to ensure that our reputational risk was dealt with).



                                            41
What in your view were the key issues with this project and how did the counterpart
and Bank performed with regards to project supervision and implementation.

The key issues are alluded to above and non-delivery is mainly related to the changing
politics and political economy in Nepal and the extreme risk aversion this generated in
senior NRB officials.

In broad terms the Bank performed well on overall supervision but failed to focus on the
underlying issues which forced implementation to go off course. Quite often the
symptoms were treated rather than looking at the underlying causes and really assessing
whether there is anything that could be done about this. Where the Bank (and DFID)
failed was not to take on board the broader implications of large changes in Nepal and
what that did to the political landscape and the realistic range of policy options open to
officials in the NRB. In retrospect once there was a substantial shift to the left and the
political instability associated with a longer-term transition to democracy it was always
going to be very hard for this project to deliver as designed.

Suggestions on way forward

As we move into a new phase of design in this area (and jointly with the World Bank) we
are keenly aware to make sure we do not make the same mistakes and the specific actions
been taken to ensure this are:
     Slowing the design process to ensure there is broad based political and
       bureaucratic support for the proposed reforms (now based around a Development
       Policy Credit and linked TA);
     Ensuring there is a full political economy analysis written into the design phase
       and that the project has standing capacity to ensure there can be continuous
       analysis throughout the intervention

One issues we are however concerned with is that there will be no TTL based in Nepal –
this is not currently planned for.
