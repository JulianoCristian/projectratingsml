7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overarching objective of the Reform Program in the Financial Sector is to support the renewed efforts
of His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) to improve the sector in order to bring macroeconomic
stability and promote private-sector-led economic growth. Specifically, the Project focuses on :       (a)
helping to restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank - NRB), so that it can
effectively perform its key central banking functions;     (b) commencing commercial banking reform in
the two large ailing commercial banks that dominate the sector (Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal
Bank Limited (NBL)) -- by introducing stronger bank management that protects the financial integrity of
the two banks and would take on a conservator role to prepare the banks for the next steps of restructuring;
and     (c) supporting a better environment for financial sector reform in areas such as enhanced credit
information, better financial news reporting, and better training for staff in financial institutions.
