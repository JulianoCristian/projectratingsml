                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final Implementation Support Report for the Financial Sector TA Project prior to its closing on December 31. 2011. Following the restructuring of the project with Board
                         approval obtained on April 1, 2011 there were only three activities remaining for implementation. Unfortunately, the procurement process for these activities could not progress as
                         planned. A summary of the status of these activities is as follows: (a) Procurement of a new MIS to upgrade Credit Information Center Limited (CICL) ran into problems when the

                         amounts quoted in the financial bids exceeded the budget. Given the inadequate time remaining in the project period for another round of bidding, the activity was considered for
                         cancellation. (b) In the case of procuring MIS for the Secured Transaction Registry Office and conducting a detailed diagnostic assessment of Nepal Bank Limited, the agreed
                         milestones in the Procurement Plan were not achieved and hence these activities were also considered for cancellation. The Bank was informed of the implementing agencies’
                         inability to complete these activities within the remaining project period.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the delays in the procurement process for all the remaining activities under the restructured project, and the very low probability that activities would be completed within the
                         project period, a request for an early cancellation of undisbursed fund was received on December 2, 2011. The project was restructured accordingly and the restructuring was
                         approved on December 13, 2011. The restructuring recommits SDR 1,198,977.84 to other IDA projects in Nepal.
