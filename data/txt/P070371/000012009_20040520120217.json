the\n            first of a series of quick disbursing loans to support the\n            Government of Mexico's low-income housing and urban\n            program. To this end, the project goals focus on seven key\n            areas: a) develop a sound national policy and institutional\n            framework for housing, and urban development; b)design and\n            establish a unified housing subsidy policy that facilitates\n            access of low/moderate-income families, to housing, and\n            leverages household savings, and private credit finance; c)\n            strengthen the housing credit, and savings systems; d)\n            strengthen urban real property registries, and rights; d)\n            increase the supply of urban land and its access by the\n            poor, and improve real estate market functions; e)\n            coordinate and support physical and social investments, to\n            systematically upgrade poor neighborhoods; and, f) improved\n            prevention and management of the impacts of natural\n            disasters. Risks however, include a relatively ambitious\n            cross-sectoral approach, risking the timing approval of the\n            second and third loans in the program. However, this risk\n            should be mitigated through the well-designed, integrated\n            strategy, and a small number of key prior actions, including\n            the intended reform policy."}, "docdt": "2004-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
