This simplified Implementation Completion\n            Report provides some findings and implications for\n            subsequent operations as follows. Reforms supported by HUSAL\n            have contributed to the recent expansion and diversification\n            of market-rate housing credit in the moderate-income\n            segment, by leveraging private sector resources, as\n            evidenced by an increase in the outstanding mortgage to GDP\n            ratio from 4.9 percent in 2000, to 7.3 percent in 2004. To a\n            large extent, the elements included in the agreed policy\n            matrix will promote this outcome; however special attention\n            should be given to the subsidy component. It would be\n            advisable to incorporate into the policy matrix the\n            development of a comprehensive housing sector database that\n            could provide the housing commission with an essential tool,\n            necessary to exercise the role as policy body. The\n            Program's main objective - improving the living\n            conditions of the poor- depends on a broad array of\n            variables identified in each of the project's\n            components. To different degrees, reform is needed in all of\n            them to address the main goal. It is expected these reforms\n            will occur gradually, and this is the reason the\n            programmatic structure of the project design suits the\n            operation. Moreover, there are substantial benefits to be\n            gained in favor of sector policy from the Bank's role\n            as facilitator between different government agencies,\n            fostering policy discussion towards reform. This has been\n            recognized by the client as an important, positive impact of\n            the Bank's role."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
