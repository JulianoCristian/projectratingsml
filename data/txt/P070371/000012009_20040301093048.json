From an institutional perspective,\n            the report suggests active participation by environmental\n            authorities in the housing sector, on policy planning, and\n            implementation, supported by a strong legal, and regulatory\n            framework. To this end, the conflicts between federal, and\n            state programs should be addressed, to then establish\n            mechanisms strengthening housing information management\n            systems for the provision of housing environmental\n            indicators, low-income housing costs, and housing market\n            estimates. Housing development should initially consider\n            availability of water resources, promote as possible water\n            tariffs that reflect real costs, as well as infrastructure\n            costs that support water service delivery, and, include an\n            adequate water management, and sanitation technology for\n            current construction programs, supported by training and\n            capacity building. Similarly, power consumption indicators\n            should be made available, so that construction plans are in\n            accordance with the energy supply. From the urban\n            standpoint, roads and urban transportation modes should be\n            fostered, taking into account the necessary legal and\n            regulatory framework concerning an integrated urban program."}, "docdt": "2004-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
