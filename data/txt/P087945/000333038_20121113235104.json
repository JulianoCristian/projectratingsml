The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from January 15, 2012 until January 15, 2013. The closing\n            date for the project will be extended from January 15, 2013\n            until November 15, 2013 with a 4-month disbursement grace\n            period. This extension is necessary to allow the Project to\n            complete key activities being performed by three working\n            groups established to support the preparation and\n            implementation of the Financial Management Information\n            System (FMIS) that focus on line accountability, accounting\n            standards, and budget execution. Other activities include\n            the finalization of the uniform account code structure\n            (posting rules); IPSAS cash basis implementation; and budget\n            entity implementation for the 2013 budget. While the\n            extension period will not be long enough to finance the FMIS\n            contract (which will be financed under a new trust fund,\n            Public Financial Management Trust Fund), it will support all\n            activities related to the system procurement. In addition,\n            the requested extension will provide essential resources to\n            undertake (i) on-the-job training and capacity development,\n            and (ii) change management and communications related\n            activities to support implementation of the reforms. These\n            include (but not limited to) the uniform account\n            code-structure, the implementation of the budget entity\n            reforms, and the implementation of newly established\n            district (and Khan) funds both at the central and provincial\n            levels. Finally, the extension will allow the completion of\n            the contract for the services of the International\n            Procurement Agent. The borrower has in place an action plan\n            to complete the project. This will be the second extension\n            of the project and a cumulative extension of 22 months."}, "docdt": "2012-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
