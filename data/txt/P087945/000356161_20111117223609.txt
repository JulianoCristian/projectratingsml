                                            Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for Cambodia Public Financial Management and Accountability, [IDA H-241-
KH], P087945, will be extended from January 15, 2012 until January 15, 2013.

2.      The PFMAP was approved by the Board on June 27, 2006 and effective on June 29, 2007 co-
financed by IDA Grant 241-KH of SDR 9.8 million (equivalent USD14.0 million), MDTF, TF 054545
of US$ 14.7 million contributed by AusAID, Dfid, EU, and SIDA, as well as Cambodian government’s
counterpart fund of US$ 1.5 million. Cumulative disbursement as of October 2011 totals US$ 20.9
million of which US$ 8.1 million from the IDA grant, US$ 12.4 million from the MDTF, and US$ 0.4
million from the counterpart fund. Currently, progress towards achievements of PDO is rated
moderately satisfactory and overall implementation progress is also moderately satisfactory.

3.      Substantive achievements have been made in improving governance of public financial
management. Beginning with the Platform One targeting budget credibility, the achievements include:
(i) improvements in revenue collection and budget execution; (ii) cash and bank account management
with successful government bank account consolidation (TSA strengthening), the use of commercial
banks for government transactions, and a complete elimination of payment arrears; (iii) more efficient
use of budget with pilots of program-based budget; (iv) better expenditure planning through Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and budget integration under Strategic Budget Plans; and (v)
motivational measures and capacity development. Under Platform Two that focuses on financial
accountability having FMIS implementation as a core component, good progress has been made on
budget classification; the budget entity framework; business process reengineering and internal control;
the completion of a strategy and action plan for FMIS implementation; and the recent evaluation and
selection of an FMIS contractor. The summaries of the 2006 and 2007 annual audit reports have been
published – a key achievement under external oversight and oversight. These reforms are contributing
to greater transparency, more efficient use of resources, and greater accountability to minimize
opportunities for rent seeking and corruption.

4.      This extension is necessary to support key reform activities to achieve the project’s stated
objectives which include support to the treasury, core activities in the preparation for the Financial
Management Information System (FMIS) implementation, and PFM-related capacity development
toward improved good governance and transparent use of public resources. The borrower has in place
an action plan to complete the project. In addition, this extension will allow for continuing financing of
the IPA contract and co-financing with the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, [TF 054545] which has just been
extended to July 11, 2012 (from October 11, 2011).


5.      This will be the first extension.
