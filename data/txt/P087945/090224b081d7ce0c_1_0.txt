                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project supports the implementation of the Stage Two of the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) consisting of the activities under the Platform One, Budget
                         Credibility, to be further strengthened and the activities under the Platform Two, Financial Accountability, that focus on the implementation of the Financial Management Information
                         System (FMIS) to further strengthen budget credibility.

                         Good progress on the strengthening of the Platform One's activities continues. Revenue policy and administration has been enhanced with continued refinement in medium term
                         revenue mobilization policy and strategy, and activities to strengthen revenue administration more broadly. The updated medium term revenue mobilization policy and strategy
                         (2013-2018) has been developed and is currently under review. Macroeconomic and revenue forecasting has also been strengthened with the development of the Economic Outlook

                         for 2012 â€“ 2014, macroeconomic update 2013-2015, and monthly socio-economic report. Revenue administration continues to be further improved with the review and amendment of
                         code of ethics for tax officers, utilization of banking system for tax payment, and circular on measures to collect information, further improving self assessed regime and tax on
                         property, tax auditing, and collection of tax arrears. The Asycuda system has been further improved and updated with tariff, exchange rate, list of 2012 tariff, risk assessment criteria,
                         and custom risk management data system (CRMDS) of the General Department of Customs and Excise. The revenue base has been broadened with the introduction of non-tax

                         revenue and property taxes. The introduction of inter-ministerial prakases on the management of non-tax revenues has been one of the major developments for mobilizing revenues
                         and improving transparency. Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) has been further improved by connecting 3 more departments to the system (National
                         Treasury, Budget Department, and Economic and Public Finance Policy Department). Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is integrated into Debt Management Office and reports on
                         debt are produced monthly, quarterly and annually. The sub decree on Public Debt Management is adopted and operationalized, and a Committee on Public Debt Management has
                         been created. Furthermore, a strategic paper for Public Debt Management 2011-2018 has been approved and launched for implementation. Cash and bank account management
                         has been improved with the strengthening of the Treasury Single Account, the expanding use of commercial banks for government transactions to 17 provinces (and consideration
                         for possible expansion to all cities in the provinces). Public procurement has been strengthened with the adoption of Law on Public Procurement, the development and finalization of
                         a number of sub decrees and Prakas to implement the Law, and the creation of a Public Procurement website. The Budget Reform Implementation Plan (that includes the scaling up
                         of Program budgeting) has been sent to the Prime Minister's Office for approval.

                         Notwithstanding these achievements, there are areas that need improvement. Revenue-to-GDP ratio, while increased substantially, remains low compared to countries in the region.
                         Further, slow progress on budget integration has hindered the progress on strategic planning initiatives such as the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the Budget
                         Strategic Plans (BSPs) that have been set up to link sector priorities and budgeting.

                         A key development under the project during this reporting period, has been the Bank's deepened engagement with and support to the MEF on two critical policy areas: contingent
                         liabilities and debt sustainability analysis (DSA). During their visit (June 10 -21, 2013) to Cambodia the Contingent Liability Technical Assistance Mission team worked closely with
                         debt management officials and other relevant representatives the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MEF) to identify and address the risks of the guarantees to the Royal
                         Government of Cambodia (RGC) balance sheet as much as possible and propose recommendations for the next steps required to effectively identify, monitor and possibly manage
                         these risks. On a return visit planned for August 2013, the technical assistance team will further investigate an issue related to Independent Power Producers' option to sell in the
                         case of EdC event of default as well as examine some of the issues previously identified. Simultaneously through a parallel effort, a DSA technical assistance team has completed its
                         desk review exercise and proved written comments to the government on its DSA strategy and analysis. A mission to discuss these findings has been scheduled for October 2013.

                         The strengthening of the Platform Two's activities continues to progress. A key achievement has been the Uniform Account code Structure (Chart of Accounts, CoA) comprised of six
                         segments. The administrative, economic and functional classifications segments of the CoA are in line with GFS/COFOG. The CoA allows for meeting fully IPSAS cash basis
                         requirements with a road map for the General Department of the National Treasury (GDNT). This CoA will form the backbone of the FMIS system and represents a significant
                         achievement under the PFMRP as it lays the foundation for much greater transparency in budgeting, accounting, and reporting. The RGC (and MEF in particular) remains committed
                         to ensure organizational and technical readiness for the implementation of FMIS. The process of procuring the treasury centric FMIS, a second attempt with more focus on the
                         GDNT, has moved steadily and within the time line agreed between the Bank and the MEF, and has now reached stage 2 of the two-stage-competitive bidding process. Contract
                         award is anticipated in the 3rd quarter of CY 2013 and mobilization of the contractor by January 2014. Following on a the key recommendations from the 2012 External Advisory
                         Panel (EAP) review and report, the FMIS Project Management Working Group (FMWG) has been formed to ensure the necessary prerequisites for the system are in place and will
                         work hand - in - hand with the contractor to develop and implement the FMIS in the key functional Departments in the MEF, the GDNT and all 24 provincial treasures. The business

                         process of the GDNT, an important prerequisite, and been reviewed and updated. The MEF remains engaged in the PEMNA network and has made a number of presentations at
                         regional workshops and plenary conferences and sits on the Management Board of the organization.

                         The PFMRP is generally on the right track; however, overall progress under the Stage Two appears much slower than initially anticipated due to the complexity of the Program and
                         the failure of first tender of the FMIS which has resulted in program extensions. The delay to the implementation of the new CoA (until the preparation of the 2015 budget) will like
                         cause delay to FMIS implementation. While this issue will be reviewed during the upcoming World Bank Supervision mission in August 2013, the long delay in organizing the
                         (quarterly) technical working group (TWG) meetings this year due in part to the general elections, to some extend, has impeded close and regular consultations between DPs and the
                         Government. To facilitate the ongoing discussions, DPs will request that at least one TWG be held prior to the end of calendar year 2013. Despite some progress - eg. completion
                         of 3 year rolling audit plan 2012-2014, the establishment of internal audit departments in 26 ministries [of which 23 department are active], and the preparation of guidelines for
                         internal audit including rules and standards for FMIS audits - the internal audit function and capacity of the MEF and the line ministries require further improvement. The deepening
                         and the expansion of the PFMRP (increasing demand for improved collaboration and coordination with other reform programs such as the Public Administration Reform and De-

                         As at July 15, 2013, the total expenditures for the IDA Grant No. H2410 were US$ 13.66 million (excluding the advance made to the designated account (DA) amounting to US

                         $698,678), which is representing 93.01% of the total approved loan and grant of US$14.69 million. The total budget of US $14.69 reflects the exchange rate gains - 0.69 million
                         USD for the conversion the amount of 9.80 million SDR. Since the project is still 04 months to closing date (November 15, 2013), the team is expected to ensure all claims are
                         cleared (i.e. retention fees, goods, services rendered before the closing date) by the disbursement deadline (up to 8 months) which is March 15, 2014.
