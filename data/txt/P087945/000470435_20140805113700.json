satisfactory outcome with significant institutional\n            development and a satisfactory for the Bank and moderately\n            satisfactory by the Borrower. The project underwent\n            restructuring three times relating to extension of closing\n            date and revision of components and sub-components. Merit\n            Based Pay Initiative (MBPI) was formally revised to the\n            Priority Operating Costs (POC). According to the\n            Restructuring Paper dated June 6, 2011, it was the Royal\n            Government of Cambodia (RGC)\u0092s decision to cancel the MBPI\n            and Priority Mission Group (PMG), and all other salary\n            supplement and incentive schemes with effect from January 1,\n            2010 regardless of the sources of financing. It was replaced\n            with the establishment of the Priority Operating Costs\n            (POC), which was also terminated in 2012. Reallocation of\n            IDA grant was made and hence there were changes to the\n            results monitoring. The lessons learned where that they\n            needed to narrow the project scope and manage expectation of\n            both Government and DPs in the face of mounting uncertainty\n            in a post conflict country. They also needed to make\n            adaptive adjustments to project\u0092s scope and timeline based\n            on proactive engagement and effective communication of the\n            task team with the Government counterparts."}, "docdt": "2014-05-13T00:47:02Z"}
