                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project supports the implementation of the Stage Two of the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) consists of the activities under the Platform One, Budget
                         Credibility to be further strengthened and the activities under the Platform Two,FinancialAccountability focusing on the implementation of the Financial Management Information
                         System. to further strengthen budget credibility.

                         Continued good progress on the strengthening of the Platform One's activities. Approval of the medium-term revenue mobilization policy and strategy (2011-2013) supports annual
                         budget preparation, and a working group was created to monitor and evaluate of the implementation of the strategy, a number of key tax legislation is being drafted and finalized
                         (revising and resubmitting draft of petroleum regulations to the Council ofMinisters and drafting a law on tax on natural mine resources operations). Revenue administration continues

                         to be further improved with the planned expansion of tax base (drafted a sub degree on deduction of threshold of turnover and value added tax under self assessed regime), circular
                         on measures to collect information, further improving self assessed regime and tax on property, tax auditing, and collection of tax arrears. Automated System for Customs Data
                         (ASYCUDA) has been further improved, updated with customs risk management database system (CRMDS), expanded to in-land ports and main border checkpoints. A standardized
                         non-tax revenue receipting system has been implemented and expanded. A number of key legislation for managing non-tax revenue is being drafted (draft Trust Law, Law on

                         Insurance, Law on Casino Management, Law on Real Estate Management). Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) has been further improved by connecting 3
                         more departments (National Treasury, Budget Department, and Economic and Public Finance Policy Department), Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is integrated into Debt
                         Management Office, monthly, quarterly and annually reports on debt are produced; sub degree on Public Debt Management is adopted and operationalized, and a Committee on
                         Public Debt Management has been created, strategic paper for Public Debt Management 2011-2018 was approved. Treasury Single Account is further strengthened, having zero
                         balance accounts for revenue collection (for both tax and customs departments), the use of commercial banks for government transactions has been expanded to 17 provinces. Law
                         on Public Procurement was adopted and a number of sub degrees and Prakas to implement the Law are being developed and finalized. A website for Public Procurement was
                         created. However, a number of key weaknesses remains. Revenue-to-GDP ratio remains low compared to regional countries. Slow progress on budget integration has hindered the
                         progress on strategic planning initiatives such as the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs) that have been set up to link sector
                         priorities and budgeting. Performance of program budgeting pilots remains constrained by the lack of budget virements flexibility for implementation and the non-existence of program
                         budget nomenclature yet (until the new CoA have been implemented) for reporting and evaluation purposes.

                         Good progress has been achieved in implementing the Platform Two. A key achievement is the Uniform Account code Structure (Chart of Accounts, CoAs) having six segments. The
                         administrative, economic and functional classifications segments of the CoAs are in line with GFS/COFOG. This is a key issue which had been unresolved for a long time. Despite
                         the fact that the FMIS procurement has been delayed; the team has worked hard to get this finalized and the CoAs allows for meeting fully IPSAS cash basis requirements with a
                         road map for the General Department of the National Treasury (GDNT). CoAs that will be the backbone of the FMIS system. This represents a significant achievement under the
                         PFMRP as it lays the foundation for much greater transparency in budgeting, accounting, and reporting. It should encourage the donor community to use country systems. A lot of
                         efforts have been made to finalize FMIS Procurement which is expected to be out before the end of the year. Our procurement hub was invited to come to advise the MEF as they
                         amend the bidding documents. The team has provided substantial procurement and technical advice and feedback to the MEF and the documents are progressing well. One sticking
                         point has been to ensure that this process is led by the GDNT in order to achieve successful implementation (and senior MEF management recognizes this). Under our
                         encouragement, the MEF implementation team (with the right mix of departments) has applied to participate in the jointly sponsored WB/Korean Institute, new Leadership Program
                         for FMIS implementation program. MEF also takes pa rt in the PEMNA initiative. 2012 External Advisory Panel was conducted, and EAP team agreed during the recent annual retreat
                         that the PFMRP is on the right track and that the RGC’s PFMRP strategy remains valid. The team is working with the MEF to confirm and finalize on the the overall procurement and
                         contract implementation time ine so that an agreed framework with agreed milestones and deliverables can be used by both the Bank and the MEF to monitor progress of this
                         complex process.

                         However, overall progress under the Stage Two appears much slower than initially anticipated due to the complexity of the Program and the failure of first tender of the FMIS resulting
                         in program extensions. The delay in the finalization of business process reengineering resulting from the postponement of the functional review exercise needs to be quickly resolved
                         and finalized and and the MEF management assures the Bank that this will be done for the FMIS implementation. Internal audit functions require substantial improvements. The
                         deepening and the expansion of the PFMRP increasingly demand for improved collaboration and coordination with other reform programs such as the Public Administration Reform
                         and De-concentration and Decentralization remains to be done. Participation and engagement by line ministries including provincial levels needs further strengthening and
                         deepening.
