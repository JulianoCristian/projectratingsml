REPORT AND RECO15ThNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OlN A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMET CORPORATION OF INDIA IIMITED
1. *     I submit the following report and recommelndation on a proposed
loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Limited (ICICI) with the guarantee of India for the equivalent of
US$60 million to help finance ICICI's operations over a period of two
years. Amortization will conform substantially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules applicable to the sub-loans and investments finan-
ced out of the loan now proposed. The interest rate will be 7¼ percent
per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.       Since 19491, the Bank has made 39 loans amounting to US$1 ,051
million and the Association 36 development credits amounting to US$1,551
million (both net of cancellations) to India. Of these amounts, US$678
million has been repaid and US$403 million is still undisbursed. The
share of agricultural projects in Bank/IDA operations has increased
substantially in the last two years, reflecting the high priority which
the Government accords to agriculture in the current Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1969-74)., and agricultural lending is expected to account for a
large share of future Bank Group assistance, although refinance of
infrastructure and industry will continue to be important. Support to
education and family planning is also planned, but here the scope of
lending is limited. During the remainder of this fiscal year, I expect
to be ready to present for your consideration four agricultural projects,
four industrial projects, including another development finance company
project, two transport projects, a power project and a family planning
project.
3.       ICICI, founded in 1955, has been one of the first development
banks financed by the Bank Group and an effective channel of substantial
Bank financing for Indian industry. Since 1955, the Bank has made eight
loans to ICICI totalling US$205 million. The proposed ninth loan would
provide ICICI with much of the foreign exchange required for its
operations through the end of 1973. So far, ICICI has been the only
development finance company in India supported by the Bank Group.
However, a mission is about to appraise the Industrial Development Bank
of India (IDBI), a government-owned development bank providing finance to
large private and state enterprises and to many smaller firms. Through
these two channels, Bank Group assistance should reach a wide cross-
section of Indian industry.



4.       A summary statement of loans and development credits as of
August 31, 1971, is annexed in Attachment I and shows that six loans
and 11 credits of those declared effective have not yet been fully
disbursed. Of the undisbursed loans, Loan 307-IN to the Indian Iron
and Steel Corporation (IISCO) for the development of their collieries
is very muach behind schedule. In my report to the Executive Directors
of July 9, 1970, (R 70-135), I explained the technical and organiza-
tional problems which beset this project. Since then, we have arranged
for a consultant to pay regular visits to assist IISCO and recently the
list of goods has been revised to meet the present circumstances. The
disbursement schedule referred to in my report of July 9, 1970,
indicating completion of the project by June 1974  still holds good.
5.       It was agreed in 1970 that the balance of Credit 89-IN (Beas
Equipment Project) should be allocated to Stage II of the projact and
hence major purchases will be made during 1972. In the Kadana
Irrigation Project (Credit 176-IN), the main contractor of the dam has
been suspended, having fallen badly beh:uad. As a consequence, dis-
bursements are running about a year behiind schedule, but work has now
been resumed with departmental force account labor. Disbursements under
the Sixth Industrial Imports (Credit 18°-IN) we,7e at first mnuch slower
than ori.ginally projected but they have picked up considerably in
recent months.  The closing date has been postponed from June 1971 to
December 1971, by which time the credit should be fu:lly disbursed.
6.       Of the remaining eight credits, two (Third Telecommunications
and Tenth Railways) are being disbursed on scheduile, while the remaining
six credits either have only just reached the first date scheduled for
disbursement or have yet to reach it. Three of these are for agricul-
tural credit and represent the Bank Group s first financing of agricul-
tural credit in India. The institutional and procurement arrangements
for these credits are complex and progress towards making the credits
effective and starting disbursements have been slower than expected.
However, in the case of Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 191-IN),
ordersfor the first tranche of the tractors to be supplied has recently
been approved.  In the Punjab Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 203-DN),
bids for one-half of the tractors have now been received and will shortly
be advertised to farmers. A mission visited India in September to assist
the proj ect institutions in meeting the various requirements, and I
expect that progress will improve as experience is gained in these new
and rather complex projects.
7.       There have also been delays in disbursements of the Bank's loans
to ICICI. The closing date of the Sixth (414i-IN) ICICI loan has been
Pob4tpjMed from December 31, 1969 to June 30, 1 971 and again to June 30,
1972, and the Seventh (515-IN) ICICI loan has also had to be po§ipoed
by one year. These loans were affected by the 1966-68 rereXion, which
meant a substantial lengthening of the interval between ICICI's approval
of sub-projects and the actual commitment and disbursemrAt of Bank funds.



- 3 -
However, the current outlook is better, and more rapid disbursement is
expected in fIture. In fact, the most recent loan to ICICI (Loan 683-L\O,
approved in June 1970, is expected to be fully conmitted by the end of
1971, half a year ahead of schedule.
8.       Since 1957, IFC, has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million, of which US$3.0 miLlion has been repaid, US$5.9 millinn
sold and US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$27.1 million,
US$18.9 million represents loans and US$3.2 million equity. The largest
commitment to date has been US$18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemical for a
fertilizer plant in Goa.
9.       The current project was appraised in July and August 1971 and
negotiations took place in September. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. S. S. Mehta, General Manager. The Guarantor has reviewed and approved
the proposed loan documents.
PART II - THE ECOlNOMIY
10.      An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-25 a), dated May 11, 1971, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 24, 1971. A country data sheet is at Attachment II.
11.      In the period follouing the recession  of 1966-68, the Indian
economy grew at an annual rate of about 5 percent. This reflects the
encouraging progress of agriculture, especially in foodgrain production.
Preliminary reports indicate that foodgrain production in the last crop
year reached 108 million tons, which is 8.5 percent above the level of
the preceding year. This reflects in part substantial investments in
irrigation and in the 'green revolution' which have increased the
average level of agricultural production. But weather remains an impor-
tant factor both in agriculture and - because agriculture contributes
nearly half of India's GNP - in determining overall economic growth.
12.      Manufacturing now contributes 19 percent of GNP. India's
current Five-Year Plan (1969-74) aims at an overall annual growth of 5.5
percent, and an increase in manufacturing output by about 8 to 10 percent
a year in both the organized and the small-scale industrial sectors.
Medium and large-scale industrial production rose by about 7 percent in
both 1968 and 1969. In 1970, the growth rate was just over 5 percent.
The main reasons for this setback were shortages of raw materials,
especially steel and cotton, and low public investment caused by



- h -
restrictive budget policies. In contrast sma.ll-scale firms-/ seem to
have directly benefitted from the advance of agriculture and made
considerable gains.
13.      The principal cause of concern, and an important constraint
for the future, is the low rate of investment. Net investment was
12 percent of national mncome in FY 1970 against nearly 15 percent in
FY 1966. Public sector investmefnt is held back by lack of funds, and
increases in public savings through higher taxation were insufficient
to make up for the sharp decline in net aid receipts from US$800 million
in 1966/67 to about US$300 million in 1970/71. The difficulties of
this situation have been aggravated greatly by the large influx of
refugees this year. Unless adequate assistance is,made available by
the international community, the cost of caring for the refugees could
force cutbacks of other expenditures, mostly likely public capital
expenditures.
14.      The investment climate in tlhe private sector, however, has
improved. The number of industrial liceases granted and the volume of
new capital issues have substantially increased. Associated with
these investment plans is an increased demand for imports of capital
goods, especially as Indials industry moves into areas of higher
technology.
15.      The Government has followed strict budgetary and monetary
policies in recent years and net foreign exchange reserves are now just
over one billion dollars. During 1967-71, imports (especially of food)
came down sharply, and in 1970-71, exports increased by over 8 percent.
As a result, Indiafs trade deficit has decreased from US$1.3 billion
in FY 1967 to US$130 million in FY 1971.
16.      In view of the heavy burden of India's external debt (annual
debt service is presently equivalent to some 29 percent of India's
export earnings), it is clear that as much as possible of India's ex-
ternal capital requirements should be provided on concessionary terms.
Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to India has been
and should continue to be provided from IDA. However, the amount of
IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small in
relation to India's needs for exterxTal support, and I consider it
appropriate to propose some modest Bank lending to India as long as
the Bank's net investment in India is not increased thereby. As of
August 31, 1971, the loans to India held by the Bank totalled    us $560
million, of which US$82 million remained to be disbursed leaving a
net amount outstanding of US$478 million. Considering the scheduled
repayment of principal, which in the FY 1972 will amount to some
US$55  million, and the expected pattern of disbursements, the pro-
posed loan w7ould not lead to an increase of the Bank's net investment
in India above the present figure.
1/ Defined as enterprises with total investment below the equivalent
of US$100,000.

PART III - THE PROJECT
17.      A full appraisal report recommending the eighth loan to
ICICI (R 70-95) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 21,
1970. This report showed that ICICI is a financially sound, well
managed, creditworthy institution. Because of the recent date of a
full appraisal report to the Executive Directors and the fact that
ICICI faces no major problems, a separate appraisal report is not
distributed on this occasion.   My report has therefore been expanded
to provide a fuller, self-contained evaluation.
18.      ICICI's operations since 1963 are summarized in Attachment III-1,
and have largely followed the general economic trend. The recovery of
the Indian economy and the fact that ICICI can provide finance in a
desirable form for imported equipment have led to a high level of commit-
ments: US $44 million in 1969 and US $38 million in 1970. Projects pre-
pared in 1970 and earlier this year indicate that 1971 will achieve a
record, with commitments likely to total more than US $50 mdllion.
19.      Well over half of ICICI's commitments in the past two and
one-half years have taken the form of foreign exchange loans for import
financing, totalling about US$20-30 million a year. ICICI's rupee
loan commitments have been relatively modest, although they have
increased at growth rates of better than 50 percent in recent years
(from only 10 percent of total operations in 1968 to 20 percent in 1970
and 27 percent in the first half of 1971). Furthermore, increases in
share prices over the past eighteen months and improved prospects for
dividend income and capital gains have encouraged ICICI to place more
emphasis than before on equity investments.
Resources
20.      For rupee resources, ICICI has relied principally on the
public sector - initially the Government and later IDBI. Twenty-three
percent of ICICI's resources as of June 30, 1971, had come from these
sources. In addition, ICICI increased its share capital in 1967 (by
50 percent to Rs. 75 million) and floated two debenture issues, Rs. 60
million in 1967 and Rs. 50 million in 1969. ICICI's own equity now
accounts for 8 percent, and debentures for an additional 6 percent, of
ICICI's total available resources and foreign exchange borrowings
contribute a further 63 percent. The Bank has been the main provider;
the Kreditanstalt fuAr Wiederaufbau(KfW) was another significant source.



- 6 -
Three recent IDBI loans to ICICI, against which ICICI's borrowers can
obtain licenses for imports frcm the United Kingdom, provided
together Z3 million. Efforts to obtain other funds from abroad on
suitable terms have not yet met with success, but are ccntinuing.
Attachment III-2 details the resources invested, or available for
investment, by ICICI as of June 30, 1971.
Ownership
21.      For most of its existence, ICICI has been the only private
institution in India providing long-term financing for industry and
operating on a national basis. With the nationalization in 1969 of
India's 14 major commercial banks (eight of which are shareholders of
ICICI, and more recently of the general insurance canpanies, public
sector entities now hold just over 60 percent of ICICI's capital.
Other shareholders include foreign institutions in France, Germany,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States which together hold
approximately 30 percent of the capital (Attachment III-3).
Board, Management and Staff
22.      The composition of ICICI's Board of Directors is shown in
Attachment III-4. Mr. G. L. Mehta, Chairman of the Board since 1958,
has resigned and will retire from his post at the end of 1971. He will
continue to be associated with ICICI as an Adviser to the Board of
Directors. Mqr. Mehta's successor will be Mr. H. T. Parekh, now the
Deputy Chairman and Managing Director, who has been with ICICI since
its inception. ICICI's experienced management can rely on a competent
staff, which now numbers 253, including about 120 professionals.
Recent staff additions have been used largely to develop ICICI's work
on eccnomics, statistics, and market research. ICICI's two branch
offices in Calcutta and Madras, opened in 1969, have served principally
to relieve Bombay headquarters in project follow-up; recently,
however, both branches have become more involved in project appraisal,
often assisted by technical staff from Bombay.
Procedures
23.      Project Appraisal.  ICICI's project appraisals continue to
center on the engineering and financial aspects of investment projects
and are competently handled. Marketing prospects are being covered
with more care than in earlier years, although domestic sales receive
a more thorough treatment than exports.  Recently, ICICI has sharpened
its analysis of the eccnomic merits of the projects it supports, for
example, by examining the level of effective protection required.
During loan negotiations, ICICI has agreed that these more sophisticated
approaches to economic analysis will be continued ccnsistently and
further refined in ICICI's future project work.



24.      Follo1J-Up.  In the last three years project supervision has
been handled more systematically and effectively than before. In
addition to the careful compilation and evaluation of progress data,
projects are visited often during construction and when in operation;
projects in difficulties are supervised closely by ICICI's staff. With
the recent strengthening of ICICI's economic and statistical staff, ICICI
is able to keep in touch with general developments in industry in India.
25.      Procurement Practices and Disbursement Procedure.  ICICI urges
its borrowers to procure equipment on the best terms. Although it does
not require them to go through a formal bidding procedure, ICICI
generally insists that its clients obtain quotations from at least
three or four firms of international reputation from different
countries. While evaluating alternative quotations, ICICI takes into
consideration not only quoted prices but also the supplier's reputation,
service, facilities, quality and delivery period. Where a foreign
partner of ICICI's Indian client has the right to suggest the source
of supply, ICICI asks the client to obtain quotations for similar
equipment in order to judge the reasonableness of the price. ICICI's
disbursement procedures are sound.
Business Policies and Practices
26.      ICICI has broad policy guidelines set by its Board. It aims
at financing firms using the newrer technologies and in this it has been
successful. In the past two years, ICICI has faced a considerable
upsurge in the demand for loans, a sizeable portion of which were for
projects referred to ICICI by the Government's Capital Goods Committee,
which has to approve most investment imports. Consequently, ICICI did
not have to make special efforts to seek business. Through work with
other term-financing institutions and through stepping up assistance to
small firms, ICICI has attempted in recent years to contribute effective-
ly to the general policy objectives of the Indian Government. Similarly,
further emphasis has been placed on supporting industrial development
in India's backward areas and in sectors of industry requiring special
effort. These efforts are only just beginning to pay off. Another
measure to expand ICICI's activities was a decision taken late in 1969,
to finance partnerships and proprietary concerns; previously only
limited companies were accepted as clients. As a result, there has
been a considerable increase in ICICI's small loans.



- 8 -
27.     ICICI pursues its long standing policy of not investing in
equity for quick yields and marketability, but rather because of the
longer term economic and financial m.erits of a project. ICICI has
been prepared to take the riskrs of undernriting share issues even for
new industrialists who would not otherwise have been able to go to
the market. As to lending, ICICI raised its interest rates in 1970;
on foreign currency loans fran 8½12 to 9 percent and on its rupee loans
from 8 to 8-2 percent.  Loans are usually secured by first mortgages and
bank guarantess. Exercising a right it seeks wnen project considerations
justify such a course, ICICI has representatives on the boards of
twenty-four companies. Normally, IGIC uses outsiders rather than ICICI
staff to represent it on boards.
Characteristics and Impact of I0ICI's Gperations
28.     ICI0I's clients have made substantial contributions to the
increase in India's industrial capacity: its clients account for 100
percent of capacity ir. aluminum and in automobiles, the bulk of PVC,
80 percent of textile machinery, 75 percent of cement and 60 percent of
paper.  Given the sophisticated nature of the industrial sectors supported
by ICICI, it is not surprising that about one-half of the projects,
and the amounts committed, concern ventures linKed to foreign firms.
29.     ICICI finarncing, like that of other national financial
institutions in 1India, remains heavily concentrated in West India,
especially in Gujarat and iMiaharashtra. But, I00CI has had some success
in spreading its finance to the iorth, spec-fically to Uttar Pradesh and
to Haryana, reflecting rapid development of metal working and agricultural
implement production, and to Bihar, where steel and automobile projects
have expanded.
30.     Clients' Performance. Attachment II-5 summarizes important
aspects of the econoiidc and financial performace of ICICI's clients.
Iost sectors improved their results in 1970. Projects with a return in
excess of 10 percent on capital invested accounted for about 85 percent
of 1OII0's total portfolio; this is a considerable irmprcvemert over the
situation in previous years.   (Only about 60 percent of ICICI's borrowers
had a return of over 10 percent in 1969). ICICI estimates that total
exports by its clients daring 1970 have been over Rs. 1.2 billion (US
$160 million), or 14.5 percent of india's industrial exports, a satisfact-
ory proportion.
31.     Because of ICICI's involvement in more modern and capital-
intensive industrial sectors, the investment per job created in iCICI
projects is quite lhigh by Indian standards. It averages Rs. 42,300
(us $5,65o) of investment incurred for every job which was created by



- 9 -
ICICI projects in recent years. The direct creation of jobs in each
of the last three years resulting from ICICT-financed projects has been
about 16,000 annually. ICIC1 has estimated that since its inception in
1955, the projects it has financed have created a total of about 228,000
jobs, which represents over 5 percent of industrial employment in
factories employing over 25 workers in India and 11 percent of employ-
ment created in industry since 1955.
32.     As in earlier years, ICICI has given effective support to
Indian industry and its achievements are viewed with critical respect
by the Government and the business community. I0ICI has maintained a
close relationship with the Government, without impairing its independ-
ence.
Portfolio and Financial Position
33.     Loan and Equity Portfolio.  ICICI's portfolio outstanding on
June 30, 1971, included Rs. 1,029 million in loans, Rs. 133 mnillion in
debentures and Rs. 157 million in equities.   Its quality has improved
in the past 18 months. Arrears on learns have decreased, and many
borrowers previously in trouble have recovered fromn the recession in the
mid-sixties   Only 5 loans with an outstajnding amnount of Rs. 10 million
are to companies likely to ace continued difficulti-es or to close down.
These loans are well secured by first mortgages. All debentures held
by IICI are in first-class companies and constitute quiclkly marketable
instruments should cash needs arise.  The quality of 0CICI's equity port-
folio, is, on the whole, good. Losses on doubtf'ul equity investments
would probably be offset by capital gains if 10ICI decided to sell more
of its good investments.
34.     ICICI0 s auditors, the firms N. h. Raiji and Ray and Ray, estimated
ICICI's doubtful accounts at Rs. 5.4 milion at the end of 1970; this
amount was edequately covered by ICICI's provision for bad debts (Rs.9.0
mi.llion).
35.     Profitability and Financial Position.   ICICI's Income Statements
for 1967-70 and for the first six months of 1271 are shown in Attachment
TII-6 and Balance Sheets in Attachment II-7. As in previous years, the
auditors certified ICII's 1970 financial statements without qualification.
ICICI's 1970 net profits were 9 percent higher than 1969, reaching
27 percent of share capital and 14 percent of net worth.   I0ICI has been
paying dividends since 1956.  For the years 1966 to 1969, it paid 9
percent annually; in 1970 ICICI increased its dividend to 10 percent.
The payout ratio has been modest (37 percent in 1970) and 0ICIG has,
therefore, been able to add sizeably to reserves, IICI0's financial
position is sound. Reserves stood, at the end of 1970, at 6.5 percent
of ICICI0 s portfolio, compared with 5.4 percent at the end of 1969 and
4.6 percent at the end of 1968.



- 10 -
36.      Since the end of 1969, the quotation of ICICI's shares on
the Bombay Stock Exchange has increased from Rs. 111 to Rs. 118 on
September 27, 1971, at which price the share yield amounted to 8.5
percent. This price compares favorably wfith shares of Indian private
investment companies traded in the market, wich have yields ranging
between 9 and 12 percent.
Operational Prospects
37.      Economic and institutional factors augur well for a further
significant growth in ICICI's operations in the next five years. These
factors include four consecutive good crop years, booming small-scale
industry, pressure on Indian industry to develop more sophisticated
products, and demand considerably in excess of capacity for certain
steel, machinery, food items and some chemical products.
38.      Against this background, and supported by a sizeable number of
projects under study, ICICI forecasts future commitments to rise at an
average of about 14 percent per year in the period 1970-75, with a growth
of 24 percent in 1971-72. Given the foreign currency commitments already
made in 1971 (US$15.7 million), the expansion of rupee business, and the
general outlook, ICICI's forecastis (Attachment III-8) appear reasonable.
Resource Requirements
39.      Looking ahead from June 1971, 101C1 has to raise fresh resources
totalling the equivalent of nearly US$270 million to carry out its
business forecast until the end of 1975. In the period until the end
of 1973, ICICI will need to raise about US$130 million, of which US$73
million is required to finance imports.
40.      Foreign exchange loan ccmmitments are estimated at a total of
US$178 million. Commitments expected before the end of 1973 amount to
US$94.5 million, of which US$38 million are projects already approved by
ICICI's Board and US$18 million under active c cnsideration. The bulk
of these projects has received the necessary clearance from the
Government. A summary of ICICI's expected commitments of foreign
currency loans, and relevant sources of finance, till the end of 1973,
follows (in $ million):

Additional amount required         2            35      36        73
41.      In accordance with its recent borrowing pattern, ICICI expects
to have an additional US$8 million from KfW and UK available for
commitments in 1972 and 1973. ICICI is also hoping to obtain limited
amounts of foreign exchange from other foreign banks, possibly about
US$5 million to be utilized in the next two years. ICICI would probably
have to pay more for such borrowings, possibly 81- percent per annum
(for a term of about 5-7 years) than for loans from the Bank. For an
institution such as ICICI, which has already reached a high degree
of maturity and proficiency, it is appropriate, after 16 years of
activity, for it to try to enter the inteniational capital market. The
Bank is encouraging such an entry, even if it means, in respect of a
relatively small amount, somewhat heavier balance of payment consequences
for India, as it is important for ICICI to establish its name and credit
abroad. The proposed US$60 million loan would cover a substantial
proportion of the amount needed by ICICI to finance its forecast import
financing commitments to the end of 1973.
42.      To cover rupee commitments projected for the period June 30,
1971 to December 31, 1975 (Rs. 825 million), ICICI would have available
about Rs. 275 million from net loan collections, sales of securities and
net cash generation. For the remaining Rs. 550 million, ICICI will have
to look to outside sources. ICICI plans to increase its share capital
by Rs. 25 million (one-third) in 1971, and by another Rs. 25 million in
1975. The first share increase is already at an advanced stage of
preparation and will be paid-in in two installments, in October 1971
and January 1972. Most Indian shareholders have expressed their
intention to take part in the share issue and also any portion which
foreign shareholders may not take up. ICICI will have to borrow the
remaining Rs. 500 million needed to cover commitments forecast through



- 12 -
1975. This is substantial borrowing, and ICICI wJill have to make a
ccnsiderable effort to achieve it.  Preparatory work for a debent-Lre
issue of Rs. 100 miiillion in 1972, is starting now. Given the reactions
already ascertained from several potential investors, ICICI expects
that the issue will be well received. ICICI is planning to raise a
further Rs. 140 million in 1973, Rs. 150 million in 1974 and Rs. 140
million in 1975, of which Rs. 30 million to cover comnnitments in 1976.
Financial Projections
43.      ICICI's projected income statements, balance sheets and cash
flow (Attachments III 9-11) based on its business forecasts indicate an
adequate debt service coverage, a sound financial position and a
satisfactory profitability. ICICI's debt service coverage will not be
below 1.2 througlh the life of the Bank loan, and interest coverage will
not drop below 1.4-  ICICI's liquidity will remain strong, with a
current ratio of about 2:1 and with a large additional cushion of
marketable securities. Net profits are projected to increase annually
by 10 percent and reach 12.5 percent of average net worth by 1975.
44.      Even with the expected expansion of ICICI's net worth and with
the share capital increase of one-third projected for 1971, ICICI is
likely on its business forecast, to reach in 1973 the debt limit of
9:1 established in the 1967 Loan Agreement. The present limit of 9:1
provides sufficient leverage for ICICI to remain profitable and to
obtain additional share capital when it needs it. It is planned,
therefore, to maintain the existing limit.  ICICI is, thus likely to
have to move forward its plans for a share increase in 1975 to 1973.
45.      In summary,, ICICI remains a creditworthy borrower and an
effective financial intermediary, deserving of continued Bank support.
Onlending Terms
46.      The use of the proposed loan would be limited to foreign
exchange expenditures. The terms of the proposed loan would follow
those of recent Banlc loans to development finance companies, including
the standard comritment charge. The ccnditions of the proposed loan
would be identical to the provisions of the last Bank loan to ICICI
(683-IN). Estimated quarterly loan disbursements are shoan in
Attachment III-12.

PART IV  - LEGAL INST m MET AND AUTHORITY
47.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between India and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans to development
finance companies.
48.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V  - RECONMIENDATION
49.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
