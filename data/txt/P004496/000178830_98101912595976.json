The project\n            aims at reducing infrastructure bottlenecks to economic\n            development in the project cities, providing basic urban\n            services, and improving the project management capabilities\n            of the cities and the participating Government agencies. The\n            project includes: (a) construction, rehabilitation or\n            upgrading of urban roads and the provision of road\n            maintenance equipment and vehicles; (b) improvements in\n            drainage, solid wastes management and sanitation; (c)\n            provision or upgrading of municipal enterprise facilities\n            including markets, slaughterhouses, bus terminals and a\n            livelihood zone; (d) improvement of shelter conditions\n            through the provision of about 16,500 serviced and upgraded\n            plots benefitting about 133,000 people, about 660 serviced\n            plots for small businesses generating employment for about\n            6,500 people, and building materials loans for residential\n            structures; and (e) technical assistance for project\n            implementation, institutional strengthening and preparation\n            of future projects."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
