Some lessons learned included: early\n            diagnosis and immediate treatment of malaria to reduce\n            mortality is a cost-effective intervention for reducing the\n            burden of malaria. It should be the centerpiece of any\n            malaria control strategy. Focused application of\n            insecticides for vector control based on the epidemiological\n            stratification by municipalities and by community, according\n            to levels of risk of malaria transmission, offers an\n            efficient and environment friendly alternative to\n            traditional widespread insecticide application for vector\n            eradication. Management contracts, performance indicators,\n            monitoring, supervision, and evaluation are crucial to\n            successful project implementation. Active Bank supervision\n            at state and municipal level, as well as at the federal\n            level, reinforced the need for decentralized management and\n            accountability. Competent and stable project management is\n            necessary for continuity of the project in a changing\n            political environment. In the early 1990s political\n            appointees in a volatile political environment almost\n            brought the project to a halt. Government commitment is key\n            for the project. States with more committed governors were\n            more successful than others. At the federal level, strong\n            support by the minister between 1993 and 1995 accelerated\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1997-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
