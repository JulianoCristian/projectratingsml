The project comprises\n            two components: (i) a malaria control program supporting\n            epidemiological and entomological surveillance, treatment of\n            cases, source reproduction projects, vector control,\n            education activities, and endemic disease control activities\n            in Amerindian areas; and (ii) institutional strengthening of\n            SUCAM focussing on in-service training, district offices,\n            computerized information systems, operational research, and\n            inter-institutional actions."}, "docdt": "1989-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
