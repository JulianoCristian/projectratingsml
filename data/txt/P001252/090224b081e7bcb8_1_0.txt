Section, Article and Schedules shall be read, respectively, "Bank"
and "Loan".

long as the Bank has not given notice to the contrary to the
Borrower: (i) the obligations of the Borrower to consult with and

over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution
of foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of
such member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any
public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any
external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the
benefit of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation,
realization or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall,
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost
to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in
creating or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make
express provision to that effect; provided, however, that if for


﻿- 9 -
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be
made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of its
political or administrative subdivisions, the Borrower shall
promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on
other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
(ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking
transactions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year
after its date; and (iii) any charges on the General Fund of the
East African Community (hereinafter called the Community) securing
a debt of the Community where the amount of the debt service on
such debt in any financing year together with other debt service
on other debt of the Community payable from such General Fund in
such financial year does not exceed 2% of the average of customs
duties and excise duties collected by the East African Customs
and Excise Department in the three financial years preceding such
incurrence. For the purposes of this paragraph, "debt service"
shall include payments of the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, debt; and any reference to incurring of debt
