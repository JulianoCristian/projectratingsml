   development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: favorable national regulatory\n            frameworks and policy instruments for biogas development and\n            livestock pollution control provided legal ground and\n            financial incentives for a successful project\n            implementation. Stakeholders' commitment, dedication,\n            and capabilities are critical to ensure project success,\n            sustainability, and ownership. Despite attractive financial\n            returns and positive social and environmental benefits of\n            the project investment, up-front significant subsidies as\n            financial incentives are required to share the initial\n            capital cost of the project facilities to help mobilize\n            household participation. One of the key reasons for the\n            smooth operation of the clean development mechanism (CDM)\n            pilot program was the integration of the CDM operations into\n            the Bank loan investment project."}, "docdt": "2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
