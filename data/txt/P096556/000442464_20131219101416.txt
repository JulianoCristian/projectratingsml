                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

This Project Paper introduces the following changes in P096556- China Eco-farming
Project financed under loans IBRD-07604 & IBRD 07605. The present restructuring does
not require an amendment to the project’s legal documents.

The main item proposed for adjustment is to increase the sub-financing reimbursement
amount of household package unit costs. The proposed changes have become necessary
due to a sharp increase in project costs and the devaluation of the US dollar that has
reduced the total amount of RMB available for the project financing.

The project development objective (PDO) remains unchanged after restructuring. Targets
at the outcome level will not need to be revised. The revised number of beneficiaries
(443, 958 households in total) will remain within the PAD target of 400,000-500,000
households and the intended demonstration effect of the project would remain the same.


B. PROJECT STATUS

The China Eco-Farming Project became effective in May 2009 and the current closing
date is June 30 2014. The PDO is to deliver direct environmental and economic benefits
from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In addition,
the project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and
reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas. The project covers Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, Chongqing Municipality, Anhui, Hunan and Hubei (Enshi
Prefecture) Provinces. As of March 30, 2013, about USD70.11 million (58.4%) of the
Bank loan of USD120 million has been disbursed. Disbursement is slow relative to total
cumulative expenditure which is reported at approximately 80% of total project
investment by December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the reported cumulative
investment completion progress for Component 1 (Integrated Eco-farming Systems) was
84%, for Component 2 (Local Technical Extension and Biogas service Systems) 70%,
and for Component 3 (Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation) 50%.

Project adjustments are required due to an increase in unit costs for many activities
compared to those estimated at project design, notably unit costs have increased for labor
and construction materials (bricks, pipes, sand and cement). Average unit costs for “1+3”
activities1 among the five provinces have increased from RMB3,160 to RMB5,308, a
68% increase. The cost of road improvements, training and study tours have also risen
considerably. The US dollar has depreciated significantly against the RMB from 1:6.8 in
2008 during project appraisal (at which time the World Bank loan of USD120 million
converted to RMB820 million) to 1:6.3 in December 2012 (converting to RMB756

 They refer to activities of one biogas system construction plus three improvements, i.e. animal shed
improvement, kitchen improvement and toilet improvement.
                                                     4
million). This depreciation of US dollar against RMB has resulted in a reduction of the
RMB equivalent of the available loan amount.

As a result, the amount of reimbursement for household package unit costs in Anhui need
to be changed from USD229 to USD320, in Guangxi from USD209 to USD305, in
Hunan from USD230 to USD261 and in Hubei from USD98 to USD240. The level of
increase is determined by the availability of government counterpart funds and pressure
of household’s contribution. In Hubei, the increase of 144 % is to increase household
package size from covering only the biodigester only to also improving kitchen, animal
shed and toilet, as the other four provinces do. Chongqing will not change the
reimbursement amount as the municipal government agrees to cover the increased costs
with counterpart funds.

After consultations with relevant central government and local offices, it is concluded
that no additional World Bank funding would be available for the project and additional
government counterpart funding would only partially cover the RMB shortage and the
cost increases. Restructuring of the Project is thus required due to a reduction in the
existing project financing envelope.

The change to the amount of the household package unit costs will become effective
retroactively as of January 1, 2012, as the application of the new rates is needed for
Anhui and Guangxi to reduce the burden of the beneficiaries due to the increased unit
costs and to use the loan fairly and efficiently. The amount of difference against the
expenditures that were paid by the Bank according to the old rates since 2012 is
estimated about USD 2.4 million in total (Anhui: USD 1.3 million and Guangxi: USD 1.1
million).


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Project’s Development Objectives
    The PDO remains unchanged.

Results/Indicators
    While the PDO remains unchanged, some of the targets of the Intermediate Results
     Indicators have to be adjusted to reflect the impact of price increases and exchange
     rate changes (see Annex 1).

Components

              Adjustment in the Number of “1+3” Households. The total number of
               beneficiary households will reduce by 94,692 (17.6%) from an original
               total of 538,650 to 443,958. This change occurs as a result of increased
               unit costs, depreciation of the US Dollar, and unchanged total amount of
               World Bank loan. Household numbers will be reduced from 80,850 to
               62,850 in Guangxi, from 92,800 to 79,808 in Anhui, from 90,000 to
               86,000 in Hunan, and from 200,000 to 140,300 in Hubei. There will be no
               changes in household numbers in Chongqing which remain at 75,000.
                                           5
Safeguards
    The proposed restructuring will not result in any changes regarding safeguards.
     The current safeguard arrangements will be applicable for the remainder of the
     project.

Institutional Arrangements
     Current institutional arrangements will not be affected by the restructuring.

Financing

     Project Costs. The total amount of World Bank loan will not changed (USD120
      million). The total project investment will increase from the PAD investment target
      of USD439.8 m (RMB2.62 billion) to USD460.8 m (RMB 2.9 billion) due to
      project cost increases and exchange rate changes. The total increase in USD
      equivalent is 4.8%.

Total Costs to be Financed                                 439,752       460,836        4.8

o     Financing Plan. The counterpart funding will be increased by 17.4 % from
      RMB1.754 billion to RMB2.06 billion. The total amount of the incremental
      investment costs will be covered by T-bond projects, project provinces
      (municipality), counties and project beneficiary households.

o     Disbursement arrangements. Unit costs will be adjusted for “1+3” activities.

      The incremental cost for “1+3” activities in Anhui, Chongqing, Guangxi, Hubei
      and Hunan in 2012 is RMB4,994, RMB4,949, RMB5,756, RMB5,113, and
      RMB5,730 respectively, representing an increase of 58%, 56%, 78 %, 70% and
      73%. As a result of this change, increasing the amount of reimbursement cost from
      the World Bank is needed to reduce the pressure on government and beneficiaries
      in providing counterpart funds.

      The sub-financing amount for the integrated household package in Anhui needs to
      be changed from USD229 to USD320 and for Guangxi from USD209 to USD305,
      Hunan from USD230 to USD261 and Hubei from USD98 to USD240. Chongqing
      will not change the reimbursement amount as the municipal government agreed to
      cover the increased costs using counterpart funds.

o     Reallocations. There are no reallocations of loan proceeds.

                                                6
o       Cancellations. There are no cancellations.

Financial management
    The changes described above will require corresponding changes in the project’s
     Financial Management Manuals.

Procurement
    There will be no procurement adjustments. Current procurement arrangements will
     not be affected by the restructuring.

Closing Date
    There is no change in the project closing date which remains June 30, 2014.

Implementation Schedule
    There are no changes in the project implementation schedule.

Others
       Nil.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

The Technical, Institutional, and Safeguards Aspects of the project will not be affected
as this restructuring would not involve any new project activities or institutional
arrangements other than already designed at appraisal. The restructuring will also not
trigger any new safeguard policies and will not affect the current Environmental Risk
Category B. The project is consistent will all applicable Bank policies and will not
require any exceptions.

However, the economic return of the project has been re-estimated under the above cost
increase and restructuring scenario.

Economic analysis. The major factor causing a change in the economic viability of the
project is the disproportional increase in input prices. While input prices have often
doubled or tripled (e.g. labor and construction material), output prices have gone up at
much slower rate. Key outputs such as grain or fruits have increased by a rate of 20-80
percent. Meanwhile, the operation of biogas systems can save farmer’s labor input
usually required for collecting firewood and the costs of providing fuels such as coal and
liquefied gas; as a result the investment in biogas will be more economic valuable due to
increased cost of labor and fuels2. Using the appraisal assumptions in terms of
incremental yields and production the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the biogas
systems, agricultural activities and the whole project is estimated to drop from 3 to 8
percentage points respectively as detailed below.

 CO2 is an exception. The reduction of CO2 emissions is one of the important outputs of a biogas system.
But price for CO2 emission reduction has declined in recent years.

Risks. The achievement of the primary outcome of the project is not jeopardized. In
addition, the nature of the project as a learning project will not be affected. The project
would still demonstrate a comprehensive approach to integrating biogas development
with farm production systems, including biogas technology solutions and biogas-related
on-farm investments; institutional strengthening of biogas service and extension systems;
technician and farmer capacity building; and improved M&E systems at local levels.

However, there have been significant increases in the cost of materials and skilled and
unskilled rural labor since project design. These trends are likely to continue in the near
future. Currency exchange rate risks could still affect the project’s financial situation
after restructuring. To mitigate such risks, a conservative assumption about the future
value of the Bank loan has been made and the increase funding per household of the
government’s National Rural Biogas, with which the project is integrated, will partially
mitigate the rise in costs. Otherwise, the originally identified project-specific risks and
their ratings still apply.

        The revised targets are at least 4 times larger than the PAD targets for this indicator, due to the fact that the PAD targets were based on number of farmers trained
