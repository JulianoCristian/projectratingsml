In\n            addition, the project aims to reduce greenhouse gas\n            emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of\n            coal and firewood in the project areas. This restructuring\n            will bring the following changes: (i) some of the targets of\n            the intermediate results indicators have to be adjusted to\n            reflect the impact of price increases and exchange rate\n            changes; (ii) the total number of beneficiary households\n            will reduce by 94,692 (17.6 percent) from an original total\n            of 538,650 to 443,958; (iii) the total project investment\n            will increase from the project appraisal document (PAD)\n            investment target of United States dollar (USD) 439.8\n            million (m) (Chinese currency (RMB) 2.62 billion) to USD\n            460.8 m (RMB 2.9 billion) due to project cost increases and\n            exchange rate changes; and (iv) the counterpart funding will\n            be increased by 17.4 percent from RMB1.754 billion to\n            RMB2.06 billion."}, "docdt": "2013-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
