                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To deliver direct environmental and economic benefits from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In addition, the project aims to reduce
                         greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is for the Sixth SPN Mission. The mission visited 2 of 5 project provinces, and 5 of the 64 project counties.

                         Project implementation has accelerated since the 5th Supervision Mission with 60% of the overall PAD investment cost completed and overall implementation quality of works
                         continues to be satisfactory. However, the status of project physical and investment progress varies from province to province and Chongqing lags behind in both investment

                         implementation quality. Overall investment progress of Components 1 (Integrated Ecofarming Systems – biogas systems, farm production, rural roads and other infrastructure) and 2
                         (Local Technical Extension and Biogas Service Systems) are in reasonable balance (except in Chongqing). Such balance is necessary so that households have the necessary
                         technical skills and support systems to properly use the biogas systems and obtain maximum benefit from them. However, investment completion and implementation of Component

                         3 (Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation) is seriously lagging in Chongqing, Anhui and Hunan.

                         Linked with ( or as part of ) the Eco-farming lending project, the Eco-Farming Biogas CDM Project implementation was progressing well over past months. The Emission Reduction
                         Credits were issued by the UNFCCC and the first payment down to the households has been processed in August 2011.
