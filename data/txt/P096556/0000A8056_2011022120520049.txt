                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To deliver direct environmental and economic benefits from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In addition, the project aims to
                         reduce greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas.
