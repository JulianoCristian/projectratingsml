                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To deliver direct environmental and economic benefits from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In addition, the project aims to reduce
                         greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports the implementation progress after the Sixth SPN Mission. The next supervision mission is scheduled for late May, 2013.

                         Project implementation has accelerated since the 6th Supervision Mission with 80% of the overall PAD investment cost completed and overall implementation quality of works
                         continues to be satisfactory and over 350,000 rural households are benefiting from the improvement on their living environment and production conditions, cost saving for fertilizers,

                         and improved yields. However, the disbursement for the last four months was still slower than expected with actual disbursement rate about 5%. With only fourteen months left
                         before project closing on June 30, 2014, it is critical for the central PMO and local PMOs to speed up further the project implementation and reimbursement.
