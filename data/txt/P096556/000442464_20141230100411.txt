H. Restructuring (if any)
A level 2 restructuring was approved by the acting Country Director for China in April 2013. The key
adjustment introduced was to increase the sub-financing reimbursement amount of household package
unit costs for all project provinces except Chongqing (see section 1.7) without Bank loan proceeds
reallocation among expenditure categories. Some intermediate outcome indicators were also modified
accordingly.
I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 Country and Sector Background. China's rapid economic development was
accompanied by serious degradation of the environment affecting many areas and having
its origins in several sectors, including agriculture. Intensive and mechanized farming,
desertification, natural disasters, over-use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and the
rapid growth in livestock production were already beginning to take a toll on the resource
base. Although there was significant migration out of farming to urban areas, millions of
households still derive their livelihoods from agriculture, and their well-being and
prospects for the future depend on the improved management of the natural resource base.
1.1.2 The intensification of Chinese agriculture was characterized by a shift to higher-
valued crops, many of which are more nutrient-demanding and susceptible to pests than
traditional crops. This resulted in an increase in use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizer
which was starting to meet increasing consumer resistance in China. The rapid expansion
of livestock production, while being interpreted as a generator of rural income and
employment, also posed an environmental challenge in terms of waste disposal.
1.1.3 Although small farm households traditionally gathered firewood for fuel,
substitution by coal for wood was increasingly taking place. Intensified use of both fuels
had obvious environmental consequences: deforestation and air pollution respectively. In
addition to more widely recognized atmospheric pollution, coal’s pollution was also
apparent indoors, affecting households’ health and general welfare. Both fuels also made
for slow cooking, and wood was time-consuming to collect.
1.1.4 The Government of China saw biogas utilization as a means of improving the
lives of rural households and addressing environmental degradation. Biogas could easily
emerge as an alternative fuel that is clean, cheap, requires no time-consuming collection,
providing quick heat, and offered biogas slurry as a cheap source of natural fertilizer, rich
in nutrients and organic matter. Households’ conversion of animal manure and other
wastes to biogas reduced emissions of methane into the atmosphere. Until 2008, China’s
biogas production from human, animal and other organic wastes had received strong
government promotion and accompanying subsidies because it was seen to have
significant local environmental benefits, among other positive externalities. A large
National Rural Biogas Program (NRBP) was launched in 2001 with total investments by
the time of project preparation of more than US$440 million. By 2007, more than 750
large- and medium-size biogas projects had been completed and a total of 7.2 million
rural households were cooking using biogas.
1.1.5 It was anticipated that during the 11th Five-Year plan about US$7.3 billion would
be invested in rural biogas development in China, through central government grant
programs (estimated at US$1.9 billion), local government grant programs,
internationally-financed programs (such as those supported by the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank - ADB) and private investments. With the commitment of the




                                             1
government to building the “new socialist countryside 2 ”, biogas was a particularly
attractive option because it could deliver both social and economic benefits to rural
residents and also address environmental degradation issues simultaneously.
1.1.6 This project strategy was to operate at the interface of these rural agriculture-
related development issues, in continuing to, and intensifying, harnessing livestock waste
and crop residues to generate biogas as an energy source. It also proposed farm-level
integrated management to support biogas production as a means of improving the lives
and livelihoods of rural households. Based on the lessons learned during the two earlier
major biogas campaigns, the government had invested in applied research, formulating
rules and regulations, improving the technical design and quality, creating technical
standards, and establishing centers to train and certify technicians. These measures had
improved the construction and service systems. However, the sustainability of the biogas
investments was hindered by inadequate support systems, especially at the post-
installation stage such as technical support for sustainable operation and maintenance of
the systems. Systematic and quantifiable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) indicators
were also required to be developed to assess the economic, social and environmental
benefits of the proposed multi-billion dollar government-led biogas development
program.
1.1.7 Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project was consistent with two strategic
areas of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (2006-2010) for China. First, it aimed
to manage resource scarcity and environmental challenges by contributing to improved
land management and energy use and to protection of global environmental commons.
Second, it aspired to reduce poverty, inequality and social exclusion by promoting
sustainable income increase in rural areas. Overall, the project would contribute to the
development of social infrastructure, energy security and enhancement of rural
livelihoods – in line with the development objectives in the Government’s 11th Five-Year
Plan.
1.1.8 Bank engagement in the project would assist the government in developing and
testing approaches that will enhance biogas impacts and the methods to monitor them at
the local level. The project would combine the use of Bank funds with the NRBP funds.
Technical innovations would include demonstrations of how to better integrate biogas
into on-farm production systems, and the establishment of systematic M&E processes at
local level. An activity attempting to utilize carbon finance for household-level biogas
development was to be piloted in parallel to the main project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
1.2.1 Project Development Objective. The project development objectives were: (a)
to deliver direct environmental and economic benefits from the integration of biogas in
farming and cooking for rural households in the project areas; and (b) to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of coal and
firewood in the project areas.



2 The concept of building a “new socialist countryside” incorporates investments in infrastructure, health, and

education, social development and a grassroots democratization process.


                                                           2
1.2.2 Key Indicators of Project Performance. The project had three main PDO
indicators:
   (a) Improved quality of life in the targeted households;
   (b) Increased disposable income for targeted households; and
   (c) Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
1.2.3 The project’s main private benefits consisted of the project households’ reduced
expenditures for energy, saved time and improved living conditions. The households
would also benefit from savings on chemical fertilizer purchases, improved agricultural
practices and increased farm productivity. The main public benefits included reduced
greenhouse gas emissions and increased carbon recycling through the reduced use of coal
and biomass for energy.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
1.3.1 Neither the PDO nor its indicators were revised during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 Project primary target groups comprised the following:
   (a) Project households receiving the bio-bas development package. Between 400,000-
       500,000 households were to benefit from significantly improved quality of life
       demonstrated by much improved living conditions and increased household
       revenue.
   (b) Project households under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Pilot
       Program in Enshi prefecture of Hubei province. About 33,000 households, in
       addition to the benefits listed above, were to also benefit from trading of certified
       emission reductions (CERs) to further increase revenue as well as awareness and
       knowledge of CDM programs.
   (c) Local technical extension and biogas service technicians. This group was to
       benefit from improved service system and facilities, renewed knowledge and
       skills through training; and increased revenue from increased demand for services
       e.g. biogas system construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), trouble
       shooting and training.
   (d) National, local governments and their officials in Project Management Offices
       (PMOs). These agencies would have enhanced their capacities and skills in
       introducing innovative project design; in supporting efficient project
       implementation; and in regulating and monitoring an integrated and innovative
       project.

       financing). This component consisted of two sub-components: A. Integrated


                                            3
       Household Systems. Biogas systems (digesters, stoves and related equipment)
       were to be installed in households. Related household infrastructure (animal sheds,
       toilets and kitchens) were to be built or rehabilitated. Investments comprised
       integrated biogas-farm production packages, improvements to related farm
       infrastructure and production systems (e.g., new varieties of crops, and orchard
       rehabilitation). The combination of these investments would lead to improved
       quality and efficiency of farm production, including partial substitution of
       chemical fertilizer and pesticides with biogas residue. Linked with this component,
       a CDM Pilot Program was developed to: (i) demonstrate technical and
       methodological approaches for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) at the household
       level; and (ii) pilot a carbon credit trading process for household-based GHG
       emissions in eight counties of Enshi prefecture in Hubei province. B. Community
       Development. To achieve maximum benefit from the integration of biogas with
       farm production, limited investments in rural water supply and village roads - as
       needed – were to be supported. Investments in water supply would enhance the
       impact on household health. Investments in rural roads would assist in optimizing
       the farm production system. A participatory planning process was to be
       implemented for the community development activities to ensure that household
       and community priorities are reflected in activity selection.
   (b) Component 2: Local Technical Extension and Biogas Service System (US$ 15
       million, 52% IBRD financing). This component consisted of two sub-
       components: A. Service System Improvement. This aimed to improve the
       effectiveness of the biogas service system by financing refurbishment of service
       system facilities, providing equipment, supporting biogas and farmer associations,
       and applied research. B. Training. This would train households in biogas
       operation and maintenance, and integration of biogas with household production
       systems. A comprehensive training program would be implemented for
       technicians (county, township, farmer technicians) and farmers in biogas systems
       and farm management.
   (a) Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 24 million,
       17% IBRD financing). This component, comprising three sub-components
       relating to project management, institutional capacity building, and monitoring
       and evaluation, would respond to the need for establishment of an efficient and
       effective project management structure and systems, with well trained and
       appropriately resourced staff to implement and monitor the progress of the project
       and the impact of the various activities under the project.

1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Level 2 Restructuring in April 2013. The main focus of the restructuring was: (a)
to reduce the number of “1+3” system households adopting the package resulting from
increased unit costs, depreciation of the US Dollar, and unchanged total amount of World
Bank loan. The total number of beneficiary households were reduced by 94,692 (17.6%)
from an original total of 538,650 to 443,958. This was still within the overall 400,000-


                                           4
500,000 households range specified in the Results Framework; and (b) to modify the list
of Intermediate Outcome Indicators, as follows:
   (a) Number of new households connected to village water supply systems: Revised
       up from 150,000 to 154,800;
   (b) Length of new village roads connecting households to village roads: Revised up
       from 500 kms to 1,400 kms;
   (c) Percentage of households expressing reduction in travel/transportation time:
       Dropped;
   (d) Number of farmers trained in biogas operation and management, and in new farm
       production practices (person days): Revised from 300,000 to 1.5 million;
   (e) Percentage of farmers using new practices: Dropped;
   (f) Clients who have adopted an improved agriculture technology promoted by the
       project; New: 330,000 (of which 280,000 women) or 75% of the revised 440,000
       households;
   (g) Number of technician visits to farmers: Dropped;
   (h) Number of farmers attended demonstration sites: Dropped;
   (i) Percentage of farmers satisfied with technical and biogas extension services:
       Dropped;
   (j) Targeted clients with satisfied agriculture services (%): New: 75% (or 396,000)
   (k) Targeted clients satisfied with agriculture services (number): New: 119,000 males
       and 277,000 females (totaling to 396,000);
   (l) Targeted clients: New: 158,400 males and 369,600 females (totaling to 528,000).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Project preparation took full account of the extensive experience and lessons
learned from a large number of Bank funded projects in China and elsewhere, projects
funded by other international agencies, as well as the various national biogas
development programs in China. Such lessons covered aspects relating to technical
design, institutional arrangements, capacity building and training, private benefits, project
management and leadership, counterpart funds, monitoring and evaluation.
2.1.2 The project applied a comprehensive approach to fully integrate biogas
development into farm production systems, including biogas technology solutions and
biogas-related on-farm investments; institutional strengthening of biogas service and
extension systems at provincial, county, township and village levels; technician, farmer
and household training programs in integrated biogas and farming practices; and
improved M&E systems. The project was fully integrated with the government’s NRBP
in project provinces to achieve the maximum environmental, economic and social
benefits and was built on existing institutional systems for implementation. The project
also considered various alternatives to strive for an optimal design focused on innovation
and practicality.
2.1.3 The project assessed ten major potential risks and suggested appropriate
mitigation measures at project appraisal. These were indeed the rightly identified major
risks the project encountered during project implementation except the risks of reduced


                                             5
coal price and reduced fertilizer/pesticide costs. In fact, market prices for coal,
fertilizer/pesticide went up steadily. There is another risk that was not well identified is
the risk of a reduction in pig farming and consequent shortage of manure which in turn
poses a risk to the development outcome, if not handled properly. In many project
locations the number of pigs raised in small-scale household-based operations declined
significantly over the period of the project. This was partly due to increased urban
migration (hence a lack of labor in villages). To a large extent it was also due to the
introduction of central government policies encouraging commercial pig raising in large-
scale operations, which resulted from concerns about food safety, an action which was
unforeseen at the project design stage. In line with the risks, the project took various
serious and solid actions throughout the project implementation to tackle these risks. As a
result, the project was able to maintain the overall risk rating to a Moderate at the time for
preparation of the ICR.
2.1.4 Project design and preparation were carried out in a full participatory process.
Wide coverage surveys and various awareness raising campaigns were organized in all
project provinces. Project activities were decided based on results of such surveys and
campaigns. Community development activities were selected through a participatory
planning process to ensure that household and community priorities were reflected in
activity selection. The process involved households, community leaders, women’s
representatives, minorities, PMOs, and technical experts to ensure that technical quality
requirements were met. Participating households were also selected through a
participatory approach. Among the selection criteria to ensure ownership of project
activities was their willingness to participate and commitment to carry out project
activities and use biogas as the major fuel following project implementation.
2.1.5 The project pioneered piloting a household-based biogas CDM initiative. The
design of the CDM Pilot Program was relevant and the Program achieved all its expected
outputs. It is the first registered household-based CDM biogas digester project in China.

2.2 Implementation
2.2.1 Overall project implementation was successful with almost all adjusted physical
targets achieved by the original project closing date. The overall implementation quality
of works remained satisfactory throughout the project implementation.
2.2.2 A formal project Mid-term Review was conducted for the project in May 2011.
The mission highlighted a number of issues – slow implementation progress, slow
reimbursement, slow checking and acceptance progress, slow availability of county
counterpart funding, poor evidence of adoption of improved farm management initiatives
(improved rice varieties or rehabilitated orchards), incomplete implementation of the
“1+3” system, poorly functioning biogas associations and cooperatives in some counties,
no environmental monitoring of bio-slurry and groundwater around the biogas pit. The
mission provided a range of recommendations to address these issues and endorsed the
government’s proposal for a project restructuring.
2.2.3 Following up on the recommendation of the MTR mission, a number of actions
were taken and major progress was made in addressing main issues identified. One of the
key actions taken was project restructuring in April 2013 after long discussions with
China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The key adjustment


                                              6
introduced was to increase the sub-financing reimbursement amount of household
package unit costs for all project provinces except Chongqing without Bank loan
proceeds reallocation among expenditure categories. Some intermediate outcome
indicators were also modified accordingly. The key change was necessary due to a sharp
increase in unit cost of the “1+3” systems and the significant devaluation of the US$ of
the Bank loan that has reduced the total amount of RMB available for the project
financing. As a result, (a) the scale of “1+3” systems in four of the five project provinces
was downsized; (b) minor adjustments among activities under the Community
Development sub-component were agreed; (c) total number of project counties was
increased to 65 from 64 identified at appraisal; (d) the total project costs were increased
by about 5 percent; and (e) changes were made to the intermediate outcome indicators to
better reflect the project achievements (see section 1.7 on Other Significant Changes).
However, the PDO, project design, targets at the outcome level, the intended
demonstration effect of the project and the project’s legal agreements remained
unchanged. Project implementation has never been at Risk status. This restructuring
proved to be very effective in accelerating project implementation and disbursement.
2.2.4 The CDM Pilot Program addressed all the issues and challenges, demonstrated the
successful household-based biogas program development and operation approaches. The
Program also demonstrated the mechanism in using the carbon emission reduction
revenue as leverage to strengthen the biogas service support system, including monitoring
system, and institutional capacity at community level. This CDM program has fulfilled its
pioneer role through new methodology development to quantify the generated emission
reduction (ER) and has paved the way for replication in similar CDM projects. The
validations proved that the project biogas digesters were operated well and around 95.4
percent of designed CER amount was delivered by the project during the reporting period.
The project has also demonstrated as a role model of successful CDM transaction for
Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) portfolio by delivering a total of
213,940 tCO2e CERs, from February 2009 to December 2012. During implementation,
the Program was awarded national and provincial/ministerial prizes including “1st Prize:
China Agricultural Sci-technology Advancement”, “2nd Prize: State Sci-technology
Advancement”. The Program is one of the best delivery performances in the Bank’s
carbon finance portfolio with a stable delivery of about 53,500 tCO2e CERs annually.
Please see Annex 4 for detailed CDM Biogas Pilot implementation summary.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 Project M&E was designed to assess the project’s economic, social and
environmental impact and identify best practices for dissemination. The M&E system
was developed based on overall project design and experience drawn from other similar
projects. A large number of systematic and quantifiable M&E indicators were carefully
selected to track project outcomes and outputs. This was the first project to introduce the
results-based M&E system to the government’s NRBP in China.
2.3.2 Project M&E was carried out through implementation of three monitoring
systems specifically developed for project progress monitoring, project impact
monitoring, and project social and environmental monitoring. The M&E system
comprised (a) a Management Information System (MIS), funded jointly by all five
project provinces, was developed by the central PMO and used regularly by all PMOs at


                                             7
central, provincial and county levels as an efficient tool for physical progress monitoring,
contract-based procurement management and financial management; (b) project impact
monitoring was conducted through village surveys, farmer household surveys and kitchen
air quality sampling in years 1, 3 and 5 of project implementation. These surveys and
sampling were undertaken in 15 project counties by independent institutions which
provided creditable monitoring results; (c) project social and environmental monitoring
was carried out throughout the project implementation. Training was provided for all
project households (including women and minority participants) focusing on safe
utilization of biogas and bio-slurry. Local languages were used where minority
participants were concentrated. Environmental monitoring focused on the pathogenic
level of bio-slurry and groundwater quality through sampling in 10 project counties for
three consecutive years. This was lagging behind project implementation in earlier years
of project implementation due mainly to weak capacity and lack of funding.
Environmental monitoring was organized by each province and thus was conducted less
consistently among project provinces. With special efforts made, environmental
monitoring in all project provinces was accelerated to catch up in the last two years of
project implementation. The results of last round of monitoring show that the pathogenic
level of bio-slurry meets relevant national standards and most of the groundwater
monitored also met applicable national standards.
2.3.3 Monitoring of key performance indicators undertaken by 15 sampling counties
through household survey using questionnaires was unprecedented in terms of
comprehensiveness, volume of information gathered and tremendous effort made by the
PMOs. However, the design of the questionnaires could be improved as some questions
were not so relevant or found to be unnecessarily too detailed, whereas other important
aspects for the project (e.g. use of bio-slurry) should have been investigated in more
detail. Experience and lessons should be well analyzed in order to benefit similar
endeavors in the future.
2.3.4 Successful issuance of CERs over the past four reporting years demonstrated the
Pilot Program’s full compliance with CDM monitoring requirements. Key features of the
satisfactorily implemented monitoring and reporting system of project activity included:
(a) centralized monitoring system ensuring all required data to be collected and
maintained in a systematic manner; (b) solid organizational arrangements among
implementation parties at all levels; (c) representative sampling plan ensuring a
reasonable size of randomly sampled households on an annual basis; and (d) a training
system in place covering training for all parties involved in the Program and including
methodologies for CDM program related monitoring.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguard Compliance.
   (a) Social safeguards. It was decided at project appraisal that the Bank’s policies on
       Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10)
       were triggered. However throughout project implementation, it was concluded
       that: (i) neither land acquisition nor resettlement was required since all village
       roads were constructed on the basis of existing roads; and (ii) the Ethnic Minority




                                             8
        Development Plan was fully implemented by Hubei, Hunan and Guangxi where
        the Bank OP4.10 policy was triggered.
   (b) Environmental safeguards. The project was classified as Category B and triggered
       safeguard policies on Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). Measures for
       environmental assessment (EA) were followed in terms of construction of biogas
       facilities and village infrastructure. However, proper use of bio-slurry and
       associated training were relatively weak in earlier years of project implementation.
       Bio-slurry was mostly applied for backyard vegetable gardens and orchards rather
       than for staple crops or commercial vegetables in the field due mainly to the
       limited amount of bio-slurry generated by the household, transport cost, fertilizing
       frequency and quality enhancing effect on different agro-produce. Therefore,
       benefits of bio-slurry on soil and plants under the project should not be
       overestimated.
2.4.2   Fiduciary Compliance.
   (a) Procurement. The overall procurement was carried out in a satisfactory manner.
       This is despite the fact that the procedures of the Community Participation in
       Procurement were not strictly followed by some project counties in earlier years
       of project implementation. This was due mainly to lack of experience of county
       PMOs. Both the Bank’s Procurement and Consultant Guidelines were closely
       followed by all PMOs.
   (b) Financial Management. The overall project financial management was undertaken
       in a satisfactory manner which was assessed by the three main financial indicators
       i.e. counterpart fund delivery rate, investment completion rate, and loan
       disbursement rate. Counterpart fund delivery has been exceptional for the project
       as a whole which exceeded the committed amount. Counterpart funds were
       provided in a timely manner despite shortfalls remaining an issue in a few poorer
       project counties throughout the project implementation period. Project investment
       and loan disbursement were completed by project closing (June 30, 2014),
       although both investment completion rate and loan disbursement rate were
       lagging behind the PAD schedule prior to project restructuring (April 2013). The
       audit reports were timely and unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 It is highly likely that project financed facilities (i.e. “1+3” systems and village
infrastructure (drinking water supply facilities and village roads)) as a whole will
continue to be operated in a sustainable manner after project completion. This was
ensured basically by: (a) the beneficiary households’ full ownership of the project
financed “1+3” systems; (b) transition arrangements to post-completion operations
developed by project counties and provinces; and (c) the O&M arrangements for project
financed investments. The project efforts also received an additional impetus in the
adoption of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), which vigorously strives to green
China’s growth process and lower its carbon intensity.
2.5.2 The project transition arrangement focused on sustainable operation of the biogas
digesters constructed under the project within their designed life span of 10 to 15 years



                                            9
and covering all project supported biogas digesters 3. A number of innovative models for
sustainable operation of “1+3” systems were developed and successfully tested during the
project implementation (see section 3.5.3 for details). These models, spread among
project provinces and broadcasted in local media, provided practical options for
sustainable post-completion operations.
2.5.3 The project O&M arrangements were carefully made. For “1+3” systems, the
O&M responsibilities clearly rest with the beneficiary households supported by the
service stations as households do not have the expertise to self-service their digesters. As
an integral part of the national network, the project financed biogas technical extension
and service system in all project provinces has been under the regular supervision and
monitoring of the Rural Energy Offices. They receive continuous support from the
central and local governments. The O&M responsibilities for the project financed village
infrastructure would be transferred to: (i) relevant households and village committees for
drinking water supply facilities; and (ii) county Transportation Bureaus, village
committees or relevant enterprises respectively for village roads according to the specific
nature of different village roads.
2.5.4 Various replication options were considered as part of post-completion actions:
(a) replication of project experience within the jurisdiction of project county and province
to remaining households suitable for construction of household biogas digesters; (b)
replication of project experience to other counties and other provinces beyond project
jurisdiction through NRBP and other government funded programs; and (c) replication of
project experience to or knowledge sharing with other countries through the World Bank
Institute and South-South Cooperation Program. The Central PMO has initiated a
program to disseminate and replicate the project results.
2.5.5 Some project counties have developed a comprehensive Sustainability Action
Plan (SAP) to incorporate best practices, successful experience and lessons learned from
their own operations as well as from other project counties. The SAPs also spell out the
detailed actions for transition arrangements to post-completion operation, O&M
arrangements, institutional and funding arrangements, and the replication options. These
SAPs formed a solid base to ensure the project’s long-term sustainability. Anhui reported
that the provincial Finance Bureau has made an allocation of RMB22 million to continue
supporting development of sustainable systems for O&M.
2.5.6 Hunan province has launched preparation of a new Agricultural Production Base
Safety and Quality Improvement Project funded by a US$100 million IBRD loan. The
new project is expected to involve similar government agencies as this project. Though
still at the initial stage, support to sustainability of this project’s infrastructure and
replication of project experience in the new project is being considered.
2.5.7 The successful experience of the CDM Pilot Program was extended to broad
areas in China and beyond through site visits, south-south CDM workshops and various
other approaches. More than 20 delegations from a number of provinces in China as well


3
 Excluding those households without any user all year round, resettled away from the constructed biogas
digesters, no longer showing any interest in using biogas for whatever reason.



                                                   10
as delegations and expert groups from Vietnam and other countries have visited the
Program area. Similar CDM projects were replicated within China and in other countries.
The stable carbon revenue stream provided incentives to participating households to
maintain the performance of the biogas facilities. Following the Program’s effective
performance-based rewarding mechanism, the Hubei government has been piloting the
same mechanism to encourage its households to maintain their biogas digesters.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 The project development objective remains relevant in terms of addressing issues
in China relating to intensive agriculture (e.g. fertilizer substitution), livestock production
(e.g. productive use of waste), and income increase in rural areas (e.g. through energy
cost savings). The project developed solutions relating to biogas use for integration with
farm production models and sustainability of the biogas approach itself, including service
system development. The project design remains highly relevant and could be easily
replicated across China in other areas where biogas facilities already exist or where there
is a need to make biogas sustainable.
3.1.2 The project, as designed and implemented, addressed China’s priorities that remain
highly relevant today, notably (a) increasing rural incomes; (b) building new socialist
countryside; and (c) achieving the development objectives in the 11th Five-Year Plan. The
project developed innovative and replicable models for China to address these priorities.
The successful experience under the project is also of global significance for other
countries to follow. The project addresses the GHG emission reduction issue, one of the
global priorities through a household-based CDM Pilot Program in one of the project
provinces. The project design and implementation are also highly relevant to two
strategic areas of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for China i.e. (a) managing
resource scarcity and environmental challenges; and (b) reducing poverty, inequality and
social exclusion (see section 1.1.3).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 The project fully achieved its two development objectives as measured against the
key indicators defined at the time of project appraisal.
The first indicator was the improved quality of life in the targeted households which was
reflected through actions in two specific areas: (a) reduction in smoke in kitchens while
cooking; and (b) improvement in the dirty environment resulting from poor manure
management.
Smoke in kitchens while cooking was greatly reduced as a result of reduced use of
firewood and coal as fuel which is the primary source of kitchen smoke and household
ambient environment. Project monitoring results showed that use of firewood and coal
was reduced respectively by 568 kg and 325 kg in average per HH/year and also time
spent for cooking was reduced by 16 days in average per HH/year. Comparing the
situations between project closing and baseline, project households with indoor air
quality coming up to the national standards increased by 21.6 percent; household
members with respiratory problems such as occasional cough, phlegm, asthma and


                                              11
children with occasional cough, phlegm or breathing difficulties, and diarrhea all
decreased, without exception, ranging from 1.6 to 6.5 percent for households among
participating provinces. Project monitoring results also showed that pathogenic level of
bio-slurry and most groundwater quality monitored met applicable national standards.
Environmental conditions in all participating households were significantly improved
primarily by implementation of the “1+3” systems. The bio-digesters using and treating
the pig manure as well as other kitchen and human wastes, and the three improvements,
namely animal sheds, kitchens and toilets upgrades helped achieve a cleaner environment
in the house and in the farm yards. About 470,000 households deployed this package,
indicating the extent of the spread of the clean environment actions, compared with the
revised target of about 444,000 households. In addition, the project supported 155,560
new water connections provided clean water and hygiene and sanitary conditions in the
households. All of these contributed to cleaner environment of the participating
households.
3.2.2 The second indicator was the increased disposable income for targeted households.
This was successfully achieved primarily through: (a) reduced fuel expenses; (b) time
saving for firewood collection and cooking; and (c) reduced application of chemical
fertilizers and pesticides.
Reduced fuel expenses: At appraisal, there was an underestimation of the electricity grid
coverage in project area and households electricity usage as an energy source. This
resulted in an assumption of higher use of the conventional energy source (firewood and
coal) and a lower use of electricity. Hence the target for reduction in firewood, coal, and
natural gas was higher and that for electricity reduction lower. As a result, with the
exception of electricity (actual reduction was 102 kWh per household per year versus a
target of 35 kWh per household per year, or 292% of appraisal target), actual quantitative
reduction of firewood, coal and natural gas did not meet the appraisal targets (69%, 74%
and 68% respectively). The indicator however focused on increased household incomes.
Due to increase in the price of alternative energy sources, monetary savings per HH/year
(RMB806) exceeded the PAD target (RMB355) by 127 percent.
Time saving for firewood collection and cooking: The target set at project appraisal was
exceeded by over 29 percent (see Annex 3) and the annual household income from time
saving at ICR was almost six times as envisaged at appraisal as a result of increased labor
cost 4.
Application of chemical fertilizers: The reduction at 405kg per HH/year in average
exceeded the appraisal target, with actual reduction ranging between 19 and 73 percent
against the baseline of 500-1500kg per HH/year.
Against the baseline, the annual disposable household income increased by an average of
RMB8,212) which was a combined result of reduced fuel expenses (RMB806), saved
labor time value (RMB693), reduced farm production costs (RMB222) and the higher


4
 Calculated based on assumption that 30% of the saved labor would be put into productive activities, the
saved labor time was valued at RMB837 per HH/year (31 days x 30% x RMB90/day) at ICR while that was
RMB144 per HH/year (24 days x 30% x RMB20/day).


                                                  12
value of the improved quality and efficiency of farm production (RMB4,209) and
livestock production (RMB2,282).
3.2.3 The third indicator was the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The project
was expected to achieve an annual average of about 0.8 million to 1 million tCO2e of
CERs i.e. a reduction of about 2 tCO2e per HH/year based on conservative calculations 5.
The GHG reduction was successfully demonstrated by the CDM Pilot Program in Hubei
province where 33,000 units of installed biogas systems delivered a total of 213,940
tCO2e verified CERs 6 from February 2009 to December 2012 i.e. a reduction of about
1.67 tCO2e per HH/year 7. This implies an average annual reduction of about 785,000
tCO2e estimated based on the experience of Hubei’s CDM Pilot Program. The actual
GHG reduction should be even greater if the emission reduction from the production of
replaced chemical fertilizers is included.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Consistent with the approach adopted at project appraisal, both financial and
economic analysis was performed to evaluate the project’s efficiency. The same
methodology and same group of parameters were used for cost-benefit analysis. The
average financial Net Present Value (NPV) for project households, the economic NPV of
the project and the project’s Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) were recalculated.
All fundamental data for the analysis were from farm models afforded by the 5 project
provinces. See Annex 3 for details.
3.3.2 Financial Analysis. Financial analysis was undertaken to assess the financial
viability of the household investments in biogas systems. The financial benefits included
the savings from (a) replacement of traditional fuel; (b) replacement of chemical
fertilizers; and (c) labor time. Despite dramatically increased investment cost for “1+3”
systems during project implementation, the average financial NPV (at 12 percent
discount rate) for project households was re-calculated at a financially very attractive
RMB5,802 against the PAD estimate of RMB1,060. This resulted from much higher
value of saved traditional fuel, chemical fertilizer and labor time.
3.3.3 Economic Analysis. Economic analysis was conducted under three scenarios: (a)
biogas facility; (b) agricultural activities; and (c) biogas facility plus agricultural
activities. In addition to direct benefit generated by the project activities i.e. savings in
traditional fuel, chemical fertilizer and labor time, and increased agricultural outputs, the
project also produced multiple public goods benefits through impacts on health,
environment and poverty. However, the only quantifiable environmental benefit i.e. the


5
  This was calculated based on (a) decrease in GHG emission from firewood; (b) decrease in GHG
emission for coal burning; (c) decrease in GHG emission released by human and animal waste; and (d)
increase in GHG emission due to biogas leakage.

6
  The CER payments were distributed as the following: (i) management fee (22%) including Qingjiang
Seed Company (2%), prefecture PMO (4%), county/city PMOs (16%); (ii) technical service (10%); and
(iii) HHs (68%).

7
 This was calculated based on achieved verified CERs (55,106 tCO2e) and the total number of biogas HH
(33,000) for the latest 12 months (2012) when bio-digesters were in normal operations.


                                                  13
economic value of CO2 emission reduction was included in the calculation of EIRR. As a
result, the project yielded an economic NPV of RMB0.89 billion and an EIRR of 21.6
percent. The less robust economic NPV and EIRR were due mainly to the decline of
economic value of the CO2 emission reductions. However, the project EIRR at ICR was
still far above the standard discount rate of 12 percent.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The project was highly relevant to current country and global priorities and to the
Bank’s assistance strategy. It met or exceeded almost all targets as measured by outcome
and impact indicators and so fully attained all development objectives. It was highly
efficient, with an EIRR well in excess of the opportunity cost of capital though somewhat
lower than appraisal expectations. This was due mainly to the decline of economic value
of the CO2 emission reductions during project implementation which was out of the
project’s control.
3.4.2 The satisfactory rating is also justified by the strong demonstration effect of the
project (see section 2.5). Although not captured in the overall outcomes rating, the
demonstration under the project that, with the innovations tested, agricultural production
and farmers’ incomes of the participating households can be sustained as long as the
project improved systems and infrastructures are sustained. This demonstration could
prove, in the long run, to be the most valuable benefit of the project. The government has
also highly appreciated and built in the ownership of the comprehensive approach
developed under this project for improved quality of life, integrated approaches, and the
institutional innovations. The experiences and lessons are already being scaled-up in the
government NRBP and also in medium- and large-size household-based biogas programs.
3.4.3 Largely as a public goods operation, the project still yielded a robust economic
NPV of RMB0.68 billion and an EIRR of 17.3 percent at ICR. This was over 5 per cent
above the standard discount rate of 12 percent.
3.4.4 The CDM Pilot Program was validated in February 2009. Four verifications have
been conducted for CO2e CERs generated during the period from February 2009 to
December 2012. The accumulative delivered CERs of 213,940 tCO2e achieved around
95.4 percent of targeted delivery. The fifth verification process to verify the CER
delivery in year 2013 is underway. About 5 percent of the installed biogas digesters were
no longer in use because of households moving to cities for new jobs. All other biogas
digesters were operating well with a stable delivery of CO2e CERs every year. Local
technical extension and biogas service systems were further strengthened by using a
portion of the revenues accrued from the CERs to promote the sustainable biogas digester
O&M.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development



                                           14
3.5.1 The project paid special attention to the engagement of the poor, women and
ethnic minorities for the purposes of alleviating poverty, promoting social inclusion and
gender equality for sustainable development. Of the total beneficiary households, 41,346
households or about 9 percent were classified as poor households and 19,182 households
of them were able to successfully alleviate poverty through participating in project
activities. Their income was increased through project supported agricultural production
and living cost was reduced by using biogas in terms of saved fuel and health costs as
well as saved labour in cooking, firewood collection and other related heavy housework.
They were mostly located in remote areas of the 15 nationally or provincially designated
poverty counties.
Of the total beneficiary households, 111,677 households or about 24 percent were ethnic
minorities spread in a total of 1,533 villages of all five project provinces, especially in
Guangxi, Hunan and Enshi of Hubei provinces. 477 minority households were selected to
participate in project surveys.
Women’s participation in the project was significant, especially with the women-headed
households as a result of temporary migration of male members of such households.
Women also benefitted the most from the project activities, the “1+3” systems in
particular, as they traditionally took care of meal preparation and pig rearing. Women
especially reported high satisfaction in benefits from the project in terms of enjoying
cleaner and healthier living and cooking conditions, much less heavy housework.
Participants received training throughout the project implementation. Of the total
household training provided, about 40 percent and 17 percent were offered for women
and minority households, respectively. Most of the training sessions were provided in the
villages at convenient locations and at times when women trainees could attend. This
training improved their technical skills as well as awareness and knowledge on
environmental protection. Women particularly benefited very much from training on
safety of using biogas, technical skills and methods in planting cash crops in agricultural
production. The project showed very positive social impacts on people in project areas,
especial women who gave a lot of positive feedback on the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The project brought significant institutional changes and strengthening. The
networks and institutional linkages among government line agencies (e.g. planning,
finance, agriculture, forestry and rural energy, universities and research institutes) were
established and functioning well. Project institutional capacity and staff skills were
greatly improved through intensive capacity development programs, hands-on training,
and project implementation practices.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3 Various innovative models for providing biogas services were developed and
implemented very successfully during project implementation. The following typical
models represented by project counties were unintended during project preparation.



                                            15
   (a) Shouxian county of Anhui Province established a unique service system to
      integrate livestock farms, biogas user households, and vegetable production farms
      through cooperation between the biogas cooperative and the vegetable
      cooperative. This model ensures benefits to all parties involved including the two
      cooperatives and is a sustainable operation.
   (b) In Kaixian county of Chongqing Municipality, the model was developed with
      distinguishing features: (i) offering 55 positions for providing biogas service at
      township level on the government payroll; (ii) making a trusteeship arrangement
      for biogas users at village level to provide overall services; and (iii) sharing
      information and knowledge through a cell-phone based mass-delivery system.
      This system is currently servicing about 400 project households and the county’s
      plan is to cover all 6,271 project households by the end of 2014 and all 63,000
      biogas user households in the county by the end of 2015.
   (c) In Gongcheng county of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the model
      involves a private company, whereby the company is responsible for providing
      project households with feed-stock from large animal husbandry operations,
      servicing and maintaining the biogas digesters, and collecting the bio-slurry for
      sale to orchards and large crop farms. The system also involves installation of gas
      meters in every household and collecting a subsidized tariff based on the volume
      of gas used. This gives the service company the incentive to ensure that gas
      production from the biogas digesters is maximized and that service and
      maintenance is adequate. The system has been serving about 500 households and
      its business plan is to cover over 10,000 households with biogas systems in the
      county in the next five years.
   (d) In Linli county of Hunan Province, the model contains 20 biogas associations and
      has been providing services under the principles of (i) government guidance, (ii)
      association operation, and (iii) household participation. Government budgetary
      allocation was provided for setting up the associations, O&M financing, and
      technician subsidies. The service has been covering all biogas user households in
      the county with an annual association fee of RMB50 per household.
   (e) In Enshi prefecture of Hubei Province, a “supermarket” model was developed to
      provide biogas services in a sustainable manner. The model is in the form of
      village-based convenience stores supported by township Agricultural Service
      Centers and under operation by farmer technicians. Such convenience stores were
      built with unified development principles, unified exterior design, unified
      development standards and unified operations. They supply biogas spare parts and
      stoves, seeds, pesticides, agricultural equipment, solar water heaters, and daily
      necessities; and provide biogas services for technical guidance, trouble shooting,
      repairing and maintenance. One remarkable result achieved is that most such
      convenience stores are able to provide satisfactory biogas services while making a
      profit in their operation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
4.1     Sustainability of the biogas digester system beyond project completion was
basically ensured as discussed in section 2.5. However, there is a potential risk to the
sustainability closely linked with (a) feed-stock supply issues; (b) biogas service issues;
and (c) institutional cooperation issues. Though still low, the risk is real and may become
substantial if these issues are not handled properly.
4.2      Due to various reasons 8, about 30-40 percent of project supported biogas user
households were no longer raising pigs by project closing. These households found feed-
stocks for the biogas digesters through various sources including collecting pig manure
from neighboring large and medium sized pig farms; using poultry manure; or using
alternative feed-stocks (crop stalks, straw, grass and kitchen residues). Alternative feed-
stocks, if not prepared properly (e.g. removing non-biodegradable fiber fraction,
chopping into smaller pieces), reduce the efficiency of biogas production and may cause
digesters to underperform or eventually fail. Despite various trials and demonstrations
going on to deal with this issue in all project provinces with impressive and encouraging
initial results, this tendency of biogas households without raising pigs is expected to
continue and supply of good quality feed-stocks remains an issue and challenge to a large
number of biogas user households.
4.3     Biogas service systems have been established and functioning well under the
project, but issues exist. One of which was to maintain a team of professional biogas
technicians willingly to work in the service system particularly at village and township
levels. The current practice of providing service free of charge to the biogas households
on a voluntary basis in many project counties was doubtful in retaining these technicians
for providing sustainable post-completion services. All project counties have to make
their own arrangements taking into consideration their specific situation to ensure a
functioning service system. Only when the biogas technicians are ensured an income
stream from their services either from government sources or users or both, can the
technician team be stabilized and the biogas service issue eased.
4.4     Effective institutional cooperation among government line agencies is a critical
element to ensure an appropriate institutional arrangement for the project’s post-
completion O&M. This is vital especially for Hunan and Guangxi where the project
implementation responsibility and project post-completion O&M mandates at both
provincial and county levels are under different government line agencies. The project
sustainability may be jeopardized without detailed and well coordinated plans to ensure
effective institutional cooperation for a seamless transfer of project responsibility from
implementation to post-completion operation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

8
 Including poor economic returns from pig raising, the central government’s policy preference shift from
support for small scale household-based pig raising to larger livestock raising operations, migration of able-
bodied workers out of the villages for wage labor elsewhere, and accelerated urbanization for villages and
households adjacent to towns and cities.


                                                     17
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1 The Bank ensured that the project design was consistent with the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy for China, and in line with the development objectives in the
Chinese Government 11th Five-Year Plan. It was technically sound, socially acceptable,
environmentally sustainable, financially and economically viable. The Bank involved top
international and national experts in the design of the CDM Pilot Program including
development of new methodology. The Bank’s role in ensuring high quality at entry was
widely recognized as exemplary by the government at all levels.
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2 During project implementation, the Bank was able to conduct 11 effective
supervisions and provide timely support for successful completion of implementation of
all project activities to achieve project objectives and development outcomes. The Bank
was highly responsive to the client’s requests for advice, support and project restructuring.
5.1.3 The Bank has worked closely with the client to support smooth preparation,
registration at UNFCCC, verification and CER issuance over the past four years (2009 –
2013) for the CDM Pilot Program. The Bank’s carbon finance experts were fully engaged
to provide technical assistance and maintain regular dialogue with the client and
designated operational entities (DOE), which facilitated the project validation and
verification process.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank played a vital role in ensuring quality at entry and in providing timely
support to the client during project supervision. The Bank maintained a responsive team
and made a definite contribution to the success of the project and the CDM Pilot Program
throughout the project preparation, implementation and completion. The satisfactory
rating for overall Bank performance is fully justified.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.1 The government at all levels demonstrated strong commitments and made
significant contributions to the project throughout project preparation, implementation
and completion. The overall commitment, contributions and support from the
governments at all levels represented by Project Leading Groups (PLGs) were strong,


                                            18
consistent and adequate. Notable and full involvement of the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) in the project was demonstrated by the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center
(FECC) in providing overall project coordination; and by the Department of Research,
Education and Rural Environment in providing overall technical support through its local
technical services system, and in providing counterpart funding (over 60 percent of total
government funding) through its NRBP.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.2 PMOs, Project Implementation Offices (PIOs) and Project Implementation
Groups (PIGs), established under the project and supported by Project Technical Expert
Groups (PTEGs), were assigned overall project management and implementation
responsibilities. They were maintained throughout the project implementation period with
capable, dedicated and adequate staff which was the fundamental base for the successful
project implementation. The project implementing agencies working closely with the
Bank were highly cooperative and effective, and their overall performance was rated
satisfactory. Specifically, they (a) effectively implemented the project consistent with the
project design; (b) closely followed the legal covenants specified in the legal agreements;
and (c) efficiently managed the project in accordance with the agreements reached with
the Bank. This included preparation of annual work programs for the Bank’s review;
coordination of annual budgets for project activities; carrying out efficient project
fiduciary, safeguards and M&E activities; organizing training and inter-provincial visits;
and providing various project plans and reports. The PMOs and PIOs have been playing a
critical role in ensuring successful project implementation.
5.2.3 For the CDM Pilot Program, the project entity’s performance was also rated
satisfactory based on the following: (a) timely provision of funding for project
preparation, implementation and operation; (b) fully complying with the project
safeguards requirements; (c) high reliability of data measured and collected; (d)
compliance with CDM operational and monitoring requirements; and (e) efficient
maintenance of a database of technical and operational information to enable annual
monitoring by the Bank as well as verification by DOEs. In particular, the project entity
made great efforts to develop a comprehensive monitoring system and technical service
system to ensure that the 33,000 biogas digesters, scattered in more than 600 villages of
eight counties, could be operated in an appropriate manner to secure the stable ER
delivery.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.4 Despite slower than expected implementation progress up to the time of project
restructuring, the governments and project implementing agencies maintained their strong
commitment. The satisfactory rating of Overall Borrower Performance was justified by
(a) the government’s provision of 27 percent more counterpart funding(in RMB terms)
than the committed amount in the PAD; (b) the successful completion of project
implementation as originally scheduled; (c) the replication of the project’s successful



                                            19
experiences and lessons in domestic programs; and (d) very successful operation of the
CDM Pilot Program which was considered one of the best delivery performances in the
Bank’s entire carbon finance portfolio.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1    Many factors contributed to the project’s success. The following are among the
most important lessons learned.
6.1.1 Favorable national regulatory frameworks and policy instruments for biogas
development and livestock pollution control provided legal ground and financial
incentives for a successful project implementation. The “Renewable Energy Law of the
People’s Republic of China” (Chinese People’s Congress 2005), the “Decree of Control
and Management of Pollution by Livestock Production” (SEPA May 2001), National
Rural Biogas Program (MOA 2001), Construction of New Socialist Countryside
Development Program (Suggestion for 11th Five-Year Plan Outlines 2005), and
“Guidance on Further Strengthening Construction of Rural Biogas” (NDRC and MOA
2012) were particularly relevant. In absence of such instruments, the project would not
have been developed in the first place and project success would not be achieved.
6.1.2 Stakeholders’ commitment, dedication and capabilities are critical to ensure
project success, sustainability and ownership. These were demonstrated by (a) strong
leadership by government at all levels in providing policy guidance and counterpart
funds; (b) effective cooperation and coordination among government line agencies; (c)
full involvement of all key stakeholders in project design and implementation; (d) well
established project management procedures and operational and monitoring systems; and
(e) unremitting and concerted efforts and hard work by highly dedicated and capable
project staff. Strong project management and leadership at the central level played an
essential role for this specific project which involved multiple provinces and covered a
wide range of project activities. This was also an experience for the Bank’s rural sector
operations in China and the government’s programs. The project success could not have
been achieved without timely provision of greatly increased counterpart funding to fill
the huge funding gap caused by major depreciation of the US$ and large cost increase
during project implementation.
6.1.3 Despite attractive financial returns and positive social and environmental benefits
of the project investment, up-front significant subsidies as financial incentives are
required to share the initial capital cost of the project facilities to help mobilize household
participation. The project experience indicates that households were willing to participate
and contribute once the project design was accepted and initial capital cost barrier was
removed. The project statistics show that the final household’s overall contribution under
this project is 42 percent which is a bit higher than the contribution rate (36 percent) for
Guangdong province under the Global Environment Facility (GEF) financed Livestock
Waste Management in East Asia Project. The project experience provided more evidence
that a beneficiary’s contribution between 30 to 50 percent is a fair norm for other similar
projects in China.




                                              20
6.1.4 One of the key reasons for the smooth operation of the CDM Pilot Program was
the integration of the CDM operations into the Bank Loan investment project. In the loan
project great efforts were made in institutional capacity building, technical services
provision, as well as monitoring system development and maintenance with adequate
budgetary support. The CDM Pilot Program has also benefited extensively from the
investment project’s timely training and technical assistance provided as well as quality
control and monitoring of project activities. Carbon finance has played a vital role in
successful operational performance of the biogas digester systems. With a portion of the
carbon revenue used to support biogas community service station extension to the village
level, training and maintenance services to households even at remote locations have
been significantly strengthened. This has greatly ensured the sustainability of the Pilot
Program activities.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Analysis Methodology
1.      Financial analysis was undertaken to assess the financial viability of the
household investments in biogas systems. The financial benefits included the savings
from (a) replacement of traditional fuel; (b) replacement of chemical fertilizers; and (c)
labor time. Only the actual cash income and expenditure of household impacted by the
project activity were taken into account of the calculation of financial net benefit.
2.      Economic analysis was conducted under three scenarios (a) biogas facility; (b)
agricultural activities; and (c) biogas facility plus agricultural activities. In addition to
direct benefit generated by the project activities, such as reduction in use of traditional
fuel and chemical fertilizers, saving of labor time, yield improvement of agricultural
products, the project also produced multiple public benefits through impacts on health,
environment and poverty. However, only the quantifiable environmental benefit i.e. the
economic value of CO2 emission reduction was included in the calculation of EIRR.
Shadow prices were adopted for non-tradable goods such as labor and CO2 emission
reduction; for tradable goods, market prices were used directly as their economic prices.
3.      All fundamental data for the analysis were from farm models provided by the five
project provinces. The calculations followed the same analysis models adopted in the
PAD for comparability between the PAD and the ICR.


Financial Analysis
4.      The prices of the main inputs and outputs changed significantly compared with
the beginning of project implementation. In summary, the investment cost for the “1+3”
system increased significantly because of the much more expensive cost of labor and
feed-stock. The increase of investment cost for the biogas system had a negative impact
on the financial returns of biogas investment. On the other hand, the simultaneous
increase of prices of traditional fuels, chemical fertilizer and labor had positive impact on
the financial returns of investment. The investment on biogas was more financially
valuable due to the more expensive labor and fuels because operation of the biogas
system saved the farmer’s labor input in firewood collection and the input of fuels such
as coal and liquid gas,.
5.      Tables 4 and 5 summarize the actual impact of the biogas facility on household’s
labor saving and the use of traditional fuels, respectively, compared with the impact
projected in the PAD. The tables show that the actual RMB value of energy saving was
much higher than that projected in the PAD, mainly because of the increasing energy
prices in the past 6 years. The actual labor saving impacted by the biogas system was
higher compared with the PAD projection. If the remarkable increase in labor value is
considered, the actual impact on the value of labor saving was also more positive than the
PAD projection.

6.      Actual prices of inputs and outputs were adopted in the financial analysis.
RMB90 per labor-day was used as the financial value of off-farm labor. It was assumed
that 30 percent of the saved labor would be put into productive activities, i.e., about
RMB27 per labor-day was valued for the financial benefit of labor saving induced by the
biogas system. The calculation showed that the actual financial NPV equaled a
financially attractive RMB5,802, given the discount rate of 12 percent. It was evidently
higher than the projection of the PAD, which was RMB1,060, given the same discount
rate.
Economic Analysis
7.      The same impact of the change of prices on economic analysis has its impact on
the financial analysis: more expensive inputs and outputs would have both negative and
positive impact on the investment of agricultural activities. But CO2 was an exception.
The CO2 emission reduction was one of the important outputs of the biogas system,
butthe price for CO2 emission reduction declined greatly in recent years. Shenzhen City
became the first city which launched Carbon Trading in China in June 2013.
RMB30/tCO2e, the price for the first batch carbon trades in Shenzhen City, was used for
the project’s economic analysis at ICR, while the price of RMB80/tCO2e was estimated
and used in the PAD.
8.       The same economic analysis model adopted in the PAD was used at ICR. Table 6
summarized the results of EIRRs of the biogas system, agricultural activities and the
whole project in the PAD, at project Restructuring and at ICR respectively. It showed that,
comparing with that projected in the PAD and at project Restructuring, EIRRs for biogas
facility of the five project provinces at ICR declined, due mainly to the decline of
economic value of the CO2 emission reduction; while EIRRs for agricultural activities
increased. The project as a whole yielded an EIRR for biogas facility, agricultural
activities and biogas + agriculture scenario of 23.0 percent, 21.1 percent and 21.6 percent


                                             28
respectively and an economic NPV of RMB0.89 billion (at discount rate of 12 percent).
The less robust economic EIRRs and NPV were due mainly to the decline of economic
value of the CO2 emission reductions. However, the project EIRR at ICR was still far
above the standard discount rate of 12 percent.

2. ACHIEVEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES AND
OUTCOMES

2.1 Basic project description and summary of any significant changes since ERPA
signature

1.   The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to demonstrate innovative technical
     approaches and a credible carbon trading model for a household-based Clean
     Development Mechanism (CDM) biogas digester program. It was developed to
     install household-based biogas digesters to appropriately tread livestock manure and
     generate thermal energy for households’ cooking and heating. Through the design,
     construction, and management of biogas digesters that utilize pig manure as raw
     material, the project supports the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
     the improvement of local rural environment and household living conditions,
     including household health. The key project performance indicator is annual delivery
     of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) based on monitoring results of actual



                                           33
     emission reductions that are annually verified by the Designated Operational Entity
     (DOE), a third party verifier.

2.   The project was developed under a Bank financed Eco-Farming Project (a Bank
     Loan Project, P096556), piloting the first CDM household based biogas operation in
     China. As the Trustee of the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF), the
     Bank is purchasing CERs resulting from the operation of household biogas systems.
     For the period from February 9, 2009 to December 31, 2014, a total of 337,192
     tCO2e of CERs have been contracted for purchase by CDCF, with 213,943 tCO2e of
     CERs purchased already.

3.   No significant project changes were made since Emission Reduction Purchase
     Agreement (ERPA) signed.

2.2 Project implementation and commissioning

Achievement of PDO: Highly Satisfactory

4.   The project has achieved its PDO and its overall outcome is rated as Highly
     satisfactory. Project design was relevant and the project achieved its planned outputs
     at a high rate of efficiency. In February 2009, the project was registered at the
     Executive Board of United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change
     (UNFCCC), becoming the first registered household-based CDM biogas project in
     China. Before the project, many domestic and international institutions had been
     exploring the development of CDM operations in the biogas sector, but without
     success because of the complexities of baseline determination and the challenging
     organizational and monitoring arrangements needed to involve thousands of
     households across very broad remote rural areas. By addressing these challenges, the
     project has demonstrated a successful development and operational approach for
     CDM household-based biogas operation. The project has further demonstrated a
     market mechanism that uses carbon emission reduction (ER) revenue to strengthen
     the support network for biogas technical services, including monitoring systems and
     community-level institutional capacity building. Technical support network had
     typically been considered weak, which caused poor and unstable performance of
     biogas digesters for similar programs.

5.   As the first registered household-level biogas project in China, the CDM project has
     played a pioneering role by developing a new methodology to quantify the generated
     emission reductions, thus paving the way for the development of similar CDM
     projects worldwide. In addition, the project communities are receiving significant
     project benefits through the improvements in rural sanitation, enhanced ground
     water quality, and the provision of easy-use and clean energy to households.

6.   The CDM verifications show that the project biogas digesters have been operating
     well. During the 2009-2012 reporting period, 213,943 tCO2e CERs or around 95.4%
     of contracted CER volume were delivered (Table 1). (The verification for the ERs to



                                            34
     be issued from 2013 is currently underway). The project represents one of the best
     delivery performances in the Bank’s carbon finance portfolio with a stable delivery
     of about 53,500 tCO2e CERs annually.

7.   In terms of community benefits, the successful application of the “one digester, three
     renovations” principle—referring to the improvement of toilets, pig pens, and
     kitchens, while installing the biogas digester, has significantly improved local
     environment and human health conditions in the project areas, which demonstrated a
     sustainable model to efficiently solve a range of problems related to animal manure
     management, sanitation conditions improvement and rural clean energy generation.

8.   More specifically, project implementation has contributed to the reduction of
     household indoor air pollution through the use of biogas for household cooking and
     heating (thus reducing the consumption of coal and fuel wood). The project further
     contributed to (a) a reduction of local ground and surface water contamination
     through improved manure management; (b) an increase in the employment of skilled
     labor for the installation, operation, and maintenance of biogas digesters; and (c) a
     savings in households’ labor time by reducing the time needed to collect fuel wood.
     The project monitoring results indicate that all of the pre-set community
     development targets under the project have been reached or exceeded (Table 2).

9.   The successful project experience has been disseminated to other regions in China as
     well as worldwide, through on-site visits, a south-south CDM workshop, and various
     other channels. In January 2012, the lessons learned from the project was selected as
     Smart Lessons by the Bank competition process and published in Bank SmartLesson
     website. During project period more than 20 delegations from various provinces in
     China, as well as delegations and expert groups from numbers of Asian and African
     countries, have visited the project areas. The project has been replicated within
     China and in other countries.

Assessment of implementation performance: Satisfactory

10. All project institutional arrangements are fully in place in the project areas and all
    designed project activities have been completed; the biogas facilities show good
    operational performance and a functional and improved technical service network is
    in place. Project Management Offices (PMOs), responsible for the project
    management, are established at both prefecture and county levels. Staff numbers at
    each level have been stable; the relevant knowledge and project management
    capacity, which was built up through progressive training, are well maintained.

11. Supported by well-structured institutional arrangements and strong commitments
    from project agencies, project implementation has led to the installation and stable
    operation of all designed biogas digesters, with ER targets and community
    development targets reached or exceeded. Project implementation performance is
    therefore rated as satisfactory.




                                            35
12. Specifically, since May 2008, 33,000 biogas digester units have been installed and
    put into operation in 625 villages in 8 project counties (Jianshi, Badong, Lichuan,
    Xuanen, Laifeng, Enshi, Hefeng and Xianfeng Counties) in Enshi Prefecture, Hubei
    Province to appropriately treat the pig manure and generate cooking and heating
    energy for 33,000 households. The breakdown of the biogas installations is as
    follows: 10,082 biogas digesters with a reactor size of 8 m3; 14,181 biogas digesters
    with a reactor size of 10 m3; 4,167 biogas digesters with a reactor size of 12 m3; and
    4,570 biogas digesters with a reactor size of 15 m3.

13. The project was registered in February 2009 and four verifications were conducted
    for ERs generated between February 2009 and December 2012. For that period, a
    total of 213,942 tCO2e of CERs were delivered, achieving around 95.4% of the
    targeted delivery. The fifth project verification process that verifies ER delivery in
    2013 is currently underway. The project therefore, reached its performance objective
    in Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) as programmed. While most biogas
    digesters have been operating well with a stable annual delivery of CERs, about 5%
    of the installed bio digesters are out of operation mainly due to project households
    having moved to a city for employment purposes. The table below summarizes the
    delivered CERs under the project.

14. In addition to the reduction in GHG emissions, the project’s integration of biogas
    system management with farming and cooking has also delivered environmental and
    economic benefits to the targeted households, including the improvements in quality
    of life and increased disposable income. According to the monitoring results,
    significant community benefits included (a) the improvements in household
    sanitation status, reported by 88-91% of surveyed households; (b) a reduction in
    household labor, with around 36-55 labor days per year saved by each household; (c)
    an increase in job opportunities of around 660-760 person-days for local farmers;

    and (d) the use of biogas slurry to replace the use of livestock manure and chemical
    fertilizers on farmlands, with around 100% of biogas slurry applied to farmlands. In
    all cases, project targets were exceeded (Table 2).

15. During project implementation, special attention was paid to the provision of
    technical services and the development of monitoring systems. Various types of
    local technical extension and biogas service systems were developed, including one
    prefecture-level biogas association, 8 county-level rural energy service centers, 88
    township-level biogas service stations, and 1,025 village-level service networks to
    provide technical services, trainings, and biogas maintenance support to local
    farmers, including the 33,000 CDM project households. The technical service
    systems set at the county-to-village levels significantly improved institutional
    capacity in biogas management through the provision of technical training and
    services to local famers in the aspects of biogas installation, operation and
    maintenance; application of biogas slurry; and implementation of project safeguard
    policies and monitoring plans. The strengthened local capacity and timely technical
    services further ensured the stable operation and maintenance of biogas facilities in
    each of the project villages. Meanwhile, the established monitoring system enabled
    project quality control for the successful CER verifications and issuances.

16. The project also paid great attention to engaging poor farmers and women. The
    project counties are located in remote areas and all are nationally designated poverty
    counties, with around 20% of project villagers and households are below the poverty
    line. In the household training provided by the project, women constituted around
    55% of the participants. Project monitoring further indicates that the populations of


                                           37
    both women and children have been key project beneficiaries, with for example 4%
    and 2% reductions in the incidences of cough and diarrhea, respectively, among
    children.

17. In summary, the project performance has been very good, with key contributions to:
    (a) delivering environmental and economic benefits though the integration of biogas
    management with household farming and cooking; (b) implementing a
    comprehensive monitoring and evaluation protocol, including a central monitoring
    information system and effective organizational arrangements; and (c) supporting
    the stable operation and maintenance of the biogas digesters by using part of the
    carbon revenue (the payments for the CERs) to strengthen local technical extension
    and biogas service systems.

2.3 Monitoring and Reporting: Satisfactory

18. Successful issuances of CERs over the past four reporting years demonstrate the
    project’s full compliance with CDM monitoring requirements. Key features of the
    project’s satisfactorily implemented monitoring and reporting system are as follows:

    • Set up and use of a centralized monitoring system to ensure all required data is
      collected and maintained in a systematic manner.
    • Solid organizational arrangements among the different parties involved in the
      implementation. Responsibilities for project management were assigned to the
      counties, with quality control and overall coordination managed and coordinated
      by designated staff at township and village levels; daily data recording is the
      responsibility of the participating households.
    • Use of a sampling plan to ensure that a reasonable number and representative
      sample of households is randomly selected from the pool of 33,000 households on
      an annual basis.
    • Set up of a training system to cover training for all involved parties (ranging from
      the prefecture energy bureau to biogas digester users), including training on
      monitoring methodologies of CDM-related parameters record, data aggregation
      processes, and document and record filing.

2.4 Lessons learned

19. Importance of strong commitment by the provincial and local governments. One of
    the main drivers of the project has been the strong commitment by the provincial and
    local governments to pursue clean energy for rural households and improve rural
    environmental conditions. This commitment is demonstrated by the strong project
    management and systems in place, with financial support and technical assistance
    provided by lines of government agencies at provincial, prefectural, and county
    levels.
20. Benefits of integrating CDM operations into Bank loan investment projects. Another
    key reason for the smooth operation of the project as a CDM demonstration project
    is the integration, by the Bank team, of CDM operations into the Bank loan


                                           38
    investment project. The investment project’s efforts to strengthen institutional
    capacity and technical services provision, develop a sound monitoring system, and
    ensure proper maintenance with adequate budget support, have all greatly benefitted
    the CDM operation.

21. Successful use of carbon finance to support stable operations of biogas digesters.
    Carbon finance has played a vital role in the successful operational performance of
    the project by supporting the stable operation of individual digesters.. The stable
    carbon revenue stream has provided incentives for individual farmers to ensure good
    performance of the biogas facilities. Learning from CDM program’s performance-
    based payment process, namely that the payment would be based on the performance
    of biogas facility operation, Hubei government is piloting a similar performance
    rewarding mechanism by providing participating households a subsidy of RMB 150-
    260 (up to annual households biogas consumption) per year to encourage maximum
    operation of their biogas digesters.

22. The success of the project can also be largely attributed to good maintenance and
    monitoring through the project’s network of technical assistance and maintenance
    services. During operation, biogas facilities usually require more maintenance work
    than other renewable energy facilities (such as solar power), creating a major
    challenge for biogas projects to ensure sufficient resources for maintenance and
    repairs. By using part of the carbon revenue to support the extension of biogas
    community service network to the village level, the project was able to significantly
    strengthen the provision of training and maintenance services for households at
    remote locations, thus ensuring the sustainability of the project.

23. Including and encouraging women participation in biogas management. Over the
    course of the project, many female family members were trained and educated in the
    use and maintenance of biogas facilities. Women often spend considerable time at
    home and typically take care of cooking; they are also usually the first point of
    contact with technical and maintenance support teams. As a result of the trainings—
    along with helpful brochures and pictures (with phone numbers that could be posted
    in the kitchen)—the women are able to carry out routine inspections of the systems
    and identify problems that require technical support. According to the project
    progress report, women accounted for 55 % of the trained farmers in project counties.

24. Careful selection of household-based biogas project areas to limit the impacts of
    urbanization. Rapid changes in social and economic environments impact the level
    of PDO achievement of household-based projects. For instance, continued increased
    large amount of urban infrastructure construction and the emergence of new towns
    and cities result in the migration of young labor out of the rural area to city and the
    relocation of some households to the centralized residential buildings. However, for
    the project, though the impacts of urbanization have being gradually increased and
    emerged over past years, as the project areas are located in the remote mountainous
    areas, only a small numbers of households moving to cities and/or concentrated rural
    residential buildings, which largely limited the impact of urbanization on the biogas



                                            39
    operation. Therefore, careful consideration of the project areas is important to ensure
    the long-term stable operation of household-based biogas digesters and CER
    generation.

3. BANK AND PROJECT ENTITY PERFORMANCE

3.1 Assessment and rating of overall Bank performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

25. The overall Bank performance for the preparation and implementation of the carbon
    finance operation is rated as satisfactory. This is reflected in the smooth project
    preparation, registration, verification and CER issuance over the past 5 years (2009 –
    2013). In particular, the task team has successfully supported the innovative project
    by: (a) bringing in top international and national experts to support project design
    and implementation (including the development of a new methodology); (b)
    promptly identifying issues and difficulties and providing sound advice to address
    those problems; and (c) focusing on capacity building for all project implementation
    agencies to ensure sound project preparation and implementation. The project’s
    validation and verification processes were facilitated by experts from the Bank’s
    Carbon Finance Unit, who engaged throughout the project cycle to provide technical
    assistance and maintain the dialogue with the client and Designated Operational
    Entities (DOE).

3.2 Assessment and rating of overall project entity performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

26. Overall project entity performance is rated as satisfactory in terms of its (a) timely
    provision of funding for project preparation, implementation, and operation; (b) full
    compliance with project safeguards requirements; (c) high reliability of data
    measured and collected; (d) compliance with CDM operational and monitoring
    requirements; and (e) efficient maintenance of a database of technical and
    operational information to enable annual monitoring by the Bank as well as
    verification by DOEs. In particular, the local governmental agencies made great
    efforts in developing a comprehensive monitoring system and technical service
    networks to ensure the stable operation of the biogas digesters of 33,000 households
    (across more than 600 villages in 8 counties), to secure a stable ER delivery. The
    well-functioned monitoring system has also demonstrated best practice in biogas
    program management in biogas sector.

4. COMMENTS FROM PROJECT ENTITY AND OTHER PARTNERS

4.1 Project entity

27. The project agencies consider the project’s Implementation and Completion Results
    Report (ICR) fully acceptable. Gaining carbon income, as an incentive, has greatly
    encouraged households to ensure smooth biogas operations and maintain well-


                                           40
      functioning biogas technical services, which does not only promote income
      generation from carbon trade, but also enhances project environmental benefits and
      improves biogas management.

28. In addition, through successful CDM registration and CER issuance, Enshi biogas
    sector has established itself as a credible results-oriented partner for collaboration
    and innovation. It has also well positioned itself to become a major contributor in
    China’s emerging domestic Emission Trading Scheme.

N/A


5. JUSTIFICATION FOR MOVING TO THE SECOND PHASE (CARBON
FINANCE MONITORING PHASE) AND SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

5.1 Compliance with safeguards and implementation challenges in the first phase
(supervision phase)

29. Overall, the project has contributed significantly to reducing rural pollution,
    including indoor pollution, by the anaerobic treatment of animal manure and the use
    of the generated biogas to replace coal and wood fuel for cooking and heating of
    local households. As confirmed during project supervision missions undertaken
    during the implementation period, the project fully complied with the Bank’s
    safeguards policies. The project agencies and households have strictly implemented
    the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and the Ethnic Minority Development
    Plan (EMDP). Biogas slurry application and biogas facility construction and
    operation have largely generated positive environmental impacts; the potential social
    and environmental concerns were appropriately addressed and the safe use of biogas
    is ensured. From a social perspective, no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement
    was occurred during project preparation and implementation. The land for the
    construction of biogas digesters are the project households’ housing plots or their
    nearby farming (vegetable/fruit) fields. Good progress has also been made in the
    implementation of the EMDP. The farmers, including ethnical minority people, have
    had an equal opportunity to participate in the project and have benefited from the
    carbon revenue, trainings, and technical services provided under the project.

5.2 Project entity’s capacity to carry out key functions related to safeguard
requirements

30. The project entity has demonstrated sufficient capacity to carry out key functions
    related to the safeguards requirements. The PMOs at the different levels have been
    able to ensure a stable number of employees over a long period of time with
    sufficient financial resources. With the project’s well-established project
    management systems and the project entity’s accumulated project experience, it is


                                           41
    believed that the project entity is capable of sustaining project operations to meet the
    Bank requirements for the second phase.

5.3 Potential issues in post completion operation, including project entity’s capacity
and ability of the project to deliver the contracted emission reductions.

31. Project operational performance has been stable during the project implementation
    period and this performance is expected to continue. Therefore, no technical, social,
    and environmental issues are expected to put future delivery of contracted CERs at
    risk. The only factor that could have a potential impact on emission reductions
    generation is the phasing out of a small percentage of biogas digesters (around 5%)
    due to the relocation of rural households in some areas. However, this risk is limited
    and projected as manageable given the geographical location of the project areas,
    which minimizes the impacts of urbanization on the project. The majority of project
    households are expected to maintain a stable operation of their biogas digesters in
    the future.

5.4 Justification for moving to the second phase (carbon finance monitoring phase)

32. The project has been successfully implemented: since project commissioning in
    2008, biogas facility operations have been stable and the issuance of CERs over five
    years has proven to be consistent with the project design; all management structures
    and technical protocols have been put in place; and no major risk exists for
    complying with the limited safeguard requirements related to biogas digester
    operation and maintenance. Therefore, the project is ready to be transferred to the
    second phase: the monitoring phase.

33. 5.5 Recommendations and guidance for project monitoring in the second phase
    (carbon finance monitoring phase) As the technical services for biogas digester
    operations are in place and the households have obtained the relevant skills for
    operating the biogas system (including biogas slurry application), the focus in the
    second phase should be on safeguard compliance—the continued monitoring of the
    implementation of the EMP and the disbursement of carbon revenue. The EMP
    includes detailed environmental management measures that the project households
    should be undertaking during the project operation stage. As the EMDP mainly deals
    with the community consultation and development during the project design and
    implementation phases, in the operation stage, its monitoring should focus more on
    the timely carbon revenue delivery to ethnic minority people.

34. The project agencies have committed that the PMOs at Enshi prefectural and project
    county levels will be maintained with sufficient financial resources to continue their
    responsibility for the project’s verification process, technical assistance provision,
    and safeguard policy implementation during the project monitoring period. The ER
    reporting requirements, which incorporate the monitoring of the EMP
    implementation and carbon income distribution, were also agreed with project
    agencies. The Bank recommended that field visits are carried out once every year by



                                            42
    the Bank team to ensure that the project will continue to comply with the Bank
    safeguard policies; that its motoring system is operating well; and that carbon
    revenue is being properly disbursed to the participating households, including ethnic
    minority groups. The Table 3 below listed the monitoring requirements
    recommended in Phase 2.

In order to deal with continuing environmental deterioration, increase farmers’ income
and improve the inadequate technical support, management, and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system of the National Rural Biogas Program (NRBP), the Ministry of
Agriculture cooperated with the World Bank in the implementation of the China Eco-
Farming Project. This project involved a total 470,141 rural households in 3,241 villages,
490 townships, 65 counties and 25 cities, in Anhui, Hunan and Hubei provinces,
Chongqing municipality and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region. The project combined
the use of World Bank loan (US$ 120 million) with the investment of NRBP, for a total
investment of US$ 487 million. Project implementation lasted for 5 years, becoming
effective in May 2009 and closing on June 30, 2014. The design and implementation of
the project are highly consistent with national policies and industrial development
planning, as well as the World Bank’s country partnership strategy.

The project development objective is to deliver direct environmental and economic
benefits from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In
addition, the project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through methane
combustion and reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas. Specifically
the project included three components: Component 1: Integrated Eco-Farming Systems,
aiming to demonstrate technical best practices for biogas development for replication;
Component 2: Local Technical Extension and Biogas Service System; and Component 3:
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. In addition, a Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) pilot program under this project was established in Enshi, Hubei,
which aims to reduce greenhouse gases by changing traditional manure management
methods and recovering methane from manure for the households’ thermal energy needs
by installing and operating biogas digesters, and to complete carbon credit trading.
In the course of the project implementation and in view of changes to project conditions
such as central government grants, unit costs of construction and exchange rate, while
adhering to the principle of maintaining project development objectives, components, the
overall investment and the total size of the loan, adjustments were made to construction
sites, scale of construction, unit prices of reimbursement, and M&E indicators.
Meanwhile, the project implementation process was affected by various factors, including
the increase of central government grants, the increasing number of migrant workers, and
national incentives promoting large scale animal husbandry production. Nevertheless,
through the coordination and concerted efforts of central and local project management
offices and relevant government agencies the five provinces successfully overcame the
effect of various negative factors, minimized risks, and smoothly completed the project.

During the five year implementation, the five project provinces completed various project
activities as planned. The construction of “one biogas system + three improvements” was
completed for 470,141 households. Water supply was improved for 155,560 households
and 1770.8 km village road were built. A 5-Level technical extension service involving
provinces, cities/prefectures, countries, townships and villages was established. Province,
city/prefecture and county project management offices were set up, and office facilities


                                            48
were improved to fulfil various project management responsibilities successfully. Sound
project M&E systems were established and the stated project outputs, outcomes and
development objectives have all been achieved.

The project has achieved fruitful economic, social and environment benefits and the
health and quality of life of farmers have been effectively improved. First, through the
“one biogas system + three improvements”, the sanitation conditions of rural households
have been improved by changing their previous conditions, which was characterized by
smoky interiors of homes, and toilets shared by humans and animals. Second, the
disposable income of rural households has increased. The implementation of the project
reduced the use of conventional fuel such as coal and firewood, etc., substituted chemical
fertilizer and pesticide with solid and liquid bio-slurry, reduced time spent on gathering
fuel and cooking, and reduced spending on chemical fertilizer and pesticide which, in
turn, effectively increased the incomes of rural households. Third, greenhouse gas
emission has been decreased. In the project, toxic gas such as methane produced by
livestock and poultry manure has been collected. It was burned and emitted in the form of
CO2, which effectively reduced greenhouse gas emission. Fourth, throughout project
implementation special attention was paid to women, ethnic minorities and poor
households. During the project a large number of women in rural households, ethnic
minorities and poor households participated in project implementation and received
trainings conducted by the project. Women in rural households have saved time on
housework and their labor efforts have been reduced, which increased their income and
savings and improved their knowledge on environment protection, technical skills, and
other aspects.

The Central Project Management Office and provincial project offices have also gained
valuable World Bank project experience through project implementation. For the design
and implementation of future projects, they could fully utilize, promote and demonstrate
the experience and concepts of project design and management used by the World Bank.
First of all, the priority assigned by government officials to the project, sound
institutional structures and proactive steering provided by World Bank were prerequisites
for the success of this project.

Second, scientific project design and the mature, standardized management practices of
the World Bank were essential for the success of this project.

Third, the project has fully respected farmers’ wishes and carried out extensive
informational campaigns so that rural households could fully understand the economic,
social and environmental benefits brought by the project. The voluntary participation of
rural households was vital to achieving the project objectives.

Fourth, the project combined biogas construction and agricultural production, focused on
the establishment of technical service systems and delivery of training, emphasized the
establishment of M&E systems, and developed quantitative appraisal system, which were
all indispensable for the successful implementation of the project and outcome
monitoring. This was a major highlight of the project.



                                           49
This project, indeed, has also left us with some lessons. First, personnel changes among
managers and staff members of project offices affected the consistency of the project.
Second, it was discovered that a few counties of a few provinces withheld project funds,
gave sub-standard subsidies and diverted project funds. After discovering such problems
the responsible project counties/cities promptly rectified the abovementioned problems.

In summary, the performance evaluations of both the Bank and the Borrower are
satisfactory. From project design to implementation, and through to completion of the
project, various state ministries, governments of project provinces, central and local
project management offices and World Bank have all played crucial roles at different
levels and from different perspectives. The National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Agriculture have all
proactively participated in project application, negotiation and signing of agreements,
resolved the provision of project counterpart funds through coordination, established a
central project management office, and devised project implementation and management
arrangements. Local governments of all five provinces have also invested abundant
manpower, material and financial resources, which laid foundation for the smooth
approval, implementation and completion of the project. During project implementation
both central and local project management offices played important roles in coordination
and communication, assisted World Bank supervision missions, conducted trainings on
project management knowledge, and promptly finished and submitted project plan and
reports, including progress, finance, auditing and M&E, and completion report. Both
central and local project management offices were highly effective, which guaranteed the
smooth implementation of each project activity. During the project design and
preparation stage, the World Bank did a large amount of work on planning and
deployment of project components, progress plan and establishing an impact M&E
system. During the implementation of the project the World Bank also sent out teams for
11 supervision missions to promptly rectify issues and provide copious constructive
comments, which played a significant role in the successful implementation and smooth
completion of the project.
