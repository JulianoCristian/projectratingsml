Specific lessons indicate\n            that the experience of demand-driven training programs was\n            successful, since requests for training originated from\n            micro-enterprises, and responsive, skills upgrading programs\n            provided an improved productivity among those enterprises.\n            Regrettably, the Bank's operational procedures\n            precluded the full disbursement of funds over the six-year\n            period, to the training support fund, an issue which needs\n            to be reviewed, and simplified. Moreover, although some\n            training financing sources exist, diversification of\n            financing methods, and alternatives for private financing\n            are still needed. It is further suggested that selection of\n            construction firms should follow a rigorous process, to\n            avoid unnecessary delays, as proven by the difficulties\n            encountered in this project, due to the firm's\n            difficulties with liquidity in foreign currency. General\n            lessons reinforce that institutional, and policy reforms\n            follow a political process, and it is this\n            process-time-frame which should be precisely estimated, to\n            avoid falling behind schedule, due to possible delayed\n            adoption of policy statutes. Additionally, performance\n            indicators should be specified, in measurable terms, before\n            implementation; similarly, impact assessment of training\n            programs should be built into the implementation plan."}, "docdt": "2001-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
