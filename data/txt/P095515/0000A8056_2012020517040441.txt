                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services; (b) to strengthen the incentive
                         framework for efficiency and focus on results between the national level and the Eligible Provinces and among Eligible Provinces and service providers by linking
                         financing to both services actually rendered to the target population and to the achievement of the MCHIP results as reflected by the selected ten tracers of the
                         Trazadoras Matrix.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Progress on the achievement of the project objectives is moderately unsatisfactory, since only three out of the eleven PDO indicators were fully achieved by October 2011, and the
                         remaining eight are still in progress. PDO indicators related to Plan Nacer implementation and the strengthening of the new incentive framework are on track: by the end of October
                         2011, the number of beneficiaries was around 1.71 million, representing 84.3% of the eligible population. In Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions (the original Phase II provinces),
                         coverage was on average 83.3% with around 1.15 million active beneficiaries, while in the Northern Region, coverage was 86% with more than 560,000 enrollees. In addition, the

                         percentage of affiliated health providers was over 87% and annual performance agreements were implemented successfully in all participating provinces. Achievement of the lowest
                         tracer's threshold increased: from 64% in December 2010 to 67% in April 2011 in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions (audited figures), and from 80% to 88% in the Northern
                         Region (unaudited figures). However, increasing access to health services has been slower than expected especially in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions due to difficulties in
                         billing health services, registration at the provider level and an inadequate use of the information generated by the project.

                         The Mid Term Review mission was carried out on November 7-22nd, 2011 to assess project implementation status, discuss the main project challenges and achievements, and
                         agree on the way to move forward and achieve PDOs. With respect to the challenges faced by the PDO indicator goals related to increasing access to health services, it was decided
                         that it is necessary to provide additional information on the causes that explain the current performance in order to assess a restructuring proposal to modify certain indicators and
                         their goals. Therefore, the Government and the Bank agreed on maintaining the current PDO indicator goals, and working on the implementation of an action plan to improve health
                         outcomes given that there is only one year of Project implementation left and the maternal and health insurance support will continue under the new Provincial Public Health
                         Insurance Development Project. In addition, a reallocation of loan proceeds was agreed in order to ensure adequate support to the provision of the basic health service package until
                         the end of project implementation and to avoid increasing funds in the congenital heart disease account that are not used by the Accredited Health Centers.
                         The Government is working on the preparation of the project restructuring request which is expected to be approved by the Bank in February 2012.
