development objectives of the Second\n            Adaptable Program Loan for the Provincial Maternal-Child\n            Health Investment Project for Argentina are to (a) increase\n            access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic\n            health services; and (b) strengthen the incentive framework\n            for efficiency and focus on results between the national\n            level and the eligible provinces and among eligible\n            provinces and service providers by linking financing to both\n            services actually rendered to the target population and to\n            the achievement of the Maternal and Child Health Investment\n            Program (MCHIP) results as reflected by the selected ten\n            tracers of the Trazadoras matrix. This paper is the\n            restructuring of the project to reallocate funds between\n            categories of expenditure. The reallocation will transfer\n            funds from categories, including capitation payments for\n            primary health care services in the Northern, Central,\n            Patagonia and Cuyo regions and for consultant services. The\n            project's overall implementation progress is moderately\n            satisfactory. As of October 2011, the number of\n            beneficiaries of plan Nacer program was around 1.71 million,\n            representing 84.3 percent of the eligible population,\n            exceeding the end of project target of 80 percent. In\n            addition, the percentage of affiliated health providers was\n            over 87 percent and annual performance agreements were\n            implemented successfully in all participating provinces;\n            both indicators are above the end of project targets. The\n            reallocation is necessary to: ensure adequate support to the\n            provision of the basic health service package and the\n            implementation of an action plan for increasing the\n            feasibility of achieving the related health outcome\n            indicators targets by the end of project implementation in\n            all participating provinces; ensure an efficient use of loan\n            resources; and support the adequate performance of the\n            program and project implementation units."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
