Provincial\n            Maternal-Child Health Investment Project in Support of the\n            Second Phase of the Provincial Maternal-Child Health Program\n            for Argentina were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: for\n            Argentina, and other countries with a federal institutional\n            framework, it is critical to take diversity in terms of\n            local institutional capacity into account and adjust the\n            project accordingly. An in-depth analysis is required to\n            identify differences in local capabilities and develop a\n            strategy on how to address the specific circumstances of\n            different provinces or localities. Results-Based Financing\n            (RBF) can work well even in a federal system, but all major\n            actors at different levels need to receive performance\n            payments, and the different sets of performance indicators\n            at different levels need to be aligned. Close engagement\n            with actors at lower levels, including health providers, can\n            make a large difference to overall performance of an RBF\n            program. A strong focus on information systems (including\n            for reporting and billing) is key for the success of a\n            larger-scale RBF program. Another reason for the better\n            performance of first phase provinces could have been that\n            they had more time to implement the project. The time frame\n            for second phase provinces was likely too short and better\n            results could have been achieved if the project period was\n            longer. If the project time frame could not be changed, then\n            it will have been better to be less ambitious with the\n            indicator targets. More broadly, provincial ownership and\n            institutional sustainability have been growing but will take\n            time to be fully entrenched."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
