                         The project development objectives are: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services; (b) to strengthen the
                         incentive framework for efficiency and focus on results between the national level and the Eligible Provinces and among Eligible Provinces and service
                         providers by linking financing to both services actually rendered to the target population and to the achievement of the MCHIP results as reflected by the
                         selected ten tracers of the Trazadoras Matrix.

                         Plan Nacer implementation and the strengthening of the new incentive framework are on track: by end April 2011, the number of beneficiaries was around 1.57 million, representing
                         78% of the eligible population. However, increasing access to health services has been slower especially in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions due to difficulties in health service

                         billing and registration processes at the provider level. Most management and input targets have been achieved.

                         Disbursements need to improve. After four years of project implementation, disbursement is only 55%, mainly because of implementation difficulties in three of the most important
                         provinces in term of number of eligible population (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Cordoba). Although loan execution improved by end 2010 as a result of the implementation of
                         Universal Family Allowances policy and the inclusion of Phase I provinces as eligible provinces, project implementation during the first semester of 2011 remained constant mainly
                         because national transfers to Phase I provinces with loan proceeds have been suspended since the technical audit has not yet been contracted for these provinces.
