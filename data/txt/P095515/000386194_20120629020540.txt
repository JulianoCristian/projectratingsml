A. SUMMARY

2.     This paper proposes the restructuring of the Argentina, AR Provincial
Maternal-Child Health Investment APL 2, Loan Number 7409-AR, P095515 to
reallocate funds between Categories of expenditure. The reallocation will transfer
funds from Category 2 (Goods), Category 3 (Training), Category 4(c) and Category 6
(Unallocated) to other Categories, including Capitation Payments for primary health care
services in the Northern, Central, Patagonia and Cuyo regions and for Consultant
Services.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The Bank’s Board approved a US$300 million loan for the Provincial
Maternal Child Health Investment APL 2 Project on November 2, 2006 to assist the
Borrower in the implementation of the second phase of the Provincial Maternal-Child
Health Program (Plan Nacer). The Loan became effective on May 31, 2007.
Subsequently, a Project restructuring was approved on May 10, 2010 to: (i) reallocate
proceeds of eligible expenditure among different categories of the Loan; (ii) change the
percentages of expenditures to be financed under Category 4 of the Project (Capitation
Payments); and (iii) include Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Jujuy, Misiones,
Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucuman as Eligible Provinces. As of June 25, 2012, the
Project has disbursed US$275.67 million of the loan amount (91.89%), and has an
undisbursed balance of US$24.33 million (8.11%).

4.      The Project development objectives (PDO) are to: (a) increase access for
eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services; and (b) strengthen the
incentive framework for efficiency and focus on results between the national level and
the eligible Provinces and among eligible Provinces and service providers by linking
financing to both services actually rendered to the target population and the achievement
of the program results measured by the selected ten tracers of the Trazadoras Matrix.

5.       The Project's overall implementation progress is moderately satisfactory. As
of October 2011, the number of beneficiaries of Plan Nacer program was around 1.71
million, representing 84.3% of the eligible population, exceeding the end of Project target
of 80%. In addition, the percentage of affiliated health providers was over 87% and
annual performance agreements were implemented successfully in all participating
provinces; both indicators are above the end of Project targets. Finally, the percentage of
tracers’ targets achieved by the participating provinces in last year’s billing period
increased: from 64% in December 2010 to 67% in April 20111 in Centro, Patagonia and
Cuyo Regions, and from 80% to 88% in the Northern Region and is on track (the final
target is 70% for APL 2 Provinces).

6.     However, progress on the PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory given the
slower than expected progress on indicators related to increasing access to health
services, especially in the Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions. Only four out of the
eleven PDO indicators were fully achieved as of October 2011 but progress is being

                                            6
made on the remaining seven. The main reasons for the underachievement are related to
difficulties in billing health services, underregistration and misreporting of interventions
at the provider level. However, further information on the causes that explain the current
performance of health indicators needs to be gathered and analyzed to propose additional
changes. Therefore, and because there is less than one year of project implementation
remaining, PDO indicators targets will not be adjusted. Instead, the Government will
implement an action plan to address the main issues identified and improve health
outcomes prior to project completion (December 2012). In addition, support to maternal
and child health insurance will continue under the Provincial Public Health Insurance
Development Project, Loan 8062-AR and thus Plan Nacer’s PDO targets are likely to be
achieved during the implementation of this project with a new more realistic timeframe.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.        The proposed reallocation is necessary to:

     a)     Ensure adequate support to the provision of the basic health service
            package and the implementation of an action plan for increasing the
            feasibility of achieving the related health outcome indicators targets by the
            end of project implementation in all participating provinces. With the
            implementation of the Universal Child Allowance and Pregnancy Allowance
            policies, which made enrollment in Plan Nacer a condition to receive a
            subsidy, the number of beneficiaries increased more rapidly than expected (by
            40 pp. in the case of children under six and 27 pp. in the case of pregnant
            women as of November 2011). Thus, the implementation of the maternal and
            child health insurance program accelerated, making it necessary to increase the
            amount of loan proceeds associated with the basic health service package to
            ensure adequate provision to Plan Nacer beneficiaries by December 2012. In
            addition, channeling loan proceeds to the provision of the basic health service
            package creates the financial space to support the action plan linked to the
            achievement of the PDO indicator targets.

     b)     Ensure an efficient use of loan resources: From April 2010, the Government
            decided to include congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnosis and treatment
            services into the Plan Nacer benefit package. However, because per capita
            rates were overestimated and capacity to bill these services is lower than
            expected, the loan resources intended for this purpose will not be spent before
            the closing date. Excess funds from this component can therefore be made
            available for other activities.

     c)     Support the adequate performance of the program and Project
            Implementation Units, through the contract extension of an independent
            technical audit and the completion of evaluation studies and baseline analysis
            envisioned under the first phase of the program that will serve as inputs to
            improve Project implementation.
