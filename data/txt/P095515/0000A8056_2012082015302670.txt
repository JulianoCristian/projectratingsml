                         Plan Nacer implementation and Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators related to strengthening the new incentive framework are on track: by the end of May 2012, the
                         number of beneficiaries was around 1.88 million, representing 91.8% of the eligible population. In Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions coverage was on average 91% with around
                         1.28 million active beneficiaries, while in the Northern Region, coverage was 93.8% with more than 598,000 enrollees. In addition, the percentage of affiliated health providers was
                         over 91% and annual performance agreements were implemented successfully in all participating provinces. Achievement of the lowest tracer's threshold increased: from 67% in

                         April 2011 to 72.7% in December 2011 in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions (audited figures), and from 88% to 88.9% in the Northern Region (unaudited figures). However,
                         increasing access to health services continues being slower than expected especially in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions due to difficulties in billing health services, under
                         registration and misreporting of interventions at the provider level.

                         As it was agreed during the Mid Term Review mission, the government is implementing an action plan to improve the Project performance in terms of health results by the end of
                         project closing date in December 2012. By June 2012, some of the activities included in this plan have been already completed, while others are still ongoing. In addition, in July
                         2012 a reallocation of loans proceeds was approved to ensure adequate support to the provision of the basic health service package and the implementation of the above-mentioned
                         action plan.
