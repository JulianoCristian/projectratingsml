"The Plan Nacer (Plan) is a program whose\n            main objective is \"to improve health coverage and\n            quality of care for the population without social work,\n            helping in reducing maternal and child mortality.\" The\n            Plan seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of health\n            services to achieve better results in reducing morbidity and\n            infant and maternal mortality. One of the most innovative\n            aspects of the Plan is the inclusion of an assessment of its\n            own impact on the health and welfare of the target\n            population. This assessment began with the completion, in\n            2006, of a survey on the socio-health of the target\n            population and the supply of public health services, the\n            LBAPL1 (Baseline Evaluation of the Impact of Phase 1 of the\n            Plan Nacer), covering a sample of 60 health centers by\n            province in each of the nine districts in the country that\n            make up the northeastern and northwestern regions. This\n            Final Report collects and reorganizes the information in\n            previous partial reports. The report is organized as\n            follows: Chapter 3 describes briefly the main\n            characteristics of the sample chosen for the realization of\n            the LBAPL1 and questionnaires that gave rise to the\n            databases used. Chapter 4 presents and analyzes the timely\n            filed information about socio-demographic indicators of the\n            eligible population. Chapter 5 deals specifically with\n            aspects of various kinds of risk factors which affect the\n            target population. Chapter 6 analyzes the offering of public\n            health services for birth control and infant health in the\n            designated provinces. Chapter 7 extends the analysis of data\n            collected from the integration of the information in the\n            previous chapter through hypothetical surveys and vignettes\n            to review the quality of care made. Chapter 8 gathers data\n            from the main health outcomes related to maternal and child\n            health collected by the LBAPL1 survey and puts them in\n            context according to the alternative sources listed above.\n            Finally, chapter 9 gathers the information already presented\n            in the report on health care gaps from the analysis of the\n            differences in access to perinatal and child health care."}, "docdt": "2012-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
