                         The project development objectives are: (a) to increase access by eligible uninsured mothers and children to basic health services; (b) to strengthen the
                         incentive framework for efficiency and focus on results between the national level and the Eligible Provinces and among Eligible Provinces and service

                         PDO indicators related to Plan Nacer implementation and the strengthening of the new incentive framework are on track: by the end of December 2010 the number of beneficiaries
                         reached approximately 1.48 million covering the 72% of the eligible population. However, PDO indicators related to increase access to health services show a low performance

                         especially in Centro, Patagonia and Cuyo Regions due to difficulties in health service billing and registration processes at provider level. Most management and input targets have
                         been achieved.
                         Disbursements need to improve. After three years and a half of project implementation disbursements reach only 55%. This situation is mainly explained by the slow development of
                         Plan Nacer in three of the most important provinces in term of number of eligible population (which also have municipal health organization): Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Cordoba
                         provinces. However, since the implementation of Universal Family Allowances policy (which made enrollment in Plan Nacer a condition to access this benefit) and the inclusion of
                         APL I provinces as eligible provinces and congenital heart disease interventions to Plan Nacer s health services package, loan execution started to accelerate.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         According to the Loan Agreement amendment signed on April 26, 2010, APL I provinces became eligible provinces of APL II under the name of Northern Region; and Congenital
                         Heart Disease (CCC) Interventions and Maternal and Child Care Services were incorporated as new possible practices to be financed through the loan under a new disbursement
                         category. The team will continue supporting MOH on its efforts to improve disbursements.
