                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Adult HIV prevalence continues to be stable in Ethiopia this year. The country has paid increasing attention to MARPs and community-based interventions. The Ethiopia second
                         Strategic Plan for Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Response (SPM II) has identified MARPs and community-based interventions as priorities. Delays in conducting DHS and BSS have
                         caused a problem to more accurately measure the trend of HIV knowledge and healthy behavior among MARPs. However, data from other recent studies have indicated promising
                         signs, for example:
                         --Percentage of young women (15-24) who reported that they had sex in the last 12 months reported using condom during the last sexual intercourse reached 45.3% (2008 Health

                         Project implementation has been on track over the last six months. Activities were carried out as planned particularly under the community-response component. All the major
                         procurement items were completed. As of November 8, 2010 disbursement has reached 85.54 from 73.1% in June 2010, an increase of 12.44% in five months. All the project funds
                         are expected to be utilized by the closing date of the project (June 30, 2011).

                         The next joint integrated supervision mission is scheduled for early February 2011. The team agreed with HAPCO to align the Bank mission with the joint mission.
