                         [Background]
                         Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa and one of the poorest countries in the world, was significantly affected by the HIV epidemic. The first AIDS cases in Ethiopia
                         were reported in 1986, and early data indicated a progressive rise of HIV prevalence from 1% in 1989 to 3.5% in 2005. An estimated 1.32 million Ethiopians lived with HIV/AIDS, and


                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 6
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR3325



                         there were around 128,900 new HIV infections in 2005 (meaning 353 per day). As a result of the epidemic, life expectancy in Ethiopia has fallen and is expected to drop to 50 years
                         by 2010 from a previous estimate of 59 years. The country also has one o f the largest populations of children orphaned by AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa, currently estimated at
                         744,100.

                         Ethiopia's concentrated epidemic has been driven by high risk groups, which include young and unmarried women, commercial sex workers, and mobile populations.

                         The Bank was one of the first partner agencies to finance the national response to the epidemic. The first Bank-financed Ethiopia Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project (EMSAPI) became
                         effective in 2001 and closed in December 2006, which helped the country expand access to prevention, treatment, and care services in all regions.

                         This project is a follow-up project to particularly focus on prevention of HIV among high-risk groups, and accounts for the contributions of other partners (e.g., Global Fund) who have
                         been heavily financing other areas (e.g., treatment, and care & support) . The main objectives of the project are to (a) increase access to prevention services for youth, in particular
                         females aged 15-24, and other most-at-risk groups; and (b) sustain access to care and support for PLWHA and orphans undertaken in EMSAP I.

                         [Project Outcomes]
                         Adult HIV prevalence has been stabilized, even showing signs of declining in some regions. Based on most recent antenatal care sentinel HIV surveillance, the HIV prevalence
                         among antenatal care clients in 2009 is estimated to be 2.6%, down from 3.3% in 2007. This project has contributed to the achievement in a significant way: (i) The project supported
                         pilot initiatives that were later taken up by other donors; (ii) The epidemiological synthesis that the project promoted as a covenant has provided critical information to the formulation
                         of national response to HIV; and (iii) It provided financing on preventive activities when there is lack of attention on prevention.

                         The project has achieved its objective indicators, based on a special household survey conducted recently to measure the progress of the project:

                         #        Percentage of young people aged 15-24 who both correctly identify ways the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission is
                         found to be 81%, achieving beyond the original target of 75%

                         #         Percentage of young women and men reporting the use of condom during the last sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner in the last 12 months is 88% beyond the
                         original 50% target.

                         #        Percentage of sex workers who report using condom with their most recent client (of those surveyed having sex with any clients in the last 12 months) is 97.8% (the target is
                         98%).

                         [Implementation Status]
                         The project has completed the planned activities in all the three components: (i) Program coordination and capacity building, (ii) Multi-sectoral support; and (iii) Local response fund.
                         Highlights of the activities include:

                         #        Condom distribution reached 173 million in 2010/11 up from 127 million in2009/10. 16, 779,011 condoms were procured and distributed using EMSAPII resources.

                         #        9.8 million people were counseled and tested for HIV in 2010/11 up from 9.4 million in 2009/10 which is more than the target of 700,000
                         #        Community conversations on HIV knowledge and behavior were conducted in 15,591 Kebeles.

                         The project also contributed to the national strategy for HIV and AIDS control. The Ethiopia second Strategic Plan for Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Response (SPM II) has identified most-
                         at-risk groups and community-based interventions as priorities. In addition, EMSAP II, together with EMSAP I, played a key role in establishing HIV multi-sector response systems
                         and procedures from national to woreda level particularly in financial management and supervision/reporting instruments. Part of the GF grants has used the systems established by
                         EMSAP for implementation and disbursement purposes, which reflects the lasting impact provided by EMSAP II on the country's HIV control system.

                         During the implementation of the project, staff shortage and turnover have caused delays particularly in fiduciary areas (e.g., submission of audit reports, settling of advance funds to
                         regions). In addition, the delay in DHS completion has affected timely evaluation of the project objectives.
