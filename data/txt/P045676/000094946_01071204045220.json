The successful\n            implementation of the project owes to several factors:\n            facilitation, and the necessary impetus provided by the\n            preceding operations, particularly their broad coverage, and\n            programmatic structure; the useful mechanism of a\n            single-tranche disbursement operation, which provides clear\n            understanding on prior actions to be taken by the\n            Government; and, the effective dialogue among counterparts\n            at all stages of the program, as well as the support of\n            strong Government commitment. However, in terms of outcome,\n            the stagnant growth rate of the economy, hinders poverty\n            alleviation, and remains a persistent concern. While the\n            Government continues to meet the challenges of maintaining\n            macroeconomic stability, the volatility of the economy\n            increases commensurately, with the security situation in the\n            region, translating into less-than-anticipated domestic, and\n            foreign investments. Recommendations suggest: conducting an\n            in-depth study on the growth constraints, and obstacles of\n            the country's economy; undertaking the Bank's\n            Business Environment Survey, to obtain the viewpoint for an\n            enabling environment for the private sector; and, pursuing\n            public sector reforms, focused on public investment\n            programs, institutional arrangements for budgetary\n            decision-making, and increasing productivity of investments."}, "docdt": "2001-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
