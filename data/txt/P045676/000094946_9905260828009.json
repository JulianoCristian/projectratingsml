The loan supports a set\n            of trade, privatization, financial sector, and regulatory\n            reforms. It further facilitates trade, fosters integration\n            with world markets, and reduces administrative obstacles\n            that raise the cost of trading activity through streamlining\n            customs procedures for exports and the planned conversion of\n            the entire Aqaba area into a fully developed free port. It\n            supports a broad program of financial sector reform\n            initiatives designed to enhance the soundness and efficiency\n            of the banking system and promote the development of capital\n            market and long-term savings institutions. It improves\n            banking competition and supervision and increases the\n            efficiency of financial intermediation through modernization\n            of the institutional and legislative set-up. It encourages\n            long-term savings and promotes development of new financial\n            instruments and markets. It facilitates entry and improves\n            incentives for domestic and foreign investors. Through\n            privatization, it improves opportunities for private sector\n            firms, increases competition, and allows the Government to\n            concentrate on its core functions. The loan will be\n            disbursed in one tranche."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
