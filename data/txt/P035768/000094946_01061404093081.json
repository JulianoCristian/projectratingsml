Nonetheless, several lessons\n            indicate that : 1) poverty targeting needs to be improved,\n            to include an approval criteria on the types of\n            micro-projects. This would require a revised methodology,\n            formulated on the share of population, and the degree of\n            poverty; a revised approval criteria based on infrastructure\n            conditions, cost per beneficiary, and capacity of the\n            implementing agency; and, changes in the micro-projects\n            typology to reflect community demands; 2) improvement of\n            inter-sectoral, and inter-agency coordination needs to focus\n            on consistent social fund activities, at par with relevant\n            social policies, and investment priorities. This would\n            require the development of effective information strategies,\n            and regular working contacts with the Government, the Bank,\n            and donors; 3) the quality of work needs improvement, to\n            ensure the inclusion of technical specifications for all\n            micro-project types, and a well defined procurement process,\n            which would require training of contractors, as well as\n            assistance from advisory services; and, 4) additionally,\n            local capacity, and, monitoring and evaluation needs further\n            improvement. Other issues call for more decentralized\n            decision making, the need to match Fund arrangements, and,\n            to refine micro-project calculations, and cost effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2001-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
