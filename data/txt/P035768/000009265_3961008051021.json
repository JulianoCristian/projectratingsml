services and\n            creation of employment opportunities. The primary objectives\n            of the project are to: 1) rehabilitate basic small-scale\n            infrastructure that can result in immediate improvements of\n            the living conditions of the poorest among the population;\n            2) strengthen the capacity of private, small-scale\n            contractors and other micro-businesses so that they can\n            benefit directly or indirectly from contracts financed by\n            the Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF), and build the\n            capacity of local government staff and communities so that\n            they can prepare and implement small projects; 3) generate\n            employment through financing of labor-intensive public\n            works; and 4) build greater capacity for policy makers to\n            monitor and analyze trends in the level and structure of\n            poverty in Armenia. The project has four components: 1)\n            financing of ASIF microprojects to support the\n            rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure; 2)\n            institutional support for the ASIF; 3) capacity building of\n            small contractors, implementing agencies and communities;\n            and 4) support to the government for monitoring the living\n            standards of the population."}, "docdt": "1995-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
