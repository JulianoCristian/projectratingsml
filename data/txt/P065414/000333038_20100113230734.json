Some lessons\n            learned included: risks associated with fluctuating exchange\n            rates should be hedged if a significant proportion of the\n            expenditures financed by the loan are in a currency\n            different from the loan currency. Procurement and\n            implementation arrangements for technically complex project\n            components should be carefully aligned with the real\n            capacity of the contractor and the implementing agency.\n            Close involvement of the implementing agency in project\n            design, together with attentiveness to their views, helps to\n            build a cooperative relationship between the Bank and the\n            Borrower. Continuity of Bank and Borrower personnel helps to\n            create mutual respect and understanding which in turn\n            facilitates resolution of problems that arise during the\n            course of implementation. Transferring slow-moving\n            components to other projects with the same Borrower should\n            be considered in order to avoid prolonging project closure,\n            particularly in instances where project development\n            objectives (PDOs) are similar and additional financing is\n            not a viable option."}, "docdt": "2009-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
