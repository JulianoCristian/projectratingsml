Electricity Transmission\n            Rehabilitation Project aims to improve the reliability and\n            quality of electricity supply; develop competition; and\n            restructure the Kazakhstan Grid Operating Company so that it\n            is financially viable. The project has four main components.\n            The first refurbishes transmission substations, including\n            replacement of high voltage equipment at substations;\n            installs shunt reactors to compensate for reactive power;\n            replaces protective relaying, and supplies and installs\n            monitoring and control equipment at substations. The second\n            component modernizes the dispatch control system, including\n            supply and installation of a supervisory control and data\n            acquisition system at regional and national dispatch\n            centers; reinforces a telecommunications system; and\n            supplies and installs a commercial metering system. The\n            third component finances institutional development, which\n            includes installing a company-wide management information\n            system and corporate restructuring. The fourth component\n            provides technical assistance for procurement and project\n            management, and establishes an electricity spot market."}, "docdt": "1999-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
