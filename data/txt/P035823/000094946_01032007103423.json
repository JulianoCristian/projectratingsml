custodial communities in park management,\n            and conservation, and, addresses both environmental, and\n            resettlement issues. While involuntary resettlement issues\n            are not envisaged, restrictions on the access by surrounding\n            communities to utilize resources, within the protected areas\n            (PAs), will need to be introduced, to prevent further\n            ecological degradation. Nonetheless, management practices,\n            and alternative income generation measures will be agreed\n            upon with those whose livelihood is affected by project\n            implementation. By and large, communities in the PAs will be\n            allowed to a continued grazing, and fuel-wood/timber\n            extraction for subsistence needs, but under Park\n            supervision. However, the introduction of culturally\n            compatible, alternative livelihood measures (income\n            generation), raises questions, namely regarding the Kalash\n            group, whose goat rearing practices in high altitudes, of\n            cultural significance, offsets possible restrictions in the\n            utilization of high alpine pastures. Environmental\n            mitigation addresses: biodiversity conservation, through\n            committed, community involvement to specific, measurable\n            actions; limiting the use of agrochemicals, or unnecessary\n            construction activity; development of participatory\n            fuel-wood impact assessments; management strategies for\n            summer, and winter pasture uses; management of no-timber\n            forest products, and of no illegal timber extraction; and,\n            fisheries management, within the estuarine, and marine zone\n            of the PAs."}, "docdt": "2001-03-31T17:17:02Z"}
