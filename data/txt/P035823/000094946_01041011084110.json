include: 1) Protected area biodiversity\n            management, through the following subcomponents: a) creation\n            of a process framework for participation of custodial\n            communities in park management, and conservation, through\n            Village Conservation Committees; additionally, a technical\n            assistance (TA) entity will provide planning, scientific,\n            and social expertise. Community orientation, and\n            mobilization will be provided, to map the community resource\n            utilization, and develop resource management strategies, and\n            mitigation measures; b) formulation of detailed park\n            management, and strategy, integrated into community\n            micro-planning, and micro-enterprise initiatives in\n            accordance with environmental programs, and traditional\n            ecological knowledge; c) improvement of park infrastructure;\n            d) improvement of park operations; e) development of a\n            baseline resource inventory, habitat improvement research,\n            and wildlife enrichment; and, f) creation of public\n            environmental awareness, and outreach programs. 2) Promotion\n            of public/private cooperation for long-term biodiversity\n            conservation, by providing TA, and supporting cost-sharing\n            arrangements, and, income-generating activities. 3) Support\n            an institutional capacity building training program, with\n            topics ranging from legal, and policy reform, to tourism\n            management, and plans. 4) Project coordination for the\n            development of policy, and legislation relating to protected\n            areas, ensuring standardized systems. Eco-tourism\n            opportunities will be evaluated through the Tourism\n            Development and Marketing Study."}, "docdt": "2001-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
