          Facility (GEF) Protected Areas Management Project (PAMP) for\n            Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to Global environment outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: establishing clear linkages\n            between economic benefits and resource conservation. The\n            benefits of long-term sustained economic resource flows from\n            conservation such as through tourism and employment in\n            Protected Area (PA) management were found to be essential to\n            ensure sustainability in several conservation projects at\n            the time, particularly in the India Eco development Project.\n            Building understanding and consensus among stakeholders. A\n            key lesson from other projects in the sector illustrated the\n            need to build consensus among stakeholders on project\n            objectives, activities and roles. Planning for long term\n            sustainability. Providing start up funding, appropriate\n            asset management arrangements and assessing the legal\n            framework for the establishment of a trust fund were\n            important lessons that had begun to appear in the sector. At\n            the time of project preparation, conservation trust funds\n            were beginning to take shape internationally. Experience\n            with these funds highlighted the value of having reliable\n            funding available during the initial stages of a trust fund\n            to begin investing in activities before investment income\n            becomes available. PAMP planned its activities around the\n            notion of establishing a park association early in the\n            project that would be capitalized with $2 million in seed\n            funding. However, the association was established late in\n            the project and the opportunity to bridge its beginnings\n            until it was flush with investment income was squandered."}, "docdt": "2010-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
