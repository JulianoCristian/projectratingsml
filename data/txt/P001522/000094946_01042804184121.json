Some lessons learned were: Even\n            modest investments can create momentum for management\n            transfer if they include proper mobilization and training of\n            farmers. The project approach used should be consistent\n            witht the selected disbursement approach. The participatory\n            approach should be well-structured with an agreed agenda and\n            objectives among all stakeholders. Irrigation projects\n            should be part of a multi-sectoral approach, integrated into\n            watersheds management programs and including land tenure,\n            credit, transport, access to marketing, input supply, and\n            extension.
