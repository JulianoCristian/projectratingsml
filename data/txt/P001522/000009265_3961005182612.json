It will contribute to improved rural\n            incomes and food security by improving production and\n            productivity on irrigation schemes country-wide. (c)\n            Improving environmental management. It will develop\n            techniques for environmental assessment of irrigation\n            rehabilitation and reinforce local capacity. This project\n            will also establish operational procedures for the transfer\n            of management of the operation and maintenance of public\n            irrigation schemes to water users and thus will serve to\n            reduce the burden of public expenditure on the maintenance\n            of such irrigation infrastructure. It will provide the means\n            for more efficient management of the decentralized services\n            of the Ministry of Agriculture in agricultural extension,\n            rural works supervision and local planning and programming."}, "docdt": "1994-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
