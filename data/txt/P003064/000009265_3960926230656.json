           Project supports the government's objectives and\n            strategy for improving the efficiency of the transport\n            sector. The project involves a component for the Office\n            National des Transports (ONATRA) and a component for Societe\n            Nationale des Chemin de Fer Zairois (SNCZ). The objective of\n            the ONATRA component is institutional reform, it will\n            involve : (i) a major reorganization based on a\n            reorientation of ONATRA's goals and strategic role in\n            the transport sector; (ii) an improvement in its financial\n            performance by restructuring its debt and measures to\n            control its costs; and (iii) an improvement in its operating\n            efficiency by rehabilitating infrastructure, replacing\n            obsolete equipment, developing human resources, and\n            improving management. The main objective of the SNCZ\n            component is to restore capacity and improve operational\n            reliability through : (i) improvement in operational\n            efficiency and reduction of financial deficit; (ii)\n            improvement in its operations by a large program to\n            rehabilitate track and rolling stock, equipment and\n            infrastructure; and (iii) clarification of its relationship\n            with the State through a \"Contrat-Programme\"."}, "docdt": "1989-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
