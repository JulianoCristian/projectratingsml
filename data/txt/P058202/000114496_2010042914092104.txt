Re:  Loan No. 7013 POL (Rural Development Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement.
Dear Mr. Raczko, 
 
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Rural Development Project) dated July 25, 2000, 
between the Republic of Poland (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank), as amended.  We also refer to the letter from Minister Mazurek, 
dated January 8, 2002, requesting that a new dissemination concept for Part B.3 of the Project be  
approved allowing the use of existing associations of local governments for the provision of  
dissemination activities under Part B.3 of the Project. 
 
I
am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to said request and accordingly the Loan 
Agreement is amended as follows: 
1. 
Section 1.02 of the Loan Agreement is revised by deleting the word “and” at the end of 
sub-paragraph (y), replacing the period at the end of sub-paragraph (z) with a semicolon, and 
adding new sub-paragraphs (aa) and (bb), which read as follows: 
 
“(aa) 
“Associations” means collectively Zwiazek Miast Polskich (Association of 
Polish Cities), Zwiazek Powiatow Polskich (Association of Polish Powiats), Zwiazek Gmin 
Wiejskich RP (Association of Rural Gminas of the Republic of Poland), and Unia Miasteczek 
Polskich (Union of Polish Townships), all existing local government organizations of the 
Borrower of countrywide reach and competence, co-operating with the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Public Administration of the Borrower in providing dissemination activities under 
Part B.3 of the Project; 
 
(bb) 
“Program for Promotion and Dissemination of Part B.3 of the Rural 
Development Project” means the Program defining the activities for promotion and dissemination 
under Part B.3 of the Project, prepared and adopted by the Borrower.” 
2. 
The table in paragraph 1 of part A of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, is revised as 
follows: 
 
(a) 
the amount of the Loan allocated (expressed in Euro) to Category 3 (Consultants’ 
services and training) is revised to read “21, 754,000”; 
 
(b) 
Category 7 (Operating costs) is revised by lettering “Operating Costs” as sub-
category “(a)” and by adding a new sub-category “(b)” which provides for financing of 
“Operating Costs for Dissemination Activities under Part B.3 of the Project”, with EUR 396,000 
allocated to said sub-category and with the percentage of expenditures to be financed from the 
Loan proceeds set at 82%.

Paragraph 2 of part A of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is revised by deleting the 
word “and” at the end of sub-paragraph (b), replacing the period at the end of sub-paragraph (c) 
with a semicolon and adding a new sub-paragraph (d) which reads as follows: 
 
“(d) 
“Operating Costs for Dissemination Activities under Part B.3 of the Project” 
means incremental operating costs for workshop facilities rental, refreshments for workshop 
participants, printing of training materials, press advertisements, mailing charges, 
telecommunication costs, travel, and remuneration of personnel (excluding salaries of 
government staff) incurred by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Public Administration of the 
Borrower, the Associations and the PCU, for the dissemination activities defined in the Program 
for Promotion and Dissemination of Part B.3 of the Rural Development Project.”
