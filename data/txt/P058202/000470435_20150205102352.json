By the project\u0092s end in July 2005,\n            micro-credit loans had helped finance the creation of almost\n            3,000 small enterprises in rural areas; 2,018 schools had\n            been rehabilitated (more than ten times the targeted\n            number); more than 4,000 local government staff had been\n            trained in modern management techniques; 750 km of roads\n            were built - the list goes on and on. But beyond the\n            specific figures, those who worked on the Rural Development\n            Project (RDP) are most proud of the project\u0092s institutional\n            legacy. At a time when decentralization was still a novelty,\n            hundreds of civil servants and officials involved in RDP\n            have gained knowledge in how to implement local development\n            programs in an \u0093effective, transparent and collective way ,\u0094\n            says Lundell. Poland\u0092s decentralization law was adopted in\n            1999, just one year before the start of the World Bank\n            program. Instead of centrally appointed voivods (executive\n            governors) implementing decisions from above, newly elected\n            marshals at the regional level were given the power to\n            decide how to allocate money from the loan and where."}, "docdt": "2006-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
