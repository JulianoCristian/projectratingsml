The project ratings\n            are as follows: project outcome is satisfactory;\n            sustainability is likely; institutional development impact\n            is substantial; Bank and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the project can be summarized as follows:\n            1) a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) based in a single line\n            ministry cannot fully coordinate a national multi-sectoral\n            rural development project, nor would this be desirable; 2)\n            project design should place a maximum emphasis on\n            decentralization of project implementation, especially if\n            political decentralization to elected regional and local\n            governments is already in place; 3) procurement (even for\n            capacity building activities which emphasize a standardized\n            approach) should be decentralized, with centralization of\n            procurement not exceeding the level of a group of four to\n            five regions at most. 4) a web-based management information\n            system (MIS), integrating local activities to the regional\n            level and regional summaries to the national level is a\n            prerequisite for a fully representative monitoring and\n            evaluation system; 5) in cases where such national programs\n            are designed already, project components should follow the\n            design of national programs as much as possible if they have\n            been generally assessed positively; and 6) an initial Bank\n            project in rural development (or in any decentralized\n            community focused project) should view itself as primarily\n            building capacity for subsequent scaling up through further\n            Bank projects, but especially through an allocation of a\n            wider set of donor and state budget funds."}, "docdt": "2005-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
