The components\n            include: 1) the development of micro-enterprises to reduce\n            unemployment in rural areas, and allow a comparison of the\n            micro-credit approach, with the current cost of social\n            assistance. Off-farm self-employment will be promoted,\n            through the financing of grants covering social insurance\n            premiums, micro-loans for rural micro-enterprises, advisory\n            services for these enterprises, and technical assistance\n            provision; 2) labor redeployment, through the financing of\n            economic, and labor market surveys, and labor redeployment\n            services. Education financing will improve the quality of\n            teaching, of school equipment, and will support\n            instructional computerization, while institutional\n            development, training programs, and capacity building will\n            strengthen local, and regional administrations; and, 3)\n            technical infrastructure in rural areas, to stimulate\n            private sector investments, facilitate the creation of\n            non-farm jobs, and introduce market-oriented approaches in\n            developing infrastructure networks."}, "docdt": "2000-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
