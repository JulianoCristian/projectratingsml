MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR AN URBAN HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Republic of the Philippines for SDR
50.5 million (US$70.0 million equivalent) to help finance an Urban Health and
Nutrition Project.  The proposed credit would be cn standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 35 years. The Government of Australia has agreed to provide a
cofinancing grant of US$3.1 million equivalent for the project.
2.   Country/Sectgr Background. At the beginning of the 1970s, incomes in
the Philippines were at levels comparable to those in Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia
and Malaysia. During the 1980s, these newly industrialized countries averaged
growth of over six percent a year while the Philippines grew at less than one
percent a year. Poverty reduction in the Philippines has lagged behind these
countries partly because of slower growth, and partly because growth was
concentrated in a higher wage formal sector protected by minimum wage
legislation; in the dualistic Philippines economy, growth did no more than
trickle down to the majority of people working in the low productivity
agriculture and informal sectors. In 1992, the Philippines had a real per
capita income 7.2 percent lower than in 1980.
3.   Similarly, while health, nutrition and fertility conditions in the
Philippines have improved since the early 1970s, progress has been far slower
than in other East Asian countries. As a result, the Philippines infant
mortality rate, which was comparable to those of China and Thailand in the
1970s, has not improved, and is now roughly twice as high as their rates.
Slow growth in the incomes of poor people and the government's difficulty in
financing adequate health and nutrition programs for the poor have resulted in
minimal improvement in health status. In addition, in the early 1980s,
budgetary constraints, coupled with low levels of commitment to preventive
health care for the poor, resulted in the urban poor suffering from both lack
of public services and from the income effects of economic crisis. High rates
of fertility, linked to weak commitment to family planning programs, have also
contributed both to slow per capita economic growth and to relatively high
death, disease and malnutrition rates among women and young children.
4.   Inadequate human, physical and financial health care resources have been
allocated to poor urban communities. This inequity is the result of chartered
cities throughout the country failing to allocate comparable budget support on
per capita terms for their independent health departments than did the
Department of Health (DOH) for the provinces and municipalities whose health
activities were its direct responsibility. And even though past per capita
allocations to the 13 municipalities in Metro Manila were higher than were
*        those for the four Metro Manila chartered cities, the rapid influx of
population into these smaller, poorer municipalities surrounding the city core
overwhelmed their resources and resulted in the growth of slums without even
the most basic primary health care, water and sanitation services. Following
the return to budget stringency in 1991-93 after a period of real growth in
health sector allocations from 1986-90, resources from the DOH have not been
adequate to fill the investment gap in the urban areas.



- 2 -
5.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank group Involvement.  The Bank has
assisted the Government in the PM4 sector through three operations, two in
population now completed and one in health, now under implementation. 'The
main problems identified in previous projects concerned delays in
implemantation and disbursements due to the protracted procurement process and
complex budget release and payment procedures. These problems are being
addressed as general countrywide issues by the Government and the Bank
following a Country Implementation Review in early 1993. Lessons learned
involving procurement delays are being specifically addressed in the proposed
project's design. Bank staff are working with the DOH to improve procurement
procedures. DOH has already prepared draft bidding documents and a
procurement plan; implementation of the plan will be closely monitored by Baik
supervision missions.
6.  Rationale for, ID  Inmolvement.  The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
for the Philippines revolves around five themes: (a) maintaining the
stabilization program; (b) deepening the structural adjustment program; (c)
deepening the sectoral reform programs; (d) alleviating poverty; and (e)
obtaining greater effectiveness in utilizing existing aid commitments. The
proposed project, which is aimed at improving the health and nutrition status
of slum dwellers, among the most disadvantaged people in the Philippines, is a
core element of (c) and (d) of the strategy.
7.   Specific rationales exist for the proposed project.  First, the project
would finance preventive health and nutrition activities which the Government
and foreign assistance agencies (other than the Bank) could not finance in the
current period of extreme budgetary stringency. Second, the proposed project
will improve the resource targeting systems in use in the health sector,
including the introduction of (a) new technologies for area-based targeting
using Geographic Information Systems; and (b) the development and application
of reproductive cycle targeting, in which health and nutrition interventions,
and scarce worker time are concentrated on women and children at the most
vulnerable points in their life or reproductive cycle. Third, the proposed
project would also be the first social sector project to be implemented after
the 1991 enactment of the Local Government Code. Under the code,
responsibility for health services delivery is decentralized from central to
local government. Bank Group support at this time will assist both central
and local governments to address the redesign of health service management
systems required by devolution. Finally, preparation of the proposed project
is helping to lay the foundations for implementation of improved targeting
methods and devolved service delivery on a national scale in later projects.
8. Project Objectives. The project would have four major goals in the
areas of health and nutrition impact, institutional development, community
self-reliance, and policy and research. These include the following: (a) to
improve the health and nutrition status of slum dwellers in urban areas of
Metro Manila, Metro-Cebu and Cagayan de Oro; (b) to build the capacity of city
and municipal governments to plan, finance and implement cost-effective slum
health and nutrition programs, in partnership with communities, NGOs and the
DOH; (c) to help slum communities identify their own health, nutrition and
environmental problems and participate in planning, implementing and
monitoring appropriate interventions; and (d) to help DOH develop policies and
strategies to improve the outreach and cost-effectiveness of health and
nutrition service delivery systems.



- 3 -
9.   Project Description.  The project would include the following
components: (a) service delivery (722 of total project cost) to improve the
range, outreach quality and cost-effectiveness of priority health and
nutrition services, through improvements in health risk assessment and client
targeting systems, additions/improvements to health staffing and facilities,
and provision of additional equipment, drugs, contraceptives, supplies and
food and micronutrient supplements; (b) institutional development (15X) to
improve the capacity of the project local governments to plan, manage, monitor
and evaluate their health programs, and of DOH to support local governments,
through strengthening of management systems and planning and evaluation
capacity; of training technologies, programs and infrastructure; and of
communications technologies and programs; (c) community partnerships for
healMh (71) to support community mobilization and community-based health and
nutrition service delivery through financing grants to strengthen local NGOs,
to develop community/NGO/local government fora, and to implement joint
community/local government/NGO subprojects in health and nutrition; and (d)
policy research and cvaluation (6Z) to support aperations research studies
testing alternative delivery models for key interventions, and studies to
evaluate project progress.
10.  Project Imglementation.  Project activities would be implemented by the
central DOH and by city and municipal governments over a six-year period.
Project funds would flow through two administrative channels to CHOs/MHOs or
NGOs, and then to project communities, as follows: (a) the central or regional
offices of DOH procaring or providing goods or services; (b) local governments
procuring or providing goods or services. Day-to-day coordination of project
activities would be the responsibility of a DOH UHNP Project Coordination Unit
(PCU-UHNP), under the direction of the Undersecretary of Health and Chief of
Staff who also serves as Project Director. LGUs would play the lead project
implementation role, in light of the devolution of health program
implementation responsibilities to local governments. Central government, as
Borrower of the IDA credit, would exercise its overall responsibility for
project management through its financial control of project grants to LGUs and
through Memoranda of Agreement to be entered into by central and local
governments. Project funds would be allocated on grant terms from central to
local governments. Each grant would require cost sharing by the individual
WU.
11. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$82.2 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.0 million (291). The
proposed IDA credit of US$70.0 million equivalent would finance about 851 of
total project costs, including 96X of foreign exchange and 811 of local costs.
The Australian grant of US$3.1 million equivalent would finance about 41 of
total project costs, including 41 of foreign exchange and 41 of local costs.
A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11702-PH, dated May 14, 1993, is being distributed
separately.
12. Project Sustainability. Three approaches would be followed to ensure
project sustainability. First, the participative approach taken in project
preparation and the resulting commitment to project objectives and



- 4 -
interventions on the part of LGUs would help ensure continued project services
following credit completion. Second, beneficiary communities would be asked
to contribute to project implementation in two ways: (a) volunteer BHWs from
slum communities would contribute labor; and (b) under the community health
partnership component, communities would be involved in defining their own
health problems and risks, and in monitoring the success of efforts to respond
to them. This increased community involvement and awareness would help ensure
popular demand for sustained budgetary commitments to slum health care after
project end. Third, participating LGUs would be asked to absorb an increasing
share of project costs during the life of the project. So as to minimize the
difficulty of absorbing the full recurrent costs at the end of the project,
each participating LGU would be expected to contribute toward the cost of the
project for recurrent rather than capital costs; contributions would bagin at
a level below the agreed average contribution over the project life and
increase to a level above this average by the end of the project. In
addition, some LGUs whose local revenue collections are below potential, or
whose health budget share in local revenues is below average, would be
expected to increase their local health budgets during the project at a rate
faster than their revenues have historically grown.
13. Agred Actions. During negotiations, assurances were received from the
Government that: (a) the Project Coordinating Unit headed by a project
coordinator would be maintained under conditions satisfactory to IDA
throughout project implementation; (b) audits of LGU and DOH p,zoject-related
records and accounts would be urdertaken and sent to IDA within 9 months of
the end of each Government fiscal year; (c) project funds would be provided to
LOUs once each LGU signed its KOA. Each MOA would also be signed by DILG and
DOH and would include a cost sharing arrangement acceptable to IDA; (d) semi-
annual progress reports would be submitted to IDA and a Project Completion
Report prepared within 6 months of the Closing Date; (e) annual reviews of the
individual LIU yearly KOA implementation programs would be carried out by DOH
each July, including an aggregated operational plan and budget to be prepared
by October of each project year; (f) IDA and DaH would jointly review
individual LGU yearly MOA implementation programs, and these programs would
take into account IDA comments; (g) a baseline evaluation study would be
carried out by December 31, 1994. Two separate follow-up studies would be
carried out by December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1999, respectively;
(h) prior to effectiveness, the DOH would have established the PCU-UHNP and
appointed its project coordinator and personnel; (i) prior to effectiveness,
the DOH, DOF, DBM, DILG and NEDA would have signed the MOA Inter-Agency
Agreement governing the release of Credit proceeds through the Municipal
Development Fund; (j) prior to effectiveness, at least 9 of the 21 LCUs would
have signed project MOAs; and (k) assurances were received from the Government
that a study on pre-school child development in the Philippines would be
carried out under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA by December 31, 1994.
This study would help lay foundations for improved targeting uethods and
devolved service delivery on a national scale in later projects.
14.  Enlronmental Anseta.  The project is designed to improve directly
environmental health conditions in urban slum areas by: (a) improving small-
scale community water supplies and sewage; (b) linking communities to sAlid
waste disposal systems; (c) provision of drainage; and (d) insect and rodent
control.



-5-
15.  Program Objective Categories.  The project objective is to target urban
slum commumitloej  for improved health services and thus to strengthen poverty
alleviation programs.   By doing so, the project would promote greater equity
and increase human resource development. In particular, the project would
help focus social services on the poor; develop and maintain social safety
nets; direct public-resources and efforts at basic social services,
disadvantaged regions and specific vulnerable groups; expand schemes to
promote physical well-being of the homeless; promote balance between
population, resources and environment; improve and strengthen systems for
planning, policy formulation and implementation of local development programs;
and provide necessary infrastructure facilities to Improve and expand delivrery
of basic social services.
16. Project Benefits. The project would assist the Government to: (a)
develop operational models for health and nutrition service delivery and
community empowerment in urban slum areas which are potentially replicable in
urban areas outside the project; (b) test innovative approaches to client
targeting (especially the reproductive cycle approach and GIS-linked targeting
approach), to training and communications methodologies and to nutrition
service delivery which have potential applications on a national scale; (c)
build DOH capacity to fulfill its new role after devolution of providing
support to, rather than management of, the health departments of local
governments; (d) test approacaes for nanaging the relationship between DOH and
local governments which have potential applications on a national scale; and
(e) increase the capacity of the 21 local governments in the project area to
plan, manage, monitor and evaluate their health and nutrition programs. The
project would directly benefit an estimated 0.9 million households in the
three target cities and include better access to health,and nutrition
services; reductions in infant and maternal mortality; an increase in the
contraceptive prevalence rate and in the spacing of births; reductions in
protein-energy malnutrition, anemia and goiter, and elimination of vitamin A
deficiency; reductions in the incidence of childhood pneumonias; and
reductions in t.te prevalence of tuberculosis.
17. Risks. The main risks foreseen are (a) whether LGUs would be able to
provide and sustain the financing required for the project; (b) whether LOUs
with newly devolved responsibilities would have the capacity to manage the
proposed project; (c) whether implementation would be delayed through
shortfalls in and slow release of project funds by the central government; and
(d) whether all 21 LGUs would agree to participate in the project, as well as
the likelihood that project outcomes would not be uniform for all LGUs. With
regard to (a), strong commitment to project goals was generated by the
participative approach to project preparation, and would be formalized through
the proposed central/local government MOAs. For (b), LGU managerial capacity
would be considerably strengthened by project institution-building activities,
with technical assistance and training being provided by central and local
offices of DOH and by consultants. For (c), the Government and IDA are
undertaking a project and program prioritizing and restructuring exercise
which would help ensure that central government funds are concentrated on
fully funding a limited number of priority projects. Second, the proposed
release of project funds through the Municipal Development Fund is likely to
be faster than the normal system, based on the experience of other Bank Group
projects. Agreement would be sought from the Government to release project
funds in six-monthly tranches into the MDF, thus helping ensure adequate cash



flow. Finally, for (d), all 21 LGUs participated in project preparation and
project design.
18. Recomendation. I au satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
