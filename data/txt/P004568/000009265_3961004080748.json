"The project will directly address\n            poverty alleviation through the following objectives: (a) to\n            improve the health and nutrition status of slum-dwellers in\n            the urban areas of Metro-Manila, Metro-Cebu, and Cagayan de\n            Oro; (b) to build the capacity of city and municipal\n            governments in these areas to plan, finance and implement\n            cost-effective slum health and nutrition programs; (c) to\n            help slum communities to identify their own health,\n            nutrition and environmental problems and participate in\n            planning, implementing and monitoring appropriate\n            interventions; and (d) to help the Department of Health\n            develop policies and strategies which will improve the\n            outreach and cost-effectiveness of health and nutrition\n            delivery systems.The project will support the following\n            components: (a) service delivery, to improve the outreach,\n            range, quality and cost-effectiveness of priority health and\n            nutrition services, through improvements in health risk\n            assessment and client targeting

micro-nutrient supplements; (b)\n            institutional development, to improve the capacity of\n            project local governments to plan, manage, monitor and\n            evaluate their health programs, and of the Department of\n            Health to support local governments, through strengthening\n            management systems and planning and evaluation capacity;\n            training technologies, programs and infrastructure; and\n            communications technologies and programs; (c) community\n            partnerships for health, to support community mobilization\n            and community-based health and nutrition service delivery,\n            through financing grants to strengthen local nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs), to develop community/NGO/local\n            government fora, and to implement joint community/local\n            government/NGO sub-projects in health and nutrition; and (d)\n            policy research and
