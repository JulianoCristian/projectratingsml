The\n            extension is being requested to enable the completion of the\n            main works under the project and to measure after completion\n            the resulting improvements of the level of service.\n            Principally the construction of three water treatment\n            plants, which has experienced delays due to a combination of\n            factors, namely initial delays in arranging the required\n            subcontracting and liquidity issues from the main\n            contractor, needs to be completed. Construction is now\n            around 70 percent complete and is forecasted to be completed\n            by September 2010 at the present rate of implementation\n            progress. Project implementation was delayed by the\n            termination of a contract for well drilling and another for\n            transmission main setup. The new contract for well drilling\n            to complete the remaining works is currently being\n            negotiated for signature and is expected to be completed in\n            four months. Six additional months following the completion\n            of the works will be necessary to measure the improvements\n            of the level of service in the project areas and evaluate\n            the overall project achievement. The change is the extension\n            of the closing date of the project by 12 months from its\n            current closing date of March 31st, 2010, to March 31, 2011."}, "docdt": "2005-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
