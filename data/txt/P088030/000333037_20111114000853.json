"Ratings for the Water Sector\n            Consolidation Project for Guyana were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: reform programs such as this that are\n            crucial to the performance of investments, require long term\n            engagement. The project benefited from a more than 10 year\n            Bank engagement in the sector through the previous\n            investment project and the extended period of engagement in\n            developing the reform agenda. This ensured a well designed\n            project grounded on well developed institutional and\n            regulatory reform. The long term and productive involvement\n            of the government on the water sector reform also enabled\n            high government and ownership at the time of appraisal which\n            was able to be sustained during implementation. Even if the\n            Government decided to give the management contract an early\n            termination, it remained engaged in dialogue with the main\n            donors and Guyana Water Incorporated (GWI) and there was\n            high support at the highest levels for the agreed turnaround\n            plan which proved invaluable to sustaining the improvements\n            achieved and maintaining the principles of the reforms\n            throughout this crucial time in the development of the\n            sector, even if the management contract tool for GWI was\n            discarded by the Government at the time."}, "docdt": "2011-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
