        EnvironmentalGuidelines
        for Construction Projects
   and EnvironmentalAssessment



Guidelines written in conjunction with the World Bank.

                 February 2005

                            Executive Summary

This document represents the output of a six-month collaborative effort between GWI and the
World Bank to establish new guidelines to protect the environment before, during and after
construction.

The impetus for creating the guidelines came from a request by the World Bank to ensure
mechanisms were be in place that would take environmental issues into account should the bank
decide to fund future capital investment within GWI. Clearly, however, the guidelines will now
be a mandatory component of any project over GYD 5M carried out either by GWI, or by
subcontractorson its behalf.

The key documents associatedwith these environmental guidelines are:

  an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the linked Environment Screening Checklist
  (ESC)
  an EnvironmentalAction Plan (EAP)

The responsibility for carrying out an EIA and producing an ESC falls to GWI. Should any
concerns be raised by the EIA, these must then be passed onto the relevant contractor, who in
conjunction with the GWI and the Environmental Projection Agency will produce an EAP
(based on guidelines contained in this document). The responsibility for keeping to the EAP lies
with the contractor, although GWI would obviouslyprovide oversight.

The sole aim of an EAP is to minimise environmentalimpact during the construction.

This document, as well as containing the new guidelines, also details three examples (in
Appendix A) of ESCs carried out as part of a feasibility study for the World Bank in 2004. For
any future project, these ESCs can act as reference documents.

Appendix B contains a record of the public consultation activity associated with these guidelines.

                                  1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide Contractors with an efficient means of complying
with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
requirements for projects greater than G$5M in contract value in the water sector where potential
environmental impacts are typically relatively similar and small in scale. ETA requirement may
be satisfied through use of a screening template (Environment Screening Checklist - see Section
7). Guidelinespresented herein, along with specifications included in the bid documents, should
form the basis of the project specific EMPs. The recommended format for the EMP is also
presented below.

1.1   General Environmental and Social Principles Guiding Guyana Water Inc.


Guyana Water Inc. (GWI) has established the following environmental principles to serve as a
basis for design and construction of civil works (pipelines,pump stations, etc.).

        The designs should avoid or minimise the need for resettlement of population, as well as
        the impact on recreational areas and buildings of historical or architectural value. If these
        impacts are unavoidable, resettlement plans, mitigation and compensatory measures will
       be included in project costs.

        Access to dwellings and businesses should be guaranteed for both the construction and
        operational phases. Any restriction or limitation to accessibility to properties should be
        properly mitigated or compensated.

        All areas and infrastructure affected during construction should be restored to their
        original condition, especially pavements, gardens, utilities, and side streets impacted by
        traffic diversion.

        Safe and secure pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be integrated into the design and
        reconstruction of any road crossings.

        The design should harrnonise with urban surroundings in order to minimise negative
        impacts on environmental quality and property values.

        In cases where significant, irreversible negative impacts are predicted, alternative
        solutions and final designs should be subject to public and community consultation with
        special emphasis on the property owners directly affected, local NGOs and community
        organisations, and business and professional organisations.

        To minimise public nuisances, construction activities should follow environmental
        guidelines developed in this document. Construction schedules and the timing of

       necessary interruption of public utilities (electricity, water and telephone) should be
       communicated to the affected community.

       GWI shall perform the preliminary EIA screening in order to determine the
       environmental impacts expected using the screening templates included herein. The
       outcome of the EIA shall be incorporated into the bidding documents, in addition to the
       generic guidelines outlined below for construction.

       Design and construction should minimise negative social and environmental impacts on
       the community. In all cases several alternatives (layouts, technologies, approaches) will
       be explored to select schemes that provide efficient water supply and sanitation services,
       comply with all existing regulafions, minimise externalities, and respond to community
       needs and concerns. During design, due consideration will be given to social and
       environmental impacts associated with project components.

       Community participation is an important component of all GWI activities. GWI will
       introduce the project, its components, contractor(s), and GW17scontact personnel to the
       community before work starts, and community concerns will be incorporated as
       appropriate.

1.2   Roles and Responsibilities


For all projects (or sub-projects) greater than G$5M in contract value, a project specific EIA
screen shall be performed and a project specific EMP shall be developed in accordance with
guidelines from the Guyana Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This EMP will address the
implementation of the generic construction guidelines as well as the project-specific guidelines
as a result of the EIA process. Roles and responsibilities necessary to fulfill the requirements of
these guidelines are detailed in Table 1.1below.

                and implementation.

In the event any projects are implemented via a design-build approach, GWI will have identified
need and developed a rough scope for the project before the contractor would be hired. Roles
and responsibilities would be as indicated in Table 1-1.

                        2 Preliminary Screening

Usually, the construction of projects for the water and wastewater sectors do not pose a serious
potential for environmental impacts of high magnitude and importance. However, it is advisable
to screen projects and construction sites in order to ensure that significant issues are identified
and proper measures included in project design. The potential issues depend on the type of
construction, area available (congested vs. open area), and the location (urban vs. rural) of the
proposed construction. In most cases, construction activities would probably be of some concern,
especially in urban areas in which inconvenience or nuisance to certain communities during
construction will require careful planning of construction activities.


Future project sites and projects shouldbe screened for:

   (9      The potential need for resettlement of families and businesses, the presence of
           squatters or any other land titling conflicts;
    (ii)   Potential interruption or limitation of access to dwellings or businesses either
           permanently or temporarily (during construction);
    (iii)  Encroachment1reduction of recreational areas;
    (iv)   Demolition of buildings of high architectural or historical value;
    (v)    Potential deterioration of urban quality and property value in the immediate vicinity
           of the works or deterioration of unique architectural characteristics in the
           neighbourhood;
           The potential for increased accidents in areas with high density of schools, hospitals,
           and commercial use;
    (vii)  The effect on urban infrastructure (pavements, power and telephone lines, water and
           sewerage mains, etc.);
    (viii) Potentially unacceptable nuisances during construction (dust, noise, wastes, and
           heavy construction traffic);
           Potential issues regarding natural hazards (floods, instability);
           Potential issues related to disposal of materials from the construction sites.

A screening template is provided in Section 6.1 of this document. GWI will use this template to
identify potential environmental and social impacts and satisfy the EIA requirements established
by EPA. Findings of the preliminary screeningwill form the basis of the project specific EMP to
be developed by the Contractor and further discussed in Section 6.2.

Based on the screening exercise, the environmental work for this type of project may fall within
the following categories:

        No major issues identified: apply environmental guidelines for design and construction

        Some issues of concern: apply environmental guidelines for design and construction,
        further environmental assessment of specific components may be required

        Major issues identified: prepare resettlement plans, compensation programmes (for green
        areas / natural habitats, for instance), and archaeological salvage 1 restoration plans as
        required, design and implement community consultation / information programme, apply
        environmental guidelines for design and construction

These guidelines provide a constant set of basic environmental and social practices that may be
applied once specific sites have been identified for construction.

              3 Basic Environmental and Social
                                    Considerations

This section identifies issues that should be considered by the contractor during the project
planning and design phases of projects such as distribution system improvements, pump stations,
new wells, treatment facilities, and wastewater collection system improvements. Enhancements
should be identified and proposed to GWI where practical and cost efficient approaches are
available.

This section covers activities from design to construction. Typically, only some of the sections
will apply in standard contracting arrangements where contractor is hire to perform either design
or construction. In the event that projects are awarded on a design-build basis, the contractor will
follow guidance in Section 3 in it's entirely keeping in mind GWI's guiding principles presented in
Section 1.1.

3.1   Environmental and Social Considerations for Planning & Design

3.1.1 Engineering Design


The engineering design of the project should take into considerationthe followingmatters:


    (i)    Incorporate social and environmental issues in the project cycle from the beginning;


    (ii)   Analyse / assess / consider several alternatives to achieve the desired goals (layouts,
           technologies, materials, approaches, etc.);


    (iii)  A holistic approach is endorsed while studying a project. Due consideration should be
           given to the integrated system the project forms part of. That is, the water source,
           extraction, treatment, storage, distribution, sewerage collections, treatment or
           appropriate disposal, as well as the environmental, social, and cultural contexts are all
           incorporated in the design considerations;


    (iv)   For water projects, the hydraulic capacity of the existing downstream water distribution
           network and the need to provide water (via well or connection to distribution) and
           sanitation (via septic tank or connection to sewerage in Georgetown) for ancillary
           facilities;

    (v)    For wastewater projects, the hydraulic capacity of downstream infrastructure and
           potential need for expansion of receiving collectors or need for on-site treatment or pre-
           treatment (septic tank, infiltration ditch, etc);

   (vi)    Encourage treatment or pre-treatment of wastewater from cafeterias and restaurants (via
           grease trap, septic tank, etc.) before discharge to the sewerage networks or the
           wastewater treatment system;


   (vii)   Adequate management of runoff and the facilities for its recollection and evacuation,
           having in mind the existing downstream systems;

   (viii) The systems of recollection, storage and transportation of solid wastes generated in
           treatment processes, during maintenance activities, etc.;


   (ix)    Appropriate access systems for pedestrians, bicycles, children and handicapped people;

   (x)     The need to integrate building design with architectural characteristics of the
           surroundingneighbourhood; and


   (xi)    Avoiding the use of materials such as endangered, threatened or rare species of wood
           from tropical forests, lead-basedpaints, asbestos, for example.


3.2  Environmental and Social Enhancement


Some project sites provide excellent opportunities for environmental enhancement and the
promotion of environmentally sustainable technologies and concepts.           These enhancement
opportunities can be built into the design and constructionof the project.


The architectural design of some projects may bring many opportunities to incorporate and
reinforce the criteria of environmentally fiiendly design. The feasibility of incorporating these
aspects into the design should be analysed during the conceptualisation phase of the architectural
designs and during the engineering designs. This analysis could include:


   (i)     solar panels to satisfy totally or partially the electricityneeds;
   (ii)    rooflop rain water collection and storage (for larger projects such as a treatment
           facility) for the irrigation of gardens and green zones;
   (iii)   maximising natural light in order to minimise artificial light needs;
   (iv)    planting of native species in gardens and green areas;
   (v)     using windmills for groundwater exploitation;
   (vi)    natural ventilation systems, minimizing the necessities of air conditioning; and
   (vii)   the stabilisation of slopes using vegetative measures.


3.3  Environmental and Social Management of Construction Activities


Construction activities could cause important impacts and nuisances to surrounding areas. These
impacts merit carehl planning of construction activities and the application of strict environmental

                                                   7

measures during construction.       Aspects that should be kept in mind and addressed in an
environmentalmanual, which would be part of bidding documents, include:

           pedestrian safety and traffic congestionduring construction due to the increase of heavy
           traffic (for the construction itself and from traffic detours);
   (ii)    dust and particulate materials, causing nuisances to surrounding families and
           businesses, especiallyto vulnerablepeople (children, elderly);
   (iii)   undesirable noise levels due to the machinery and equipment especially in areas with
           hospitals, homes for the elderly, schools;
           degradation of streets due to heavy equipment machinery and traffic detours;
           the interruption of services (water, electricity,telephone, etc) during construction;
           the adequate disposal of garbage, metals, used oils, and excess material, generated
           during construction;
   (vii)   the need to inform the population about construction and work schedules, interruption
           of services,traffic detour routes; and
   (viii) pedestrian security measures, especially for school children, during construction.

Some projects may generate substantial amounts of construction waste that require appropriate
environmental handling. The identification of suitable sites for waste disposal, the environmental
management necessary (compacting, re-soiling and re-vegetation, drainage control), and the
associated transportation costs shouldbe included in project design and cost estimates.

The engineering design will then consider:


   (i)     the preparation of environmental specificationsthat the contractor should follow during
           the construction; and
   (ii)    planning of construction and activity programme for minimisation of impacts and
           nuisances to the population.


3.4   Environmental and Social Supervision During Construction


Construction supervision will be conducted by GWI to ensure contractor compliance with the
manual and the environmental specifications included in the bid documents. These specifications
should be incorporated into the project specific EMP to be developedby the Contractor.


3.5   Public Participation, Consultation and Information Activities


Public participation will be incorporated into all projects over G$5M through an initial public
meeting held in the local area of the proposed project. GWI will introduce the contractor and
GWI contact person. A brief presentation will be made including the scope of the project,
anticipated local impacts such as traffic disruption and road closures, and a proposed schedule.
Time for questions and answers will be allotted, with all comments recorded for hrther review

and implementation into the project where appropriate. A brochure may also be made available
including a brief description of the project and a hotline number for further questions or
emergencies. It is anticipatedthat initial public meeting will last an average of one to two hours.

The screening exercise may identify the need for communityconsultation in the area of influence
of particularly sensitive construction sites. If so, a community consultation methodology needs
to be designed which may include an opinion survey and a consultation programme
encompassing broad and specific areas of influence of the sub-projects. The methodology may
include specifically designed questionnaires and strategies for:


    (i)    public and community organisations; and
    (ii)   the community in general.

The public and community organisationsto be consulted include:


    (i)    local professional associations (including engineering and architectural associations);
    (ii)   local chambers of commerce and industries;
    (iii)  community organisations (neighbourhoodorganisations) and local NGOs.

The public and community in general could further be divided into two groups:


    (i)    the public at large in the area of influence; and
    (ii)   the affected community in the immediate area of the proposed works.

The consultationprogram may involve both formal and informal presentations and meetings with
the target groups, information dissemination campaigns through fliers, posters, and radio
announcements,and an opinion survey.

Public notification procedures for issue that may arise during construction will be developed by
the Contractor in coordination with GWI and incorporated in the EMP, which is further
discussed in Section 6.2.

         4 Environmentaland Social Guidelines

These guidelines serve as typical recommendations for potential impacts identified in
preliminary screening and should be incorporated into the project specific EMP as needed.

4.1   Environmental and Social Guidelines for EngineeringDesign


Planning and design considerations detailed in Section 3.1 should be implemented to the extent
practical. Sustainability and enhancement opportunities will be considered in the design phase of
the project.


4.2   Environmental and Social Guidelines for ConstructionPlanning and Execution

4.2.1  Occupational Health and Safety


        1.     The contractor should comply with all existing regulations related to Heath and

      7.     Workers should not enter a trench more than waist deep without appropriate
             safety precautions such as shoring.

      8.     If there is reason to believe that excavated soils may be chemically impacted (i.e.,
             visible sheen or odor), soils should be either be disposed of in accordance with
             local regulations or tested via laboratory analysis prior to replacement to ensure
             suitability of fill material.

      9.     Excavated areas and trench crossings shall be clearly marked and temporary
             fencing, bridges, access routes, signage, etc. shall be constructed to facilitate
             access and avoid accidental falls into these areas.


4.2.3 Traffic Management


      10.    All traffic management will be coordinatedwith authorities

      11.    Outside of working hours, especially at night, all barriers and signs will remain at
             sites, with lighting and / or lighted signs placed as required to warn both vehicular
             and pedestrian traffic. Residents within a construction zone should be notified.
             Also see items 14and 15.

      12.    Flagmen shall be used to warn and direct vehicle traffic around construction sites
             and hazards during working hours.

      13.    The contractor shall restore the project environment to the state to which it was or
             better, prior to construction. In the case of road cuttings, the contractor shall
             restore all roadways to their original state prior to project implementation.

4.2.4 Social Impact Management


      14.    The contractor shall advise citizens in advance concerning road closures,
             rerouting of vehicle and pedestrian traffic and interruptions in water and sewerage
             services. The contractor should notify citizens and collect their concerns to

            minimise negative reactions according to public notification procedures to be
             included in the EMP.

      15.    Closures and interruptions shall be announced according to the following:
           1.       Announcements will be placed in local newspapers by GWI for two

          ..        consecutive days before beginning construction activities.
          11.       Signs announcing the closure of roads and / or temporary shutoff of
                    services will be placed in the vicinity of the intended construction sites
                    and include a telephone number and contact address for further

         ...        information.
         111.       The contractor shall advise residents when reconnected water supplies are
                    safe to use.

4.2.5 Construction Materials and WasteManagement


      16.    The contractor shall handle construction materials and waste in accordance with
             procedure in the approved EMP. Sites for temporary piles should be agreed with
             GWI, and described in the EMP. The community should be aware of constraints
             imposed on the contractor for waste collection, storage and disposal.

      17.    The contractor shall contain excavated materials in the vicinity of the worksite
             within berms to prevent dispersion and sedimentation of canals, streets and
             adjacent properties.

      18.    Materials that are capable of generating dust when stockpiled must be wetted with
             water and / or covered in order to prevent dispersion.    Stockpiles that remain in
             place more than 6 months may be seeded with vegetation to prevent erosion.

      19.    If material enters drainage canals, it should be removed and properly stored. No
             material shall be stored in such as way as to be carried away by rains or drainage
             canals.

      20.    The contractor shall maintain all liquid and solid construction waste in
             appropriate receptacles and dispose of these at legal dump sites. No inappropriate
             liquid or solid wastes shall be disposed of in drainage canals.

      21.    The contractor shall ensure that disposal of asbestos containing material (ACM) is
             carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Environmental Protection
             Agency and the Occupational Health and Safety Department of the Ministry of
             Labour.

      22.    The contractor shall ensure that all hazardous (ignitable, flammable, reactive,
             corrosive, toxic) material is stored in appropriate, clearly labeled containers.
             Hazardous materials shall always be stored in such a way as to minimise exposure

               to the hazard. In particular, fuel, lubricants and water treatment chemicals must
               always be stored in an appropriate manner.

      23.      The contractor shall ensure that chlorine-contaminated water used to disinfect the
               distribution lines prior to use is collected and disposed of in an appropriate
               manner. The method of final disposal will vary depending on project location and
               will be agreed upon with GWI. Under no circumstances shall the contractor
               dispose of the chlorine effluent in the drainage canal.




      24.      The contractor shall develop a contingency plan to deal with accidents, spillage
               and dealing with complaints, to be approved by GWI. The plan should include:
             I.        Procedures for dealing with occupational accidents, both to workers and
                       citizens.
            ..
            11.        Procedures for dealing with accidental water, sewage andlor chemical
                       spills, including clean-up and remediation.
            ...
           111.        Procedures for dealing with complaints from citizens in relation to
                       construction areas.

      25.      Record keeping shall be maintained for all accidents and injuries. These records
               shall be made available to GWI, EPA, their agents and contractor employees upon
               request of the interested party.

4.2.7 Involuntary Resettlement


      26.      If displacement of persons is unavoidable, GWI will develop, in collaboration
               with the relevant authorities and the contractor, a resettlement plan, which ensures
               that affected people receive fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation.


4.2.8 Community Complaints
      GWI has established procedures for dealing with customer complaints.

4.3  Environmental and Social Guidelines for Supervision During Construction


As discussed in Section 3.3, construction supervision will be conducted to ensure contractor
compliance with the project manual and the environmental specifications included in the bid
documents. These specifications should be incorporated into the project specific EMP to be
developed by the Contractor and self-audited to ensure proper implementation.

A few examples of guidelines that may be covered in the contractor's EMP and self-audit
procedures include:

Dust mitigation and erosion control via methods such as seeding, covering, wetting soils;
Maintenance of local roadways through methods such as a gravel pad at exit from
construction site to remove large debris from tyres;
Limiting sediment transport to streamsthrough use of methods such as silt fences; and
Periodically checking signage and confirming proper communication of road closures
etc.

                                5 Implementation


5.1   Development of Contractor EMP


GWI will complete the screening checklist to identify any potential environmental and social
impacts associated with the project. If any impacts are identified outside of those already
captured in the generic construction guidelines, these will be communicated to the contractor and
be incorporated into the EMP. A project specific EMP will be developed to address any
potential impacts identified by the screening checklist based on guidelines and recommendations
for prevention and mitigation detailed in Section 4.0 of this document.

EMPs are necessary to ensure that the proposed procedures, actions and measures identified as
part of alleviating environmental impacts of a project are not just a statement of goodwill by the
company / developer but that they will be effectively implemented.

The EMP should identify feasible and cost effective measures that may reduce potentially
significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels. It should also involve operational
procedures needed to avoid environmental risks during everyday and maintenance operations, as
well as emergency and contingency plans in case of accidents, where applicable.

Each EMP must clearly state the company's commitment and policy to integrate environmental
management into its operation.

The preparation of an EMP involves the following:

    1. Environmental Policy of the contractor and a project policy statement that incorporates
        GWI's guiding principles presented in Section 1;

    2. Specific objectives of the plan;

    3. Identification and description of the potential adverse impacts and environmental risks
        associated with implementation of the proposed 1existing project;

    4. Detailed description of the appropriate mitigation and compensatory measures together
        with designs, equipment description and operational procedures (as appropriate) to
        respond to these impacts or to avoid or reduce risks.

    5. Determination of requirements for ensuring that responses to predicted impacts are made
        effectively and an implementation schedule (timing) for mitigation measures that must be
        carried out as part of the project.

    6. Development of a program to monitor the impacts arising out of the project operational
        activities and the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures. The monitoring

       plan should detail as a minimum, impact indicators, location and frequency of sampling,
       analytical methods to be used and criteria for evaluation. Such information enables GWI
       and the EPA to evaluate the success of mitigation and allows corrective actions to be
       taken when needed. This program should also include regular audits of the
       implementation of the EMP.

   7. Identification of persons within the company responsible for executing the EMP.

   8. Identification of necessary funds (including budget) to implement mitigation measures.

   9. Emergency Response Plan in cases where the project uses or produces substancesknown
       to have a deleterious effect on the environment. Emergency response to spills should be
       included in this section.


5.2  EMP Approval


The contractor will obtain approval of the EMP from GWI prior to implementation of the EMP
and commencement of work.

5.3  Audit Process


A self-audit process will be included in the EMP to ensure full and efficient implementation of
the EMP, although GWI will periodically audit operations. Audit records should be made
available to GWI and EPA and their agents upon request.

                                   6 Reporting Format


     6.1   Preliminary Environmental Impact Screening Checklist


     A preliminary screening checklist has been developed to identify significant impacts that may
     warrant a more extensive EIA. For screening purposes, impacts are only assessed as positive
     versus negative and major versus minor. Negative impacts are characterised as either "minor" or
     "major". In general, minor impacts are temporarily visible or otherwise notable changes while
     major impacts generally are permanent and require significant mitigation such as resettlement.
     Further characterisation of impacts as cumulative, direct and indirect will generally be reserved
     for more detailed assessment than afforded by the checklist approach.

     EPA will be consulted to identify best practices for all major issues identified through the
     screening process. Typically, any potential major impacts will require further studies to assess
     the sensitivity of the issue, extent of impact and best practice for mitigation.

     Further guidance on each section the screening checklist is provided in the sections followingthe
     checklist. The need for each category of information is discussed and guidance on assessing
     potential impact is presented.


I    6.2   Minimum Qualifications of the Preparer


     The Environment Screening Checklist (ESC) has been developed for use by GWI engineers
     familiar with the project development and the environmental impact screening process. This
     screening checklist may also be used by competent environmental assessment professional to
     held streamline documentation requirements. Those new to the environmental assessment
     process should conduct several screens under the supervision of an experienced professional
     until a familiarity with the types of information is gained and judgment of potential impacts can
     be rendered in a professional manner.


I    6.3   Site Description


     This section provides context for the screeningprocess and information collected in all following
     sections. By providing a detailed description of the site and project, early insights can be gained
     regarding the types of impacts are most likely to be relevant to the project.

     The site should be fully described including project location and boundaries identified on a map
     to allow the reader context for review of the screening checklist. By describing structures,roads,
     adjacent properties, and the surrounding area, the character of the area can be established as basis
     for judgment of potential impacts. For instance, an industrial / commercial area will likely be

more sensitive than a residential area to road closures that may interfere with customer traffic or
shipments. However, a residential area may be more sensitiveto construction noise.

The history of the site is useful for determining if issues inherent to the site itself may exist. A
historically industrial site is more likely to be environmentally impaired. A site that has not
previously been disturbed or has been used only for agriculture may have cultural andlor
archaeological significance,whereas a previously disturbed site is less likely to have high quality
archaeologicalmaterial.


6.4    Future Use


Any activities planned for the site that may cause environmental impacts should be documented.
Examples of future uses that may result in minor impacts include storage of fuel or chemicals
such as chlorine that may spill, industrial activities swch as shipping that may increase traffic, etc.
Risk of potential spills may be mitigated through incorporating secondary containment into
design. Traffic impacts may be mitigated by selection of delivery routes, road improvements or
scheduling deliveries around sensitivehours.

No major impacts are anticipated in association with water and wastewater projects. For
illustrative purposes, strip mining and logging and other activities associated with clearing large
areas are examples of future uses that may pose a major impact during operation and
decommissioning. In the event a potential major impact is identified, a full scale EIA should be
performed and / or specialised studies swch as a wetlands assessment or a critical habitat survey
may be conducted to further assessment impact and best managementpractices.

EPA shall be notified if chemical storage is planned in excess of thresholds establish in either the
GWI corporate guidelines or by EPA.


6.5    Geology and Physical Setting


Information on local geology is collected to asses the potential for mitigation in the event of a
spill and identify special considerations for construction. This information is not likely to trigger
either a minor or major impact by itself, but it may be used in design to mitigate potential
impacts. For example, special foundation considerations may be warranted in areas of fill.
Special considerations may be made for on-site wastewater in area of sandy soils and high
groundwater.


6.6    Hydrology


Information on hydrology and topography is collected to assess potential impacts of or to
stormwater, groundwater and soil erosion. Minor impacts associatedwith high groundwatermay
require project specific consideration of design of on-site wastewater systems, dewatering of

construction trenching, and 1 or maintenance of pipelines located below the water table (i.e.,
potential infiltration).

Identification of wetlands or mangroves on-site is considered a potential major impact, requiring
notification of EPA and further study. A wetlands assessment may be performed to further
assess potential impacts and identifybest practices.

Development of large amounts of impermeable areas in floodplains is also considered a major
impact that may increase flood frequencies. Unacceptable risk associated with high flood
frequenciesmay result in consideration of alterative sites or elevated structures.


6.7   Water and Wastewater


All projects are likely to require water and / or wastewater services to some extent. No major
impacts are anticipated. If no construction water is available on site, minor impacts may occur
associated with dust. Trench dewatering may produce minor impacts if no sewer is available for
disposal. These issues can generallybe mitigated if identified early in the planning process.


6.8   Air


Dust generated during construction is the most likely air related impact for water and wastewater
projects. Minor impacts are anticipated with any project that include significant earth moving
unless mitigation procedures are in place, such as wetting and slowingwork when necessary.


6.9   Solid Waste


Consider how waste will be handled during construction and operation. Depending on the
material handled, either minor or major impacts may result if no solid waste handling practices
are established prior to work. Potential impacts from solid will be addressed by practices to be
included in the project EMP.


6.10 Natural Resources


EPA shall be notified in the event critical habitat or endangered or rare plant or animal species
are identified on site. Identification of any of these on site constitutes a potential major impact
warranting more detailed study.


6.11 Cultural and Archaeological Issues


Available information should be reviewed regarding the location of archaeological sites in the
surrounding area.       If the site has not been previously disturbed and there are known

archaeological sites in the area, an archaeological study or special construction practices may be
warranted. If the site has previously been disturbed, no impact is anticipated.


6.12 Disruption


Disruption impacts are typically minor unless information obtained through public participation
indicates otherwise. Potential disruption to traffic, power, phone, etc. should be noted and
mitigation planned accordingly. Resettlement is considered a major issue and will be addressed
by separateprocedures approved by GWI.


6.13 Aesthetics


Aesthetic impacts are typically minor unless information obtained through public participation
indicates otherwise. Historical areas or public gathering places may required a higher degree of
sensitivity it aesthetics.


6.14 Regulatory Review


Although regulatory compliance of the project is the responsibility of the contractor, a
preliminary review of regulatory requirement is performed as part of the screening process.
Since regulations and permits for water and wastewater projects will be similar for most projects,
a brief review of the site compared to anticipated requirements should be performed.
Requirements that dictate design modifications may be considered minor impacts. Major
impacts generally result in non-compliance and / or increased risk to the project. For instance,
development of a large area of floodplain into a paved area may constitute a major impact
depending on consultation with appropriate agencies.


6.15 Environmental Management Plan


The EMP will be submitted for GWI approval. Therefore, adherenceto a standardisedoutline
report will aid review and approval. The followingoutline is suggested:

    1) Introduction

                                           Checklist


Appendix A contains three Environmental Screenings Checklists.              The assessments are
associated with a feasibility study carried out by GWI in 2004 for the World Bank regarding a
potential intervention by the bank to fund a project that would see wells, treatment plants,
transmission mains, and service connections based around the major population centres of Anna
Regina (Divisionl), Vergenoegen (Division 2) and Rosignol (Division 4). All three projects
were submitted as one feasibility study.

7.1   Planned Intervention for Division 1

7.1.1 Summary of Project


The project area extends from Queenstown to Walton Hall inclusive of both villages, taking in
the primary population centre of Anna Regina. The projected 2024 population covered by the
intervention is 18,727, generating an average water demand of 3.37 MLD. The proposed project
comprises of the following components:

   the drilling of one new well at Lima;
   the construction of a gravity-type treatment plant at Lima including aeration, pH adjustment,
   oxidation, filtration and disinfection;
   the construction of a nominal capacity 1,650m3ground level storagereservoir at Lima;
   the construction of a booster pump station, chemical storage, electrical panels and installation
   of stand-by generator;
   installation of gate, check and air valves throughout.the system in appropriate locations;
   construction of an 18.2kmlong 200mm diameter transmission main;
   rehabilitation of existing distribution network;
   installation of flow-meters at appropriate locations to monitor consumption;
   provision of domestic flow meters for all customers within project area;


7.1.2 Project Environmental Summary


The main potential negative impacts of the project that require carehl management are as
follows:

   disposal of chlorinated water used to initially shock chlorinatethe new transmission mains;
   storage, handling and use of chlorine for on-site disinfection will have to comply with the
   highest safety regulations to both mitigate against the likelihood of a leak occurring, and
   minimise the impact of a leak if one did occur;
   traffic congestion, air quality problems and noise pollution during construction;

   construction material storage and transportation;
   disposal of water treatment sludge in such away as to avoid clogging of drainage channels and
   waterways;

The key positive environmental impacts are:

   water demand within the target area will be managed and reduced, lessening the stress placed
   upon Guyana's groundwater resources;
   water of a higher safety and aesthetic standard will be delivered to residents within the target
   area.

7.2   Planned Intervention for Division 2

7.2.1 Summary of Project


The project area extends from De Kinderen to St. Lawrence inclusive of both villages, taking in
the primary population centre of Parika. The projected 2024 population covered by the
intervention is 22,369, generating an average water demand of 4.03 MLD. The proposed project
comprises the following elements:

   the dnlling of one new well at Vergenoegen and developing the existing well at Vergenoegen;
   the construction of a gravity-type treatment plant at Vergenoegen including aeration, pH
   adjustment, oxidation, filtration and disinfection;
   the construction of a nominal 1950 m3 capacity ground level storage reservoir at
   Vergenoegen;
   the construction of a booster pump station, chemical storage, electrical panels and installation
   of stand-by generator;
   installation of gate, check and air valves throughout the system in appropriate locations;
   construction of transmission mains, of which approximately 9.85 km would be 200mm and
   250mm diameter new pipelines linking to 9km of existing pipelines;
   rehabilitation of the existing distribution network;
   installation of flow-meters at appropriate locations (to form DMAs);
   provision of domestic flow meters for all customers.


7.2.2 Project Environmental Summary


The main potential negative impacts of the project that require careful management are as
follows:

   disposal of chlorinated water used to initially shock chlorinate the new transmission mains;
   storage, handling and use of chlorine for on-site disinfection will have to comply with the
   highest safety regulations to both mitigate against the likelihood of a leak occurring, and
   minimise the impact of a leak if one did occur;
   traffic congestion, air quality problems and noise pollution during construction;
   construction material storage and transportation;
   disposal of water treatment sludge in such away as to avoid clogging of drainage channels and
   waterways;

The key positive environmental impacts are:

   water demand within the target area will be managed and reduced, lessening the stress placed
   upon Guyana's groundwater resources;
   water of a higher safety and aesthetic standard will be delivered to residents within the target
   area.

7.3   Planned Intervention for Division 4




T h e project area extends from Shieldstownto Inverness inclusive of both villages, taking in the
primary population centre of Rosignol.         The projected 2024 population covered by the
intervention is 14,456 generating an average water demand of 2.60 MLD. The proposed project
comprises of the following components:

   the drilling of one new borehole at the proposed site of the treatment plant, and redeveloping
   the existing well at Rosignol;
   the construction of a gravity-type treatment plant at Rosignol, including aeration, pH
   adjustment, oxidation, filtration and disinfection;
   the construction of a nominal capacity 1250m3ground level storage reservoir on the same site
   as the treatment plant;
   the construction of a booster pump station, chemical storage, electrical panels and stand-by
   generator;
   installation of gate, check and air valves throughout the system in appropriate locations;
   construction of an 8.5km transmission main of 200mm to 300mm diameters;
   rehabilitation of existing distributionnetwork;
   installation of flow-meters at appropriatelocationsto create (DMAs);
   provision of domestic flow meters for all customerswithin the project area;



7.3.2 Project Environmental Summary


The main potential negative impacts of the project that require careful management are as
follows:
   disposal of chlorinatedwater used to initially shock chlorinatethe new transmission mains;
   storage, handling and use of chlorine for on-site disinfection will have to comply with the
   highest safety regulations to both mitigate against the likelihood of a leak occurring, and
   minimise the impact of a leak if one did occur;
   traffic congestion, air quality problems and noise pollution during construction;
   construction material storage and transportation;
   disposal of water treatment sludge in such away as to avoid clogging of drainage channels and
   waterways;

The key positive environmental impacts are:
   water demand within the target area will be managed and reduced, lessening the stress placed
   upon Guyana's groundwater resources;
   water of a higher safety and aesthetic standard will be delivered to residents within the target
   area.

        Development of EnvironmentalGuidelines for Construction Projects

Guyana Water Incorporated has developed a set of environmental guidelines that will be
implemented on all projects of value equal to or greater than $5M GYD. The aim of these
guidelines is to minimise any negative social and environmental impacts as a result of
construction projects while maximising the benefits of such projects. These guidelines
will be built into contract documentation and will be implementedby all contractors hired
by GWI.

All interested parties are hereby invited to review the guidelines, which are in draft
format, and submit comments to Guyana Water Incorporated, 10Fort Street, Kingston, to
the attention of the Scientific ServicesManager. The guidelines can be collected from our
Kingston office, or they can be accessed from the Environmental Protection Agency's
website: http://www.epa~uyana.org.

Please note that there will be a public meeting on 17 December 2004 at 10.00hrs in the
Training Room of GW17sKingston office at which comments will be discussed.

The meeting commenced at 10.15hrs in the Training Room of GWI's Kingston Office on
17 December 2004. A presentation was made by P. Singh outlining the aims / objectives
of the guidelines and its general content. After the presentation, questions / comments
were invited from the audience,which are outlined below:

A. Roberts:           Supports the idea of the guidelines and the attempt to standardise
                      the system. Encourages contractors to emulate DWIDAG, a
                      contractor firm that operates to European standards.

Y. Chandisingh:       Supports A. Roberts. Was of the view that the way that
                      construction sites are presently managed could be improved
                      significantly, particularly from a point of view of traffic
                      management, damage to infrastructure such as roads etc.

G. Bess:              While supporting the general concept, has many concerns
                      regarding the implementation of the guidelines, particularly
                      regarding the Personal Protective Equipment requirement. Has had
                      past experience of workers not wanting to use protective
                      equipment due to the fact that they were unaccustomed to wearing
                      them. Workers would have to be provided with training 1
                      education.

N. Persaud:          Has had experience with uncooperative residents, despite them
                     being notified of works, diversions etc.

G. Bess:             Warns that GWI will have to allow for delays caused by dealing
                     with third parties such as the EPA and other legislative bodies, as
                     he was recently penalised for such a delay on a GWI contract.

N. Persaud:          Expressed similar concern.

Y. Chandisingh:      In cases where delays are encountered, contractors need to infonn
                     GWI.

There being no further comments, the meeting adjourned at 11.15 hrs.
