provides contractors with an\n            efficient means of complying with Environmental Impact\n            Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP)\n            requirements for projects in the water sector.  The\n            guidelines lay out preliminary screening, basic\n            environmental and social considerations, environmental and\n            social guidelines, implementation, and the reporting format.\n            The guidelines then detail environmental screening\n            checklists for the major project construction divisions,\n            also noting potential negative impacts for each division of\n            the project.  Volume 2 is comprised of the Corporate\n            Environmental Guidelines for Guyana Water Incorporated\n            (GWI).  The corporate guidelines are composed of three\n            sections; 1. GWI's mandate and environmental and social\n            responsibilities; 2. GWI' s environmental and social\n            guiding principles; 3. GWI employees' roles and\n            responsibilities.  The guidelines note that GWI's\n            mandate is to supply water to the public and its\n            responsibilities follow pertinent stipulations of the\n            constitution of Guyana, the Environmental Protection Act of\n            1996, the National Development Strategy; the Guyana Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy of 2001, and the Millennium Development\n            Goals of 2000.  Its environmental and social guiding\n            principles are based on playing a significant role in\n            Guyana's efforts to improve its environmental and\n            social situation, and in particular improving health and\n            reducing poverty."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
