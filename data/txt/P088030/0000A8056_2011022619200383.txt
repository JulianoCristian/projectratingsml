                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objective is to support the achievement of sustainable universal access to safe and affordable water for the population of Guyana,
                         especially the poor. This Project will also help to consolidate the water sector modernization and reform process supported by IDA and other donors in recent
                         years. Specifically, the Project will:

                          - Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people through the development of treatment facilities in the coastal water supply systems in regions 2, 3 and 5.
                          - Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already connected to the service.
                          - Provide the technical assistance needed to allow for the sustainable development of water resources in Guyana, and support the modernization and financial
                         sustainability of GWI.
                          - Through the emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after the January 2005 floods.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on its way to closing on time: disbursement is essentially complete (at 99.9% disbursement rate) and virtually all works contracts have been completed. The main works
                         on the three water treatment plants have been completed, and all plants have been issued operational acceptance.The last ongoing work is that of the drilling of a well at Lima which
                         has started but encountered technical difficulties; these difficulties are not expected to affect project closure.
