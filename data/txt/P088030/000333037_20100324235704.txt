7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The Project development objective is to support the achievement of sustainable universal access to safe and 
affordable water for the population of Guyana, especially the poor.  This Project will also help to 
consolidate the water sector modernization and reform process supported by IDA and other donors in 
recent years. Specifically, the Project will: (i) Provide access to treated water to over 48,000 people 
through the development of treatment facilities in the coastal water supply systems in regions 2, 3 and 5.  
(ii) Improve levels of service to low and medium income housing schemes already connected to the 
service. (iii) Provide the technical assistance needed to allow for the sustainable development of water 
resources in Guyana, and support the modernization and financial sustainability of GWI. (iv) Through the 
emergency component, provide funding to support recovery needs after the January 2005 floods.
