and\n            Health Project (FPHP) in Bangladesh.  For the Health and\n            Population Program Project (HPPP) it differed in the rating\n            of modest institutional development impact and an\n            unsatisfactory performance of the Bank.  The two projects\n            have made a clear and demonstrable contribution to the\n            Bangladesh's remarkable success in reducing fertility\n            and under-five mortality.  Lessons learned include the\n            following: aid-financed health infrastructure can work in\n            improving health outcomes provided other conditions are in\n            place; public and private provision are complements not\n            substitutes; a sector wide approach (SWAP) takes time to\n            implement and is an evolutionary process; wide stakeholder\n            participation in preparation helps ownership but can weaken\n            design; think through the implications of the new system;\n            draw on the appropriate skills mix; failure to assess fully\n            the political economy of reform and to prepare both a\n            proactive plan for addressing/mitigating risks and a\n            contingency plan will considerably diminish prospects for\n            successful reform; too much donor/Bank intervention can\n            undermine government capacity and ownership of a SWAP\n            approach; and finally, be realistic in tackling major reform objectives."}, "docdt": "2006-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
