The\n            project will strengthen health service delivery by\n            increasing the range of maternal and neonatal health care\n            services, strengthening nursing and medical education,\n            introducing medical quality assurance, supporting medical\n            research, strengthening disease prevention and control,\n            developing urban primary health care, continuing and\n            expanding school health programs, improving district and\n            upazila health facilities, and improving the utilization of\n            upazila health centers. The project will assist in\n            strengthening information systems, improving FP and health\n            management, expanding communications programs, supporting\n            nongovernmental organization activities, and developing\n            innovative projects. Finally, the project will assist with\n            the continuation of three women's programs financed\n            under previous projects and will strengthen and develop the\n            National Nutrition Council."}, "docdt": "1991-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
