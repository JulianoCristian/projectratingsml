PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project is rated satisfactory. Key\n            lessons learned are: 1) Although long-term commitment to the\n            sector on the part of International Development Association\n            (IDA) and other development partners will continue to be\n            essential to the progress of the sector, the project did not\n            effectively address program sustainability or the reduction\n            of continued dependence on external financing. 2) The\n            IDA-led donor consortium largely achieved its aid\n            coordination objectives, thereby reducing Ministry of Health\n            and Family Welfare's management burden in terms of\n            donor relations and facilitating relatively flexible\n            financing arrangements. 3) The projectized approach to the\n            utilization of donor resources was inefficient in a variety\n            of ways and undermined the Ministry's ability to manage\n            its program. 4) The delivery of health and family welfare\n            services through separate Directorates continued to be\n            inefficient and in important respects limited effectiveness.\n            5) Despite extremely limited public resources, pressures on\n            Government to fund expensive tertiary facilities and\n            curative care proved difficult to resist. A public sector\n            focus on priority funding for the most cost-effective basic\n            services is needed. 6) The successful delivery of services\n            by nongovernmental organizations in cooperation with\n            Government suggests that this approach could usefully be expanded."}, "docdt": "1999-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
