expand training of extension\n            officers. The project would establish a link between\n            research and extension and enhance the intensity, coverage\n            and the content of agricultural extension services. A\n            unified extension system would be developed, under which\n            extension workers would receive biweekly training, visit\n            farmers according to planned schedules, and transmit\n            extension messages. The project would raise production and\n            income levels on about 4.8 m acres of land, cultivated by\n            about 1.4 m farm families. The output includes rice, a wide\n            range of upland crops, coconut and undercrops, vegetables\n            and fruits, and livestock."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
