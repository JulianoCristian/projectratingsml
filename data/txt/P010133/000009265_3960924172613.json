With the\n            assistance of the International Development Association\n            (IDA) supervision mission in July 1979, early progress was\n            made in establishing the organizational and administrative\n            framework for project implementation. By the end of calendar\n            year 1979, preliminary administrative and operational\n            systems had been established. The principal weaknesses in\n            project design related to: (a) provision of technical\n            assistance (138 man-months) without a firm commitment from\n            Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) resulting in an ad hoc\n            reduction of consultancies to 50 man-months during\n            implementation; (b) inadequate operational funds for\n            Benchmark Survey and other monitoring and evaluation\n            activities; (c) optimistic assumptions on phasing of\n            procurement and buildings program; and (d) the expectation\n            that GOSL would have the financial resources for the\n            considerable investment on manpower and infrastructure. The\n            main lessons learned were: Adequate operational funds should\n            be provided under Monitoring and Evaluation to carry out\n            Benchmark Survey, monitoring studies, and special impact\n            studies; and the borrower should be provided detailed\n            guidance in the early stages of the project on IDA\n            requirements in respect of audit reports and certified\n            statements of expenditures, and procurement procedures."}, "docdt": "1989-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
