Lessons reinforce once\n            again, that staff continuity greatly facilitate operations,\n            of particular importance when unconventional government\n            structures prevail, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\n            establishment of Project Implementation Directorates, proved\n            highly useful, particularly appropriate in emergency\n            situations as this one, where implementation was critical,\n            and institutional performance weak. Nonetheless, these\n            arrangements should be transitory, to be integrated into\n            established administrative structures later on. Questions\n            arise on the efficiency of focusing on institutional\n            development, when the main priority of emergency operations\n            is emergency reconstruction, and, moreover, the assumption\n            of decisions, and actions during project implementation,\n            regardless of whether it is an emergency operation, or not,\n            becomes further questionable when actually parliamentary\n            action is required. Therefore, given the unpredictability of\n            circumstances on emergency operations, it is thus implied\n            that project design be limited to the utmost simplicity,\n            focusing strongly on the central objective, i.e., physical\n            infrastructure, though project concept, and definition calls\n            for further analysis. But this does raise questions on the\n            time needed for institutional reform, namely where should\n            reform originate."}, "docdt": "2000-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
