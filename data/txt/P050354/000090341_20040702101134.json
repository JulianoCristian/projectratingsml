 follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was unlikely, the institutional development impact was\n            modest, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that conflict\n            reverses the effects of development, imposes large economic\n            and welfare costs on society, and hampers ongoing\n            development activities in their implementation. A government\n            emerging from conflict is likely to have a weak\n            institutional and civil service capacity. Formal education\n            at higher levels requires formal qualifications and\n            credentials. An implementing partner abroad is key to\n            effective management of funds, links with learning\n            institutions, and follow-up of students abroad. Capacity\n            development issues are complex phenomena relating to human,\n            organizational and institutional change. The project used a\n            cost-quality principle that has proven an important factor\n            in achieving the outputs of the project. The project also\n            used a cost-effectiveness principle, and the project has\n            been much more cost-effective than originally anticipated,\n            with US$20 million being re-allocated towards the emergency\n            efforts, the project achieved nevertheless larger outputs in\n            terms of Public Sector Employees (PSE's) trained and in\n            terms of experts recruited."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
