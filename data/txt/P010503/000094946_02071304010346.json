Lessons learned from the\n            project are conveyed as follows. Public institutional\n            investments, when focused on building human capital, deliver\n            positive, catalytic effects; that is, changes in staff\n            motivation, commitment, and re-orientation of attitudes\n            towards work were reported in the project's State\n            Agricultural University, and line departments'\n            activities, and, currently, these institutions are using\n            organizational resources more effectively. However,\n            complementarity between capacity enhancement, and reform\n            incentives are important factors, to be engaged in project\n            design, with issues of internal performance incentives,\n            wherever human capital investments are made. Furthermore, to\n            sustain performance-related behavioral changes, the main\n            goal of the project, the presence of durable constituencies\n            for reform is required, following implementation and when\n            supervisions cease. But creation of such constituencies\n            require delegation, decentralization, and empowerment of\n            various functionaries, as well as institutionalization of\n            key reforms, and, project design needs to devise ways to\n            initiate, and elicit such governance, and institutional\n            reform, probably by phasing in project investments,\n            explicitly linked to the realization of agreed\n            \"milestones\" of governance reform. Other lessons\n            address the need for strong monitoring and evaluation\n            systems, clear objectives, timely training, and\n            capacity-related activities, and integrated financial\n            management, and procurement inputs."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
