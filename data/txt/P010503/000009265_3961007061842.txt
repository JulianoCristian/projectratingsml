MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for SDR 40.5 million, the equivalent of US$59.5 million, on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance an Agricultural Human
Resources Development Project.
2.    Background. Modernizing India's agricultural sector and boosting its growth depend
on diversifying to higher-value crops and introducing integrated farming systems. These
changes require strategic infrastructural investments and sectoral policy liberalization to
encourage private investment in the sector and to integrate the sectoral fabric of India both
internally and with the global economic community. To realize this transformation, the
quality, technical skills and management of agricultural manpower must improve in
consonance with rapidly changing labor market requirements. The significant deterioration in
higher agricultural education that has occurred over the last decade must be reversed in order
to attract top-quality manpower to the sector and realize better performance from national
extension, research and agribusiness systems, for which India has made large investments in
infrastructure, extension networks and technology.
3.    Much of the progress achieved in the agricultural sector over the last 30 years has been
attributable to the State Agricultural University (SAU) system. Following a period of growth,
development and international contact in the 1960-70s, the SAUs reached a plateau of
achievement in the early 1980s and afterwards fell into serious decline. By 1989 there was
widespread consensus that there was urgent need for the Government of India, the states and
the SAUs to give attention to upgrading the quality and standards of higher agricultural
education and to improving university management. Recommendations were made that the
teaching and training responsibilities of scientists should be recognized in addition to research
skills. With reduced public sector absorption of graduates currently in effect, students face
difficult employment prospects and a lack of preparedness for private sector jobs, including
self-employment.
4.    As a key element of India's national developmental efforts over the past four decades,
both the Central and state governments have invested heavily in staff training to improve
competence and efficiency in delivery of field-level services. However, quality of output and
cost-effectiveness of these training programs are often lacking, even though the need for staff
improvement is keenly felt and there is a governmental willingness to commit public funds to
right the deficiencies. Much scope exists to make systems currently in effect in the state
development departments more efficient through the adoption of modern human resource



2
management methods. Adequate efforts are currently not being given to: (a) analyzing
manpower needs in state development departments charged with frontline extension
responsibilities, (b) modifying staff recruitment qualifications and methods, (c) reviewing and
refining job descriptions, (d) assessing actual training needs and upgrading training systems,
and (e) introducing better management systems and methods designed to improve efficiency
and effectiveness.
5.    Rationale for IDA Involvement and Country Assistance Strategy. In 1991, GOI
embarked on a program of stabilization and reform focused on the investment regime, trade
policies, financial sector, taxation and public enterprise. The new strategy aims at reducing
fiscal and balance of payments deficits, promoting rapid and sustainable growth in incomes
and employment through a broad-based liberalization of the economy, and more effective and
efficient public interventions to reduce poverty and to deepen India's human capital. Thc
Bank's strategy for India, presented in the Country Assistance Strategy of May 1994,
emphasizes support for GOI's efforts to promote an enabling environment for broad-based,
efficient, private sector-led growth while accelerating poverty alleviation and the development
of human resources. An important element in this strategy is modernizing India's agricultural
sector and increasing its growth. In addition to market reforms to improve the incentive
framework for agriculture, this transformation must depend on institutional strengthening and
improved resource management. The proposed project is consistent with these objectives by
fostering policy and institutional reforms complemented by investments to upgrade the
quality, management and use of the sector's most important input--human capital.
6.    Project Objectives. The project would introduce meaningful changes in the way the
Center and the states develop and employ human resources in efforts to modernize the
agricultural sector and achieve greater sectoral productivity. It would also encourage changes
in investment priorities which would reap higher returns because of the policy and
institutional reforms adopted. The project would begin a process of: (a) improving the
quality and relevance of higher agricultural education and in-service training programs, and
(b) strengthening the capacity of participating states to develop and manage agricultural
human resources. The project is considered by GOI and the states as the first in a long-term
program to improve agricultural human resources development.
7.    Project Description. The project would be implemented over five years and would
have four main components:
(a)    ICAR Strengthening (US$10.1 million):' The project would enhance the
Central apparatus to establish nationwide norms and standards in agricultural
education, monitor compliance with these standards and prepare future projects.
Each participating state's subproject would include:
Base costs.



3
(b)    University Programs (US$41.8 million): (i) curriculum and syllabus reform,
(ii) faculty quality improvement, (iii) revitalization of teaching methodologies,
(iv) faculty exchanges within India and with foreign universities, (v)
modernization of university administration and management systems; (vi)
upgrading of teaching laboratory equipment, computer systems,
commllunications, farmiis, libraries and hostels, and (vii) establishment of
placement centers and student attachment programs to agroindustries. The
project would promote a number of initiatives to involve university clientele
more in university management and programs and to improve education-related
financial management.
(c)    In-Service Human Resource Development and Management (HRD and
HRM) (US$17.6 million): (i) training focused on job-oriented needs in state-
level agriculturc and agriculture-related departnments, (ii) systematic training
needs assessments. (iii) training of trainers, (iv) evaluation of training
effectiveness, (iv) better instructional facilities, and (v) improved management
of public sector employees.
(d)    Manpower Needs Assessment (US$0.3 million): involving the establishment
of broad-based Manpower Advisory Councils to sponsor rigorous studies of
labor market requirements and trends, or labor market intelligence, within each
state in order to provide state authorities and university officials with
technically sound information for crafting public policy, academic programs,
budgets and adjustinents to university intake numbers.
8.     Policy Reforms. The project supports major institutional and policy reform at the
Centr-ail and state levels. ICAR has prepared a Statement of Agricultural Education Strategy
andt matrix of key actionis to be carried out under the project. The participating SAUs have
prepared a commoni actioni matrix, endorsed by their respective state governments, which
contains impor-tant adjustments/activities to be undertaken during project implementation
(para 10). The ICAR statement anid ICAR and SALJ matrices have been presented in the
SAR and woLIld represent essential clcrnemets of the project's reform package. ICAR's matrix
addresses: (a) the estatblishmiient of a statutory body to set norms and standards in higher
agricultura.ll education. (b) accreditation of universities and their programs, (c) manpower
needs assessmient. (d) admllissions policics at SAUs, (e) edLIcation technology, (f) staffing and
facilitile. in the strengthened ICAR, and (g) modern access to scientific information. The
commnion SAL' nmatrix focuses on: (i) entr-ance qualifications for students, (ii) student
CoLoneCInllg and joh placement serviceS, (iii) education technology, (iv) faculty improvement
p11wraml,lS (v) uL1iversity administr-ation and record-keeping systems, and (vi) fiscal
manacement  In addition. the participating SAUs and states have signed Memoranda of
l7 ndcistanding with ICAR agrecing to abide by the norms and standards in higher agricultural
education whicth l'AR wouldl iramlle irom time to time.

9.     Project Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$74.2 million, with a foreign
exchange component of 50% (US$37.1 million). Investment costs and recurrent costs amount
to 80% and 20% of base costs, respectively. The IDA Credit would be for US$59.5 million,
or 90% of project costs, excluding taxes and duties. The breakdown of costs and financing is
shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing would be provided up to a total of
SDR 1.0 million (US$1.47 million equivalent) to finance eligible expenditures after August
22, 1994. To expedite project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal
applications, a Special Account in US dollars would be established in the Reserve Bank of
India with an authorized allocation of US$4.0 million, equivalent to an estimated four months
average estimated disbursements. The proposed procurement arrangements and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 13517-IN) dated March 9, 1995 is being distributed separately.
10.   Project Implementation. The project would be implemented in five years. The
Closing Date of the Credit would be December 31, 2000. The project would be implemented
through the existing management system responsible for agricultural development and
education at the national and state levels. The major implementors of the project would be
ICAR's Education Division (ED) at the national level, and the Secretaries (Agriculture), the
participating agricultural universities and Development Departments in the three states. (a)
The Center. The Department of Agricultural Research and Education (MOA) would be the
nodal agency responsible for overall project coordination. ICAR(ED) would set and enforce
norms and standards for accreditation and release of Central funds for SAUs; it would also
foster faIculty improvement, promote coordination among SAUs and assist in establishing
contacts with institutions outside the country. (b) The States. The Secretaries (Agriculture)
would organize, coordinate and monitor project activities at the state-level. A small Project
Monitoring and Implementation Cell (PMIC) would be created and attached to each Secretary
to manage these tasks. Main responsibilities at the state government level would be:
manipowcr planning and adjusting public policies and investments in agricultural education,
and humran resource development and management; monitoring project implementation and
providing adequate and timely funding to support project activities; approving annual state-
lcvel project implementation plans; and designing and coordinating HRD programs in the 14
participating Development Departments. The four participating universities would implement
progranis to raise the quality of graduates and improve faculty competence and university
mnanagemnent. The university Vice-Chancellors would be responsible for implementing project
activities at participating universities. Each state government by executive order would
cstablish a broad-hascd Manpower Advisory Council (MAC) consisting of 9-10 members
made up of' thrce flromii the state government, three from the SAU(s), three representing NGOs
and trade interests and one expert in labor market intelligence. Manpower studies would be
car-ied out by quali'ied consultants. MACs would be supported by secretarial units located at
one SAU per state.
11.   Panel of' Experts. The Government of Switzerland through the Swiss Development
Cooperation (SDC) has agreed to fund a Panel of Experts to advise ICAR and the SAUs as



5
they carry out the project. This Panel would provide a core of technical excellence,
continuity and objectivity over a three-year period. Specifically, Panel members would: (a)
assist ICAR and the SAUs to develop a plan of action to assist them in their transitions to
modern accreditation, educational and management systems; (b) conduct seminars on good
education policy and university management practices; and (c) contribute assessments of
project progress to facilitate the mid-term review which is meant to enable mid-course
corrections to project design. In addition, short-term technical assistance would be provided
as required over the three-year period to advise the ICAR and SAUs in special topics to be
identified by the Panel. Such short-term assistance would also include seminars sponsored by
panel members to stimulate discussion of key educational and administrative issues and
present findings/recommendations. Panel members would not undertake any role or
responsibility in project implementation. SDC would fund the Panel on a grant basis through
its existing Special Studies Consultant Trust Fund administered by the Bank. This would be
untied assistance.
12.    Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the project would depend on the long-
term commitment of GOI and the states to enhance the quality of sectoral manpower and
foster its more effective use. The inefficiencies of the status quo are now so pronounced,
standards at state agricultural universities have dropped to such an extent, and the economic
environment in India is changing so dramatically that the current modes of manpower
development/management and academic performance are no longer tenable or sustainable.
The changes in the development and use of human resources fostered by the project are now
advocated widely in India, and have strong support from the Center and the state governments
concerned. Regarding educational norms and standards, the project would support the
strengthening of ICAR(ED) as an interim step until such time as a national Agricultural
Education Council (AEC) is established with statutory powers to set, monitor and enforce
academic norms and standards (para 18). GOI's Ministry of Agriculture has indicated its
commitment to the eventual establishment of this council. The reorganization and staffing of
the strengthened ICAR(ED) supported by the project would be consistent with those proposed
for the eventual AEC.
13.    Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Bank experience indicates that
levels of investment in project-related training have not declined and have frequently
increased during periods of Bank involvement in agricultural sector development. A major
reason for this has been that graduates from tertiary agricultural institutions have not met
labor market requirements in terms of knowledge and skills thereby needing large infusions of
remedial induction and in-service training. Experience also indicates a lack of systematic
human resource management in public sector institutions and services, thereby reducing the

Panel has not been included in project cost estimates.

effectiveness of' staft'. In a 1992 study,' OED stated that Balnk projects have missed flactors
which are key to the stability, relevance and effectiveness of' agricultural higher educaLtion,
including: (a) ensuring an adequate flow of resources to an institution; (h) en-endering
conditions--including good governance and managemient at the univer-sity lecel--to prolmloU:
institutional autoniomy and accountability; (c) creating linkages to clients and colleaLCus; arild
(d ) coordtinating research and extension investments with those in ait(icultul-Ld Liniversitles to
promiiote institutional synergies, responsiveness and adaptability by CducationI institutions.
OED recommilended that the Bank should: (i) involve a broad range of sectoral
representatives in problem  analyses and project design; (ii) improve project monitoring and
evaluation-; (iii) focus project assistance on upgrading university management and developing
appropriate ,,overnance; (iv) incorporate agricultural concerns and organizations into
university decision-making; and (v) strengthen ties to local and international agricultural
researcil instituitions. These lessons have been takeni into aCCOUnt in the designi of the
prIoposed projeCt.
14.    Agreed Actions. During negotiations with the Government of India, ICAR and the
thiee participating states, the f'ollowing assurances and understandings were obtained:
Condition of Project Effectiveness. ICAR's Education Division would establish an
Accreditation Board satisfactory to IDA.
Other Assurances. These assurances relate to actions to ensure the timely
implementation of project activities and, among others, woul d include: (a) GOI will
make Credit proceeds available to ICAR and the participating states according to
GOI's standard arrangements for developmental assistance to central agencies and the
states; (b) by April 30 of each year starting in 1996, an annual implementation plan
ftor the ICAR activities under the pro-ject acceptable to IDA will be approved by a
conmilttee consisting of the ICAR Director-General, Deputy Directorl-General (ED)
and FA of ICAR; the ICAR implementation plan for 1995 will be so approved by
May 31, 1995; (c) by April 30 ot' each year startilig in 1996, an annual
implemenitation plan of' eacih participating state acceptable to IDA, including the
par-ticipaitilg universities, development departments and MAC, will be approved by a
state-level committee consisting of Secretaries of AgricultUrle and Finance, the Vice-
Chancellor(s) of participatting universities, the heads of' the developimient departments
and f'our eminent persons nominated by the Government representing education and
agr-oindustries; the states' implementation plans t'or 1995 will be so approved by
May 31, 1995; (d) the Accreditation Board and the sections of' the strengthened
ICAR(ED) will be hully operational and staffed with senior persons acceptable to IDA
by Septembner 30, 1995; (e) by June 30, 1995, a Manpower Advisory Council
acceptable to IDA will be established in each participaiting state; (f) sLubsequent to the

completion of the project-financed studies of higher agricultural education financial
management, the participating states, SAUs and ICAR will develop a common
strategy by September 30, 1996 for discussion at the Mid-Term Review and at that
time would agree on an action plan for implementation; (g) by June 30, 1995,
participating states and SAUs will expand the SAU Boards of Management to include
at least two additional private representatives of the agricultural sector; (h) on or
before June 30, 1995, each SAU will establish a broad-based advisory group in
consultation with IDA to meet at least once each year to obtain feedback about the
preparedness of university graduates and relevance of their programs and to receive
advice about future directions of university activities; (i) participating states will
provide adequate and earmarked funds to the SAUs on an annual basis to adequately
maintain buildings, facilities and equipment; (j) ICAR's Deputy Director-General (ED)
will be given adequate powers to use project funds once annual implementation plans
and budgets are approved without recourse to item sanction by ICAR's Financial
Advisor; (k) project accounts and the Special Account will be maintained and audited
annually according to appropriate auditing principles; (I) a joint mid-term review be
held no later than December 31, 1997.
Understandings. Understandings were reached that: (A) GOI will release in advance
to the participating states those funds necessary to cover about three months of
anticipated project expenditures to participating states; and (B) upon receipt of such
quarterly funds from GOI, the participating state governments will transfer the funds,
together with their own quarterly allocations for the project, to agencies responsible
for project implementation, to be used exclusively for eligible expenditures under the
project.
15.   Environmental Aspects. SAUs have expressed interest in including environmental
courses as integral components of curriculum development. Greater dialogue between the
SAUs and the wider community, including NGOs, would enable grassroots concerns for
environmental issues to be raised for SAU action, both in the classroom and in research. In
the long-term, the project would foster the production of higher quality graduates, more
attuned to environmental choices and issues, better prepared to communicate
technical/business options and opportunities to the farming community and better equipped to
develop public policy and sound managerial decisions based on efficiency and environmental
considerations. The project could have beneficial environmental impact by encouraging
training for staff in public service in environmental topics for agriculture and around specific
environmental issues (e.g., integrated pest management, environment impact studies, pesticide
management and control, sustainable agricultural management).
16.   Project Benefits. The project would support improved human resources development
as a means of accelerating agricultural growth. By improving the quality and effectiveness of
sectoral manpower, the project would protect and enhance the benefits derived from the
considerable investments made and proposed in agricultural research, extension and other
services. By strengthening the Center's capacity to set norms and standards in agricultural



8
universities and to accredit such institutions rigorously, the project would foster a national
upgrading in the quality of higher agricultural education. Because of policy, administrative,
pedagogic and infrastructural improvements made under the project, better quality graduates
would be produced at SAUs more compatible with labor market signals. The quality of
teaching would improve at the SAUs as a result of staff training received under the project,
improved access to worldwide scientific information and enhanced teaching resources and
systematic teacher/course assessments. The basic quality of life on campus for both students
and faculty would be enhanced through upgraded housing, recreational facilities and health
services. A key benefit of the project would be the establishment of worldwide professional
contacts in scientific fields and the creation of a new cadre of Indian educators/scientists
which would have received exposure to education, education technology and scientific
research abroad. It would be constructive if bilateral donors encouraged their countries'
educational institutions to establish training and other professional contacts with Indian
agricultural universities. Academic inbreeding of both faculty and students would also be
curtailed. The project would foster greater interaction between the university and the outside
community of entrepreneurs, government, farmers and NGOs. The management and
administration of each participating university would become more efficient because of the
policy changes made and the management information systems introduced. The project would
begin a close examination of and improvement to financial management of higher agricultural
education which could ultimately increase the chances for financial sustainability of the
system. The project would initiate the establishment of a much-needed national agricultural
information system complete with computerized on-line databases at university-level and at
ICAR.
17.   The project would improve management and operational performance of key
agricultural institutions at the Center and state-level because of better, more efficient human
resource management. In-service training would be strengthened and be made demand-
driven. MACs would provide broad-based fora for substantive debate on agricultural human
resources issues and for the formulation of reasoned advice to decision-makers. State policy-
makers and university administrators would have access to technically sound analyses of labor
market trends on which to base policy, budgetary and academic planning.
18.   Risks. As a long-term goal, the project would support the eventual establishment of
an AEC to set norms and standards in higher agricultural education. AEC would have
statutory powers to enforce these standards through its certification of SAUs and their courses
and through their funding of educational programs at the universities. Such a statutory body
would help ensure that uniform standards are established at the national level and enforced
throughout the country, and given the statutory nature of the eventual council, that higher
standards once achieved are more likely to be maintained. A risk exists that action to
establish the AEC might experience delays because of the elaborate Center-state consultative
and legislative process involved. The implementation of the project would not be adversely
affected by delay in establishing AEC since as an interim measure the project would achieve
many of the beneficial reforms by implementing the project through a strengthened
ICAR(ED). This division would be responsible for monitoring and shepherding the process



9
of state and Central legislative action to establish the AEC. An important activity in IDA
supervision would be to track progress in setting up the Council.
19.   The project promotes important changes in the way the states develop and use human
capital. Progress in implementing these changes might be slowed by the traditional inertia
present in agricultural development departments and SAUs. This risk is reduced by the
widespread institutional and political support in India for reforms built into this project, as
evidenced by the production of sound project proposals produced by ICAR and the states. In
addition, the project's mid-term review and other project fora, including supervision missions
and Panel seminars, would provide opportunities to assess progress in introducing changes,
share experiences and take corrective actions to attain objectives. The project's monitoring
and evaluation system should provide a reliable, ongoing gauge of project progress in its
various components and thus help guide timely and appropriate corrective actions.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
