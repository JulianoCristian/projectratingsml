MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSMUCTON AND DEVELOPM
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSD LOAN
TO MAURI    FOR THE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMEN An SERVICE PR
1.    The following memorandum and recom ation on a proposed Loan to Mauritius for
US$10.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed Loan would be on IBID  tem  with a 17
yea maturity w}th  years grace and would help put in place orgnizational arrnforsectoral
management and delivery of supporting services in the agricul  secoor.
*       Background
2.    Mauritius' structural adjustment program introduced in the ealy 1980s has been succesl In
encouraging export-led growth powered by sugar, manufactured exports and ourism. Suaied
growth rates and sound economic management led to major Inprovements in the extal accounts
and per capita incomes doubled in less hn a decade. But the econDmy rema_n dependent on a
narrow range of actvities with limited growth potential. Sugar is stil the lwgest source of net foreign
exchamge earnings and accounts for 75 percent of agricultural GDP.
3.    Future growth will depend on both diverification and Imoven In  productdvity since the
economy has attained full employment and land is limited. Given the domestic resoure constraints
and the highly competitive exten  market conditions, the key to fiutre success is sophisticated
management and highly skilled manpower capable of adaptig quickly to changing maret condions.
In agriculture the levels of skills and flexibility need to be improved to meet the exactng demands of
competitive markets. Sectoral policy making and magm     are constained by: weak_n in
coordinion mi  4anisms between MAPNR and producers in setting prioiies; insuffiient anltytical
capacity to meet the growing demands; bottlenecks in infomaon flows resulting in less than opdmal
decision mading; and insufficient assessment of organizational efficiency within the complex
istutiona appts serving the sector. Supporting services for resrch and etension for
diversification activities lag far behind those for sugar in terms of organiation, maagement, faciltis
and logistical support. In irrigation less than one third of the estad potei is being utilized
because of isufficient capacity to plan efficien use of the potential. Most of the exisig systems are
high cost (drip and high pressure sprinlder) and affected by problems of labor magement and tmely
water delivey. At the production level, especially in the smallholder  for, modrnization has not
lkept pace with the rest of the economy.
4.    These constraints have been studied in detail by GOM, the Bank and other agencies. At a co-
lenders meetng in Decmber 1990, GOM outlined Its strategy for Impring producvity,
diversificaton and modernization in the agricultural sector. The supporting investment program
covering both public and private requirements was favorably received. Also GOM has already
embak  on a program, with assistance fm the Bank and other donors, to Iitiate a number of
refirms and invesmes. This project would assist in developing key elements of the initutional
fameworlk to support the on-going reform program and proposed investment. Specific areas of
focus would be strengthening and reorganizing arangements for sectoral policy making/management
and key suporting services for diversification activities.

Padt xEre    ad Radtonale for URID  nvoelvmeut
S.    The Bank has gained considerable country   eience and learnt usefd lessons from its
invlvement in the agricultural sector in Martius. lhe two agricultural projects, the Tea and Rura
Development Projects implement d in the seventies, were unsuccessl In a number of areas becas
of inutonal and policy constraints. The experience of these two project pointed strongly to the
need for project design to carefully integrate inves with reform of the policy enviromet and
the istution   struce. The problems invved in publi secor operato  also heped sbift focs
to exploiing more fidly the potenal in the private sector trou  creation of an appropriate business
environment. These lessons were useflly applied and heped the Bank make a major impact in the
restucuring of the sugar industry. Tbis impact was achieved through a combination of severa
Intuments. Under the structural adjustment prgm, mao poic refom  were inoduce to
im e incives and efficiency. Cosensus buding was purud ho  Intensive dialogue with
both the Govnment and the private sector duig tbe prpati  of a report on the sugar sectr,
fobowed by an Action Program for sugar sector and a suppotg Investment opeaion-the Suga
Industry Project (   2728-MAS, approved in June 1986-which provided ntment and techical
assne bfr comolidating and etending the resuctuin proces. The overall pogram has boee
successul, ad te, comprehensive Sugar Industry Efficiency Act was formally adopted in Decembr
1988. The suga indsry is on a strong fincial fot , major  pements hav been adcieved In
fctoy      nion and hence in efficiency in procesn and egy productio. nstonal
arrangemens for coordination within the sugar sector and for providing services to smalholders have
also been successful.
6.    Th proposed project reflects these leson and exp  in Its desig and stategy.
Csiderablediaogu and eflt have boee put into its preio  Th sccsfd approach to
coorination and pollcy reform in th sugar sector woud now be expdd  to include the no-a
sector. Th  apprach in sugar to research and farmer services would also be applied to the re of
agruure, with apprpdate modifications, and overall codiao would be imved. The prject
is thoerore a logical contnuadon of Bank involvement in h agricultril sector. Moreover, as
Impl_g agency for the IFAD Small-Scale Aguture Project, the Bank has pind knowledg
of teo         on smll faner productvity In the nonsu   seoa. Tis couy  eXPedence
combined wit a broad access to ros-country eeienc gie the Daok a comparive advantage in
ssitIn GOM In a major reoiton and strengthening of serv  in the agricull secomr.
Bank involvement would also assist in donor codinato in the sector and in cnisec In
pwoacs to te organiatn and management of esearch, exension and rigaton services.
Pf'jet Objetves
7.    The objecdve of the project is to put In place  o-ganizationa  tfo sectoral
and delivery of supporting services, which arepond flexibly and efficlendy to
continuewdstr     transfmaton In the economy and rapidly chani  competOive maket
onditio. The project would stngthen both the proce and tho analytical fouions of secta
policy frmultlon and management. In the ddivery of supportg senices, the project aims to
improveorn       , management and use of rsmources as well as upgrade skldl and facilities.

private sector representation and supported by an Executive Secretar; (ii) creation of an agricultural
policy analysis planning, monitoring and evaluation unit (APAU) within MAFNR to provide
analytical back-up to the CCA and the operational departments and parastatals of MAFNR; and (ii
computerized agricultural and management information systems; (b) !mmon in mach and
extension services through (i) separation of these services for nonsugar activities fom the rlatoq
functions of MAFNR into a new Directorate of Agricutural Research and Extension (DARE) with
strengthened management, training and operating facilities; and (U) bet coordination of research and
extension for all agricultural activities; (c) Deyalme of irrigaiM= through 0)
strengthenng of management technical and planing capacity in the rgtion Authority (IA); (H)
improved efficiency in existing syms through repairs and bette manam     systems for water
delivery; and (iii) pilot/small-scale projects to test a low cost approach to irigain; and (d) Qhsc
mnitnw    imce   imwrQamenm   mainly through consulting studies and tiing fellowships on O)
specific aspects of marketing issues; (ii) supporting arangements fr smalscale agbuine; and
(ii) management capability at farmer level. A breakdown of costs is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
ad methods of procurement and of disbursements, as well as the d i      schedule ar  o    in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank group opera in
Mauritius are given in Schedules C and D respecdvely, followed by a map of existing and proposed
irrigation systems. the Staff Appraisd Report No. 9330-MAS dated May 7, 1991 is attached.
Areed Actions and Assunc
9.    Conditions of loan effectiveness would be: (a) eabshme  of the CCA and appointment of
its Executive Secretary; (b) establishment of the APAU and WotmeS of key staff, (c)
establishment of DARE and appointment of key staff; and (d) satsfctory reoaniaton of the IA.
Other agreed actions and assurances include: (a) satisfactoy   for the coordination of
agricultural research and extension; (b) establishent of a Water Resources Commie by Decembe
31, 1991; (c) finalization of a detailed traing program for IA sff by May 31, 1992; (d)
implementation of a pilot program of Water Users Associaons and an exchag of views between the
Bank and GOM by November 1, 1994 on the potenti for Surter action; (e) completion of a study
befre June 30, 1994 on efficiency and water charges in irrigation and joint agreent by the Bank
and GOM at the Mid-Term Reviw on an action progra  for impleentat  of the recos
of the study; (f) implementation of a pilot surface iigation system and an exchange of views by
December 1994 on conclusions and potental for expansion; (g) intiation of a study on marketi
constraints of small producers by March 31,1992 and joint agreemnt on an action program by
December 31, 1992; (h) implementation of a monioring progrm  of the opertons of the Agricultural
Marketing Board by March 31, 1992; (i) initiation of a study on the promotion of small-scale agi-
buiness by December 31, 1991 and exchange of views on recommeons and progress with

DBne Its
10.   The project would contrbute towards creating-ma enabling policy and upportng framework
for a diversified, competitive and sustainable agricultural sor. Successful diversification from
suga is of key importance to Maluritius' long-tem development and a modern competitive
agricultural sector is crucial to intenal stability and sustinable use of the island's natural resources.



Environmenl issues have been assessed and are being addressed diecy under the Environmenta
Monitoring and Development Project (Ln. 3277-MAS). Th Institutional developmet under ths
project would reinforce capacity for Implementing the recommended environmental approach in
agriculture. Bendits from te proposed iw ti   development would also Include improved
efficiency in agricultural manageme  and services, inaed productivity of land and labor,
Increased nonsugar agricultural production for export and the domesic market, and higher incomes
for smallholders. The project would hav, a beneficial impact on womn sin  in small-scale
agricul     operations women account for 40 percet of employment as both laborers and owner-
opertr.
Ris
11.   Client support risks are low. The project suppos MAFNRs Initiatives in resodg to
demands from producers and others for Improve ients in the areas to be adressed under the project
The nmeures under the project involve mainly strengthening adId supplementng of existng
mngemet arragements and building upon local expeices in aodiation and user paticipatoL
The proposed org    onal changes in research and  tension ae based on succeal local
exeiences in the sugar secaor. GOM has agreed to a dated action program which would minime
risks of delays in implementation of the necess;ay policy and intulonad chges. Ihe
technical/marketing risks associated with the developmeat of exprtable cps/products at competitive
prices would be addressed rough the strengthening of tecical capacity and the mareting s
under the project. These measures would be reinforced by tchn    support ad   dies fimnced by
other donors as well as the Bank under onoing projects and sector work
12.   I am satisfied  at the prposed Loan would comply with the Aricdes of Alemet of the
Bank and remmend tiat the Executive Directos approve the proposed Loa
