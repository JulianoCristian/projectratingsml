                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As a result of the 2011 drought-induced food crisis in the Horn of Africa, an estimated 25 percent of Somalia’s population has been displaced, either within Somalia or to neighboring
                         countries (primarily Kenya and Ethiopia). Unable to receive assistance in the most heavily affected areas of Somalia, people are being forced to travel long distances under difficult
                         conditions. As a result, Somali refugees—and particularly women and children—are arriving in camps in Kenya and Ethiopia in urgent need of health and nutrition services. Given
                         the sub-regional emergency context, refugee populations are overcrowding and overwhelming the existing response capacity in Kenya and Ethiopia, given the pre-existing food
                         security and health sector constraints in both countries.

                         The Horn of Africa Emergency Health and Nutrition Project contributes to the overall international response through the provision of financing for health and nutrition interventions to
                         vulnerable populations in targeted refugee camps in Kenya (Dadaab) and Ethiopia (Dollo Ado). This regional grant supports the expansion of the United Nations Refugee Agency’s
                         (UNHCR) on-going program of health, nutrition, water, and sanitation service delivery to the largest refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. The Horn of Africa Emergency Health and

                         Nutrition Project (US$30 million grant) was approved on September 15, 2011 and funds became available on September 19, 2011.

                         As of May 25, 2012, the grant was 100 percent disbursed in support of UNHCR's health, nutrition, water, and sanitation program in Kenya and Ethiopia (Dadaab and Dollo Ado
                         Camps, respectively). Between September 2011-March 2012, this emergency response operation supported service delivery to nearly 600,000 beneficiaries in Dadaab and Dollo
                         Ado. These program activities have included treatment of children for malnutrition, provision of nutrient supplements to pregnant and lactating women, immunization of children, and
                         the expanded provision of water and sanitation services within the refugee camps.
