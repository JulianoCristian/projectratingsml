                         Implementation Status Overview
                         -Project Background: As a result of the 2011 drought-induced food crisis in the Horn of Africa, an estimated 25 percent of Somalia’s population was displaced, either within Somalia
                         or to neighboring countries (primarily Kenya and Ethiopia). During mid-2011, an estimated 2,000 new Somali refugees were arriving daily in Kenya and Ethiopia.

                         -World Bank response: Given the magnitude of the Somali refugee crisis in the Horn of Africa, this regional project (US$30 million IDA/CRW grant) was processed in five weeks
                         under OP/BP 8.00 (Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies) and was approved by the Board on September 15, 2011. The project became effective on September 19, 2011.

                         The project supports health and nutrition interventions in targeted refugee camps in Kenya (Dadaab) and Ethiopia (Dollo Ado) and is implemented by UNHCR. It was the first
                         operation to receive financing through the dedicated Crisis Response Window (CRW) for the Horn of Africa. It is the first and only IDA operation for which the 2008 United Nations
                         Fiduciary Principles Accord (FPA) has been applied on an exceptional basis to channel IDA resources directly to UNHCR. This approach required the processing of a Board-level
                         waiver. The Ministries of Finance of Kenya and Ethiopia endorsed these alternative implementation arrangements.

                         -Implementation status and project closing: The Horn of Africa Emergency Health and Nutrition Project has fully disbursed. Between September 2011-September 2012, this
                         emergency response operation supported service delivery to over 1,000,000 beneficiaries in Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp and Ethiopia’s Dollo Ado refugee camp. Project-financed
                         activities have included treatment of children for malnutrition, provision of nutrient supplements to pregnant and lactating women, immunization of children, and the expanded
                         provision of water and sanitation services within the refugee camps. The project will be closing, as scheduled, on March 29, 2013. This is consequently the third - and final ISR - for
                         the 18-month implementation period of this emergency operation.
