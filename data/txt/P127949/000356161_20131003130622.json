for the Horn of Africa Emergency\n            Health and Nutrition Project for Africa were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            high; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: ensuring a quick disbursing mechanism and working\n            through specialized partner agencies for an effective\n            emergency response. Need for speed and flexibility when\n            responding to an emergency context. The speed, flexibility,\n            and responsiveness with which the project was prepared,\n            reflected the urgency and severity of the 2011 crisis in the\n            Horn of Africa. The inclusion of retroactive financing in\n            the project design encouraged and enabled rapid\n            implementation start-up in the emergency response context.\n            Utilizing standard International Development Association\n            (IDA) lending instruments in support of refugee populations\n            generally does not provide appealing options to governments.\n            Importance of addressing the needs of refugee camps\n            populations and surrounding communities in an integrated\n            manner.
