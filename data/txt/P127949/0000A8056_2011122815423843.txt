                         The project was approved on September 15, 2011 and funds became available on September 19, 2011. As of December 5, 2011, the grant was 68 percent disbursed in support of
                         UNHCR's health, nutrition, water, and sanitation program in Kenya and Ethiopia (Dadaab and Dollo Ado Camps).

                         The grant has helped support the following UNHCR key activities over the past three months:

                         In Kenya, the Dadaab refugee camp has been addressing an outbreak of acute watery diarrhea/cholera. The first case was detected in August 2011. Since then, more than 364
                         cases have been reported in the camps with 13 confirmed cholera cases. Recent rains and flooding are believed to have contributed to the problem. To manage the outbreak,
                         UNHCR and partners have set up cholera treatment centers for severe cases and requisite support and supplies at health posts. Other measures include working with the Ministry of
                         Health, UNICEF and other partners to train community health workers; increasing chlorine levels at water-points to kill cholera-causing bacteria; and promoting good hygiene

                         practices among the refugees. This includes information on proper latrine use and hand washing with soap. Each refugee now receives 250 grams of soap along with their food
                         rations.

                         In Ethiopia, a nutrition survey at the Kobe and Hilaweyn camps in Dollo Ado found high levels of malnutrition among children under 5 years of age. In response, health and nutrition
                         programs have been set up to address malnutrition, especially among the youngest children. Despite continuing malnutrition, the number of deaths among children under 5 has
                         decreased dramatically when compared to the very high levels seen at the height of the refugee influx earlier this year. This reflects improved access to health care and improved
                         water and sanitation facilities, which receive WB support. Since October 2011, intermittent heavy rains have resulted in flooding in many parts of the Dollo Ado complex of camps,
                         sometimes hindering access. Construction on a fifth camp in Dollo Ado, Bur Amino, continues. Upon completion, Bur Amino will be home to the latest arrivals who are now staying at
                         the transit center. There are currently an estimated 8,000 refugees in the transit center.
