The Horn of\n            Africa was experiencing the most severe food crisis in the\n            world. As a result of the drought-induced food crisis, an\n            estimated 25 percent of Somalia\u2019s population had been\n            displaced, either within Somalia or to Kenya and Ethiopia.\n            Somali refugees, particularly women and children were\n            arriving in camps in Kenya and Ethiopia in urgent need of\n            health and nutrition services. The Horn of Africa Emergency\n            Health and Nutrition Project, funded by World Bank, focused\n            on expanding the implementation of a health and nutrition\n            package of services. The project supported the provision of\n            sufficient quantities of clean water which was an essential\n            component of nutrition and health programs. The project\n            contributed to the overall international response through\n            the provision of financing for health and nutrition\n            interventions to vulnerable populations in targeted refugee\n            camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. In addition to the provision of\n            health and nutrition services to refugee populations, the\n            immediate response focused on boosting safety net , cash\n            transfer, and cash for work programs, followed by support to\n            livelihood recovery, reinvigorating crops and livestock\n            production, strengthening health facilities, and disaster preparedness."}, "docdt": "2012-04-09T07:47:01Z"}
