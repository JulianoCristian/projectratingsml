                         From May 9- May 13, 2011 the World Bank Group conducted a stock taking mission to Cape Verde. In conjunction with the other members of the Budget Support Group (BSG) ( a
                         partnership framework for a common approach to Budget Support between the Government of the Republic of Cape Verde and the Budget Support Partners), the Bank’s participant
                         assessed the country’s progress in the main areas ofthe joint matrix. The summary below presents progress in the main areas of engagement in PRSC VI.

                         Good governance: The macroeconomic framework remains adequate and the good management of recurrent expenses has allowed for a lower than expected overall budget deficit.
                         The PFR reform continues to be on track and the Bank and BSG partners encouraged the government to maintain the pace of reforms. The government is also implementing the
                         recommendations from the PEMFAR. In terms of external control, there has been no progress in the effectiveness and performance of the Court of Auditors (CoU). Regarding state
                         reform, the civil service pay and career reform plan has been delayed due to its potential impact on the civil service payroll and therefore on the macro-fiscal stability. With regards to
                         debt management, the rapid increase in fiscal and external deficits raise concerns for long term sustainability. Despite the recent positive progress in establishing borrowing controls
                         to state owned enterprises (SOEs), these continue to be a source of considerable risk since contingent liabilities originated by these SOEs are not included in the public sector debt
                         accounting. In the face of these challenges, the BSG encouraged the GoCV to consider reducing fiscal deficits and external borrowing from 2012 onwards and maintain domestic

                         borrowing low. Since the country will not be eligible for concessional loans at the end of 2012 the government may need to scale back the countercyclical impulse in order to restore
                         fiscal and external sustainability. On the procurement front, it is important to note that the decree creating the procurement managements units (UGAs) has been approved although
                         the overall legislative needs to be updated to ensure consistency of the procurement and audit system. Some of the essential legislative reforms, such as Budget Framework law,
                         Status of the Court of Auditors, Status of the municipalities, were not approved as a result of the dissolution of the parliament prior to the general election of February 2011. On M&E,

                         the government is developing a system geared towards improved institutional, technical and operational capacities. At the end of 2010, as the process of territorial planning
                         continues, 9 PDMs and 3 EROTs have been approved.

                         Human capital enhancement: Significant progress has been achieved in Technical and Vocational Education and Training with the approval of the new institutional architecture of
                         IEFP and improvements in the delivery of training and professional internships. Although figures from the budget execution demonstrate that the sector was unable to absorb all
                         available funds there is evidence that some areas could have benefited from higher allocations. The sector is therefore confronted to an inefficient allocation of funds.

                         Competitiveness: The legislation governing trade is still not fully compatible with WTO standards, thus reducing FDI prospects. In the financial sector, the current legislation does not
                         provide adequate authority to the Central Bank to effectively perform his supervisory role. Some of the regulations on onshore and offshore banking threaten the stability of the
                         financial system. The business climate suffers from the lack of an effective bankruptcy regulation increases credit-recovery risks and financing costs.

                         Infrastructure: In energy and transport, the financial and commercial performance of ELECTRA and TACV has not improved. These two companies are highly indebted and TACV
                         does not have audited company financial data for recent years. However, the GoCV, ELECTRA and the regulatory agency (ARE) adopted some measures worth mentioning such as
                         the introduction of a new tariff regulatory model (it is expected that the readjustment in tariffs over the last months may improve the financial sustainability of Electra) and the
                         implementation of the MECOFIS program aimed at reducing technical losses. TACV reported that outstanding arrears with its domestic and internal supplies have all been cleared,
                         and is planning to prepare a business plan that includes debt refinancing, new capital investments and the expansion of its network.

                         The GoCV is currently working on the design of the third Growth and Poverty and Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP III) with the goal to have a final draft by the end of the year. The
                         BSG recommended that the GoCV conduct a consultation with the major stakeholders for GPRSP III.
