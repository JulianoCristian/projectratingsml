                  SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                       CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Recipient:             The Republic of Cape Verde.
Implementing Agency:   Ministry of Finance.
Financing Data:        IDA Credit, SDR 6.4 million (US$10 million equivalent)
                       Standard IDA terms: 35-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.
Operation Type:        Single Tranche Operation of SDR 6.4 million
                       (US$10 million equivalent). Second in a programmatic series of 3
                       operations.
Main Policy Areas:     Based on the program development objectives described below, the
                       proposed operation will cover four policy areas: (i) good
                       governance; (ii) human capital enhancement; (iii) competitiveness;
                       and (iv) infrastructure. Good governance includes fiscal policy,
                       public financial management, procurement, state modernization, and
                       statistical development and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
                       capacity. Human capital enhancement focuses on vocational
                       training. Competitiveness encompasses trade openness and business
                       climate improvements. Infrastructure includes managerial
                       improvements in public utilities in energy and transportation.
Key Outcome                                                2010         Target (2011)

                       excluding fuel, per passenger
                       seat-kilometer.
Program Development    The overall objective of this operation is to support the policy
Objective and          reforms and institutional development necessary to foster sustained
Contribution to        economic growth. The operation aims to: (i) preserve
Country Partnership    macroeconomic stability and improve government service delivery
Strategy:              through the implementation of a reform agenda for public finance
                       management, procurement, government structure and M&E;

                                            vii
                 (ii) support human capital through the institutional upgrading of the
                 vocational training system; (iii) improve competitiveness by
                 strengthening and rationalizing financial sector regulation and
                 ameliorate the business climate; and (iv) ease bottlenecks to growth
                 through reforms in public utilities management. The PRSC VI is
                 designed to promote the three strategic objectives of the Country
                 Partnership Strategy (CPS), which includes supporting reforms to:
                 (i) promote good governance and public sector capacity; (ii)
                 strengthen human capital, and (iii) improve economic
                 competitiveness and the investment climate.

Benefits:        Expected benefits of the measures supported by PRSC VI include:
                 (i) greater efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources;
                 (ii) improved business climate to foster private sector development;
                 and (iii) improved operational and commercial performance of
                 public enterprises in the energy and air transportation sectors.
Risks and Risk   (a) Macroeconomic risks from vulnerability to adverse
Mitigation:           external shocks. Mitigation: A record of sound financial
                      management has left the country relatively well prepared to
                      manage macroeconomic shocks, and its institutional capacity is
                      strong by regional standards.
                 (b) Contingent liabilities of public companies (ELECTRA and
                     TACV) are source of fiscal vulnerability. Mitigation: The
                     PRSC series together with other Bank instruments are the
                     primary instruments in support of the ongoing reform of
                     ELECTRA. Similar actions included in the policy matrix for
                     TACV will reduce this risk.
                 (c) The political risks coming from changing government
                     priorities during and after the elections. Mitigation: the
                     current government has demonstrated a strong commitment to
                     fiscal discipline, and the reforms supported by the PRSC enjoy
                     significant support across the political spectrum. To mitigate
                     political risks regarding the reform agenda, PRSC VI supports
                     reforms that depend primarily on the Executive.
                 (d) Implementation capacity constraints. Mitigation: To
                     address this risk the government's budget support partners
                     have made available a combination of capacity building efforts
                     and technical support.

                     SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                                         1.    INTRODUCTION

1.1    The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC VI) is the second in a
programmatic series of three one-year operations (PRSCV to PRSC VII) designed to support the
implementation of the government's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, as presented in the
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (GPRSP-II). The Government of Cape Verde
(GOCV) has made considerable progress in achieving its reform objectives under both the
current and previous PRSC series and has completed all PRSC benchmarks. Additionally, the
government has met all assessment criteria for the final review of its International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Cape Verde has built a solid reputation for good
governance and responsible fiscal policy: it ranks first in the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) for the Africa Region (Low Income Countries). From 2000 to 2008 the Cape
Verdean economy enjoyed an average annual real GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent. In 2007 Cape
Verde graduated to Middle-Income Country (MIC) status.

1.2     The global financial crisis has had an adverse effect on Cape Verde's economy resulting
in a decline to 3.6% of GDP growth in 2009. In response, the government was able to implement
a strong fiscal impulse to smooth the negative effects of the global downturn in 2008 and 2009.
This fiscal impulse was based on the acceleration in public investment accompanied by tax cuts.
New resources were directed to much-needed capital investment in the power generation, ports
and air transportation sectors, as well as the rehabilitation and expansion of key infrastructure.
Tax rates on corporate and individual income taxes were reduced to sustain private sector
investments and household consumption. Overall, the government's policy response to the
global financial crisis has been measured and effective in mitigating the impact of external
shocks on Cape Verde's economic growth, while maintaining fiscal and external sustainability.

1.3    However, the economic slowdown in the Euro Zone is a cause of concern. The Cape
Verdean economy is tightly integrated with the Euro Zone, through its export revenues (chiefly
tourism and related sectors,1) along with foreign direct investment and emigrant remittances.
The high fiscal deficit has increased the debt-to-GDP ratio, limiting the fiscal space and the
government's ability to attenuate the effects of a further weakening of the European economy.

1.4    The proposed PRSC VI will support the government's efforts to maintain fiscal stability
and support economic growth, while continuing its reform program. The PRSC VI will enable
the government to pursue administrative reforms in the operation of the public utilities and
national air carrier. It builds on the reform program supported by the PRSC V, particularly the
reforms in the energy and air transportation sectors, the current poor performance of which is a
major obstacle to medium-term economic growth. The budget support it provides will help to

secure the gains in public health and education that were the focus of PRSCs I though IV by
obviating the need for budget cuts in social services, and it will enable the government to
continue its course of investment in critical infrastructure and complement them in critical areas
as energy and transport.

1.5    According to the analysis that underpins the proposed PRSC VI, fiscal deficits are
expected to remain high through 2012. These are largely the joint result of adverse external
conditions and the temporary acceleration of public investment which reflects the strategy to take
advantage of the five-year window under which the government can still tap concessional
sources of financing, following Cape Verde's graduation to MIC status. As the global economy,
and the Euro Zone in particular, recovers from its current recession, the Cape Verdean economy
should return to a robust growth path, and, in this context, the government's long-term
macroeconomic stance remains adequate. The current PRSC VI will enable the government to
maintain fiscal sustainability and continue its investment program without curtailing social
services or accumulating an unsustainable debt burden.

1.6    Following the approach of the previous PRSCs this operation is being prepared in close
coordination with other budget support partners through the joint policy matrix of the Budget
Support Group (BSG). The design of the proposed PRSC VI, which is embedded in a three-year
matrix agreed upon with the authorities and the BSG, was based on the government's GPRSP-II.
This ensures harmonized donor support and strong government ownership of the reforms
included in the program.

                                 2.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

                  A.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN CAPE VERDE

2.1     After enjoying an impressive average annual GDP growth rate of more than 7 percent
during 2003-2007, GDP growth declined to 6.2 percent in 2008 as the initial, limited effects of
the financial crisis became apparent. The full impact of the crisis was not felt until 2009, when
the GDP growth rate fell to 3.6 percent. The government moved swiftly to address declining
global demand for Cape Verdean exports and the contraction of international credit markets
through a countercyclical fiscal impulse driven by a combination of tax cuts and increased public
investment, which avoided a deeper slump in domestic economic activity. This strong fiscal
impulse and the temporary rise in global demand led to a modest recovery in economic growth at
the end of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010.

2.2     With a long record of fiscal prudence having created sizeable fiscal space, there was
significant room for a strong fiscal response when the crisis materialized. Thus, in 2009 the
government cut personal and corporate income taxes, increased spending in priority sectors
including health and education, and launched an aggressive public investment program designed
to stimulate domestic demand while easing infrastructure bottlenecks that would otherwise
constrain medium-term growth. New public investment commitments initially exceeded the
execution capacity of state agencies, but capital spending accelerated in 2010. Increased public
investment mitigated the effects of the financial crisis, as investment-driven growth helped to
maintain employment and private investment despite declining global export demand. As a

result, leading indicators revealed a favorable performance in the first half of 2010 and GDP
growth is projected to increase to 5.4 percent in 2010.

2.3     On the monetary side, the government has made the accumulation of foreign reserves a
priority in order to maintain its fixed exchange rate peg against the Euro. The Central Bank
(Banco de Cabo Verde, BCV) policy rate is determined by the euribor adjusted for the country
risk premium. However, in early 2008 the global credit freeze caused a spike in Euro Zone
interbank rates, which temporarily exceeded the BCV's adjusted euribor rate. In the second half
of 2008 the BCV raised its policy rate to protect its foreign reserves, stabilize capital inflows,
and to relieve inflationary pressures that had pushed the consumer price index to 6.8 percent,
well above the decade average. Inflation in Cape Verde is primarily supply driven and increased
as a result of the rising cost of imported food and fuel. As import prices moderated consumer
price inflation fell to just 1.0 percent in the following year and is expected to vary around 2.5
percent through 2012. Foreign reserves have also held at around 4 months of imports and are
projected to remain stable.

2.4     While Cape Verde has performed relatively well during the first round of the global
financial crisis, quickly adopting an appropriate policy response that substantially alleviated the
impact of the global downturn, the recent worsening of external conditions due to the Euro Zone
sovereign debt problems is worrying. Due to its heavy reliance on tourism, foreign direct
investment, bilateral aid and emigrant remittances the Cape Verdean economy is closely tied to
the global economy--and to the Euro Zone economies in particular--and is highly sensitive to
international macroeconomic shocks. Thus, the deterioration of European conditions could
amplify risks, and austerity measures in donor countries could have some negative effects on
tourism as well as disbursements and approval of new projects financed by donors.

2.5      Since 2005 tourism has accounted for between 15 and 22 percent of GDP, and changes in
demand for tourism services, along with their secondary effects on related sectors such as
construction and transportation, have had a major impact on economic growth and the fiscal
accounts. As tourism receipts rose from 2005 to 2008 in line with the broader economic
expansion the fiscal deficit fell from over 6 percent of GDP to less than 2 percent. The reduction
of fiscal deficits and solid growth performance led to the reduction of the public debt from 87
percent of GDP in 2005 to 65 percent in 2008. In 2009, however, with the decline of tourism
receipts the fiscal deficit rose to 6.3 percent of GDP2, and as a result of the implementation of an
ambitious program of public investments, which entails an expected increase in capital
expenditures from 13.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 22.6 percent of GDP in 2010; GDP growth
rate is expected to increase to about 5.4 percent in 2010. At the same time, public sector debt is
expected to reach 80.9 percent of GDP, substantially limiting the available fiscal space for
further policy stimulus.

2.6     Foreign direct investment, about two-thirds of which is devoted to the tourism and real
estate industries, more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, but dropped dramatically in 2009.
While tourism has moderately rebounded since then (growing by over 7 percent between the first

2
  Previous projections by the IMF indicated that the government deficit in 2009 would reach 10 percent of GDP. The
low implementation of investment projects and a lower fall in revenues than the expected resulted in a lower fiscal
deficit.

quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010) and FDI has increased modestly in the past year,
the medium-term recovery of the sector and the future availability of foreign capital remain in
doubt. The majority of Cape Verdean FDI originates in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the United
Kingdom, all of which are vulnerable to a protracted economic slowdown.

2.7     Since 2005 remittances have amounted to between 8 and 13 percent of Cape Verdean
GDP and represent a substantial contribution to private consumption and the balance of
payments. Though remittances did not significantly diminish during the global financial crisis
the slowdown- in the Euro Zone economies challenges faced by several Euro Zone economies,
which together account for 85 percent of Cape Verdean remittances, is likely to produce a much
more severe decline. Between January and June of 2010 total remitted income was 5 percent
less than that observed during the same period in 2009.3 Finally, bilateral aid could also be
affected as the passage of austerity budgets in key donor countries may reduce the flow of
official transfers to the country.

                   B.    MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.8    Going forward, the medium-term macroeconomic outlook remains favorable, assuming a
moderate but steady global recovery. In the short run, it is expected that the Cape Verdean
economy will experience important but transitory adverse external and fiscal imbalances, which
however do not reflect structural weaknesses in the domestic economy or in the government's
macroeconomic policy framework. Just as the shocks suffered by the Euro Zone economies will
continue to transmit their effects, their eventual recovery will also return Cape Verde to its
previous economic growth path, or indeed one that may be higher in light of its public
investment program.

2.9     As noted above, the countercyclical expansion of public spending initiated during the
global crisis has been partially delayed by capacity limitations in the executive agencies, and
much of the spending authorized for 2009 will actually occur in 2010-2011. The overall fiscal
deficit is expected to reach 13.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and to remain in double digits at 11
percent in 2011, while the current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to rise
from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 18.1 percent in 2010 and is expected to remain above 15
percent through 2012. However, due to the lag in budget execution the fiscal projections reflect
a substantial variation between projected spending (in future years) and actual spending (in
previous years), and it is likely that budget allocations under the fiscal stimulus program will
continue to exceed the spending capacity of state agencies in the near term. As a result, the
projections show a radical year-on-year increase in expenditures (and deficits) that is not likely
to fully materialize in practice, as budget execution is expected to remain below projections.
Moreover, to finance the acceleration in public investment, the government has utilized the
current five-year period of concessional lending to finance the accelerated implementation of its
investment program.4

2.10 The large projected fiscal and current account deficits have raised concerns regarding
long-term sustainability. While the 2010 debt sustainability outlook for Cape Verde is broadly
unchanged compared to projections in the joint Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis for 2009,
the temporary acceleration of external borrowing for investment to address infrastructure
bottlenecks brings debt/GDP trajectories close to risk thresholds under the baseline scenario.
Moreover, since most of the debt is highly concessional and on terms longer than 10 years, debt
service thresholds remain far below risk thresholds at low and manageable levels.

2.11 The overall macroeconomic outlook remains fundamentally strong. The GDP growth rate
is expected to recover to above 5 percent in 2010-11 and pick up in the medium run, averaging
6.5 percent annually from 2012-2015. Fiscal deficits are projected to fall to less than 8 percent of
GDP in 2012 and 3.6 percent in 2013. External balances will return to their pre-level crisis of
around 12 percent after 2012. Following a substantial increase in indebtedness through 2012,
(see Table 2-2) improved growth prospects and lower fiscal and external balances are expected
to curb the debt-to-GDP trajectory.



4
  After its graduation to the Middle-Income Country (MIC) status in 2007 Cape Verde was granted a five-year
period in which it will continue to receive the concessional lending and grant treatment of a Low-Income Country.
This period ends in 2012.


                                                      -6-
2.12 Moreover, it should be noted that while these projections account for the immediate
growth effects of the ongoing fiscal impulse, they are based on current infrastructure capacity
and therefore do not fully reflect the long-term impact of the government's capital investment
program. In fact, quarterly growth rates for 2010 are exceeding initial expectations, and though
much depends on the evolution of external conditions it appears likely that future growth will
continue to surpass recent projections. However, even under the most favorable scenario the
government must begin to substantially reduce its deficit spending by 2012. To enhance fiscal
and external sustainability, the government will need to reduce external borrowing from 2012
onwards, increase domestic revenue, and maintain domestic borrowing low to accumulate
foreign reserves and reinforce the credibility of the currency peg.

2.13 In summary, Cape Verde's macroeconomic management provides an adequate basis for
the proposed operation. The government's actions thus far have been sound: its response to the
crisis was both swift and measured, the initial fiscal impulse significantly alleviated the impact
of declining external demand, and by focusing on capital investments the government has
already started to alleviate constraints on the long-term growth of the economy. The
government's demonstrated capacity to select productive investment projects and to implement
them effectively will be crucial to promoting higher growth rates while preserving fiscal and
external sustainability. The government intends to scale back foreign financed spending as soon
as the current investment program is completed in order to rebuild its fiscal space. The
government demonstrated commitment to fiscal responsibility provides a strong indication that it
will continue to exercise prudence in its fiscal and macroeconomic management.

                          Box 2-1: The Public Investment Program

The Cape Verdean government's ambitious public investment program for the period 2010-2013
is designed to eliminate infrastructure bottlenecks, enhance the country's growth potential, and
temporarily shore-up employment and consumption in the context of a slow recovery of external
demand. The key features of the public investment program include the following:

       Externally-financed investments over these four years amount to US$480 million,
       representing in average 18 percent of GDP. Investment is focused almost exclusively on
       the transportation and energy sectors, which at present are inadequate to meet the needs
       of a growing economy.
       Investments in the transport sector represent 65 percent of the package. Transportation
       investment is largely devoted to ports and roads and designed to increase infrastructure
       capacity and lower logistics costs. Investment in ports accounts for 35 percent,
       investment in the rehabilitation and expansion of the road network represent 25 percent,
       while airports and maritime traffic capital expenses respond for the remaining 10 percent
       allocated to the transportation sector.
       Investments in the energy and water sectors represent 25 percent of the investment
       program. Increasing energy generation capacity and improvements in the electricity
       transmission network represent 18 percent, while investment in water and renewable
       energy account for the remaining 7 percent allocated to the sector. Investments in
       sanitation, housing and urban development account for the remaining 10 percent of the
       investment program.
       Due to the strong but temporary impact of the global financial crisis on the Cape
       Verdean economy the execution of the public investment program has been substantially
       accelerated in 2010; it is then expected to decline gradually through 2013. It is important
       to note that while the investment program will dramatically increase capital expenses,
       current spending will remain unaffected. There has not been, nor is there expected to be
       any significant increase in the staff or other organizational assets of the agencies charged
       with implementing the investment program. The increase in total expenditure is
       therefore unlikely to translate into a permanent fiscal expansion.
       All projects have undergone feasibility and market studies. The government has
       rigorously evaluated the impact of its new capital projects, and all are geared to
       addressing the critical infrastructure constraints described above. The government has
       made a commendable effort to avoid wasteful or impractical spending and to ensure that
       all projects contribute to the long-term growth of the economy. As a result of this
       evaluation process future growth and fiscal revenues are likely to exceed the projections
       of recent debt sustainability analyses.

        3.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

 3.1     The government's overall development strategy is set forth in its second Growth and
 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP-II), which covers the period 2008-2011. The GPRSP-
 II builds on a number of important strategic documents, including the current administration's
 Government Program, the Great Options of the Plan and the Economic Transformation Strategy
 (ETS) adopted in 2003. Recognizing that development challenges of Cape Verde are manifold
 and interdependent, the ETS proceeds from the premise that poverty cannot be reduced without a
 robust broad-based growth agenda based on accelerating growth rates, diversifying the national
 economic base and increasing competitiveness. GPRSP-II therefore focuses on pursuing three
 primary goals through the implementation of five strategic pillars.

 3.2      The overarching objectives of the GPRSP-II are:

          (a)    To reduce unemployment to below 10 percent;
          (b)    To maintain an accelerated real economic growth rate of above 10 percent; and
          (c)    To reduce the poverty rate by one half.

 3.3    To achieve these objectives the GPRSP-II established a reform agenda prioritizing
 macroeconomic stability as a precondition for accelerated growth and poverty reduction. It
 emphasized the reorganization and modernization of the government to make public
 administration more transparent, accountable, efficient and results-oriented. It identified the
 development of human capital as necessary to match the skills of the labor force with the
 employment needs resulting from the economic development strategy and to reduce the


                                                 -9-
unemployment rate. It called for the upgrading of the country's economic infrastructure to
eliminate bottlenecks to growth, and for the enhancement of social protection policies and social
service delivery.

3.4       Accordingly, the GRSP-II's five strategic pillars are:

       (i)    Promote Government Reform. GRSP-II regards macroeconomic stability and
              public sector efficiency as prerequisites for ensuring long-term growth and poverty
              reduction. The objective is to guarantee fiscal stability and to make the public sector
              more efficient and better-oriented to the government's development priorities through
              the modernization of the public administration, the implementation of better
              management practices in public financial management, procurement and human
              resources. The reform agenda also encompasses the simplification of administrative
              procedures and structures, legal and judicial reform, the expanded use of information
              technology and the decentralization of revenues and spending responsibilities from
              the national government to the municipalities.
      (ii)    Develop Human Resources. The objective is to create a more competitive human
              resource base with advanced levels of scientific, technical and technological
              knowledge and the skills required for the services industries in order to increase
              employment, especially for youth, and to strengthen Cape Verde's global
              competitiveness in sophisticated technological industries and services.
      (iii)   Build Competitiveness to Meet the Challenges of Sustainable Development and
              Globalization. Along with the adoption of a growth-oriented fiscal policy and public
              sector reform agenda, which are designed to strengthen the government capacity to
              finance and implement much-needed public investment in critical infrastructure areas,
              the main components of the government strategy in support of private sector
              development and competitiveness include measures to increase trade openness,
              improve private-sector access to credit and guarantee financial sector stability, and
              enhance the overall business climate.
      (iv)    Improve the Country's Economic Infrastructure. The objective is to increase
              public investment in infrastructure in order to meet the growing needs of its citizens,
              to resolve infrastructure bottlenecks, and to keep pace with the fast-growing tourism
              industry. A central objective of the GPRSP-II is to develop a modern and efficient
              energy sector capable of supplying the power needed for growth, competitiveness and
              welfare improvements.
       (v)    Strengthen Social Cohesion. The aim is to substantially reduce poverty by: (i)
              improving access to microcredit, labor conditions and the social protection system;
              (ii) reducing unemployment; (iii) strengthening food security; (iv) ensuring better
              health care services for people of all income groups; (v) supporting youth
              development and integration into the economy; and (vi) promoting gender-sensitive
              development.

Participatory and Consultative Process

3.5     The definition of Cape Verde's development priorities, as embodied in the GPRSP-II, reflect not
only rigorous technical analyses but also a participatory decision-making process. The Joint Staff
Advisory Note that accompanied GPRSP-II highlighted its inclusive preparation process, which
resulted in strong ownership of the strategy by the government and society. The GPRSP-II was
prepared by the Technical Secretariat for Development Assistance at the Ministry of Finance,
which worked in close coordination with the line ministries. A corresponding communication
strategy was also developed, and consultations were held with municipal representatives, civil
society organizations and private sector stakeholders in Santiago, São Vicente and Sal Islands.5

                4.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                       A.    LINKS TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

4.1     The proposed operation is fully consistent with, and closely linked to, the objectives of
Cape Verde's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY09-12 approved by the Board on 21st
April, 2009. The CPS establishes a framework for the World Bank Group's selective and
demand-driven support for the implementation of GPRSP-II for the period 2008-11. The focus
of the CPS is on helping the government to sustain high levels of growth and reduce
unemployment and poverty by promoting good governance, economic competitiveness and
strong social cohesion. The CPS is designed around three strategic objectives: (i) promoting
good governance and public sector capacity; (ii) improving competitiveness and the investment
climate to enable private sector-led growth; and (iii) strengthening human capital and social
cohesion. The CPS program will be implemented with: (i) financial resources from the
International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and trust funds; and (ii) non-financial support from these organizations
through analytical and advisory services, technical assistance (TA), policy dialogue, and project
supervision.

4.2     The CPS specifies how the new PRSC series will contribute to each of its three strategic
priorities. The IDA PRSC series will continue to be the main instrument for supporting reforms
in public financial management, strengthening public administration and improving the business
environment. The budget support program will increasingly focus on reforms to strengthen
private sector development and boost competitiveness, reflecting the new priorities of the
government and, therefore, those of the World Bank (as reflected in GPRSP-II and the CPS).

4.3    PRSC VI is a key tool to support the five strategic pillars of CPS. This includes
providing support for reforms to: (i) promote good governance and responsible macroeconomic
management (e.g. by supporting the government's countercyclical response to the deterioration
of external demand conditions while taking appropriate measures to maintain fiscal
sustainability); (ii) enhance human capital to match labor supply and demand (e.g by
5
  The process of consensus-building and data/information gathering included working sessions between: (i) the
Minister of Finance and Public Administration and members of the government and ministerial staff responsible for
planning and management; and (ii) the Technical Secretariat for Development Support and other government
departments (in particular for defining the logical framework, budgeting, and indicators) as well as with municipal
chambers, civil society groups and the private sector.


                                                      - 11 -
strengthening vocational training); (iii) improve competitiveness and the investment climate (e.g.
by supporting the adoption of regulatory and trade reforms compatible with the World Trade
Organization [WTO] regulations and reducing the costs of business registration and closing); (iv)
guarantee the efficient provision of economic infrastructure (e.g. by promoting managerial
capacity in key infrastructure sectors, particularly in energy generation and transportation
services); and (v) strengthen social cohesion (e.g. by supporting the design and adoption of
targeted social protection policies).

                       B.    COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

4.4     The staffs of the Bank and the IMF collaborate closely in their work with Cape Verde.
IDA typically takes the lead on sectoral issues, including public sector management, private
sector development and infrastructure provision, while the IMF takes the lead on macroeconomic
and financial policies. This PRSC has been prepared in close coordination with IMF staff and in
consideration of the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) reviews. The PSI focused, inter alia,
on supporting fiscal, tax, debt management and financial stability policies. In a number of areas
where the PSI and this operation overlap the work is being carefully coordinated to ensure that
consistent advice is provided to the authorities and that triggers and structural benchmarks are
complementary. Two such areas are public financial management and debt management. To
support the control of the government's contingent liabilities the IMF has included as a new
structural benchmark for 2008-2009 (which was met by end-March 2009), the compilation of a
consolidated balance sheet for five state-owned enterprises (including ELECTRA, ENAPOR and
TACV) detailing their debt by maturity, currency, residency and state guarantees. The staffs also
collaborated on the preparation of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).

4.5     Donors have harmonized their budget support to Cape Verde around key policy measures
and results indicators. Seven donors are now part of the Budget Support Group (BSG), and have
signed the Memorandum of Understanding "Partnership Framework between Budget Support
Partners and the Government of Cape Verde for the provision of Budget Support". The Group
consists of the African Development Bank, the Austrian Development Agency, the European
Commission, the Netherlands Embassy, the Government of Portugal, and the Spanish Agency
for International Development Cooperation and the World Bank. In addition, the United Nations
recently joined the BSG as an observer. These donors conduct joint reviews twice a year, which
allow for consensus-building and lower transaction costs for the government.

4.6     The government and its donors have developed a streamlined matrix, which is used as the
basis for discussions and disbursement in the donors' respective operations.                  Donor
harmonization in Cape Verde has allowed for the broader coverage of international community
support while avoiding duplicative efforts and allowing for the provision of coordinated
technical assistance in certain reform areas. In addition, the BSG has increased the government's
ability to attract further external support6. All PRSC VI prior actions are part of the joint matrix
document (see Annex 4 Table 4A-1).

                      C.   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

4.7     Related World Bank Group support to Cape Verde currently includes financial support
through investment, technical assistance and development lending operations (the own PRSCs
series) as well as selective grant-based funding. In particular, IBRD's Cape Verde Recovery and
Reform of the Electricity and Water Sectors Project aims at supporting a comprehensive sector
recovery, an objective shared by the proposed PRSC VI. The former includes three major
components: (i) priority investments in electricity and water, which will significantly increase


                                                  - 13 -
the electricity and water supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing costs; (ii)
improvement in sector performance and institutional reform, which supports activities and
investments designed to improve commercial performance (loss reduction and bill collection);
and (iii) ELECTRA's restructuring, which supports activities related to institutional and
managerial reform in the state energy and water utility. The energy pillar of the PRSC VI
reinforces components (ii) and (iii) above, supporting key administrative reforms to increase the
operational and institutional performance of ELECTRA. These reforms are necessary to
guarantee the financial sustainability of ELECTRA as a prerequisite for the improvement and
expansion of the energy supply.

4.8    In June the Board of the Bank approved the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)
Capacity Building and Economic Governance Project. The activities included in this project
provide technical assistance to the government for the design and implementation of investment
climate reforms such as the bankruptcy law, the revised investment code, and a set of
government procurement reforms designed to guarantee transparent and fair competition in
government purchases; all of these are part of the competitiveness pillar of the PRSC VI. The
PRSC VI team is coordinating closely with the SME Capacity Building and Economic
Governance Project to ensure synergy between this project and the PRSC series.

4.9      PRSC VI also supports the continuity of the reforms fostered by the Growth and
Competitiveness Project, which was approved on May 2003 and closed in December 2009.7 The
goal of the Growth and Competitiveness Project was to broaden private participation in Cape
Verde's economy, enhance private sector competitiveness and further develop its financial
industry. It focused on financial sector reform, investment climate reform, post-privatization and
divestiture reforms, and private sector and institutional capacity-building. PRSC VI will
reinforce the gains made under the Growth and Competitiveness Project by continuing to provide
support to improve the investment climate, strengthen the financial sector and increase
institutional capacity.

4.10 Finally, the PRSC VI will benefit from the recently approved grant from the Trust Fund
for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB). This grant will support Cape Verde's efforts to
improve the collection, processing, analysis, dissemination and use of timely, high quality
statistics in accordance with the objectives of the PRSC VI's good governance pillar. In
particular, the component on statistics and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) supports the
country statistics agenda and the development of the government M&E system.

                                     D.    LESSONS LEARNED

4.11 The design of PRSC VI is based on the following lessons learned from Cape Verde's
experience with PRSC I through V:

       (a)   Strong client ownership of the reform program is essential to its success. In the
             proposed operation client ownership is assured by the close dialogue that the Bank
             has conducted with the government, and by the government's proactive role in


7
  A Growth & Competitiveness Supplemental Credit was approved on January 2007 to further support these
development objectives through funding for additional activities.


                                                - 14 -
      defining the policy matrix around reform measures that were both high-impact and
      feasible within the timeframe of the operation.

(b)   Enhanced donor coordination and the alignment of reform incentives can be
      achieved through the use of budget support. The shift in favor of budget support in
      Cape Verde has been catalytic in harmonizing aid, and budget support operations
      have succeeded in enhancing the leverage for reforms while reducing transaction
      costs. This is particularly important in a small country such as Cape Verde, where
      the public sector can quickly be overwhelmed by aid and associated requests from
      donors. The Budget Support Group now includes seven participants. These budget
      support donors have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government
      detailing their commitment to aid coordination. This includes a joint matrix
      (highlighting the main policy and results indicators to be supported), and provides
      for joint review missions twice a year and joint preparation and discussion of Aide
      Memoires.
(c)   Technical assistance and capacity building resources should accompany policy
      lending in order to ensure: (i) the strengthening of capacity of domestic
      counterparts, and (ii) support to specific reforms via specialized analytical work or
      reform-specific capacity building. Achieving the results targeted by PRSCs
      requires strengthening counterpart capacity, and the World Bank will remain
      closely involved in capacity building through technical advice from the PRSC team
      and financial and technical support through the SME Capacity Building and
      Economic Governance Project. Particularly relevant for this operation is the
      ongoing analytical work on poverty and labor markets.
(d)   The need for realism in the definition of reform targets is critical. The technical
      capacity of Cape Verde's government is limited, and the political constraints on
      reform in an electoral period are particularly formidable. The reform targets have
      been designed to take these constraints into account. A variety of arrangements for
      technical support have been incorporated into the project, from the provision of TA
      from other projects (SME) to TA provided by other development partners (the
      European Union, Spanish Cooperation). Political constraints have led to the
      inclusion of PRSC VI prior actions that depend exclusively of the Executive and
      PRSC VI triggers that will need strong political support, which is more likely to be
      available in the first year of a new administration than in the last year of the current
      administration.
(e)   Greater attention should be given to the establishment of effective M&E systems in
      public administration. The first four PRSCs did not succeed in producing a fully
      functioning M&E system in Cape Verde. In this context, PRSC VI continues the
      work of PRSC V to support further development of public sector M&E.

(f)   It is crucial to simplify and harmonize the policy matrix. Based on the experience
      of the previous PRSCs the policy matrix was prepared according to the principles of
      simplification (fewer prior actions and triggers) and harmonization (a common
      matrix shared by donors).

                               E.   ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.12 The proposed operation is built on a number of reports by both the Bank and the
government, and significant technical assistance has been provided to the government during the
preparation stages of the operation. This includes: (i) two Public Expenditure Reviews (PER),
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), and a Debt management
performance Assessment (DeMPA) which contributed to the identification of reforms to promote
good governance, improve public financial management to avoid the generation of arrears and
enhance public sector capacity; (ii) the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) and a recent
assessment on the formal labor market, which contributed to the identification of reforms to
improve competitiveness and the investment climate and promote private sector-led growth and
to reinforce the need for improvements in vocational training.

4.13 The Public Expenditure Review Update, "Cape Verde, The Challenge of Increasing
Fiscal Space to Meet Future Pressures", highlights Cape Verde's recent successes in fiscal
consolidation but points out the necessity of further reforms. Progress in public finance reform
has included efforts to improve the legal framework and budget execution. Key outstanding
impediments to the efficiency of public finance are: (i) the delay in the submission of accounts to
the Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas, TdC), which reduces the effectiveness of the Court's
assessments; (ii) weak implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF);
and (iii) insufficient financing for the TdC and the General Inspectorate for Finances (Inspeção
Geral de Finanças, IGF) to fulfill their mandates. Additionally, the PER Update points out the
need to increase electricity tariffs to ensure the fiscal viability of ELECTRA. PRSC VI supports
organizational reforms to decrease the delay in the submission of accounts to TdC and the
improvements in budget execution that would reduce the probability of contingent liability and
arrears accumulation.

4.14 The latest ICA (2006) concluded that while manufacturing firms are relatively productive
in Cape Verde, there is a need to increase export volumes and trade diversity through reforms to
promote competitiveness and eliminate barriers to trade. Exports of manufacturing firms in Cape
Verde are lower than in any of the comparison countries in the ICA, including small island
economies like Maldives and Mauritius. Expanding and diversifying the export base in Cape
Verde is important to reduce its vulnerability to external shocks and to sustain and continue to
improve the overall standard of living. Structural constraints to exports (such as the small size of
the domestic market, its physical isolation and distance from major shipping routes) make it
difficult for firms to compete in labor-intensive manufacturing and emphasize the importance of
developing other industries (such as tourism, financial services and IT services). Policies to
promote exports should focus on: (i) increasing competitiveness through investment in the power
generation and transport sectors and the promotion of lower labor costs (e.g. by increasing the
human capital of the workforce); and (ii) reducing administrative barriers to exports. The
proposed PRSC supports initiatives in these areas, including the adoption of procedures and
legislation conforming to WTO rules, the advancement of a comprehensive development strategy
for the tourism sector, training of the workforce, energy sector reform and public investment in
transportation.




                                               - 16 -
4.15 Diversification is also strongly advocated by the DTIS prepared under the leadership of
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2008. Recognizing the impressive
performance of Cape Verde's economy over the past several decades the study identifies the
tourism sector, offshore services and business process outsourcing, and the use of its
geographical location as a transshipment point and passenger hub as the areas with the greatest
potential for further growth. The study also offers recommendations for improving trade and the
investment climate. Trade-specific recommendations include the definition of an external trade
strategy and the development of institutional and human resource capacity in the key ministries
involved in trade promotion. Investment climate suggestions include enhancing vocational
training programs and guaranteeing a sustainable energy supply throughout the country; both of
these actions are supported by the PRSC series.

4.16 Ongoing and planned analytical work will inform the design of future operations in the
series. The PRSC VI team will coordinate closely with the relevant research teams so that
ongoing and future analytical work provides specific inputs for the selection of prior actions and
triggers in the following operations in the series. This includes coordination with the labor study
that will be conducted to assess misalignments between recent unemployment and GDP growth
rates. This study will help the team and the government to better understand the link between
growth and poverty reduction, and the role of labor market performance therein, and will provide
input on potential reforms to reduce unemployment. Additionally, a Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) will update knowledge on competitiveness and growth while emphasizing
the identification of relevant obstacles, thereby providing input on how future operations in the
series could tackle binding constraints to growth and competitiveness.

                                   5.    THE PROPOSED PRSC VI

                                  A.    RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

5.1    The proposed operation of US$10 million (SDR 6.4 million equivalent) is the second in a
series of three annual operations (PRSC V to VII) to support the implementation of the
government's GPRSP II. In accordance with the changing government priorities reflected by the
GPRSP II, the new PRSC (V to VII) series marks a shift in the Bank's support from the health
and education sectors towards a greater focus on the economic growth and competitiveness
agenda. Accordingly, the proposed PRSC VI, while supporting the continuity of the good


                                                     - 18 -
governance and human capital enhancement agenda, concentrates on the competitiveness and
infrastructure pillars of the GPRSP II.

5.2      The results of the PRSC V, the first operation in the new programmatic series, have been
satisfactory. The most notable achievements on the area of good governance were: (i) the
reduction of government arrears recognized in 2005 from 40 percent to 10 percent; (ii) the
shortening of the period between budget execution and the audits by the TdC from 3 year to 2 (as
mandated by Constitution) and the broadening of audit coverage to include municipalities and
embassies; (iii) the inclusion of 70 percent of the government budget in the national M&E
system; (iv) the reorganization of eight ministries and the introduction of 15 municipalities into
the Municipal Integrated System. On the competitiveness pillar the most important results were:
(i) the reduction of the marginal corporate tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent; (ii) the increase
in the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system from 9.9 percent to 10.3 percent through
stricter bank supervision; and (iii) the approval of the customs code. On the other hand, the
results for the energy sector were less favorable, with financial indicators for the sector
deteriorating. In addition, a lack of available information regarding the transportation sector has
effectively prevented the monitoring of indicators defined in the PRSC V results framework
matrix.

5.3     Cape Verde's graduation to Middle-Income Country (MIC) status poses several
challenges for national development policy. The first and most relevant to this operation is to
sustain the high economic growth rates that have allowed Cape Verde to reach this status. This
challenge becomes particularly important in view of the current global financial crisis, which has
already negatively affected the country growth rate. In the context of deteriorating external
conditions the performance of Cape Verde's public sector is a key factor for sustaining its
growth rate. Likewise, the improvement of national economic competitiveness represents a
prerequisite to attract the external savings required to finance much-needed investments despite
contracting global credit markets and increasing financing costs. While the country recent
growth performance has been impressive, infrastructure bottlenecks had became a binding
constraint to sustaining or increasing growth rates even before the global financial crisis. The
enhancement of economic infrastructure is a prerequisite for the resumption of the high growth
trend experienced by the country in the pre-global crisis period.

5.4     The overall objective of this operation is to support the policy reforms and institutional
development necessary to foster sustained economic growth. The operation aims to: (i) preserve
macroeconomic stability and improve government service delivery through the implementation
of a reform agenda for public finance management, procurement, government structure and
M&E; (ii) support human capital through the institutional upgrading of the vocational training
system; (iii) improve competitiveness by strengthening and rationalizing financial sector
regulation and ameliorate the business climate; and (iv) ease bottlenecks to growth through
reforms in public utilities management. The PRSC VI is designed to promote the three strategic
objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which includes supporting reforms to: (i)
promote good governance and public sector capacity; (ii) strengthen human capital, and (iii)
improve economic competitiveness and the investment climate.

5.5    The program design reflects first and foremost a high degree of selectivity, with a focus
on a small number of measures that are relevant to the achievement of the program development


                                               - 19 -
objectives, and are technically ready and feasible given the country economic, political and
institutional context. In particular, the operation focuses on a select number of concrete reforms
that: (i) are triggers from the previous PRSC V and represent follow-up actions for the
subsequent PRSC VII; (ii) are backed by Bank analytical work; (iii) have benefitted from the
Bank's and other development partners' technical assistance projects; and/or (iv) are leveraging
reforms supported by the IFI and donor community coordination instrument under the BSG.

5.6     The PRSC VI's program matrix in Annex 3 contains baseline and target values for
performance, which serve as monitoring indicators for the supported prior actions. Expected
results for the governance pillar include: (i) the complete clearance of government arrears; (ii)
the broadening of the Court of Account audits to include municipalities, embassies and institutes;
and (iii) the institutional and technical consolidation of the government M&E system and the
expansion of its coverage. For the competitiveness pillar expected results include: (i) a reduction
in the number of days needed to close a business and a reduction in property registration costs;
(ii) a further increase in the capital adequacy ratio for the banking system; and (iii)
improvements in the financial indicators of ELECTRA and TACV.

5.7     There have been some adjustments in the selection of prior actions for the PRSC VI
relative to the triggers envisaged by the PRSC V. These adjustments were made to take into
account exogenous factors not under the control of the government, or capacity constraints that
have affected the speed of program implementation, and to make the definition of the prior
actions more precise. Specifically, technical difficulties have arisen on the preparation of the
investment code, which delayed its completion. Following the accession of Cape Verde to the
World Trade Organization in 2008, the government has been adopted reforms to align customs,
tax treatment, investments and intellectual property regulatory frameworks to the World Trade
Organization norms. In 2009, the government adopted a new customs code and for 2010 it has
been planned the adoption of the investment code that will be delayed to 2011. The authorities
remain committed to moving forward on this issue and have agreed to upgrade the trigger for the
PRSC VII through the adoption of the code by the Council of Ministers. Conversely, progress in
some areas including government modernization and the investment climate have exceeded their
planned targets, which were expected to be achieved during the PRSC VII, and have now been
included as prior actions for the proposed PRSC VI.

5.8      More substantial modifications to the triggers defined in the PRSC V are being proposed
as triggers for the PRSC VII. In particular, due to the importance of the provision of energy and
air transportation services to national economic growth, significant adjustments have been
proposed to the infrastructure component to reflect the strengthening of support to the
institutional and managerial reform of both sectors. Proposed changes in these areas include
institutional restructuring, reinforcing capacity-building efforts, introducing result-based
managerial tools to improve the operational and commercial performance of ELECTRA and
TACV, and regulatory reforms aimed at improving the quality and reliability of the provision of
services while preserving the financial sustainability of the providers. Finally, in order to
maintain a sharper focus on the growth and competitiveness agenda, the present operation does
not propose to address issues in the policy area of Social Cohesion, as had originally been
envisaged.

5.9    In line with the government's GPRSP II, the proposed operation encompasses four policy
areas:

         (i)     Good Governance
         (ii)    Human Capital Enhancement
         (iii)   Competitiveness
         (iv)    Infrastructure


Good Governance

5.10 The good governance area aims at enhancing the public sector's ability to provide the
services necessary to improve Cape Verdean growth conditions and promote poverty reduction.
This area encompasses five components: macroeconomic stability, public finance management,
procurement, government modernization, and statistics and M&E systems. Table 5.1, below,
describes the objectives, obstacles and government strategies related to each of these
components.

5.11 The first component of the good governance reform agenda is macroeconomic stability,
which supports the continuity of the sound macroeconomic policies that were responsible for the
high growth rates observed in the last decade. Nevertheless, an identified source of fiscal
instability has been the generation of contingent liabilities that resulted from weaknesses in
budget execution at the central government level and from the inefficient operations of public
enterprises. In 2005 the government recognized arrears amounting to CVE 5.352 million (that
were previously unrecorded in government balance sheets). The PRSC V series supported the
implementation of a plan for the complete clearance of these arrears by 2010. The government
has already completed the clearance of its arrears with the private sector in the amount of ECV
4,808 million. The remaining arrears of ECV 0.554 million will be offset against the debts owed
by the municipal chambers to the government, which amount to ECV 0.641 million, this implies
that the government having a positive balance as a net creditor to the municipal chambers, has
completed the clearance of its arrears recognized in 2005.

5.12 Additionally, the PRSC V supported the preparation of a time-bound action plan to clear
the arrears of ELECTRA to its suppliers within four years. Following the PRSC V, the proposed


                                                        - 22 -
PRSC VI supports the completion of the clearance of the government arrears recognized in 2005
and the submission of the action plan for ELECTRA arrears (under the Energy component).
Furthermore, the proposed operation also supports the clearance of arrears to providers accrued
by the air transportation operator TACV (under the Transportation component). By helping the
government to attenuate the risks posed by the generation of arrears, contributes to the macro-
fiscal stability efforts of the government. Reforms on the budget and financial execution cycles
have been discussed with the government to ensure that no new arrears are created. 8

5.13 Furthermore, as a structural solution to the generation of arrears, the government
introduced a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and a Medium Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF) in 2009, which orient the preparation of both the sector ministry and central
government budgets. This enhancement in fiscal programming is designed to introduce greater
discipline into fiscal policy, resource allocation and expenditure execution.9

5.14 The second component in the area of good governance supports the continuity of the
progress in public finance management (PFM). This component promotes the strengthening of
external controls to bring more transparency and accountability to public sector operations.
Under the PEFA assessment of 2008 the external control system, and particularly the auditing
role of the Court of Accounts (Tribunal de Contas, TdC), is one of the main weaknesses of PFM.
The lack of a clear definition of the role and authority of TdC, frequent and long delays in the
audit of government accounts and a limited scope of coverage were identified as the main
limitations of the external control system. To reverse this situation important efforts have been
made to reinforce the efficacy of TdC. The government submitted two bills to Parliament to
modernize the legal framework of TdC. The first bill, the Draft Law of Competencies of the
TdC, establishes the role and responsibilities of TdC. The second bill regulates the staffing of
TdC, allowing new staff recruitment to help to reduce the delay in auditing the accounts of the
central government, as well as embassies, municipal governments and other public entities. The
principles of these new laws were approved by Parliament, but the approval of the detailed
articles is still pending. To improve the timeliness of public account audits PRSC V supported
the submission to Parliament of the Audited State General Accounts for 2006 and the audited
accounts of key municipalities and embassies. The PRSC V defined as a trigger for the PRSC VI
the auditing of central government accounts in subsequent years and the extension of this
auditing to other municipalities, embassies and institutes.

5.15 The third component aims at operationalizing the procurement law approved in 2007
designed to promote efficiency and economy in government purchases. The new Public Procurement
Law became effective in January 2008 following its approval by the National Assembly in July
2007. PRSC V supported the approval and promulgation of related regulations, which are
critical to implement the new legal framework for procurement. The PRSC V defined as a trigger
for the PRSC VI the continuity of actions designed to guarantee the effective operation of this

  A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise was conducted in 2008. Its results indicated
that the government's efforts to improve budget execution were effective in reducing the risk of new arrears;
nonetheless, the control of state enterprises has remained weak.

  In 2009 four ministries prepared their MTEFs for 2010-12. In 2010 eight ministries prepared their MTEFs for
2011-13. In addition, in 2009 and 2010 the government prepared its MTEFs for 2010-2012 and 2011-2013. This
initiative is supported by the BSG.

of its senior management staff, and the availability of the equipment and training necessary to
perform their activities. Progress in this direction has been positive. The key executive staff of
the Regulatory Authority for Public Acquisitions (ARAP) was nominated in September 2009.
The General Acquisition Units (Unidades de Gestão de Aquisições, UGAs) for the line ministries
and the Centralized General Acquisition Unit (Unidade de Gestão de Aquisições Central,
UGAC) have been operating since January 2010. In line with the trigger defined in the PRSC V,
the proposed PRSC VI prior action for this component is the operation of the Public Procurement
Directorate (Direção de Serviço de Contratação Pública, DSCPE). This directorate is
responsible for overseeing the activities of the UGAs and UGAC and its full operation would
complete the set of institutional reforms defined in the new procurement law of 2007.

5.16 The fourth component supports the continuity of the government's aggressive
modernization agenda, which includes the overall reorganization of the government structure, the
restructuring of individual government entities including ministries and institutes, the
decentralization of public resources and administrative responsibilities, and the reform of the
civil service. The authorities have placed state modernization at the top of the agenda in Cape
Verde. A governance reform and restructuring plan has been articulated and is being coordinated
by the State Reform Coordination Unit (UCRE). PRSC V supported the implementation of this
plan to rationalize state structures and develop a more cost-efficient government through the
restructuring of ministries according to the plan. Updated information on the status of the plan
indicates that the government has already exceeded the targets set for 2010. Steady progress has
been made in advancing the decentralization agenda, with an increasing number of
municipalities integrated to the Municipal Information System (SIM), a key tool to strengthen
municipal capacity for collecting taxes and fees and for managing the public finances as well as
land use, human resources and administrative activities.

5.17 Progress continues to be made in the reform of the civil service. UCRE has prepared and
submitted to the Council of Ministers (CoM) a proposal for a new salary and career advancement
structure (Plano de Cargos, Carreiras e Salários, PCCS) which introduces performance criteria
into the remuneration structure of public administration. The CoM required some modifications
to this proposal due to its implications for the overall payroll; UCRE has now completed the
revised proposal and is expected to resubmit it to the CoM. In addition, the CoM adopted a set of
decrees regulating the senior staff career tracks, vacation schedules and workforce mobility rules
in order to increase flexibility in the deployment of civil service staff. The PRSC V defined the
adoption of the PCCS by the CoM as a trigger for the PRSC VI. The proposed PRCS VI would
define as a prior action the adoption of new regulations regarding vacation schedules and
workforce mobility.

5.18 The fifth component supports the improvement of the government's statistical and M&E
systems to improve program design and resource allocation. This component includes the
implementation of the Statistical Agenda for Development, which covers the government's
planned statistical activities for the period 2008-2011 and the development of the national M&E
system so that it becomes capable of effectively monitoring all projects and programs. In 2010
the government took decisive steps to further this component. It adopted a resolution creating a
task force, with the participation of several government entities, to accelerate the establishment
of the national M&E system (Sistema de Seguimento e Avaliação, SiSA), centralized M&E
functions at the National Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Finance, developed a system of


                                              - 24 -
performance indicators for the line ministries with the largest budget allocations and
incorporated them into the integrated system of budget and financial execution, developed a
platform linking the INE database to the M&E system as a step toward full implementation of
the system, and adopted a Vision Scope document defining the principles and objective of the
government's M&E system. The PRSC V defined the completion of this platform and the
tracking of performance indicators for programs in education, health, infrastructure and
agriculture (which together were expected to represent 80 percent of the budget according to the
2010 budget proposal presented in 2009) as a trigger for the PRSC VI10. The PRSC VI ratifies
these as completed prior actions and adds the creation of the task force charged with
implementing the national M&E system and the adoption of the Vision Scope or the
government's M&E system.

Proposed PRSC VI Prior Actions and Triggers for the PRSC VII

5.19 The proposed PRSC VI would support the continuation of the good governance agenda
by focusing on critical actions necessary to foster macro-fiscal stability, strengthen external
control mechanisms, operationalize the pending legal and institutional changes in the
procurement system, modernize administrative structures and human resource management, and
enhance the statistical and M&E systems. Prior actions would include:

         (i)    The clearance of the Government's domestic arrears which were acknowledged in
                2005, except for those with its municipal chambers which will be off-set through
                debts owed by the said municipalities to the central government, as evidenced by
                the Recipient's Minister of Finance letter dated August 19, 2010;

         (ii)   The submission to the National Assembly the audited: (a) state general accounts for
                the year 2007, as evidenced by the Boletim Oficial Nr. 29 dated August 2, 2010;
                and (b) accounts of 13 municipalities, 5 embassies and 3 institutes, evidenced by the
                letter issued by the Recipient's Tribunal de Contas dated October 19, 2010;

         (iii) The full operation of the DSCP, as evidenced by the: (a) the decree-law 45/2009
               which established it and defined its role; (b) the certificate No.72/2010 dated
               August 23, 2010 issued by the Minister of Finance; and (c) the activity plan (the
               Plano de Atividades) for 2010, issued by the DGPCP on January 2010, as evidenced
               by the activity plan and the correlated implementation report dated September 2010;

         (iv) The improvement of the Government's human resources management system
              allowing for the mobile placement of civil servants as evidenced by the Decree
              Nr.54/2009, dated December 7, 2009; and

         (v)    Implementation of Government's M&E system as evidenced by: (a) Resolution
                12/2010 issued by the Conselho de Ministros whereby it certifies that COSiSA has
                been established; (b) the letter dated October 28, 2010 issued by DNP, NoSI and
                INE confirming that the platform linking the M&E system to INE has been

  It is worth to note that the coverage of the programs in the four sectors that was expected to represent 80 percent
of total government's budget fell to 67 percent as a consequence of the increase of the budget designed to expand
the government investment program.


                                                        - 25 -

              the integrated financial management system for the Recipient's budget, containing
              the M&E indicators for its programs in education, health, agriculture and
              infrastructure, has been completed; and (d) the letter dated October 28, 2010 issued
              by DNP attaching the vision scope of the Recipient's M&E system.

5.20 The proposed triggers for the PRSC VII represent a shift in the focus of the PRSCs series
encompassing actions on debt management, the preparation of a second round of reforms in
public financial management through the preparation of a Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) that will be the basis for the issuance of this reform
agenda for the period 2011-14 and the harmonization between the government M&E system of
indicators and the result framework matrix of the Budget Support Group aimed at orient
international aid towards results. Therefore, the triggers for the PRSC VII would be:

       (i)    The issuance of the Action Plan for the enhancement of the government's Debt
              Management System and the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for 2012-15 by
              the Ministry of Finance;

       (ii)   Completion of a PEMFAR exercise and adoption of a reform agenda on Public
              Financial Management based on the PEMFAR;

       (iii) Further strengthening of the government procurement system as demonstrated by:
             the completion of the new procurement website and the introduction of the
             electronic reverse auction in government purchases;

       (iv) The satisfactory implementation of the Statistical Agenda as evidenced by:

              (a) the completion of the technology and institutional capacity components and
              (b) the update of the Statistical Agenda for 2011-2014.

       (v)    The harmonization between the government M&E system and the result framework
              of the Budget Support Group through the signature of a memorandum of
              Understanding between the Cape Verde's government and the BSG that should
              establish the rules for the use of indicators, the access by the BSG members to the
              M&E system and the definition of indicators to be monitored.

Human Capital Enhancement

5.21 The second pillar, human capital enhancement, focuses on vocational training. Despite
the relative quality of human capital in Cape Verde the high rate of both unemployment and
unfilled jobs indicate a mismatch between labor supply and demand requirements. As primary
and secondary education coverage has increased significantly in the past years actions to
strengthen vocational training are expected to contribute to addressing this situation. To
guarantee better compatibility between supply and demand in the labor market the government is
makings simultaneous efforts to expand the supply of training courses and improve their
targeting. The proposed operation supports the upgrading of the institutional framework of the
vocational training system.

5.22 The government has made substantial progress in this component, by expanding the
delivery of technical, vocational and educational training (TVET) courses both in terms of the
number of beneficiaries and the geographical areas covered,11 completing the Institute for
Employment and Professional Training restructuring in May 2010, finalizing the 2010 Annual
Action Plan, and increasing the budgetary allocation and commitments to the Training Support
Fund (TSF) to 600,000 for 2010.

Proposed PRSC VI Prior Actions and Triggers for the PRSC VII:

5.23 As with PRSC V the proposed operation does not have prior actions for this area.
Nevertheless, the PRSC V defined the adoption of operating procedures for the TSF as a
benchmark for this pillar. Efforts are also underway with regard to the restructuring of the TSF,
which was reinstituted and became operational at the end of 2009. However, the TSF is currently
being managed by an ad hoc structure, the Project Approval Commission (Comissão de
Aprovação de Projectos), set up by a joint decree of the Minister of Employment and the
Minister of Finance. This transitory arrangement needs to be replaced by a permanent
institutional framework, including a new status designation and operational manual.

5.24    The proposed trigger for the PRCS VII would be:

The satisfactory implementation of the TVET Action Plan for 2010 as evidenced by: (a) the
adoption of a new decree defining the restructuring of the Employment Centers; (b) the
establishment of an operational Coordinating Unit for the National System of Qualifications; (c)
the adoption of new operating procedures by TSF; and (d) the preparation of an Integrated Policy
Letter for Technical, Educational and Vocational Training.

Competitiveness

5.25 This third area has been the focus of renewed government efforts in recent years to
improve the country's competitive position. Despite Cape Verde's impressive record in
successfully attracting significant quantities of foreign direct and portfolio investment there is
11
  In 2009, a total of 4,500 people benefited from TVET courses all over the country. This represents about 107
percent of the planned 4,200 beneficiaries for that year and a 237 percent increase from 2008.


                                                     - 27 -
still much room for improvement in the business environment, and the government is
undertaking several measures to facilitate private sector development as the engine for growth.
This area encompasses four components: international trade, the tax system, the financial sector
and the business climate. Table 5-3 below describes these objectives, the principal obstacles to
achieving these objectives and the government's strategies to overcome these obstacles.

5.26 Measures under the first component of the competitiveness area, trade, support the
government's efforts to adapt customs, investment and intellectual property codes to WTO
regulations. In 2008, after seven years of negotiations, Cape Verde became the 153rd country to
join the WTO, a membership that carries significant implications. It is expected to not only
generate increased trade flows and associated efficiency gains resulting from trade openness, but
also to attract higher levels of FDI. The government quickly adopted tariff policy changes that
led to the abandonment of all remaining (tariff and non-tariff) measures designed to protect


                                                        - 28 -
domestic industries from international competition and the reduction of tariffs rates for industrial
products to an average rate of 15 percent. For agricultural products the maximum rate will be 19
percent. Cape Verde has also made specific commitments to easing market access in ten service
sectors and a wide range of sub-sectors. Within the government's economic liberalization policy
framework the PRSC V supported the adoption of a new customs code in 2009. To achieve full
implementation of the WTO agreements that would allow the country to attract greater foreign
investment inflows the government initiated the preparation of a new investment code. The
PRSC V defined the preparation of a draft of the new investment code for submission to the
Council of Ministers as a trigger for the PRSC VI. The achievement of this trigger is unlikely
within the time frame of the proposed PRSC VI due to lack of coordination among the
government entities involved in the preparation of the draft as well as the recognition that a more
detailed assessment of the prospective legislative changes is required. Consequently, as approved
at the Project Concept Note Review meeting, this trigger has been dropped as a prior action for
the PRSC VI and the adoption of the investment code by the Council of Ministers has been
reestablished as the PRSC VII trigger under this component. In addition, the government has
committed itself to the adoption of a new intellectual property law, which would be supported by
the PRSC VII, completing the adaptation of Cape Verde's legislation to WTO standards.

5.27 The second component of the competitiveness area supports government policies to
improve tax legislation. Improving the investment climate will require the reduction of the tax
burden and the rationalization of the tax system, in particular the overhaul of the current, highly
complex system of tax incentives. In 2009, as part of its countercyclical fiscal package the
government reduced the rates for corporate and individual income tax from 30 percent to 25 and
from 25 percent to 20 percent, respectively. At the same time, the IMF has been providing
technical assistance for the rationalization of the system of tax incentives. Among the first steps
in this area were the centralization of the process for awarding fiscal incentives by the
Directorate of Internal Revenues at the Ministry of Finance (Direção Geral de Contribuições e
Impostos, DGIC) and the preparation of a fiscal incentives code based on the IMF studies and
recommendations to govern the criteria and procedures for the concession of fiscal incentives.
While the PRSC V did not establish any triggers in this area for the proposed PRSC VI, it did
include a trigger for the PRSC VI in the submission to the Council of Ministers of the draft law
on fiscal incentives. The investment code to be prepared under the trade component above
would need to include norms for fiscal incentives consistent with the WTO rules. The unification
of the fiscal incentives and the investment code is therefore recommended to avoid legislative
conflicts, and consequently, the trigger for the PRSC VII regarding the investment code will
specify the inclusion of fiscal incentive regulations as part of that code.

5.28 The third component aims at ensuring the stability of the financial sector, which is crucial
for the long-term development of the country. In particular, this component supports the
strengthening of the Central Bank's oversight capacity and of the regulatory framework
governing the banking system in order to avoid systemic crises in the financial sector. The
government has taking decisive steps on this matter. The Central Bank has prepared a draft of a
revised banking law in which it will be granted more adequate supervisory powers along with the
institutional means to execute its expanded role; the Central Bank has also submitted legislation
providing for the unification of onshore and offshore banking regulations. In addition, the
Central Bank is already applying the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)



                                               - 29 -
accounting norms to banks and insurance companies, which is regarded as an important step to
reduce vulnerabilities in the financial sector.

5.29 The PRSC V defined the adoption of the draft Revised Banking Law by the Central Bank
Board as a trigger for the PRSC VI, and included the adoption of IFRS accounting norms as a
trigger for the PRSC VII. The government has already exceeded both triggers, as the revised
banking law was not only adopted by the Central Bank Board (which in turn will submit it to the
Council of Ministers) but also unified the legislation for onshore and offshore banking,
eliminating the lighter regulatory regime for the offshore segment, and is already applying the
IFRS norms.

5.30 The fourth component supports government actions to improve the business climate. Due
to the low position of Cape Verde in the Doing Business (DB) rankings (Cape Verde was ranked
147th out of the 183 countries in the DB for 2010), the government set up the Steering
Committee composed by the Operational Center for an Information Society (Núcleo Operacional
para a Sociedade da Informação, NOSI) of representatives from UCRE and Cape Verde Digital
and responsible for government IT development activities, along with Ministry of Commerce
and Energy and private-sector institutions designed to improve Cape Verde's business
environment according to the criteria of the Doing Business survey. This committee has prepared
a focused agenda of actions to address the most crucial weaknesses in the investment climate
identified by the DB survey. Particular attention has been given to streamlining the opening and
closing of firms and property registration processes, areas in which the country ranks very low in
the DB survey. Table 5-4 below describes the main government actions directed at improving
Cape Verde's position on the Doing Business rankings.

5.31 Furthermore, in order to support the recovery of firms suffering financial distress and to
define clear procedures for the closure of firms that are economically and financially unviable,
the Business Development and Innovation Agency (Agência para o Desenvolvimento
Empresarial e Innovação, ADEI) has concluded the preparation of the draft law governing the
firm rehabilitation and bankruptcy system. The Bank team considers the draft law to provide
adequate mechanisms for restructuring the debts and obligations of enterprises that are deemed
to be in financial difficulty but remain economically viable and includes appropriate liquidation
procedures for the liquidation of firms that are judged incapable of recovery. However, the
definitive version of the law would benefit from strengthening the institutional arrangements for
mediation between debtors and creditors and from a public consultation process with the private
sector.

5.32 Finally, the government efforts in this area were directed to reduce the cost of real estate
and commercial property registration. The government approved a decree that substantially
reduces the cost of property registration by replacing ad valorem fees with lower fixed rates that
more accurately reflect the costs of these procedures for the government (which are independent
of the properties' value). As a result, this new legislation has promoted a sharp decline in
property registration costs. In addition, the government has replaced paper procedures with
electronic ones, effectively reducing the time needed to obtain a copy of the cadastral certificate
(certidão matricial) from 7 days to 3, reducing the total time required for property transfer

5.33 The PRSC V defined the drafting of the bankruptcy law as a trigger for the PRSC VI and
included the implementation of necessary actions to lower the cost of property registration as a
trigger for the PRSC VII. The proposed PRSC VI confirms the former as a prior action and
includes the latter as well, as a number of important measures have already been implemented to
reduce the cost of property registration.12

Proposed PRSC VI Prior Actions and Triggers for the PRSC VII

5.34       The proposed PRSC VI prior actions under this pillar include:

           (i) The adoption by the board of directors of the Banco do Cabo Verde of a banking law
               bill on the legal framework for credit institutions and financing corporations and to
               submit it to the Ministry of Finance, as evidenced by the letter dated October 29,
               2010 sent by the Governor of the Banco de Cabo Verde to the Minister of Finance
               confirming therein that the supervisory authority of the Banco de Cabo Verde has
               been strengthened and that the onshore and offshore banking activities' legislation
               has been unified; and

           (ii) Improvements of the business climate, as evidenced by: (a) the letter dated October
                11, 2010 issued by the Conselho de Ministros confirming that the bankruptcy law bill
                has been submitted by ADEI; (b) the letter dated October 11, 2010 issued by the
                Conselho de Ministros confirming that the decree-law providing the simplification of

  It is important to highlight the complementarity between the proposed PRSC VI and the Small and Medium
Enterprises (SME) Capacity Building and Economic Governance Project, which supports reforms to improve the
business environment, including the reduction of barriers to closing a business (e.g. the new draft bankruptcy law,
addressing an area in which country's past performance has been especially poor). Indeed the SME project is
currently providing technical assistance support to the reforms described in this component.

          fixed values for real estate registration duties replacing the ad-valorem duties
          imposed by the Recipient.

5.35 The proposed trigger for the PRSC VII consist in follow-up actions to the prior actions
defined in the PRSC VI, the adoption of the investment code that needed to be adopted under the
PRSC VI to consolidate Cape Verde's accession to the World Trade Organization and the
completion of associated reforms. Therefore, the triggers for the PRSC VII in the
competitiveness area would include:

       (i) The adoption by the Council of Ministers of the Rehabilitation of Firms and
           Bankruptcy Law and submission of the draft Bankruptcy Law for public consultation;

       (ii) The adoption of the investment code by the Council of Ministers, including
            regulations for fiscal incentives consistent with WTO norms; and

       (iii)The adoption of the new intellectual property law by the Council of Ministers.

Infrastructure

5.36 The fourth area supports the government's efforts to ease infrastructure bottlenecks,
which represent the most critical challenge to long-term economic growth. This area has three
components.

5.37 The first component, land management, provides support to the strengthening of the
legislation framework governing land use and the definition of property rights. In addition, this
component comprises the enhancement of island-based and municipal planning, which will be
instrumental in improving land management and addressing population growth, mobility and
urban expansion via adequate development of civil infrastructure. The government embarked on
a major land policy review, which led to an update of key laws and a new strategic planning
system. The government adopted the new Cadastre Law, presented three Regional Plans for
Territorial Organization (Esquemas Regional de Ordenamento do Território, EROTs) that
regulate land use in individual islands and made substantial progress in the preparation of several
important Municipal Development Plans (Planos de Desenvolvimento Municipal, PDMs). The
PRSC V supported the adoption of the Cadastre Law and the appointment of a task force to
implement it. No related triggers were defined for the PRSC VI, but the adoption of a national
strategic plan for land use by the Council of Ministers has been defined as the trigger for the
PRSC VII. The proposed PRSC VI confirms this trigger for the PRSC VII.

5.38 The second infrastructure component is energy. This component supports the
government's actions to address the most important infrastructure barrier to achieving higher and
sustained growth. Due to a lack of investment in the sector the network has not been able
expand to accommodate increasing demand, and the power supply has become unreliable in

many areas.13 At the core of these problems is the critical financial situation of the national
electricity utility ELECTRA. Poor commercial and operational performance resulting in part
from an inappropriate organizational structure, the absence of adequate incentive mechanisms to
improve performance--as well as the country's physical isolation and geography, which
increases the cost of power generation and transmission--have generated an unsustainable debt
level, a significant portion of which is short-term debt.14 Debt to providers (arrears) is also large
and ELECTRA has no room left to increasing its debt to suppliers, as some suppliers are now
demanding payment in advance. The company must now secure financing before undertaking
even modest maintenance or investment projects, and as a result, ELECTRA has all but lost its
financial ability to initiate new investments. Underinvestment in water services, which also fall
under the purview of ELECTRA, has resulted in a water supply of lesser reliability, and in some
cases even chronic shortages, such as in Praia, as well as increased production costs due to
reliance on outdated and poorly maintained equipment.

5.39 In addition to ELECTRA's financial situation, weaknesses in the regulatory framework
are cited as an important factor of the poor performance of the energy sector. Following the
failure of the privatization process in 2006-07, a framework was put in place for setting and
indexing tariffs for the period 2008-2011. The accompanying regulatory mechanisms, however,
have not been sufficient to maintain reliability and increase the supply of energy to consumers,
nor have they succeeded in ensuring the financial sustainability of ELECTRA. On the contrary,
significant ongoing disagreements have been arisen between ELECTRA and the Economic
Regulatory Agency (Agencia de Regulação Econômica, ARE) regarding the application of tariff
readjustments.15

5.40 Recognizing that restoring ELECTRA's financial viability is a necessary condition for
improving the performance of the energy sector and to the country's overall economic growth
and development, the government and ELECTRA have initiated several reform measures.
Because of ELECTRA's lack of financing capacity the government obtained financing for a very
ambitious US$130 million investment program amounting designed to expand the country's
energy supply to be executed between 2010 and 2013.16 The government has also adopted an
institutional restructuring program for ELECTRA aimed at improving its operational capacity
through the decentralization of managerial responsibilities to two regional subsidiaries in order to
allow more local flexibility, especially in the municipality of Praia where most of the
distributional and commercial losses originate. ELECTRA has developed and begun to
implement a plan for restructuring its short-term debt with providers and has launched the
MECOFIS program, which includes a set of measures to reduce distribution losses, recover non-
collected bills and reduce operational inefficiencies.
13
   Nevertheless, overall access to electricity has tripled since 1998.
14
   Low operational efficiency and high commercial losses are largely due to electricity theft and the non-collection
of bills. Distribution losses have increased significantly, especially in the capital, Praia. At the end of 2009
ELECTRA had accumulated 55 million in financial debt, equivalent to 12 months of turnover, and 10 times the
company's equity. ELECTRA's short-term (less than one year maturity) financial debt was at 12.4 millions, which
is already high even without the longer-maturity debt burden. In addition, a 10 million bond will reach maturity in
2012.
15
   The current tariff regulatory scheme is provisional (in fact it is considered a pilot) and it expires at the end of
2010. A new regulatory period must be established in 2011.
16
   As the loans will be registered in the government balance sheet and debt service obligations will be honored by
the government, the investment program can be considered as a transfer from the government to ELECTRA.


                                                       - 34 -
5.41 The Bank has supported the government's efforts to improve the performance of the
energy sector. Bank support consists in a coordinated approach between the IBRD Cape Verde
Recovery and Reform of the Electricity and Water Sectors Project and the proposed PRSC VI.
The former includes three major components: (a) priority investments in electricity and water
included in the government's investment program; (b) improvements in ELECTRA's operational
and commercial performance; and (c) support for the institutional reform of ELECTRA.

5.42 Correspondingly, the PRSC V supported the preparation of a medium-term strategic plan
for the energy sector and defined the institutional restructuring of ELECTRA by the Council of
Ministers and the adoption of measures to improve the ELECTRA's operational and commercial
performances by its Board as a trigger for the PRSC VI. Triggers for the PRSC VII included the
development of a mechanism to settle public consumers' electricity bills and the adoption of a
new tariff system consistent with a restructured ELECTRA.

5.43 The proposed PRSC VI reinforces the trigger set forth in the PRSC V by supporting not
only the institutional restructuring of ELECTRA but also the satisfactory implementation of the
first phase of that restructuring, which includes the creation and registration of (and the provision
of initial capital to) ELECTRA's two subsidiaries. In addition, the proposed operation supports
the adoption by ELECTRA's Board of a comprehensive investment plan, including a financing
and implementation schedule. It also represents ongoing support to a set of measures designed to
improve ELECTRA's operational and commercial performance, including the rationalization of
fuel use, improvements in billing collection, and the reduction of transmission losses, under a
managerial improvement plan adopted by ELECTRA's Board. The proposed operation also
supports the adoption of the short-term debt restructuring plan and the satisfactory
implementation of its first stage, which covers the negotiation of the rescheduling of
ELECTRA's arrears with its suppliers.

5.44 For the PRSC VII the proposed operation considers a number of follow-up actions to the
prior actions defined in the PRSC VI above, including the adoption of an action plan for the
second and most critical phase of the organizational restructuring of ELECTRA, the regular
repayment of the restructured arrears with its suppliers, the establishment of the new regulatory
framework for tariff adjustments that reflects the institutional restructuring of ELECTRA and the
signature of a results-based management contract between ELECTRA and the government
represented by the General Directorate of the Treasury (its controlling agency). This contract will
define the responsibilities of ELECTRA managers and grant them greater autonomy to enhance
accountability. The management contract will set performance indicators for ELECTRA, as well
as define the responsibilities of its controller (the government). The achievement of these targets
will trigger financial transfers from the government. The adoption of this contract will represent
the first time that result-based management tools have been used in Cape Verde to help to align
incentives among public sector entities. If successful, this model could be adopted by other
agencies and organizations in the government and in public or quasi-public administrations.

21.    Similarly, the third component of the infrastructure area, transportation, focuses its
support on strengthening the air transportation sector, and in particular the state air transport
company, Cape Verde Airlines (Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde, TACV). Due to the
geographical characteristics and the inefficient maritime transportation network between islands,



                                               - 35 -
air transportation has become the dominant, and sometimes sole, transport mode for the
development of the tourism sector, the country's principal driver of economic growth.

5.45 TACV is however in a difficult financial situation. Poor commercial and operational
performance, against a background of adverse shocks suffered by the worldwide air
transportation industry, have undermined the financial capacity of TACV, constraining basic
investments in operational functions that have resulted in increasing costs, frequent delays,
irregular network functioning, and poor service, prompting a predictable reduction in demand.
Underinvestment in the revenue collection system resulted in a lower recovery of receipts than
those collected by other air transportation firms. The lack of investment in its accounting system
has prevented TACV from processing its balances on a timely manner. Indeed, TACV does not
currently have any audited annual balances since 2008. Therefore, assessments of its actual
financial situation are inaccurate, and the calculation of unitary costs and revenues per passenger
is unfeasible. The lack of such basic information also prevents the attraction of a strategic
partner.

5.46 As with ELECTRA, high short-term debt with providers and banks (credit lines) has
limited TAVC's access to new credit. TACV's high indebtedness also constitutes a threat to
overall fiscal sustainability, as TACV is a potential source of contingent liabilities. In particular,
accumulated arrears with providers and with the State Airports Administration (Administradora
de Aeroportos, ASA) represent not only a source of fiscal risks for the government but also an
implicit subsidy that puts pressure on the government's cash flow.

5.47 Naturally, the financing of investments to expand its network has been infeasible. Given
the general crisis in the air transportation companies of the West Africa Region that interrupted
the services of its most important regional competitors, the lack of network expansion is now
preventing TACV from becoming the regional leader in the air transportation industry.

5.48 Given its importance to the development of the tourism sector, improving the financial
situation of TACV represents a key factor for the success of the country's development strategy,
which is largely based on the expansion of tourism and related industries. In this regard, TACV
and the government have taken initial measures to restore the financial sustainability of TACV.

5.49 TACV is regularizing its short-term debt with providers. In particular, TACV and ASA
agreed in 2009 to the rescheduling of arrears owed by the former. In 2010, TACV began
regularly servicing its debt according to the agreed schedule. Furthermore, improved cash flow
balances in 2010 have allowed TACV to clear its debt with providers and its short-term credit
lines with domestic banks.

5.50 To improve its commercial performance TACV has acquired a new system of receipt
collection to improve its billing performance. TACV will also adopt an integrated system of
accounting that should allow the preparation of timely financial reports and avoid commercial
losses due to the no-collection of receipts from other companies. Finally, TACV is preparing a
business plan that includes debt refinancing, new capital investments and the expansion of its
network, which is expected to be adopted by its Board and endorsed by the government in 2011.




                                                - 36 -
5.51 The PRSC V defined triggers for the PRSC VI and VII to support improvements in the
financial viability of TACV through: (i) the reduction of direct operating costs (excluding fuel)
per passenger seat-kilometer; and (ii) the increase of unit revenues (as measured by passenger
seat-kilometer). As agreed upon, a baseline for the indicators needs to be defined during the
preparation of the proposed PRSC VI. However, the lack of updated account information
prevents the definition of baseline figures for those indicators.

5.52 Given the lack of available data the task team would modify the PRSC VI prior actions
and triggers for the PRSC VII. In particular, the recent measures adopted by TACV, including
the clearance of arrears with providers, cost rationalization measures and the purchase of a new
revenue-collection system, and the submission by the TACV Board of audited balances for 2007,
and the balances of 2008 and 2009 (not yet audited) to the General Directorate of the Treasury
(its controlling agency), should be considered prior actions. For the PRSC VII, the proposed
triggers would be follow-up actions, including the adoption by the TACV board of a business
plan for 2011-15 and the signature of a results-based management contract between TACV and
its controller. This contract would have similar characteristics to that of ELECTRA.

Proposed PRSC VI Prior Actions and Triggers for the PRSC VII

5.53    The proposed PRSC VI prior actions for the infrastructure area would be:

       (i)    Adoption of measures to improve the performance of ELECTRA as evidenced by:
              (a) the adoption by ELECTRA's Board of Directors of a comprehensive
              investment plan, including a financing and implementation schedule as evidenced
              by item 2 of the Act Nr 19/2010 of ELECTRA's Board of Directors dated on
              October 26, 2010e; (b) the Resolution 19/2010 dated April 16, 2010 issued by the

              of the two new subsidiaries; (c) the adoption by ELECTRA's board of directors of a
              set of measures to improve commercial and operational performance (billing, use of

              the debt restructuring plan issued by ELECTRA's Board of Directors on April 19,
              2010 reflecting: (i) a time-bound action plan to restructure ELECTRA's arrears
              with its providers; and (ii) ELECTRA's initial steps with its creditors inviting them
              to negotiate the rescheduling of the said arrears as evidenced by the letters from
              ENACOL to the Minister of Tourism, Industry and Energy dated August 4, 2010
              and to General Director for Treasury at the Ministry of Finance.

       (ii)   Adoption by TACV of measures to improve its operational, financial and
              commercial performance, as evidenced by: (a) the submission of TACV's annual
              balances for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (including audited balances for 2007); (b) the
              letter dated October 12, 2010 issued by TACV's Board of Directors confirming that
              arrears with its domestic and internal suppliers have been cleared; (c) the debt
              rescheduling agreement signed between ASA and TACV providing that arrears

                          6.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                               A.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

6.1    The proposed operation is expected to have significant positive direct impacts on Cape
Verde's poverty incidence and social conditions. From a fiscal perspective, the proposed budget
support operation would obviate the need for spending cuts that could place the provision of
basic social services at risk, which in turn would disproportionately affect the poor who rely on
these essential services. The indirect poverty and social impact of the reforms supported by the
operation are also anticipated be highly positive. The measures supported by the proposed PRSC
VI are expected to have a positive indirect impact on poverty reduction, mainly through
increased overall growth and rising employment, though these growth effects may be strongly
tempered by the worsening Euro Zone sovereign crisis.

6.2     Furthermore, to the extent that the initiatives and policy reforms supported by the
proposed operation will increase the fiscal space for increasing investments, as well as enhancing
efficiency in the use of public resources, the operation should have a positive indirect impact on
the government's ability to increase the quality and accessibility of social and infrastructure
services. Incidence analysis shows that low-income groups have lower rates of access to
educational, health, energy, water and sanitation services, yet low-income groups are the primary
users of these services. Improvements in the coverage and quality of public services would
therefore disproportionately benefit the poor.

6.3    Specific positive impacts of the PRSC VI on poverty include the following:

       (i)    Financing the government's countercyclical fiscal stance, which would mitigate the
              damaging effects of the global financial crisis on employment and labor income
              among the groups that are most vulnerable to unemployment shocks (e.g. the
              younger and less educated segments of the population);
       (ii)   Strengthening the reform process for public utilities and service providers
              (especially ELECTRA), further reinforcing the government's fiscal stance and
              preventing disruptions in utility provision while generating efficiency gains that
              could translate into lower tariffs and/or increased coverage;
       (iii) Supporting workforce training to improve labor productivity and better match the
             skills of the workforce to employer demand, which would increase productivity,
             raise labor income and reduce unemployment; and
       (iv) Supporting the enhancement of the government's statistical and M&E capacities,
            allowing state agencies to improve the design and efficacy public programs;
6.4     Finally, the PRSC series will support new efforts to improve the efficiency of the
government in its fight to reduce poverty through the adoption of new instruments to better target
public expenditures and enhance their poverty-reduction impact.

                                B.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.5     The specific actions supported under the proposed PRSC VI are not likely to have
significant positive or negative effects on the country's environment, forests, fisheries or other


                                                  - 43 -
natural resources. The first policy area of this operation, governance, was already covered in
Cape Verde PRSC IV and V; IDA determined that PRSC-supported actions in this area were not
expected to have a meaningful effect on Cape Verde's environment due to their primarily
administrative nature (public finance management, civil service reform and decentralization,
monitoring and evaluation systems, improved health care and social protection).

6.6     Additionally, the reforms related to competitiveness and growth--the second policy area
supported by this operation--are not expected to have a negative effect on the environment.
Nonetheless, there are potential indirect effects of reforms in the energy sector. On the positive
side, better management of ELECTRA may improve the quality and quantity of safe drinking
water to the consumers. Reduction in technical, commercial losses and energy theft may improve
the efficiency in the use of electricity use and thus have a positive effect on the environment. In
addition, ELECTRA's investment plan contains several projects for the generation energy
through renewable sources. On the other side, improvements in ELECTRA performance could
result in the recovery of its investment capacity which in turn could have environmental impacts.
At this respect, it is worth to mention that Cape Verde has a strict legislation on environmental
impact assessment that is being enforced since the publication of the environmental law in 2006.

6.7     The environmental aspects of Cape Verde's economic development and policy reform
agenda have been included in the consolidated matrix of the Budget Support Group. The BSG's
dialogue on environmental issues has been summarized in a sector-specific environmental policy
matrix agreed upon with the government. This matrix identifies critical prior actions and a set of
results indicators, which are currently being monitored.

6.8    Climatic vulnerability, erratic rainfall, limited fresh water supplies, and reliance on
tourism as an engine of development make the sustainable use of resources and the protection of
the environment critical to poverty reduction. The government, with support from Netherlands
Cooperation and UNDP, developed a National Environmental Plan (Programa de Ação Nacional
para o Ambiente, PANA, 2004-14) that identified policies, investments and results indicators to
promote and monitor the rational use of natural resources and the environmentally sustainable
management of economic activities. Spanish Cooperation and Austrian Cooperation are currently
providing budget support with a focus on dialogue regarding environmental issues.

6.9     The government made especially strong progresses in 2010 on improving the regulatory
and supervisory framework for both private and public investments. The approval of the
Strategic Tourism Plan (PEDTCV 2010-2013) in December 2009 provides guidelines for the
assessment of investments in the tourism sector. The plan regards the environment as an asset,
promotes eco-tourism and stresses the importance of minimizing the environmental impacts of
the tourism industry. A tourism observation agency is being developed, and its duties are
expected to include monitoring indicators of the environmental sustainability of tourism
activities and related infrastructure. The creation of an agency responsible for audits and
inspections, the Directorate for Judicial Services Affairs, Inspection and Evaluation of
Environmental Impacts, will further improve the government's capacity to oversee the
environmental impacts of economic activities. These initiatives provide an appropriate balance
between the facilitation of business development under the investment climate component and
effective environmental regulation and oversight of private and public investments.

                   C.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

6.10 The PRSC VI is overseen by the GPRSP-II Steering Committee, which is chaired by the
Minister of Finance. Under the umbrella of the Ministry of Finance all ministries involved in
supporting GPRSP-II objectives participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of the
donors' joint Budget Support Matrix. The PRSC VI matrix is a subset of the Budget Support
Matrix, and these ministries are therefore also involved in the design, implementation and
monitoring of PRSC VI. The General Directorate for Planning, Budgeting and Management
(Direcção Geral de Planejamento, Orçamento e Gestão, DGPOG) at the Ministry of Finance
will be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed operation and for reporting on
its progress. The Bank will vet the prior conditions for effectiveness and disbursement. The
timing of this disbursement will depend upon the government's ability to provide the Bank with
satisfactory evidence that the necessary conditions have been met. It will be the responsibility of
the DGPOG to present this information in a timely manner and in a format satisfactory to the
Bank.

6.11 Since the preparation of the first PRSC series the World Bank team has worked in close
collaboration with the government and its budget support partners to ensure the adequate
monitoring and evaluation of the program as well as a high level of accountability for the success
of each PRSC. The government and the Budget Support Group have agreed on a matrix of
indicators that is reviewed biannually to assess progress in the different policy areas.

6.12 This operation furthers the efforts of the previous PRSCs to improve the government's
statistical capacity and the effectiveness of its M&E systems. These elements are a high priority
in the proposed operation and have been an important issue in policy dialogue with the
government. Moreover, the remaining operations in the series will provide further support to
efforts designed to strengthen national statistics and M&E capacity.

                                   D.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.13 Fiduciary reforms and the strengthening of the government's fiscal systems constitute a
policy area of this operation. The 2003 CFAA and the 2006 PER have identified and addressed
the main challenges facing Cape Verde's public expenditure management and financial
accountability systems. An action plan focusing on increasing the comprehensiveness and
transparency of the budget and enhancing financial accountability has been implemented with
the support of the Netherlands, the European Union and the World Bank. The joint budget
support missions, along with PRSC-series supervision and preparation, have helped the
government to maintain its focus on the issue of public finance management, and substantial
improvements have been observed. Cape Verde's progress in PFM has been identified in the
2008 PEFA exercise and the latest joint budget support mission. The latter found that Cape
Verde has made steady progress in improving the quality of its PFM, owing to the
implementation of a comprehensive reform program that addressed its main weaknesses, as
reflected in the PEFA giving A and B scores to 18 out of 28 indicators.

6.14 The IMF's most recent assessment of the Central Bank (BCV) was carried out in 2008.
The assessment found that while BCV has taken a number of steps to strengthen its safeguard
framework since the previous assessment (in 2002) there are still significant outstanding


                                              - 45 -
vulnerabilities, especially in the audit and control areas. Measures undertaken to strengthen the
safeguard framework since the previous assessment included: (i) the development of an action
plan to implement IFRS for the 2008 fiscal year; (ii) the development of reserves-management
procedures; (iii) the introduction of an internal audit function; and (iv) the rotation of external
auditors. Notwithstanding these advancements, safeguard challenges remain. These include the
need to: (i) formally define the mandate of the Audit Committee; (ii) strengthen the newly
established internal audit function;17 and (iii) further enhance financial statement transparency.18
The Central Bank has agreed to adopt remedial actions to address these issues.

                                   E.    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.15 The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche grant of SDR 6.4 million
(US$10 million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of a
withdrawal application. The credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy lending. Once the credit becomes effective, the Government of Cape Verde
(Recipient) will submit a withdrawal application to IDA requesting that the proceeds of the credit
be deposited in the BCV into a dedicated account that forms part of the country's official foreign
exchange reserves. The Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the credit into said
account an equivalent amount in Cape Verdean Escudos (ECV) is credited in the Recipient's
budget management system in a manner acceptable to IDA and sufficient to finance management
expenditures. The Recipient will report to the World Bank the amounts deposited in the foreign
currency dedicated account and credited to the budget management system. Disbursement
would not be linked to specific purchases. If the proceeds of the credit are used for the ineligible
purposes, as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA promptly upon notice from IDA.
Amounts refunded to the Bank upon request shall be cancelled.

6.16 Through the Ministry of Finance, the Recipient will: (i) report, within one week from the
date of receipt, the exact sum received into the dedicated account; (ii) ensure that all withdrawals
from the dedicated account are for budgeted public expenditures, excepting military expenditures
or other items on IDA's proscribed list; and (iii) provide IDA with evidence that the Cape
Verdean currency (ECV) equivalent of the Credit proceeds were credited to the Consolidated
Fund account and that disbursements from that account were for budgeted public expenditures.
The Court of Accounts (Tribunal de Contas) is expected to provide IDA with its annual report to
Parliament on the public accounts by the end of the year following the execution of the budget
(i.e. December 31 N+1).
                                    F.    RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
6.17    The following risks and risk mitigation strategies have been identified:


17
   The internal audit function requires independence, qualified personnel, the implementation of a risk-based audit
methodology, and the introduction of tracking procedures for addressing external and internal audit
recommendations.
18
   Transparency should be enhanced by conducting external audits in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing, completing the implementation of IFRS, and publishing financial statements and notes in accordance with
IFRS for FY2008.

(a) Macroeconomic risks from vulnerability to external shocks: Budget deficit and
    external deficit projections have increased as a result of the deterioration in fiscal
    revenues and external receipts due to the global financial crisis and the more recent
    Euro Zone sovereign crisis, coupled with the increased spending and tax cuts initiated
    as part of the government's countercyclical fiscal impulse. The projected fiscal deficit
    for 2010 is above historical levels, and deficits are expected to remain high through
    2012. While debt ratios to exports have increased, debt service payments have
    remained low thanks to long debt maturities and low concessional interest rates.
    Borrowing must decrease after 2011 to maintain a low risk of debt distress, and the
    government has stated its commitment to keeping all key debt indicators below the
    moderate-risk threshold. Moreover, a record of sound financial management has left
    the country relatively well prepared to deal with the crisis, and its institutional capacity
    is well above that of most nations in the region. The efficiency reforms in public
    administration and public investment management supported by the PRSC will assist
    the government's efforts to control fiscal deficits and maintain macroeconomic
    stability; and the eventual recovery of the Euro Zone economies will return Cape Verde
    to a higher long-term growth path.
(b) Fiscal risks associated with the accumulation of contingent liabilities: While Cape
    Verde's fiscal position remains sustainable, the accumulation of contingent liabilities in
    public companies is an important concern. The Public Water and Electricity Company,
    ELECTRA, is the major source of fiscal risks, and the administrative efficiency and
    managerial reform of the state energy utility is a principal objective of PRSC VI. The
    insolvency of ELECTRA could threaten overall fiscal sustainability if it continues to
    experience substantial operating losses, if anticipated increases in oil prices are
    absorbed by the utility rather than allowed to pass through to tariff rates, and if
    municipalities continue accumulating payment arrears. The company is in a critical
    financial situation due to lack of investment both in new capacity and maintenance, as
    well as past tariff deficits and difficulties with billing collection. The PRSC series
    remains the main instrument in support of the dialogue on fiscal risk between the
    government and ELECTRA. Regarding the PRSC VI, this risk is mitigated by: (i) the
    inclusion in the proposed operation of the finalization of a time-bound action plan to
    reduce ELECTRA's arrears; (ii) the improvement of its commercial and operational
    performance; (iii) the definition of a new regulatory period and tariff-adjustment
    formula that would promote the financial solvency of ELECTRA; and (iv) the related
    energy-sector project, which will focus on the sector's overall financial sustainability.
    Similar actions included in the policy matrix for TACV would reduce the risks of
    contingent liabilities to the government Treasury.
(c) Fiscal Risks associated with the political transition: The fiscal situation requires
    continued careful management, and mitigating the risk of fiscal slippage associated
    with elections early in 2011 will require considerable discipline. The current
    government has, however, demonstrated a strong, long-standing commitment to fiscal
    discipline. The countercyclical fiscal impulse adopted in 2009 and 2010 that resulted in
    the deterioration of fiscal balances was made possible by a significant creation of fiscal
    space and other buffers in previous years. Furthermore, the fiscal impulse has been
    based on the acceleration of the government investment program and not increases in



                                          - 47 -
   hard-to-reverse recurrent spending. The deterioration of fiscal balances is therefore
   expected to be temporary.
(d) The risk of the reform program slowing due to the political transition: While the
    reforms supported by the PRSC enjoy significant support across the political spectrum
    the electoral period may generate political pressure to slow the reform program. To
    mitigate this risk the PRSC VI supports reforms that depend primarily on the
    Executive.
(e) Risks regarding implementation capacity: Budget support is an instrument that
    requires significant capacity to design and implement reforms and to monitor their
    impacts. To address this risk in the short term the government's budget support
    partners have made available a combination of capacity building and technical support.
    To mitigate this risk over the medium term the Bank is currently planning an operation
    that will provide similar support in coordination with other donors.

                   Cape Verde--Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                               November 4, 2010

This letter provides a preliminary assessment of Cape Verde's macroeconomic conditions and
outlook, based on information available through mid-October 2010. An IMF team visited Cape
Verde during September 15­28, 2010 for the Article IV Consultation and discussions on a 15­
month Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which staff expects to take to the IMF Board in
November 2010.19 Economic activity in Cape Verde shows clear signs of a rebound, inflation
remains low, and monetary policy focuses on ensuring gradual reserve accumulation to support
the peg.

PSI and structural reforms

Performance under the 2006­10 PSI was strong and supported the government's reform
agenda. International reserves grew to over four months of imports and net domestic debt
declined to less than 20 percent of GDP in the period. A prudent fiscal stance during the first
years of the program allowed effective counter-cyclical policies in 2008­09 when the global
crisis hit. The PSI supported the government's reform priorities in several areas, including: (i)
reducing public debt, (ii) building international reserves, (iii) improving tax policies and public
financial management, and (iv) strengthening regulatory capacity in the financial sector.20

Fund staff reached agreement ad referendum with the authorities on policies to support a
successor 15-month PSI. The authorities remain firmly committed to macroeconomic stability
and view the program as a useful macroeconomic anchor, which would focus on keeping net
domestic debt low and building international reserves. Given these objectives, the quantitative
targets include ceilings on net domestic borrowing of the central government, net domestic assets
of the BCV, and accumulation of non-concessional external debt; and a floor on net international
reserves of the BCV. Targets to be monitored on a continuous basis include ceilings on
accumulation of domestic and external arrears, non-accumulation of short-term non-concessional
external debt and a floor on the regulatory capital of commercial banks. Structural reforms will
focus on improving debt management capability; strengthening monetary operations; and
safeguarding financial sector stability.

Recent economic developments and short-term outlook

The economy is showing clear signs of recovery, with growth picking up in all sectors. On
the heels of the global slowdown, real GDP growth slowed to 3.6 percent in 2009 due to a fall in

  The eighth and final review under the PSI was concluded on a lapse-of-time basis (decision effective
July 8, 2010).

   While Cape Verde is classified as a middle-income country by some creditors, it is still classified as PRGT
eligible by the Fund.

tourism receipts and FDI. However, growth is projected to recover to 5.4 percent in 2010 and
gather momentum over the medium term as global conditions improve. Inflation remains low
given the peg to the euro.

The balance of payments is improving and foreign reserves remain at a comfortable level.
International trade and financial inflows are improving in the first half of 2010. Service exports
grew modestly, but hotel operators are reporting high advanced booking rates through the high
season in the remainder of the year, and merchandise exports rose substantially. In the financial
account, FDI has stabilized and a strong pace of official disbursements should contribute to a
positive overall balance of payments in 2010.

Fiscal policy

Large fiscal and current account deficits over 2009-12 reflect a temporary acceleration of
the public investment program as counter-cyclical stimulus. The authorities have taken
advantage of a transitional window for concessional external financing following graduation
to middle-income status and the need for countercyclical stimulus to accelerate their public
investment program (PIP). The PIP aims to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks, including those
that hinder development of the tourism sector, and to support progress on social policies. This
strategy contributes to a temporary deterioration of fiscal balances and rise in external debt, but
debt service ratios remain very low, minimizing liquidity and solvency risks. Fund staff considers
that the public investment program underway should be completed, but foreign-financed spending
would need to be scaled back without resorting to new foreign borrowing, to rebuild fiscal buffers
against negative shocks.

Fiscal policy contributes to protecting the peg by keeping net domestic debt low. The
authorities and Fund staff agree that net domestic debt should be kept below 20 percent of GDP,
including by tightly controlling recurrent spending, improving tax administration, and
rationalizing tax exemptions. Faced with weak revenue in 2010, the government stepped up the
collection of tax arrears and has been holding current expenditure below budget to minimize the
need for domestic borrowing. They also took bold measures to curb current spending--despite
pressures during an election year--including by freezing new hiring in the public sector. In the
remaining months of the year, domestic revenues are expected to accelerate slightly and additional
budget support from the European Union should contribute to higher grants.

Monetary policy and the exchange rate

The monetary policy stance is appropriately cautious, but the framework could be
improved in the medium term. The BCV has set a high minimum reserve requirement and a
policy rate well above Euribor. The authorities view this restrictive monetary stance as necessary
to encourage inflows of emigrant deposits and to restrain private sector credit that would fuel
imports. They are cautious about lowering the policy rate and reserve requirements until foreign
reserve accumulation is definite and the global environment rebounds. Fund staff supports the
BCV's cautious monetary stance given the benefit of further building foreign reserve buffers.

However, a bias toward restrictive monetary policy introduces the risks of inviting speculative
inflows and discouraging credit to the private sector. Over the medium term, restoring fiscal and
reserve buffers will help provide space to counteract shocks and reduce the need for an active
monetary policy.

The peg to the euro continues to serve Cape Verde well. This arrangement provides a stable
anchor for economic stability, while allowing some flexibility in the escudo's exchange rate vis-à-
vis currency cross rates. Fund staff analysis shows that the escudo's real effective value against
other currencies is broadly in line with its fundamentals.
