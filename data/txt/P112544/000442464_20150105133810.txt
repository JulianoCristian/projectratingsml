 Guatemala:
 Protecting and Expanding Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups




 SYNOPSIS
  Since ending its 36-year-long civil war in 1996, Guatemala has made significant progress toward
  macroeconomic and democratic stability. Assistance from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
  Development (IBRD) has focused on inclusive growth and reduction of historically high levels of exclusion
  by, for instance, reducing poverty to 51percent from 56 percent over 2000-06 and raising net primary
  school enrollment to 95 percent from 85 percent through 2000-08.
