follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: as a Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL), the CAT DDO entails a combination of\n            financial transfer to the country\u0092s budget to provide\n            liquidity after an emergency, with an equally important\n            component of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) policy advice\n            and dialogue. Therefore, adequate resources and technical\n            assistance to support achievement of project outcomes should\n            be provided accordingly. DPL with CAT DDO operations can be\n            an opportunity to introduce broader concepts of Disaster\n            Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) for countries developing\n            comprehensive strategies. Matching the CAT DDO with parallel\n            technical assistance can enhance the DRM policy dialogue.\n            The process of designing a CAT DDO can provide a platform to\n            bring other sectors and institutions. DPLs with CAT DDO\n            require coordination with development partners in order to\n            achieve more sustained and broader impacts. Given the\n            multidisciplinary nature of DRM, the implementation of a DPL\n            with CAT DDO requires partnerships with other sectors within\n            the World Bank Group. It is necessary to learn how to manage\n            early disbursements of CAT DDOs. DPLs with CAT DDO have a\n            revolving and renewal features that need to be analyzed by\n            the Bank and explained to governments during project\n            preparation. An operational manual can be helpful to address\n            emergencies and should be considered for future DPLs with\n            CAT DDO. Reporting mechanisms should be more specific in the\n            loan agreements, and agreed up front with the government\n            including the designation of the responsible party."}, "docdt": "2013-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
