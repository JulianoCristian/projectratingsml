Risksand Risk Mitigation       The proposed loan is considered to be of moderate risk. Although
                               prior actions needed for this loan have been achieved, progress of the
                               overall program is subject to risks fiom inter-institutional arrangements
                               that needto continue to exist for multisector coordination, such as those
                               associated with the decentralization of responsibilities for disaster risk
                               management actions.
                               On the macroeconomic front, the main risks derive from the global
                               crisis and more specifically from a deep and prolonged global
                               deceleration. The current global situation is expected to negatively
                                impact Guatemala as credit to the private sector becomes tighter,
                               remittances and foreign direct investment growth decelerate, and the
                               US demand for Guatemalan products declines. This risk is somewhat
                               mitigated by recent steps taken by the authorities to enhance crisis
                               preparedness including preparation and publication on January 15th of
                               the Emergency and Economic Recovery National Program which tries
                               to coordinate and adjust the country's policies to better manage the
                               current situation.

1.     Sustainable development in Guatemala is hampered by the country's exposure to
adversenaturalevents. Guatemalais considereda hotspot for natural disasters. It is rankedas one
of the top five high-risk countries in the world in terms of the vulnerability of its gross domestic
product (GDP) to three or more hazards: 83.3 percent of Guatemala'sGDP is locatedin areas at
risk'. Between 1902 and 2005, Guatemala experienced 62 natural disaster events, which affected
approximately 6 million peoples2Since 1969 Guatemala has built significant disaster response
capacity and institutions. However, building on lessons learned from this period and from
innovations in disaster risk management from other countries, Guatemala has since 2005 taken the
significant step to move from a reactive to a proactive approachto address disaster risk by investing
in risk mitigation measures and by improving risk evaluation in planning and reconstruction
activities. The current administration has elevated disaster risk management to one of its main
priorities.

2.     Guatemala has requestedthe proposedoperationto enhancethe Government's capacity
to implementits disaster risk management program.The operation would support the country's
recent move toward pro-active disaster risk management rather than ex-post response. The
preparation of the operation reflects four decades of disaster management experience inGuatemala,
lessons learned from Guatemala's active participation in regional disaster risk management
initiatives, and in particular the experience acquired in the response to and rehabilitation after
Hurricane Stan in2005.

3.     Guatemala's National Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction (Programa
Nacional de Prevencidn y Mitigacidn ante Desastres, PNPMD) has beenacceptedby the Bank.
The PNPMD and the prior actions leading to the development of this Program were reviewed, and
the Bank agreed that the Program contains a good foundation to start addressing the country's
exposureto disaster risk ina sustainablemanner.

4.    Development Objective: The overall development objective of this DPL with a CAT DDO is
to enhance the Government's capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for
adverse natural events. This objective will be achieved by supporting policy and institutional
reform inthe following aspects of disaster risk management:


     0   Improvingrisk identification and monitoring;
         Increasing disaster risk reduction investments;
     0   Strengthening institutions andplanning capacity for risk management; and
         Developing risk financing strategies.

                                         11.Country Context


5.    Guatemala, a lower middle-income country with a multiethnic population of about 13
millionpeople, and a per-capita GNI of US%2,610,is the largest economyin Central America.
Although a source of cultural strength and richhistorical heritage, Guatemala's ethnic diversity has
been accompanied by conflict and exclusion since colonial times. In the latter half of the 20th
century, long-standing socio-political and economic tensions sparked a debilitating 36-year civil
war, which ended in 1996 after protracted negotiations led to the signing of a set of Peace Accords
betweenthe Government andguerrilla leaders.


RecentMacroeconomicDevelopmentsand Medium-Term Outlook

6.    Growth has been strong in recent years, but slowed recently with the global economic
crisis. The Guatemalaneconomy grew by 5.2 and 6.3 percent in2006 and 2007, respectively, while
in 2008 GDP is estimated to have slowed to 4 percent. Although growth slowed in 2008 due to
high oil and commodity prices in the first half of the year and the impact of the global financial
crisis inthe second half of the year, it was still relatively high compared to the average of only 3.2
percent during 2003-04.

7.    Exogenous factors-mainly       the rise in global food and fuel prices-exerted substantial
inflationary pressures on the Guatemalan economy in the first half of 2008. After having
peaked at 9.2 percent in 2004, inflation moderated considerably in 2005 and 2006, when it fell to
5.8 percent. However, inflationary pressures reemerged in 2007 and 2008, as the consumer price
index based inflation reached 14.2 percent and the food price index based inflation reached 19.4
percent in July. The second half of 2008, however, witnessed a moderation in inflation as food and
oil prices abated and monetary policy tightening to stem inflationary pressures took effect.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the 2008 end-year inflationrate was 9.4 percent.

8.    To date, the impact of the global financial crisis has been moderate, but growth
prospects are slowing. The Guatemalan financial sector was not directly exposed to the "toxic"
financial derivatives that have impacted many countries and, hence, has not felt the first-round
direct effects of the global financial crisis. Yet, the credit tightening in global financial markets is
affecting the country (domestic credit to the private sector has beenat 2007 levels inreal terms over
the second half of 2008) as international credit lines are becoming more expensive and difficult to
renew, and as banks are tightening lending standards and building up liquidity buffers. On the real
front, the downturn in the United States has negatively affected remittances flows, which
experienceda decline of 8.5 percent inNovember 2008 comparedto levels a year earlier.

9.    Fiscal policy has remained prudent in recent years. Guatemala's prudent fiscal
conservatism has continued to serve the country well, especially during the current global
slowdown. Preliminary estimates indicate that the fiscal deficit of the central government was 1.6
percent of GDP in 2008. The mirror image of the country's fiscal policy is the low level of public
debt, which gives the authorities significant flexibility to address the new challenges created by the
current external environment.




                                                                                                      2

10. Lookingforward, a challenge for the country remains the approval and implementation
of the government's fiscal reform proposal. Despite the significant improvements in tax
administration, includingthe passage of an Anti-Tax Evasion Law in2006, political opposition and
unfavorable constitutional court rulings on taxes have kept tax collections as a share of GDP
relatively flat and below the Peace Accords target (13.2 percent of GDP). Inthis regard, the Colom
administration has beenconsulting with a wide array of stakeholders since its first months inpower
in order to buildconsensus around a fiscal reform proposal. Originally intendedas a single stage
reform, the proposal was then divided into two phases to facilitate consensus and congressional
approval. Actions considered inthe first phase have included administrative measures to modernize
the indirect tax system and customs, and approval by Congress of the Solidarity Tax (ISO) to
replace the temporary tax on income (IETAAP) which expired in2008. Yet, lack of progress with
other planned measures such as a new tax on vehicles, as well as lower growth, are likely to lead to
a decline in tax collections as a share of GDP in 2008 and 2009. Against this background, the
government is continuing its efforts and is now starting consultations on the second phase of the
reform program with the goal of improvingthe tax system's efficiency and fairness.

11. On the external front, Guatemala's current account deficit has remained stable over the
past few years-at    about 5 percent of GDP in 2007-and        was financed to a large extent by
high remittance inflows (11.7 percent of GDP in 2008). Exports and imports increased
considerably following the implementation of CAFTA-DR in 2006. Indeed, exports grew by 20.8
percent and 14.3 percent in2007 and 2008 respectively driven mainly by traditional exports (which
experienceda growth rate of more than 25 percent in2007). Similarly, imports rose by 16.7 percent
and 11.6 percent in 2007 and 2008, driven largely by the rising cost of fuel inthe later year. As a
result of these developments the trade deficit increased slightly between 2005-the      year before
CAFTA-DR became effective-and       2008 from 15.3 percent to15.7 percent of GDP. Strong capital
inflows, helpedfinance the current account deficit, as did the significant flow of remittances from
Guatemalans living abroad. Remittances have increased tenfold over the past ten years, displaying
remarkable stability so far, although the downturn in economic activity in the U.S has started to
weigh on inflows inrecent months.


Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability Analysis

12. The 2009-13 growth outlook for Guatemala is broadly positive, but growth projections
have now been revised downward as a result of the continued global financial turmoil and the
likely deeper economic slowdown in the US. Initial estimates had foreseen growth of 5 percent in
2008 to be followed by a gradual slowdown to about 4.5 percent GDP growth over 2009-2013.
However, in light of the continued financial turbulence and economic slowdown in the US (the
main commercial partner of Guatemala), growth projections have been lowered. This reflects an
expected decline in export performance, tightening domestic credit markets and slow down in
remittances growth. GDP growth is now projected to slow to 3 percent in 2009 and 3.5 percent in
2010 before recovering to about 4.0 percent in 2011 (Table 2). These figures could be further
revised following a Fund mission expected to travel to Guatemala on March 16, 2009 (see
paragraph 17).

13. On the external front, the positive impact of lower prices for oil imports will likely more
than offset the adverse impact of the global slowdown on dampening exports. Indeed the
projections prepared in mid 2008 for the Fund's Article IV Consultation, anticipated a trade
balance deficit above 16 percent o f GDP and a current account deficit in the 5 to 5.5 percent o f
GDP range. These projections have been revised downward in the new medium-term
macroeconomic framework to a trade deficit inthe 13 to 15 percent o f GDP range and to a current
account deficit inthe 4 to 5 percent o f GDP range over 2009-20 13,

14. On the fiscal front, Guatemala's low debt and deficit levels open the possibility to
countercyclical fiscal policy. As countercyclical fiscal policy i s implemented (particularly through
increased targeted spending on the poor) the 2009 central government fiscal deficit may expand to a
modest 2.2 percent of GDP, up from 1.6 percent o f GDP in 2008. This larger deficit is expected to
be financed with loans from the multilateral development banks. Beyond 2009, the government i s
committed to maintaining the country's ongoing fiscal restraint and hence the stock o f public debt
is expected to remain (as a percentage o f GDP) at a level similar to the one in 2008. Fiscal
outcomes will be somewhat driven by the Congressional approval o f the government's Fiscal

Modernization Plan (supported by the Bank's Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loan
series).

15. The level of public debt is expected to be sustainable over the coming years. This
assessment is based on the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) contained in Annex 2. The DSA is
based on the medium term macroeconomic framework described above and shows that under the
baseline scenariothe ratio ofthe stock ofpublic debt to GDP is expectedto remain at a level similar
to the one in 2008. Debt levels would increase under less favorable alternative scenarios than the
baseline including: (i)higher real interest rates (1 standard deviation or about 1.5 percent); (ii)
lower growth (by 1 standard deviation or about 1.3 percentagepoints); (iii) lower primary balance
                                                                            a
resulting from lower tax collection (1 standard deviation or about 0.4 percent of GDP); (iv) a
combination of the previous three shocks using 0.5 standarddeviation shocks; and (v) a sharp real
depreciation of the Quetzal in 2009 (25 percent). In all these alternative scenarios, however, the
stock of public debt would be at or below 27 percent of GDP in2013.

16. The banking sector in Guatemala remains liquid, though nonperformingloans (NPLs)
have increased slightly with the economic slowdown (Table 3). As of end-November 2008,
banks maintained a ratio of highly liquid assets to deposits of 20 percent compared to 18.9 percent
one year ago and standard profitability indicators (ROA and ROE) have been stable. At the same
time, NPLs have increasedfrom 1.9 percentof gross loansto 2.7 percent. Perhapsmore importantly
in this context, new regulations have been approved to gradually increase provisioning
requirementsfrom the current 60 percentof NPLsto 100percentJune 2011.

17. Risksto the mediumterm outlook includethe possibilityof domesticliquidityproblems
and/or lower remittances and export growth resulting from a worse than expected external
environment. The Government of Guatemala is aware of these risks and is mitigating them. For
example, the Central Bank is already considering maintaining the credit windows opened
temporarily during 2008 to increase the liquidity inthe banking sector inboth dollars and domestic
currency. The Government has also requested the Bank to advance the plannedFYlO Second Fiscal
and Institutional Development Policy Loanto early inthe fiscal year. More generally, Guatemalais
also exploring with the IMF the possibility of a precautionary Standby Arrangement. To this end,
an IMFmission is scheduledto travel to Guatemalaon March 16, 2009.

19. Guatemala's economic and social development is regularly interruptedby earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, hurricanes,flooding, and forest fires. Major disasters in Guatemala include
the earthquake (1976), which resultedin more than 23,000 deaths and damages estimated at 17.9
percent of GDP; Hurricane Mitch(1998), which caused estimated damages of 4.7 percent of GDP;
and Hurricane Stan (2005), which caused damages estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP. Inall of these
events the Government had to interrupt ongoing development programs in sectors such as health
and education to finance immediate needs for recovery andreconstruction.

Law 109 of 1996, introduced for the first time the concept of risk management in the country's
disaster management system. CONRED works as a coordinating mechanism providing a legal
framework for disaster prevention and inter-ministerial coordination in cases of emergency.
CONRED is supported by a Secretariat (SE-CONRED) employing 155 full-time staff organized
around seven work areas: coordination, financial management, comprehensive disaster risk
management, response, preparedness, mitigation, and logistics. SE-CONRED'S operating budget
has gradually been increased over the last five years to an US$4 million in 2009. The structure is
replicated in regional (Regional Coordinator for Disaster Reduction - CORRED), departmental
(Departmental Coordinator for Disaster Reduction -CODRED), municipal (Municipal Coordinator
for Disaster Reduction - COMRED), and local (Local Coordinator for Disaster Reduction -
COLRED) committees. These committees include representatives of public agencies, private and
civil society organizations, and are convened by the most senior government representative in the
relevant locality. Delegatesof SE-CONRED support the committees, whose main functions are to:
(a) coordinate disaster prevention and response activities; (b) relay informationto the next level of
the system; and (c) implement actions relating to alerts, evacuation, security, and emergency
shelter.


21.     Learning from recent disasters, Guatemala has made progress towards a more
proactive disaster risk management system. The legal basis for this change is defined in two
laws: the Social Development Law (Decree 42-2001), which includes the concept of disaster
vulnerability reduction and notions of demographics and development planning as contributors to
risk scenarios; and the Law of Housing and HumanSettlements (Decree 120-96), which mandates
that all territorial entities take disaster risk into account in development planning. The
implementation of these two laws focus on vulnerability reduction. Actions taken include: (a)
development by the Institute for         Seismic, Volcanology and Meteorological Services
(INSIVUMEH)of Landslide Event Maps, to inform territorial planning, and substantial investment
inupgrading and expanding monitoringnetworks; (b) creation of risk evaluations by the Secretaria
de Asuntos Agrarios (SAA) on landchosen for relocation of families affected by Hurricane Stan, so
as to ensure that families would be relocated to safer areas; and (c) development by the Ministry of



                                                                                                   7

Planning (SEGEPLAN) of a methodology for the inclusion o f disaster risk evaluations interritorial
planning, andthe development of instrumentsfor its implementation.


22.     Following Hurricane Stan, Guatemala began to work on a National Program for
Disaster Prevention and Reduction (Programa Nacional de Prevencidn y Mitigacidn ante
Desastres, PNPMD). The PNPMD is a coordination mechanismaimed at addressing disaster risk
reduction in a comprehensive manner. Designed with support from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the PNPMD includes four lines of action: (i)improving risk
identification and monitoring, (ii)investing to reduce risk, (iii)strengthening institutional and
planning capacity for risk management, and (iv) developing risk financing strategies. Annex 6
details the four lines of action, agencies responsible, and budget allocations. More than 25
government and private institutions participated in the drafting o f the PNPMD, ensuring a buy-in
from important sector ministries. The current Government has validated the PNPMD through
additional workshops and consultations, and through a CONRED resolution and budget
appropriations for risk reduction investments in the 2009 national budget, new authorities have
adopted it.


23.     The current Government has placed disaster risk management firmly among its
development priorities. The Plan de la Esperanza 2008-2012, the policy program of the
administration, focuses on increasing growth and reducing poverty and inequality. It articulates
disaster risk management as a self-standing policy issue in the context of securing productivity,
demonstrating significant political commitment. The government i s aware of the significant
economic consequences of business interruptions associated with the transfer of funds to address a
disaster causedby adverse natural events, along with acknowledging the importance of poverty and
inequality reduction.

Link to Country PartnershipStrategy

24.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the periodof 2009-2012 presentedto the
Board on September 23, 2008, identifiesthree broad development priorities for Guatemala:
(a) Enhancing Fundamentals (maintaining macroeconomic stability, expanding fiscal space for
priority spending, and improving governance and transparency); (b) Promoting Sustainable Growth
and Productivity (improving investment climate, rural development and productivity, sustainable
energy, and disaster risk management); and (c) Expanding Opportunities (enhancing opportunities
for vulnerable groups through improving access to, and use of, social programs) (Table IV.l). The
Government has requested Bank Group support for these development goals. The World Bank
program includes a mix of Development Policy Loans (DPLs), this proposed Catastrophe Deferred
Drawdown Option (CAT DDO), investment lending, and analytical and technical assistance. Total
lending assistance under the CPS may reachUS$1.O billion.

25.    This Disaster Risk Management DPL with a CAT DDO is one of the lending
operations which the Government of Guatemala explicitly requested for the CPS period. As
indicated in the CPS, the CAT DDO would provide bridge financing in the event of a disaster
triggered by adverse events, enabling a quicker response to address emergency needs while
supportingpoliciesto mitigate risks.


26.    The CAT DDO provides the government with a broader range of coverage for
addressing external shocks. This DPL with a CAT DDO focuses on adverse natural events,
complementing other DPLs in Guatemala, such as the Guatemala Fiscal and Institutional DPL,
giventhat the objectives of these programs are to maintainfiscal stability andprovide support to the
Government's developmentprograms.

Collaborationwith the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF)and OtherAgencies

27.     IMF Collaboration: The Bank maintains a regular dialogue with the IMFon macro policy
in Guatemala. In addition to the continuous exchange of views betweenthe two institutions, staff
havejointly reviewed specific financial sector issues identified inthe recently completed Article IV
Consultations. The IMF assessment o f the current macroeconomic situation is contained in Annex
3, but this will likely be updatedfollowing the IMF mission scheduled for March 16,2009.

28.     Other Partners: The Bank has an ongoing dialogue with various agencies dealing with
disaster risk management in Central America, includingthe Central American Coordination Center
for Natural Disaster Prevention (CEPREDENAC), the Organization O fAmerican States (OAS), the
UnitedNations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) in Central America, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and
the Provention Consortium. Key initiatives supported through these collaborations include the
Central America Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and the Mesoamerican Environmental
Information System(SIAM).

29.     Guatemala has the support of several development agencies to improve its DRM
strategy. The National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology
(INSIVUMEH)recently starteda US$12.5 million program financed by the Central American Bank
for Economic Integration (BCIE) to upgrade its seismic, meteorological, hydrological, and
volcanological networks. Guatemala was recently earmarked as a priority country by the GFDRR
which should allow the Bank to provide additional Technical Assistance in selected areas. In
addition GFDRR funds will support capacity buildingmeasuresto ensure the implementation of the
PNPMD.

Relationshipto other BankOperations

30.     The Government has requested support for various technical assistance projects
relatedto Disaster RiskManagement.Guatemala's Vice-president's Office, incoordination with
the National Committee for Risk Management, is implementing a "Technical and Scientific
Information for Municipal Planning" project, with financing from the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). This project was prepared over a two-year period in a
participatory process with institutions including INSIVUMEH, MAGA, SE-CONRED,
SEGEPLAN, and relevant municipalities.


3 1.    Guatemala is participating in Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment
(CAPRA), a regional initiative led by CEPREDENAC and Central American Governments
with support from the UNDSDR, IADB, and the World Bank. Part of an ongoing effort to
promote a pro-active disaster risk management strategy in the Central American region, CAPRA
applies probabilistic risk analysis techniques to measure magnitude and likelihood of occurrence of
hazards. This information is combined with exposure of assets and vulnerability data, to produce a
comprehensive measure of risk. The main CAPRA product is a compendium of risk maps that
provide disaster risk specialists and policy-makers with the necessary informationto manage future
disaster risk.




                                                                                                  10

LessonsLearned

32.   The design of this operation has taken into account the lessons learned from previous
disastersin the country, and lessons from 25 years of Bank operations and programs in the
area of disaster risk management.The World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) report,
"Hazards o f Nature, Risks to Development: An Evaluation o f World Bank Assistance for Natural
Disasters" (2005), recommends that the Bank assist its clients most vulnerable to natural disasters
to shift from focusing entirely on disaster response to implementing programs and policies for
comprehensively managing disaster risk. The most important lessons from these events and from
the more than 500 projects that were evaluated are the following:

33.      Disaster risk should be proactively managed rather than treated as an exogenous
shock to development. This has been documented in a wide array of studies and is the
underpinning o f the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), the international agreement adopted by
168 government^.^ Guatemala has acknowledged that hazard risk i s a manifestation o f development
that is not adequately adapted to the environment, and that managing disaster risk i s good practice
to achieve sustainable development. It has consequently included disaster risk management in its
national development program and long-term development vision.

34.      Reconstruction after a disaster should be done in areas that are not vulnerable to
adverse natural events. Experience after Hurricane Stan revealed the tendency to reconstruct in
highly vulnerable areas, resulting inprolonging the stay of affected families intemporary shelters,
while more appropriate reconstructionsites were sought.

35.      Disasterrisk managementis most efficientwhen based on adequaterisk identification.
Inrecent years, the Ministry of Agriculture (MAGA) has made some efforts to identify risk using
geographic information system (GIS) tools on a very large scale. This has complemented the more
traditional monitoring o f natural hazards work carried out by the INSIVUMEH, and the geographic
and cartographic information produced by the National Geographic Institute o f Guatemala (IGN).
MAGA has generated information on some hazards, but the standards and methodologies to
measure vulnerability and identify actual risk are yet to be fwlly developed and agreed.

36.      Local community capacity to prepare for, and respondto, disasterscaused by adverse
naturalevents should be improvedand strengthened.Duringthe last 10 years the response and
preparation capabilities in Guatemala have increased. However, Hurricane Stan and the 2008
floods revealed that despite good response capabilities at the municipal level, CONRED response
skills were still weak at the local level.

37.      Ex-anteinvestmentshave a significant impact in reducinglosses. Since Hurricane Stan,
the Government o f Guatemala has been investing in river dredging resulting in a significant
reduction o f risk, as well as promoting risk management education in primary schools and

  The HFA was formulated as a comprehensive, action-oriented response to international concern about the growing
impacts of disasters on individuals, communities, and national development. Based on a careful study of trends in
disaster risks and on practical experiencein disaster riskreduction, and subjectedto intensive negotiations during 2004
and early 2005, the HFA was finally adoptedby 168 governments at the World Conferenceon Disaster Reduction, held
in Kobe, HyogoPrefecture, Japan, 18-22 January, 2005.




                                                                                                                    11

community awareness in the rural areas. These investments will have to be integrated with the
National Plan for Disaster Prevention and Reduction in Guatemala under the leadership of
CONRED and SEGEPLAN.

38.     Ex-ante risk financing helps limit the interruptionof ongoingdevelopmentprograms.
Such interruptions have occurred in Guatemala because the current financing arrangements require
the Government to tap into its development program resources during an emergency. This practice
hampers the implementationo fthose programs, represents an administrative burden, and impairs an
effective disaster response. The CAT DDO will establish the basis for a more ex-ante approach,
will become part of the country's risk financing strategy, and consequently allow for uninterrupted
developmental progress inthe country.

39.     Rapidand flexible financing is criticalfor early recovery.On average, 50 percent o f the
economic losses associated with large natural disasters occur inthe post-disaster period. Guatemala
and other countries have experienced the critical need for immediately available liquidity in the
aftermath o f a disaster event to ensure that the Government can reestablish crucial services as fast
as possible. If the Government has access to untied liquidity, it will be possible to accelerate
recovery, minimize business interruption, and secure the operation o f critical public facilities, such
as health services.

40.     Ex-ante investments in local capacity building are necessary to prevent lack of
coordinationandleadershipduringmajor disasters.DuringHurricane Stan, existing Emergency
Operations Centers (COEs) were not prepared or able to coordinate (Cruz Avila 2008). This
exposed a largerproblem for the country: the lack o f clear institutional responsibilities and sectoral
roles, and the need for ex-ante investments to build local capacity.

AnalyticalUnderpinnings

41.     The general framework for the analysis and preparationof the four lines of action in
the NationalProgramfor Disaster Risk Reductionwas based on a number of key documents
and publications,includingthe following:

>       The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA, 2005). This document endorsed by the
Government o f Guatemala at the World Conference for Disaster Reduction in 2005 provides the
guidelines for comprehensive disaster risk management actions. Guatemala used the framework for
organizing the Identification and Monitoring o f Risks, Reduction o f Disaster Risk, Institutional
Strengthening and Planning, and Risk Financing Strategies in the PNPMD, to ensure a more
efficient and systematic implementation o f its disaster risk reduction strategies.

>       The Central American countries' Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Plan (Plan
Regional de Reduccibn de Desastres, PRRD) (CEPREDENAC 2008). This document was
instrumental for outlining key elements for Reduction o f Disaster Risk inthe PNPMD. It provided
the Government with a regional framework to work from, while also indicating the Government's
support o f the Disaster Risk Management Framework that i s promoted by CEPREDENAC, the
Central American regional organization.




                                                                                                    12

>       "Indicators of Disaster Risk and Risk Management," and the "Guatemala Case
Study," published by the IADB in 2004. The first paper provides an important source of
information for the identification and monitoring of risk and disaster risk reduction inthe PNPMD
by providing Guatemala with an understanding of its own risk profile, while also providing the
country with a comparative analysis on where it stands relative to other countries inthe region. The
"Guatemala Case Study" provides the Government with an overview of the country's main
achievements indisaster risk managementandindicates areas that needimprovement.

>       "Definitionof State Responsibility,Exposure to Natural Disasters and the Design of
Mechanisms to Cover Residual Risk' (DeJnicibn de la responsabilidad del Estado y su
exposicibn ante desastres naturales y el diseAo de mecanismos para la cobertura de 10s riesgos
residuales del Estado), published by Evaluacibn de Riesgos Naturales (ERN) in 2005. ERN is a
consortium of academics and professional specialists in disaster risk management. ERN'Swork
provided informationfor Institutional Strengthening and Risk Financing Strategies inthe PNPMD.
The document outlines the importance of the legal aspects of disaster risk managementwith regard
to the extent of government responsibility (including concepts such as moral hazards), while also
indicating the various mechanismsavailable to finance residual disaster risk.


                        V. ProposedDPLwith a CAT DDO for Guatemala

OperationDescription

42.     The overall development objective of the proposed operation is to enhance the
Governmentof Guatemala's capacity to implementits disaster riskmanagementprogramfor
adversenaturalevents.

43.     The DPL with a CAT DDO is a new financial product, which was approved by the
Bank's Board of Directors on March 5, 2008. The DPL with a CAT DDO can help address
Guatemala's immediate liquidity needs in the aftermath of a catastrophic disaster. The DPL with a
CAT DDO is a flexible and prompt financial tool to address risks to which the country is prone. It
will enable the Government of Guatemala to focus on emergency response measures in the
aftermath of a disaster, rather than spend valuable time and resources for fund-raising activities.

44.     The Governmentwill be able to access funds from the facility uponthe declarationof a
state of emergency as a result of an adversenaturalevent. The maximum amount of DPL with
a CAT DDO funding constitutes 0.25 percent of the national GDP of the country, which inthe case
of Guatemala will be about US$85 million. Loan pricing is in line with standard IBRD terms,
which include a 0.25 percentage point front-end fee. The funds may be drawn down over a three-
year period, which may be renewedup to four times for a total of 15 years. The signing of the DPL
with a CAT DDO is contingent upon Guatemala maintaining a sound macroeconomic policy
framework and the existenceof a disasterrisk managementprogram.

45.    The DPLwith a CAT DDO instrumentis designedas a "bridge financing" mechanism
in the event of disaster generatedby adverse natural events. Indiscussions with the GoG, the
Bank clarified that the DPL with a CAT DDO will help reducethe GoG's fiscal vulnerability inthe
event of a catastrophic natural event. Also, in line with the Bank's Catastrophe Risk Financing


                                                                                                   13

Framework, the GoG was advised that small-scale natural disasters should be covered by the
Government's own reserve funds, while this instrument covers less frequent and more severe
disaster events. To make this more explicit, the Bank shared with GoG officials a brief note on the
DPL with a CAT DDO andthe Bank'srisk financing framework for natural disasters.

46.      Drawdown condition, financial features, and renewalsare as f01lows:~

         Drawdown Triggers. Funds may be drawn upon the declaration of a national and/ or
         regional state of emergency' (Estudode CulumidudPziblicu), by Presidential Decree, under
         the Public Order Law 7, Article 14. The National Congressmust ratify the declaration of the
         state of emergency.
         FinanciaZ Features. The financial features of the DPL with a CAT DDO are similar to
         those available for the Deferred Drawdown Option for Development Policy Loans (DDO
         DPLs), with one exception: the DPL with a CAT DDO would have a revolving feature; that
         is, amounts repaid prior to the closing date would be available for drawdown.
         Drawdown Period and Renewals. The drawdown period for this operation will be three
         years. The DPL with a CAT DDO may be renewed up to four times. Renewals require that
         the original program remain largely in place: the adequacy of the macroeconomic
         framework and a disaster risk management program will be reconfirmed and updated upon
         renewal. Renewal will take place no earlier than one year, and no later than six months,
         before the expiry date.

47.      The process for declaring a state of emergency. According to Public Order Law 7, Article
14, a state of emergency at national and/or regional level can be declared when the disaster is of
such a magnitude that special measures are requiredfor an effective responseto the situation. There
is a legal system for CONRED's assessment o f whether an alert is severe enough to be declared a
national or regional state of emergency. Once CONRED suggests the declaration of emergency to
the Executive branch, the Public Order Law allows for mobilization of economic resources and
services to respondto the disaster. The process for declaration of a State of Emergency is described
intable V.1.

declared. National states of emergency include: the Guatemala earthquake 1976, Hurricane Mitch
in 1998, floods in 2000, forest fires in the northeast in 2003, and Hurricane Stan in 2005. The
regional state of emergency was the Tropical Depression 16 in October, 2008. A historical outline

50.     If at any time during the drawdown period the Bank concludes that the disaster risk
management program is not being implemented in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, the
Bank will promptly advise Guatemalan authorities of the need for a subsequent review to
confirmthat the programis implementedsatisfactorily before it would be able to grant any request
for drawdown. Inthis case, follow-up monitoringwould be more frequent until a review confirms
that the programis back on track. Oncethe Bank is satisfiedthat drawdownconditionsare again in
place, the Bank would inform the borrower that its eligibility to submit disbursement requests has
beenrestored.

Toward a ComprehensiveDisasterRiskManagementPolicy

51.     The prior action agreed on with the Government is consistent with the five good
practiceprincipleson conditionality,as identifiedby the Bank's 2005 review and its updates.
Box V.l describes how this disaster risk management DPL with a CAT DDO is alignedwith each
of these principles.




                                                                                               17

  Box V.1: Operational Consistency with Bank Good Practices Principles on Conditionality

      Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

      0 Alignment with governmentgoals: This operation is driven by the Government of Guatemala (GoG) and
        enjoys solid ownership inthe country. The disaster risk management DPL with a CAT DDO supports the
        National Program for Disaster Reduction and Prevention and is aligned with the Government's National
        DevelopmentPlan. This operation recognizesthe priority given to disasterrisk management by the GoG.
      0 Timely and demand-driven analytical support: With the support of UNDP, the PNPMD was developed
        during 2006-2007 and has been validated by the new government in 2008-09. Furthermore, the ongoing
        GFDRR-funded TA Grants on Technical and Scientific Information for Municipal Planning (TSIMP)
        and the Central America Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) have and will serve as inputs for
        relevantpolicy implementation.

      Principle 2: Agree up-front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
      accountability framework

      The proposed loan is based on a coherent framework of expected outcomes that i s based on the
      Government's program and has been coordinatedwith the IMF.
        Jointly designed policy matrix: The Bank and the Government have prepared an operational policy
        matrix, agreeing on the prior action for Board approval and expectedprogram outcomes drawn fiom the
        Government's National Development Plan2008-20 12.

      Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
      circumstances

         In addition to supporting the Government's development of its integratedfinancial managementsystem
        (SIAF) and e-procurement system (Guatecompras),the Bank is also providing ongoing support for civil
        society activities to help build capacity to evaluate government information, increase transparency, and
        build public sector accountability. The Bank has been working closely with donor groups (for example,
        USAID, IADB, UNDP, Norway, the Netherlands) on enhancing governance, and on supporting various
        dialogues on social auditing with arangeof civil society organizations.

      Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

      CAT DDOs are approved for 3 years and unlike with other Bank budget support operations the CAT DDO
      only requires the adequacy o f the macroeconomic framework to be established at effectiveness and
      reconfirmed at renewal.

      Funds may be drawn down upon occurrence of an adverse natural event resulting in a declaration of a state
      of national or regional emergency, or an Estado de Calamidad P2iblica, by Presidential Decree, in
      accordance with Public Order Law 7, article 14. The National Congress will have to ratify the declaration
      of the state of emergency. Such drawdown is conditioned on continued satisfactory implementation of the
      National Programfor Disaster Reduction and Prevention inthe four areas of action.

      Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
      financial support

      The policy matrix contains outcomes that have been defined by the borrower and are closely linked to the
      supported policy actions. This will help the Bank and government review progress during project
      implementation.


52.   Two subsequent Governments have taken critical steps toward institutionalizing
comprehensive disaster risk management rather than relying only on disaster response, as
had historically been the case.           The development and validation of a National Program for
Disaster Reduction and Prevention following commitments stipulated in the Social Development


                                                                                                                18

Law, Decree 42-2001, is a significant accomplishment that provides an implementing mechanism
for comprehensive disaster risk management inGuatemala. This Program was developed through a
consultative process with the support of UNDP during 2006-07. The program has been approved
by the National Council for Reduction of Disasters in January 2009. To further strengthen the
integration of disaster prevention and risk mitigation inthe country's development framework, the
Government included disaster risk management in its current development strategy, Plan de la
Esperanza2008-2012.

53.      The National Program for Disaster Reduction and Prevention outlines four areas of
action: (i)improving risk identification and monitoring, (ii)strengthening institutions and
planningcapacity for risk management,(iii)investingto reducerisk, and (iv) developingrisk
financing strategies.Of the four areas, most advances have been made on risk identification, and
some recent advances have been made on risk reduction and strengthening institutional capacity.
Guatemala's current financing strategy relies on ex-post budget allocations. An increasedallocation
to the country's emergency fund combined with the resources made available through this CAT
DDO is a step towards a more efficient ex-ante risk financing strategy.

54.      The Government and the Bank will maintain a close policy dialogue during the
implementationof the PNPMD throughout the drawdown period. The Bank will have two
supervision missions per year, where the Disaster Risk Management framework will be reviewed.
This has been agreed with the government authorities and is included in the PNPMD. Close
coordination will also be maintained with other international organizations actively assisting
Guatemalainthe area of post-disasterrecovery and mitigation, including UNDP, IADB, the Office
of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and
the Government of Spain.

55.      Through GFDRR funds, the Bank will support the Government of Guatemala with
capacitybuilding. One ofthe components of the GFDRRis capacity building at the municipal and
institutional level, which will ensure the successful implementation on the PNPMD.

First Area of Action: Improving Risk Identi$cation and Monitoring

56.      Guatemala has made good progress towards risk identification and monitoring
systems. Disaster risk management starts with the identification and analysis of risks. The
challenge of risk identification is to provide decision-makers with knowledge about disaster risk
that enables them to take efficient decisions on how to manage the risk. To support risk
identification and monitoring, CONRED counts on the support of the Science Council. The
INSIVUMEHpresides over the Science Council. The council draws on information produced by
public and private scientific entities. Some of the specific projects carried out for risk identification
and monitoring includethe following:

      INSIVUMEH:The institute has developed an inventory of Historical LandslideEvent Maps;
      implementedan early-warning alert system for flooding in six water basins; and conducted
      hydrological studies in the six basins, while preparing various educational facilities for the
      technical study of monitoring and prognostic elements of the systems.
      Secretaria de Asuntos Agrarios (SAA): In 2006, risk evaluations were made on 250
      geographic areas earmarked for relocation of families affected by Hurricane Stan. The


                                                                                                       19

      Gerencia de Riesgo, a professional risk evaluation group, worked with SAA in evaluating a
      further 50 geographic areas that are affected by land- andmudslides.
  0   SE-CONDRED: An "Early warning alert system for the Fuego Volcano to reduce the risk in
      Escuintla, Sacatepuez and Chimaltenango Departments", developed by CONRED, has been
      supportedby the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
      MAGA: This institution, responsible for basic cartography, has produced hazard maps for
      volcanic eruptions, developed at a scale of 1:50,000 with the support of the JICA.

57.      Guatemala is working to strengthen risk identificationat the municipallevel in order
to integrate this knowledge into territorial development planning.This activity, funded by a
GFDRR grant, will help hazard-prone municipal governments to includerisk considerations intheir
territorial development process. The project will help: (a) develop scientific informationon hazards,
vulnerability, and risk; (b) provide specific risk information for land use and urban zoning; and (c)
provide scientific information for Emergency Plans. The information provided will help local
authorities place appropriate controls to avoid the future generation of risks and will aid in the
design of risk mitigation programs.

58.      Guatemala is working with CEPREDENAC, the UN-ISDR, IADB, and the Bank to
develop the CentralAmericanProbabilisticRiskAssessment (CAPRA) platform.CAPRA will
help facilitate a comprehensive understanding of risk and risk management. The platform will
enable governments and scientific communities to identify and evaluate the sources of potential
losses (both geographically and by sector) from disasters, risk reduction investment opportunities,
and government capacity to finance and managerecovery operations. This knowledge will provide
the basis to the formulation of strategies and policies to strengthenthe national risk prevention and
emergency management system, andto develop a risk finance strategy. Localcommunitycapacity
to prepare for, and respond to, disasters caused by adverse natural events should be
improved and strengthened.During the last 10 years the response and preparation capabilities in
Guatemala have increased. However, Hurricane Stan and the 2008 floods revealed that despite
good response capabilities at the municipal level, CONRED response skills were still weak at the
local level.

59.      The National Program for Disaster Reduction and Preventionin Guatemala aims to
significantly augment the effort to improve risk identificationand monitoring over the next
threeyears. The program includes projects that will advance methodologically the identification of
hazards, vulnerability, and risk, while strengthening national capacity in identifying and monitoring
risk. Subprograms include: (i)a space to exchange existing methodologies on the analysis of risk
and vulnerability, while creating new methodologies in a participatory manner; (ii) production
                                                                                       the
of hazardrisk studies on landslides and flooding, andvulnerability risk studies, especially analyzing
the vulnerability o f the most important water basins to determine population, infrastructure, and
economic vulnerability; and (iii) construction or strengthening of existing observation networks,
                                  the
particularly the technical and scientific capabilities of INSIVUMEH.For this end INSIVUMEHhas
secured US$lO million for its budget during 2009.

60.    The creationof CONFWD introduceddisaster preventionin the disaster management
system in Guatemalafor the first time. CONRED works as a coordinating mechanism providing
a platform and legal framework for inter-ministerial coordination incases of emergency and to deal
with disaster prevention.

61.    The Governmenthas recentlytaken steps to strengthenits institutionalsetup for more
systematic investments in risk reduction. In Ministerial Accord 1686 of 2007, the Ministry of
Communications, Infrastructure, and Housing decided to use, in every public investment, the
minimal technical norms applied by the Ministry. Another important recent development is the
creation of an integrated water resources management program, which includes flood protection
and prevention. Under Government Agreement 204-2008, the Water Cabinet has beencreated. The
Cabinet will be responsible for coordinating government efforts on design and management of
policies, plans and budgets on the water sector, to contribute to the achievement of the national
development objectives. This Cabinet is a multi-sectoral body and i s coordinated by the Vice
Presidency, with a technical secretariat in SEGEPLAN. Six interinstitutional commissions have
been created, and one of them, Water and Human Development (Comisidn de Agua y Desarrollo
Humano), is formed by the Ministry of Health (MPSyAP), the Ministryaf Agriculture (MAGA),
the Ministry of Environment (MARN), the Ministry of Culture (MCD), the Ministry of Education
(MINEDUC), the Secretaria de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional (SESAN), and CONRED.
This commission will be in charge of developing the disaster risk management plans related to
water.

62.    However, the Government is not yet in a positionto identify or monitor needs for and
investments in risk reduction across sectors, or to provide a strategic overview of hazard
exposure or contingentrisk for the country or for different sectors. To address this challenge,
the Government has drafted a new regulation to strengthen the mandate of CONRED, SE-
CONRED, CORRED, CODRED, COMRED, and COLRED to document and monitor disaster risk
as well as to promote prevention and mitigation activities. In addition, the new regulation for the
Law of CONRED has been prepared and requires that all public infrastructure investments must
comply with seismic building codes. The regulation is ready for the President's signature and if
approved, it could have a significant positive impact on risk reduction infuture investments.

63.    Disaster risk management is not yet explicitly part of the territorial planning
processes, but authorities are working towards a screening process for public and private
investment. SEGEPLAN has developed a methodology that will help territorial entities integrate
disaster reduction and recovery into territorial planning. This is a significant first step for
developing the instruments and capacities that will allow the territorial entities to manage their
development planning ina way that reduces the construction of newrisk.

64.    The National Program for Disaster Preventionand Reduction in Guatemala aims to
significantlystrengtheninstitutionsand planningover the next three years. Programs include:
(i) formulationoftheNationalPolicyforDisasterRiskManagement,whichinvolvesallsectors,
   the
the Program being the first step toward the development of this policy and that of a National
Strategy for Disaster Risk Management. It will be coordinated by SE-CONRED, involving both
public and private institutions; (ii)the strengthening of SEGEPLAN's planning systems to


                                                                                                21

incorporate risk concepts in public investments, including: the National System for Territorial
Strategic Planning-I (SINPET-I); the National Pre-Investment System (SINAPRE); and the Sistema
Nacional de Inversidn Pziblica (SNIP). To ensure development projects are more secure SINPET-I
and SEGEPLAN will develop Departmental and MunicipalDevelopment Plansthat includethe risk
as a variable, and in SNIP, pre-investment and public investment instrumentswill be identified; (iii)
the implementation of territorial planning in 13 municipalities by an inter-institutional committee
involving SEGEPLAN, Ministry of Environment (MAW), and Municipal Development Institute
(INFOM); and (iv) the establishment of a roundtable, with private, academic, and international
cooperation, which will be coordinated by the Vice President's Office and SE-CONRED,
convening at leasttwice ayear and supportedby the UNDP andthe World Bank.

ThirdArea of Action: Risk Reduction

65.     Guatemala does not have a systematic investment program for risk reduction.
Interventions in risk reduction are generally done ad-hoc. The government does not track or
monitor investments inrisk reduction across sectors. This means that there is little understanding of
the significance or effectiveness of these investments in reducing the disaster risk exposure of the
country or even of specific geographical areas of the country, making it hard to show results in
terms of reducing risk. Nevertheless, some of the ad-hoc activities represent significant investments
andrepresent good starting points for reducing the countries disasterrisk.

66.     SE-CONRED has recently developed and disseminated better constructionstandards
accordingto risk assessment methodologies.Inthe aftermath of Hurricane Stan, SE-CONRED
developeda methodology incoordination with line ministries responsible for reconstruction as well
as rehabilitation and retrofitting of public buildings. The aim is to introduce construction standards
that result in better and safer buildings on the basis o f risk assessment methodologies. The
methodology has been passed onto implementing agencies that may use it for reconstruction and
rehabilitation activities, although SE-CONRED does not have the capacity to supervise the
processes or to monitor to what extent the methodology is being followed.

67.     COVIAL is overseeingthe implementation of investments in river dredging and the
strengtheningof river banks to prevent significantadverseimpactsof naturalevents on road
infrastructure. The investment decisions are made on the basis of documented cost for road
maintenance. In areas where COVIAL experiences significant recurrent costs of rehabilitation of
the road network due to the impacts of floods, the agency invests in flood prevention as a cost
minimizing strategy. Over the last 5 years COVIAL has dredged more than 150,000 cubic meters of
rivers and canals per annum.

68.    The National Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction in Guatemala aims to
significantly augment investments in risk reduction over the next three years. The main
subprograms of the Plan regarding investments in risk reduction include: (a) developing national
standards for including disaster risk assessment in construction planning; (b) elaborating National
Regulation for the Construction of Schools and guidelines for its application; (c) the
implementation of a public infrastructure auditing program through the National General Auditing
Agency "Contraloria General de Cuentas";(d) two pilot programs inGuatemala City to transform
high risk zones into secure zones; and (e) identification of mitigation works in vulnerable areas
(suchas river basins).


                                                                                                   22

Fourth Area of Action: DevelopingRisk Financing Strategies

69.     Until recently Guatemala has relied on ex-post budget allocations to respond to
disasters caused by adverse natural events. In the past, financing for disaster response and
reconstruction was almost entirely appropriated after the disaster event through two mechanisms:
(1) the National Emergency Fund, coordinated by CONRED and financed according to the
guidelines provided by the National Plan for Disaster Prevention and Response (each year the
Emergency Fund receives US$2 from the national budget [Presupuesto General de Ingresos y
Egresos del Estado]; and (2) on an event-by-event basis CONRED coordinatesthe implementation
of reconstruction with additional funding via budget reallocations by the Ministry of Finance. The
funds are generally channeledto three entities that are responsible for implementing and managing
rehabilitation and reconstruction projects after disasters: the Unidad de Conservacidn Vial
(COVIAL), which managesthe funds allocated to the maintenance of the road network; the Fondo
Nacional para la Paz (FONAPAZ), which develops and implementsprojects to eradicate poverty
and extreme poverty (communal buildings, halls, sport fields, and recreation, education, and
nutritional programs); and the Secretaria Coordinadora Ejecutiva de la Presidencia (SCEP) /
Unidad de Convoyes Regionales, a unit specializing in the implementation and management of
construction and maintenanceprojects of ruralroads.

70.     The Ministry of Finance (MEF) is preparing a comprehensive strategy for covering
contingent liabilities, which will include adverse effects of natural events. The preparation of
the CAT DDO will be one of the elements in this strategy. The National Program for Disaster
Prevention and Reduction in Guatemala outlines three specific areas where the Government will
advance towards this strategy over the next three years. The objective of these activities is to
improve the government capacity to mobilize and efficiently execute resources incase of disasters.
The three specific areas are: (a) viability studies for a tag system inthe budget by the Ministry of
Finance, identifying inthe budget resources that may be dedicated to disaster risk management; (b)
an analysis of the fiscal exposure to adverse natural events, which will also determine inwhich way
investments lost after a disaster may be recovered; and (c) a study that would determine the
feasibility for the Ministryof Finance to maintain a contingency fund for disasters.




                                                                                                23

                               Box V.2: Catastrophe RiskFinancing Strategy


A risk financing strategy should differentiate between a range of higher-frequencyllower-cost events and lower-
frequencyihigher-cost events. Lower layers of risk (higher-frequencyllower-cost events) can generally be financed
through reservemechanisms, specialbudget appropriations, and budget reallocations. These sources of funds are rarely
sufficient to face higher layers of risk for which other risk financing instruments are generally needed. This CAT DDO
operationhas been designedto provide liquidity incase of medium-size (or cumulative) disasters that cannot be funded
with the internal reserves and to provide bridge financing while other sources o f funding are being mobilized incase of
major disaster.

Poverty and SocialImpact

71.       The Disaster Risk Management DPL with CAT DDO is expected to have a significant
positive poverty and social impact. Disasters triggered by natural events have a disproportionate
impact on the poor. Improvements innational disaster risk management and vulnerability reduction
strategies are expected to benefit the poor. Ninety-nine percent o f people affected by approximately
6,000 large-scale natural disasters registered worldwide between 1970 and 2002 were indeveloping
countrie~.~The World Bank 2009 Poverty Assessment for Guatemala (PA) finds that the Hurricane
Stan disproportionately impacted the poor. This i s because the poorer segments o f the population
often live in the most vulnerable locations and in inadequately constructed housing.6 In addition,
the poor have limitedlabor skills, fewer assets, and little or no savings. They have little opportunity

for risk diversification and have restricted access to credit. Because o f this, they are less able to
cushion the impact on consumption or disruptions to income. Exogenous shocks can also increase
poverty indirectly through the effects o f lower economic growth, higher inflation (the poor are more
vulnerable to inflation), and through consequential lower government spending for social services.'

72.      According to the PA, poverty and extreme poverty are significantly higher among
indigenous populations. Overall poverty rates among indigenous households remain over 75
percent (50% higher than the national average) and extreme poverty i s almost double the national
average. Furthermore, declines in poverty in Guatemala have not been uniform: non-indigenous
populations have experienced a decline inpoverty, while indigenous populations have not.

73.      Distribution of wealth is a national concern and the Plan de La Esperanza has taken
this into consideration focusing on increasinggrowth and reducing poverty and inequality.
The recommendations from the PA will be taken into consideration during project implementation.
It is important to recognize that exogenous shocks can also increase poverty indirectly through the
effects o f lower economic growth, higher inflation, and through consequential lower government
spendingfor social services.

74.      The proposed operation supports policies that will make investments to alleviate
poverty more sustainable by strengtheningrisk evaluationsin territorialplanning. Moreover,
given that the CAT D D O reduces the risk o f interruption and diversion o f resources from the other
pillars o f the national development plan, the prior actions taken by the Government are expected to
allow the continued implementation o fpoverty and social programs.

75.      While safety nets such as welfare, unemploymentbenefit, healthcare,minimumwage,
and public services can be used after a disaster they are limited and weak in Guatemala.
While the'GoG i s strongly supporting their improvement, such i s the Mi Familia Progresa
*conditional cash transfer initiative, the link with the disaster risk management program i s
something that the CAT D D O will promote during project implementation and successful cases
from other regions may be introduced in the country. The CAT DDO will be complemented by
other Bank operations which are under preparation in support o f the governments efforts to expand
the social safety net.

76.      The disruption of public utilities, such as potable water or sewage systems,
communications, and transportation infrastructure during a disaster increases the
probability that the poor and other vulnerable groups will suffer from increased
gastrointestinal and other illnesses. The inclusion o f budgetary appropriations for investment
elements o f the National Program for Disaster Reduction in the 2009 National Budget, a prior
action supported by this operation, will reduce the probability that the poor and other vulnerable
groups will suffer from increased gastrointestinal and other illnesses. The Secretary o f Public
Works i s already working with public and private water utilities to build their capacity and improve
disaster risk management capacities.

 Guatemala'sMi Familia Progresa program focuses on 45 out of 332 municipalities. Dependingon the household
composition, transfers are conditionedon children's attendanceof elementary school and on taking childrento health
services.


                                                                                                                 25

77.    A country's disaster risk management framework can substantially alleviate, if not
completely eliminate, adverse impacts of naturaldisasterson vulnerable people. It is for this
reasonthat indeveloping disaster risk frameworks, governments should take into account not only
measures to prepare for disasters and reduce their damaging impact, but also to ensure that ex-ante
or post-disaster response activities are thought through carefully, keeping in mind the needs of
vulnerable sections of the population.

78.    In the wake of Hurricane Stan, Guatemala is implementingtwo disaster prevention
programs that have a pro-poor bias. The neighborhood improvement program "Mejorarnos
Nuestros Barrios" targets the poorest neighborhoods in Guatemala City for mitigation investments
including erosion control, slope stabilization and drainage all to prevent landslides. In another
program with support from the Inter-American Development Bank, the Government is investing in
landslideprevention inthe poorest neighborhoodsof GuatemalaCity, Mixco and Villanueva.

79.    The implementation of the Disaster Risk Management DPL with a CAT DDO is
expected to have a significant positiveimpact on reducingpoverty and will positively address
other social issues in Guatemala.The operationsupporteddisaster riskmanagementprogram
will specificallyfollow up on one of the recommendationsin the upcomingGuatemalaPoverty
Assessment (World Bank 2009, p. 103), which is for the Government to improve its disaster
prevention. In addition, since this CAT DDO supports the policies in the national development
plan and the validation of the national program for disaster reduction and prevention, its
implementation is expectedto have apositive impact on poverty reduction and social welfare.


EnvironmentalAspects

80.    The CAT DDO is expected to have significantpositive impacton the environmentand
natural resources through the country's Disaster Risk Management Program. Good disaster
risk management integrates sound environmental management practices, such as those related to
river basin management and slope stabilization; in Guatemala good practices include awareness
campaigns aimed at educating the public in the relevant aspects o f environmental management.
Moreover, the critical funding provided through this operation will support the implementing
measures that reduce environmental degradation and its adverse consequenceson the population. In
particular, this operation's prior action will help the Government of Guatemala support and
strengthen the following action areas: (a) risk identification, assessment, and monitoring capacities
by enhancing its institutional framework; (b) strengthening institutions and planning capacity for
risk management, by validating the first National Program for Disaster Reduction and Prevention,
and finalizing a methodology for risk reduction in territorial planning; and (c) investing to reduce
risk by rebuilding schools with infrastructure less vulnerable to disasters, and regulating the
CONRED law so that buildings are constructed inaccordance with seismic building standards.

81.    Guatemala has recently passed a new National Environmental Policy (Politics de
Conservacidn,Proteccidn y Mejoramiento del Ambiente y 10s Recursos Naturales). This policy i s
in part based on the recommendations from the 2006 Country Environmental Analysis (CEA).
Furthermore the Government is committed to improve environmental management as reflected in
the National Development Plan2008-2012.




                                                                                                  26

82.     The CAT DDO operation places particular emphasis on assuring improved
transparency and accountability of social and environmental issues with respect to
governmental oversight and the decision-makingprocess. In compliance with OP 8.60, the
regulations inplace for reducing adverse effects and enhancing positive effects have been reviewed.
All risk prevention activities are subject to environmental impact assessments, and even if the
emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction activities are inprinciple exempt from an ex
ante assessment, a report on any impact i s often prepared and filed. Thus, social, economic, and
environmental considerations are taken into account by the GoG during an emergency situation,
and steps such as emergency allocations, shelter placements, rehabilitation, etc., are takenduringan
emergency, as regulatedby law.


Implementation,Monitoring,andEvaluation

83.     Three agencies are involved in the coordination and monitoring of the proposed
program.While the Ministryo f Finance is the main counterpart o f the Bank for this disaster risk
management DPL with a CAT DDO, implementation o f the program i s a shared responsibility
among the Vice President's Office and SE-CONRED. For the implementation o f the program, an
institutional arrangement described inFigure VI.1 i s inplace.

macroeconomic environment and the implementation o f the program supported by the DPL during
the drawdown period (a period of three years, which can be extended for up to four additional
three-year periods, subject to satisfactory program implementation and a sound macroeconomic
policy framework at the time of extension). This will be done through frequent visits to the country
and regular communication with the Ministry of Finance, the Vice President's Office, and SE-
CONRED. Table VI.l summarizes the targets that the Government is working toward. These
targets are drawn entirely from the Government's existing program of actions to reduce risks
resulting from adverse natural events. The targets do not constitute conditions for either

FiduciaryAspects

85.     The 2007 update o f the Country Fiduciary Accountability Assessment (CFWCPAR)
indicates that the fiduciary environment in Guatemala i s adequate, as evidenced by the
improvements in the public expenditure management systems made over the previous decade and
the actions being taken by the Government to continue increasing transparency. While challenges
remain, the current administration is moving ahead to strengthen its public fiduciary control
framework further, and has shown a strong commitment to tackling fiduciary issues in many key
areas identified by the Country Fiduciary Assessment. The foreign exchange control environment
o f the Central Bank is adequate and, subsequent to the IMF Assessment Report (2002), external
auditing i s now in place and international foreign currency reserves are managed according to
prudent international practice.


DisbursementandAuditing

86.     The Minister of Finance has elected the deferred drawdown option (DDO) as the
disbursement mode for this operation. The DDO feature gives an IBRD borrower the option o f
drawing down the DPL during a three-year period, which can be extended up to four additional
three-year periods during which the DPL with the D D O can be disbursed. Each extension will
require the approval o f the regional Vice President o fthe Bank.

87.     The CAT DDO may be drawn down at any time subsequent to a natural disaster
resultingin a declarationof a nationaland or regional' emergency in accordancewith Public
Order Law Article 14. If during the drawdown period the Bank concludes that the hazard risk
management program i s not being implemented, the Bank will advise the Government o f the need
for a subsequent satisfactory review before the Bank will be able to grant any request for
drawdown. Adequacy o f the macroeconomic framework is verified at inception and upon any
subsequent renewals.

88.     The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the Central Bank
(Banguat), denominatedin U.S. dollars." Banguat will immediately credit the disbursed amounts
to the Ministry of Finance Treasury Single Account ("common fund"), thus becoming available to
finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week o f this funds transfer, the Ministry will provide the
Bank with a written confirmation.

89.     Due to the described conditions, no additionalfiduciary arrangements (for example,
dedicatedaccounts subject to audit) are deemed necessary for this DisasterRiskManagement
DPL with a CAT DDO.




 Accordingto the country's PreliminaryRegionalisationLaw, Decree70/86
10In the context of the latest IMF central bank safeguards assessment, an action plan has been agreed with Banguat.
Moreover, Banguat is aparticipant inthe Bank's Reserves Advisory and ManagementProgram(RAMP).


                                                                                                               30

Risks and Risk Mitigation


90.      The proposed loan is considered to be of moderate risk due to institutional and
coordination risks. As has been made evident by institutional weaknesses in the face of major
disasters in even advanced countries (e.g., Hurricane Katrina in the United States and the Kobe
earthquake inJapan), although prior actions neededfor this loanhave been achieved, there remains
a risk that comes primarily from Guatemala's lack of experience in interinstitutional coordination.
This risk can be mitigated by the validation of the Program by all the relevant institutions, as this
will ensure political support of the Program, and will secure and strengthenSE-CONRED's role as
institutional coordinator. Inaddition, the activities outlined inthe Program are accounted for inthe
2009 National Budget, guaranteeingimplementation because financing has already been set aside.

91.      On the macroeconomicfront, the main risks derive from the global financial crisis and
more specifically from a deep and prolonged global deceleration. As discussed previously, the
current global situation i s expected to negatively impact Guatemala as credit to the private sector
becomes tighter, remittances and foreign direct investment growth decelerate, and the US demand
for Guatemalanproducts declines. These factors have already beentaken into account inthe design
of the program and inthe projections developed for the medium-term.However, to the extent that
the global slowdown lasts longer or is deeper than anticipated, and hence affects Guatemalamore
thanprojected, the government may find some difficulties implementing its program. This risk is
somewhat mitigated by recent steps taken by the authorities to enhance crisis preparedness
including preparation and publication on January 15th of the Emergency and Economic Recovery
National Program which tries to coordinate and adjust the country's policies to the current situation.
A critical component of the effort to mitigate macroeconomic risks is related to the need for fiscal
responsibility. Inthis sense, the aimed increase in tax collection inthe government's fiscal reform
proposal appears to be a step in the right direction as it will allow for additional spending in key
areas such as infrastructure. Similarly, the expansion of the government's CCT program will
mitigate some of the risks of the economic slowdown by improving income prospects for the
poorest. The authorities have also taken efforts to minimize stress inthe banking sector, including
through the increaseof provisioningfor nonperforming loans.

                                   Annex 2: Debt SustainabilityAnalysis

The outlook on Guatemala's medium-termmacroeconomic prospects has deteriorated as a result of
the global financial turbulence experienced over the second half of 2008. The debt sustainability
analysis in this Program Document is based to a large extent on the macroeconomic framework
developed by the IMF following their last staff visit to Guatemala in December 2008. Thus, this
medium-termmacroeconomic framework already incorporates the expected negative impact of the
global crisis on the Guatemalaneconomy.

Mid 2008 projections anticipated a GDP growth rate of about 5 percent in 2008 and of about 4.5
percent over 2009-2013. However, inlight of the severity of the crisis growth projections have been
revised downwards to reflect an expected decline inexport performance, tightening domestic credit
markets and a slowdown in remittances growth. Indeed, growth is now projected at 3 percent in
2009 before recovering to 3.5 percent in2010 and about 4.0 percent over 2011-2013.

Table A2.1 presentsthe stock o f long-term debt of the NonFinancial Public Sector as of December
2008. It indicates that the stock of Guatemala's debt is (i)quite modest at 21 percent of GDP; (ii)
somewhat balancedbetween internal and external debt although the stock of the latter is higher (56
percent of the stock is external debt); (iii)
                                           mainly heldby private creditors (59 percent of total debt),
although whenjust focusing on the stock of the external debt this is mainly held by multilateral and
official bilateral creditors (74 percent of total); (iv) and denominated to a large extent in foreign
currency, mainly US$ denominated (61 percent of total debt).

The debt sustainability analysis (Table A2.2) indicates that under the baseline scenario, Guatemala
would manage to stabilize the stock o f public debt in a 21-22 percent o f GDP range. Thus, in the
absence o f a crisis scenario, the medium term external position o f Guatemala remains sustainable.

The main risks to the medium-term outlook are associated with the global financial turmoil as well
as with the ability o f the new administration to increase tax collection and push structural reforms
in a very volatile environment. To account for the impact that a materialization o f some of these
risks would have on the sustainability o f public debt, table A2.2 also presents projected debt
dynamics under more pessimistic alternative scenarios:

    o Under tighter financial market conditions resulting in higher interest rates paid on public
         debt o f around 1 standard deviation o f historical values (past 10 years) (equivalent to about
         1.5 percent) over 2009-2013, scenario A1 projects debt indicators for 2013 that would be 2
         percentage points o f GDP higher than under the baseline scenario.

    o Under a less optimistic growth scenario equivalent to the baseline minus 1 standard
         deviation o f historical values (or 1.3 percent) over 2009-2013, scenario A2 projects an
         increase inpublic debt in2013 o f 4.5 percentage points o f GDP with respect to the baseline.

    o Under a deterioration in public finances equivalent to 1 standard deviation of historical
        revenues (0.4 percent o f GDP), scenario A3 indicates that the stock o f public debt in 2013
        would be 2 percentage points o f GDP higher than under the baseline.

    o Scenario A4 projects the impact o f contemporaneous shocks A1 to A3 but using 0.5
         standard deviations. It indicates that the stock o f debt would reach 24.2 percent in2013.

Finally, scenario A5 projects the impact o f a real exchange rate depreciation equivalent to 30
percent in 2009. It shows that under this admittedly dramatic scenario, the stock o f debt would

          Guatemala-Assessment on EconomicSituationfor the World Bank by IMF Staff
                                              February 5,2009

The latest assessmentby the Executive Board i s presented inthe Public Information Notice o f
June 4,2008 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2008/pn0865.htm).The next Article IV
Consultation discussion is expected to take place inthe second half o f 2009.

In linewith regionaltrends, growthis deceleratingrapidly. Real GDP growth slowed to about
4 percent in 2008 (from 6.3 percent in 2007) and i s projected to decline to 3 percent in2009. Annual
inflation has declined from its peak inmid-2008 (about 14 percent) to 9.4 percent by year-end, due to
the reversal ofexternal commodityprices and tighter monetary conditions. The external current account
deficit remained broadly constant at 5% percent o f GDP in 2008, due to solid export growth and the
continued flow o f remittances. Net international reserves stand at US$4.4 billion, i.e. almost 4 months
o f imports and 110 percent o f the monetary base.

Globalturbulences havehad a limitedimpactso far, but domestic financialconditions are
becomingtighter. Interest rates have risen and the quetzal has been depreciating moderately, with
occasional intervention by the central bank. Due to the tightening in funding sources-there     has been a
small decline inexternal credit lines-banks     have been rebalancing their portfolios toward liquid assets,
with private sector credit growth slowing to 10percent in2008.

There are downside risks to the outlookdue to strongcountryand regionallinkageswith the
U.S.economy.Remittancesdeclined inthe last months of2008 (although lower oilprices are expected
to reduce pressure on the external current account in2009) and capital inflows may slow further if
external financial conditions deteriorate. The central bank recently added more flexibility to the foreign-
exchange intervention rule, which would facilitate adjustment to changing external conditions and
strengthenthe implementation o fthe inflation-targeting regime. As inflation declines toward the target
(5!4 percent in2009), the central bank could consider reducing interest rates gradually, balancing
against the risk o f inducing capital outflows.

Fiscalpolicy has remainedprudent,and there is some space for a countercyclicalresponseto the
downturn.Accordingly, the central government deficit is projectedto increase to 2% percent o fGDP
in2009 (1% percent ofGDP in2008) mainly through higher spending, butnonfinancial public sector
debt will remain low at about 22 percent o f GDP. Financing o f the budget has been shifted to external
sources (almost fully from multilaterals) to lessen crowding out, and the authorities have made
important progress in consolidating tax collection, as a temporary tax on corporate assets has been made
permanent. However, the tax ratio remains low and there i s a need o f a revenue-enhancing tax reform to
provide more scope for needed infrastructure and social spending.

The authoritiesshould continue strengtheningbank regulationand supervision in light of
remainingvulnerabilities.Provisioning requirements have been raisedto ensure 100-percent coverage
o f past-due loans in a 2-year period; in addition, the public mortgage bank (CHN) was recapitalized,
reducing solvency risks. Bank supervision has been enhanced with continuous on-site supervision and
the central bank has put inplacetemporary and limitedmeasures to ensure adequate liquidity. Progress
has been made on finalizing draft amendments to the banking law-expected to be submitted to
congress during2009-which       are necessary to reduce risks from offshore bank operations, strengthen
enforcement powers, reduce credit concentration, and enhance bank resolution tools.

Exposureto NaturalHazardsin Guatemala

Guatemala is one o f the most densely populated countries in Latin America, with about 12 million
habitants and a territory of 108,890 square kilometers. It is also one of the poorest countries inthe
region. Guatemala is also highly vulnerable to adverse natural events (Figure A6.1). The World
Bank Hotspot Study ranks Guatemala fifth among the countries most exposed to three or more
hazards, with 52.7 percent of the total area at risk, 92.1 percent of the population living in areas at
risk, and 92.2 percent of GDP inareas at riskto two or more hazards (World Bank 2005). It is this
combination of high population density, poverty, and exposure to natural hazards that constitute a
highrisk to adverse natural events inGuatemala (ibid.).

Seismic Exposure:
Guatemala is situated on three tectonic plates: the North American plate, the Caribbean plate, and
the Cocos plate, resulting inhigh risk of earthquakes. The most catastrophic adverse natural event
would be an earthquake inGuatemalaCity, inthe case of a 500-year event.




                                                                                                   37

Volcanic Exposure:
Volcanism in Guatemala is a result of the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the Caribbean
plate. There are approximately 288 volcanoes inthe country, eight active inhistoric times, and four
presenting athreat: Fuego, Pacaya, Cerro Quemado, andSantiaguito."

Exposure to Hurricanes:
Guatemalais exposed to two coasts, the Pacific coast inthe area most vulnerable to hurricanes, and
the floods associatedwith them, especially at the river mouths.

Flooding and Landslides Exposure:
Guatemalais continually affected by smaller disasters, which occur frequently at a local level, such
as landslides and flooding, largely due to the topography of the river basins and slopes, and the
exposure of the country to two coasts. Nearly 1.733 communities and 210,000 inhabitants are
vulnerable to flooding, and 30 percent of the territory is under highthreat of flooding (Table A4.1).

Drought:
The interior of Guatemala is greatly affected by drought, with the agricultural sector suffering the
most, while also having affects onthe water, energy, andhealth sectors.

Determinantsof Vulnerabilityin Guatemala

A natural disaster is the result of the occurrence of a natural hazard event that affects a vulnerable
community or a set o f physical assets. While natural hazard events are largely exogenous factors
that are hard or impossible to control, vulnerability is a manifestation of the development patterns
of a given community. Vulnerability can be understood as the degree of susceptibility andresilience
of a community, including assets, population, and the environment, to a change in external
conditions. It is therefore a key factor to consider when trying to understandhistoric trends and in
the analysis ofpotential impacts of natural events on the country.

Vulnerable populations around the world are economically fragile by definition, and often have few
or no assets or savings to help them recover from disasters. When a disaster strikes, it can destroy
their existing wealth, and also their income opportunities and livelihoods, further increasing their
vulnerability.

Guatemala is one of the most densely populated countries in Central America (12,728,111
inhabitants), and one of the poorest inthe region. It is also one of the most vulnerable countries in
South America (see Figure A4.2).

Vulnerability in Guatemala is to a large extent due to increased urbanization, insufficient planning,
inadequate environmental management and land use planning, and a lax application of building
codes. Given the high vulnerability of the country, natural hazard events result in disasters that
affect not only the population, but also infrastructure, which has a negative impact on productivity
and delays development.

HistoricOccurrenceand ImpactsofDisastersinGuatemala

During 1902-2005,       Guatemala experienced 62 natural disaster events, which affected
approximately 6 million people.

Some of the most damaging of hurricanes include:

        Hurricane Francelia, in September 1969, resulted in 269 fatalities and 248 people injured,
        and affected 10,000 people, with economic damage approximating US$15 million.'2
        Tropical Depression Paul, in September 1982, caused 855 deaths and 482 injuries and
        affected 20,000 people, especial1 in the South of Guatemala; 3,458 houses were destroyed
        and 30 aqueductswere damaged.    i;
        Hurricane Mitch, in October 1998, caused 384 deaths, affected 105,000 people, and caused
        economic damage estimated at US$748 million (4.7 percent o f GDP). The whole country
        was affected by the hurricane, with 72 roads destroyed, more than 160 kilometers of
        highways seriously damaged, and 121 bridges, 2,293 houses, and 311 educational centers
        destroyed.
        Hurricane Iris, in October 2001, affected the lives of 700 people, destroyed 26 schools,
        caused 46 collapsed bridges, and damaged 1,229 houses and destroyed 73.l4

         More recently, Hurricane Stan, in October 2005, resulted in 1,500 fatalities, affected
         475,000 people, and caused approximately US$988 million in economic damage (2.8
         percent of GDP) (Box A4.1).

Some of the more devastating earthquakes include:

         InFebruary 1976, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused by the Motagua Fault, which passes
         15 miles north of Guatemala City, resultedin23,000 fatalities, 76,000 injuries, and affected
         approximately 3 million people throughout the country. Damage to roads, bridges,
         buildings, and vital services caused approximately US$l billion in damage and US$1.250
         million (17.9 percent o f GDP) ineconomic losses.
    0    The Pochuta earthquake, in September 1991, resulted in 25 deaths, 150 injuries, and
         affected 20,000 people in the regions of Escuintla, Chimaltenango, Solola, and
         Sacatepequez. Approximately 43 percent of the houses collapsed and 31 percent were
         damaged; roads were affected by landslides, and bridges had structural damage; water and
         electricity lines were also damaged."

Of the 288 volcanoes in the country,four present a risk to Guatemala:

    0    Volcan Fuego, one of Central America's most active volcanoes, has frequent and vigorous
         eruptions, which have beenrecordedsince 1524.
         Volcan Pacaya sits 30 kilometers south of the center of Guatemala City. An eruption in
         1989 produced a 4.5-kilometer-tall eruption column, enlarging the MacKenney crater; in

         June-August 1991, an eruption damaged villages to the west, and in 1998, eruption ash fell
         on Guatemala City.l6
         One of the largest eruptions of the 20th century occurred at Santa Maria in 1902, which
         caused 6,000 deaths. This explosion also resulted in the creation of Santiaguito,
         Guatemala's youngest and most dangerous volcano. Volcanologists rate Santiaguito among
         the 10 most dangerous volcanoes in the world, interms of potential damage to people and
         property.17In 1929, part of the dome collapsed, generating pyroclastic flows, which killed
         as many as 5,000 people.    *

Flooding in Guatemala is a major source of economic loss:

         The floods of October 1949, resulted in 40,000 fatalities, and caused damage up to
         approximately US$15 million.
          InJune 1973, floods causedupto US$2,500 ineconomic damage.

     0   In September 1982, 256 people were affected by devastating floods that caused
         approximately US$1billion indamage.
         Severe flooding also occurred after Hurricane Stan in October 2005; there were 669
         fatalities, more than 470,000 people were affected, and nearly 35,000 homes were
         damaged.l9

The interior of Guatemala is greatly affected by drought. Devastating droughts include:

         A drought inJuly 1994, whichcaused US$10 million indamage.
    0    In September 2001, a drought affected approximately 113,000 people, resulting in
         approximately US$14 million indamage.

The effects of landslides should not be underestimated:

         In 1986, a series of landslides triggered by intense rainfall causedapproximately 75 deaths
         and 200 injuries, predominately in the western part of the country, with economic damage
         of up to US$10million.20

Potential Economic Losses of Disasters in Guatemala

The Disaster Deficit Risk (DDI)2' measures the economic loss that a country could suffer if a
catastrophic event takes place, and the implications in terms of resources needed to address the
situation. The DDI is the relationship between the demand for contingent resources to cover the
losses generated by the maximum considered event (MCE) and the economic resilience. The MCE
is calculated basedon a model that takes into account diverse hazards and the physical vulnerability

of elements exposedto it. Economic resilience i s definedas the availability of internal and external
funds for restoring affected inventories. The following equation shows the relationship:

            DDI =Maximum Considered Event Loss/Economic Resilience

A DDI greater than 1.0 denotes a lack of financial capacity to face extreme disasters, outstripping
even resources available when accruing as much debt as possible. A bigger DDIrepresents a bigger
deficit.

The DDI for Guatemala between 1980 and 2000 (every five years) for an MCE with a 50-, loo-,
and 500-year return period (correspondingly 2 percent, 10 percent, and 18 percent probability of
occurrence in 10 years) is presentedinTable A4.2.

                 (Manizales, Colombia, 2004).

The DDI is greater than 1 for maximum events with a 500-year return period. This can be
interpreted as Guatemala not having enough financial resources to face losses and to restore the
affected capital for events with 18 percent probability of occurrence in 10 years. For events with a
50- and 100-year return period, Guatemala has the capacity to cover the reconstruction costs with
internal and/or external funding.

Ina comparative estimation of the DDIfor an MCE with a 500-year returnperiod inyear 2000 for
Latin America and the Caribbean Region countries, the DDI for Guatemala is 1.3, showing that the
country is in a much better position (third after Costa Rica and Argentina) compared with other
countries in the region. However, the only country in the region with a DDI lower than 1 is Costa
Rica. For all other countries, the financial capacity to face losses in the event of a disaster is not
sufficient.22Inthe case of potential losses when faced with an event with a 50- and 100-year return
period, Guatemala holds second place among the countries included in this analysis. For disasters
with a 50-year return period, the Dominican Republic and Peru are the only countries with a DDI
higher than 1.

The disaster that would potentially generate more losses to the country is an earthquake in
Guatemala City, estimated in probabilistic terms to generate US$3.44 billion in losses (IADB
2004). These probabilistic losses reflect the direct economic impact of a disaster on public and
private assets that are the responsibility of the Government. In the case of a larger event, the
Government would have to provide subventions and credits to support the population most affected.

** The CAT-DDO is expected to serve as a bridge-financing instrument to find the short-term liquidity gap. It is
intended to finance government expenditures for the f r s t three months after a disaster. During this period, the
Government is expected to raise additional finding.


                                                                                                               42

The Government would also need to take additional measures against the unemployment generated
by the cessation of labor inthe productive sectors affectedby the disaster. For a medium-size quake
with a 100-year return period, the Government would suffer estimated losses o f US$692 million,
and for a smaller earthquake with a 50-year return period, estimated losses would be US$13
million.

The different economic sectors of Guatemala, if exposed to natural hazards, would affect the
economic stability o f the country. Guatemala's main agricultural export products (coffee, banana,
sugar, and oil) could be potentially affected by floods, droughts, and seismic events. The population
most vulnerable to climate change i s the small farmers producing for their own consumption. These
cases can degenerate into increased malnutrition figures affecting the poorest in the country. The
energy sector i s also at risk; drought can cause a reduction o f the energy produced inhydroelectric
plants, and sewage systems are also affected (Table A4.3 and Figure A4.3).

   Annex 5: Organizationofthe NationalCoordinatorfor DisasterReduction(CONRED)



The National Committee for Emergencies (CONE) was created after Hurricane Francelia in 1969,
which caused more than 500 deaths. Its purpose was to coordinate Guatemala's emergency
responseto disasters. A law passed in 1971made the CONE permanent.

In 1991, after the Chimaltenango earthquake, departmental, municipal, and local emergency
committees were created. In 1994, after the lessons learned from the earthquake and following the
international trend, a bill was introduced to transform the CONE into the National Coordinator for
Disaster Reduction (CONRED). Law 109-96 created this entity, allowing the institution to focus
more on prevention and continuing the emergency responsemandate. In 1999, the law was renewed
and a budget provided to CONRED. In2000, regulations regarding CONRED were issued under a
Governmental Agreement, the purpose of which was to clarify the roles and technical proceduresof
Decree 109-96 for the correct compliance of the functions describedinthe Decree.


CONRED'sLegalFramework

The legal basis for CONRED is contained in two laws: (a) the National Coordinator for the
Reduction of Disasters Law, 1996; and (b) the National Coordinator for the Reduction of Disasters
Law Regulations, 2000. CONRED's predecessor organization, the centralized, military-run
National Committee for Emergencies (Comite` NacionaZ de Emergencias, CONE), was a disaster
responsebody rather than a coordinator,

CONRED is the National Coordinator for the facilitation of disaster prevention, mitigation,
preparation, and response. During a disaster, CONRED has the power to enlist the cooperation of
all public institutions and any private bodies within their areas of competence. In addition,
CONRED plays a key role in recommending to the President of Guatemala that a state of
emergency should be declared, based on information from the Institute for Seismology,
Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH).

OrganizationalStructure

CONRED's organizational structure is designed to establish a national system of coordination
across all the relevant sectors of government and humanitarian agencies, and at the national,
regional, departmental, municipal, and local levels of territorial government. This is outlined in
Figure A5.1.

National Structures

At the national level, the National Council for the Reduction of Disasters (Consejo Nacional para
la Reduccidn de Desastres) approves policies and standards and is available to support the
Government during emergencies. Its membership includes the Vice President, the Minister of
Defense (Convener), andrepresentatives of the Ministries of Health and Welfare, Education, Public
Finance, Communications Infrastructure and Housing and Government; and the Board and
Executive Secretary of SE-CONRED (Secretaria Ejecutiva), the National Fire Brigade; the
Assembly of Professional Associations; and the Coordinating Committee of the Association of
Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial and Financial industries.

The National Board (Junta) is convened by the Minister of Defense and includes the Executive
Secretary of SE-CONRED and a representative of one of the private entities from the National
Council. The Executive Secretary is responsible for management of CONRED and implementation
of National Council decisions. The position is responsible for four main offices within the
CONRED national secretariat:




                                                                                                              47

    0   The Secretariat's core operations, made up of five sections, focused on operations, risk
        analysis, education, finance, and administration
        The sectionfor Coordination ofPlanning and Strategy
    0   The section for Coordination of Cooperation
    0   The section for Sectoral and Territorial Coordination, including the Department of
        Coordination of Regional Offices and Regional Delegates.

Finally, members o f the Scientific Council (Consejo CientiJco) o f the National Board and
Secretariat, which is incorporated into INSIVUMEH, include representatives of universities,
scientific and technical research centers, autonomous and decentralized state entities, NGOs, and
technical-scientific volunteer groups.

GovernmentCoordinators

At the national, regional, departmental, municipal, and local levels of territorial government, the
coordinators are cross-sectoralcommittees includingpublic, private, and civil society organizations
and providers of emergency services, convenedby the most senior government representativeinthe
relevant locality. The intentionis that regional and departmental delegates of SE-CONRED support
the committees, which are the delegated authority for coordination. The membership of each
committee is intendedto representgroups active inthe relevant geographic area.

Their main functions are to: (a) participate inthe process of prevention, reduction, and response to
disasters, and mitigation, preparation, rehabilitation, andreconstruction; (b) relay informationto the
coordinator at the next level of the system about actual and potential disasters; and (c) publicize,
communicate, and implementactions relating to alerts, evacuation, security, and emergency shelter.

There is a Regional Coordinator (Coordinadora Departamentalpara la Reduccidn de Desastres,
CORRED) in each of the eight regions; these are convened by the presidents of the regional
development councils and should each be supported by a regional delegate of SE-CONRED. The
Departmental Coordinator (Coordinadora Departamental para la Reduccidn deDesastres,
CODRED) is in each of the 22 departments, and is convened by the Governor of the department
and should also be supported by a departmental delegate of SE-CONRED. The Municipal
Coordinator (Coordinadora Municipal para la Reduccidn de Desastres, COMRED) is in each
municipality. These are convened by the mayor of the municipality and rely on the CODRED for
technical support. Finally, the Local Coordinator (Coordinadora Local para la Reduccidn de
Desastres, COLRED) is in each local community, consisting of local public, private, and citizen
organizations and emergency services. These are convened by an auxiliary mayor o f the
municipality or a recognized community leader.

As part of the Government of Guatemala's effort to shift to a more preventive disaster risk
management strategy, the Government is drafting new regulations in which CONRED, SE-
CONRED, CORRED, COMRED, and COLRED (see figure A5.2) assume the responsibility for
promoting prevention and mitigation projects, inaccordancewith the hazard, vulnerability, and risk
studies. In addition, the new regulations ensure the development o f national building codes and
norms that take prevention and mitigation o f disasters into account. During the recovery and
reconstruction phases, CONRED should guaranteethat these codes and norms are enforced.

The CONRED Law and Regulations provide a fiamework for the organization's Coordination
Powers, which includes a National Fundfor the Reduction of Disasters, an organizational structure
with provision for an annual operating budget, and the basic framework for an Emergency
Operations Center. The following documents prescribe how to manage and coordinate a response to
anational disaster:

      The Institutional Response Plan (Plan Institucional de Respuesta, PIR), activated by
       CONRED for its institutional decisionmaking andpreparation;
      The National Response Plan (Plan Nacional de Respuesta, PNR), activated by CONRED

                  Annex 6: National Plan for Disaster Prevention and Response


Legal Framework

The Social Development Law (Decree 42-2001) establishes that there is a reciprocal relationship
between the advancement of development planning and reducing disaster risks. InArticles 37 and
38, the Ministry of Planning (SEGEPLAN), in coordination with other government institutions, i s
charged with the strategy for disaster risk prevention and protection of vulnerable populations. In
2006 the Government approved the National Program of Risk Management in Development
Processes 2007-2012. On the basis of this Program, the Government designed the National
Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction 2009-2011 which includes interinstitutional
activities to reduce risk.

Methodology

In formulating the National Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction 2009-2011,
participatory workshops were held, with the intent of engaging various institutions. All the different
actors' points of view were incorporated in the plan, and from this information the objectives of
how to incorporate disaster risk management in development planning was defined. O f note are the
active participation and the incorporation of ideas of different institutions that make up the
CONRED system. The institutions consulted were:

Descriptionof the Program

The National Program for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation in Guatemala aims to articulate
institutional efforts and those o f the private sector in the achievement o f sustainable development,
through initiatives that incorporate disaster risk management in development planning. The
Program has 15 years validity and defines short- and medium-term activities aimed at increasing
the resistance o f the country to natural phenomena. It identifies institutional responsibilities,
provides an approximate budget, and defines development indicators for the next three years. These
indicators will be revisedand updated in2011.

Guatemala is recognized at a regional level for its capacity to respond to emergencies. The goal o f
this Program is to shift the focus o f disaster management from emergency response to disaster
prevention through a comprehensive disaster risk management strategy, based on four areas o f
action: (a) risk identification and monitoring, (b) risk reduction, (c) institutional planning and
strengthening, and (d) development o f a financial strategy.

1. Riskidentificationandmonitoring

The objective o f this area o f action is to strengthen the generation and monitoring o f information on
hazards, vulnerability, and risk. This will provide the country with essential information for
development planning. Specific projects are:


    0   Development and disclosure o f methodologies for the analysis and evaluation o f hazards
         (landslides and floods) and vulnerabilities.
    0   Hazard (landslides and floods), vulnerability, and risk studies for strategic basins and
        priority zones o f the country.
         Construction, enlargement, improvement, and modernization o f seismic, meteorological,
        andhydrological observationnetworks.

2. Risk reduction

This area o f action aims to mitigate existing risks and to prevent new ones. Projects incorporate
mitigation and guaranteeing safe constructions, especially to the health and education sectors.
Projects include:


    0   Development o f building codes
    0   Development o f municipal buildingregulations

    0   Public infrastructure auditing
    0   Works to prevent landslides (retaining walls, slope reinforcements)
    0   Rehabilitationandmaintenance o f road infrastructure
    0   Mitigation works




                                                                                                     51

3. Institutional planning and strengthening

The main objective o f this area o f action i s the incorporation of disaster risk management in
projects and activities related to development, territorial planning, and development o f public
policies. Specific projects include:

       Formulation of a National Risk Management Policy and a National Risk Management
       Strategy
    0  Strengthening of SEGEPLAN planning systems to incorporate disaster risk reduction in
       their implementationandoperational mechanisms
       Formulation of land use, urban, and rural zoning plans that take into account the reduction
       o f disaster risk
       Creation of a roundtable for disaster risk management.

4. Financial strategy

This area o f action includes projects relatedto the identification o f the investment inrisk reduction.
A code that will classify investments inthese fields will be created inorder to estimate the budget
invested in it. The financial cost of disasters and the fiscal risk for Guatemala will be studied.
Projects include:

       Development o f a code to classify and identify budget used indisaster risk reduction
       Analysis of the financial costs o f disasters for Guatemala
       A study to define possible contingent liabilities.

EstimadaSeiiora Cox:

El Gobierno de Guatemala presidido por el lngeniero Alvaro Colom Caballeros, ha fijado
wmo una de sus principales metas promover el desarrollo econornico sostenible y
equitativo que responda a las necesidades de toda la poblacion, per0 en particular las de
aquellos que viven en situacidn de extrema pobreza. En ese sentido, el cornprorniso de la
actual Adrninistracion se centra en avanzar en el cumplirniento de 10s Acuerdos de Paz y
en las metas establecidasdentro de 10s Objetivosdel Milenio.

Con ese proposito, el Gobierno est6 implementando un plan basado en cuatro
programas estrategicos que son: i) Solidaridad; ii) Gobernabilidad; iii) Productividad; y,
iv) Regionalidad.

Dentro del Programa Estrategico de Productividad, el Gobierno para hacer frente a estos
desafios, formulo la Politica de Gestion de Riesgos, Prevenci6n y Atencion a Desastres,
cuyo objetivo es evitar o reducir las perdidas de vidas, asi wmo 10s efectos datiinos que
pueden ocurrir sobre 10s bienes materiales y ambientales de 10s guatemaltecos, como
consecuencia de 10s riesgos existentes que se pueden presentar en el territorio nacional.
Los objetivos basicos de la politica son: a) reducir riesgos y prevenir desastres; b) brindar
respuestaefectiva en cas0 de desastre; y, c) recuperacionpronta de las zonas afectadas.

A traves de la citada Politica, se pretenden crear las condiciones para un desarrollo mas
sostenible, menos vulnerable a 10s efectos de 10s fenomenos de origen natural o hurnano,
cuyo alcance amenace la estabilidad social. Ademas, se pretende evitar vlctirnas hurnanas
rnediante una efectiva gestion de riesgo, prevention y rnitigacion de 10s efectos negativos
del desastre y restituir a la poblacion afectada las condiciones de vivienda y atencion
social, conforme a sus patrones culturales y situ6ndolos en lugares alejados de la
posibilidad de nuevos riesgos.




                                                                                           53

En wnsonancia con lo anterior, el Gobierno de Guatemala, ha formulado el Programa
Nacional de Emergencia y Recuperacion Economica con el objeto de contrarrestar 10s
efectos de la desaceleracion de la economia mundial, el cual dentro de su Politica
Financiera, contempla la gestidn de recursos que permitan al pais hacer frente a
eventuales choques externos. Asimismo, se pretendeacelerar la negociacion de lineas de
cr&ito contingentescon Organism0 Financieros Internacionales,incluyendo 10s programas
de apoyo contra 10s efectos de la crisis puestos a disposicion por el Banco Mundial, Banco
lnterarnericanode Desarrolloy el Fondo Monetario lnternacional.

La estrategia de asistencia acordada entre el Gobierno de la Republicade Guatemala y el
Banco Mundial contempla, entre otros, apoyar la implementaciondel Plan de Gobierno, en
el tema de manejo de riesgos, a traves del otorgamiento de un financiamiento bajo la
Opcion de Desembolso Diferido durante Catastrofes (CAT-DDO), por un monto de
US$85.0 rnillones,que se tiene previstoobtener en el aAo 2009.

Con base en lo anterior, se diseR6 el Programa Nacional de Prevencion y Mitigacion ante
Desastres 2009-2011, con el objeto de fortalecer el proceso de reduccion de desastres y
en coherenciacon el Plan de Gobierno 2008-2012,en el cual se rewnoce la necesidadde
realizar actividades de reduccion y mitigacion, con la participacion y el trabajo coordinado
de la sociedad civil y el sector privado, las institucionesdel Estado y 10s gobiernos locales,
en todos 10s ambitosgeograficos.

Este Programa contiene indicadoresverificablesen un plazo de tres ahos y el desarrollo de
una plataforma institucionalque permitiradar seguimiento y monitoreoa las acciones a ser
desarrolladas.

Asimismo, se enmarca en 10s objetivos estrategicos y acciones prioritarias del Marco de
Accion de Hyogo 2005-2015: "...Velar porque la reducci6n de 10s riesgos de desastre
constituya una prioridad nacional y local dotada de una solida base institucional de
aplicacion". Segun 10s lineamientos establecidos en dicho Marco de Accion, Guatemala
cuenta con una plataforma nacional para la gestion del riesgo, constituida por un marco
legal e institucional que incluye a la Coordinadora Nacional para la Reduccion de
Desastres, el Programa Nacional de Gestion para la Reduccionde Riesgo a Desastres en
10s Procesosde Desarrollo2007-2012, y las instanciasde coordinacionque lo conforman.

Para la     implementacion del citado Programa, se han definido cuatro estrategias:

PamelaCox
Vice Presidentof LatinAmerica andthe CaribbeanRegion

Washington, D.C.

Dear Ms.Cox:

The Government of Guatemala, presidedby Engineer Alvaro Colom Caballeros, has set
as one of his principal goals to advance sustainable and equitable economic development
that addresses the needs of the whole population, but especially of those that live in
extreme poverty. In this sense, the commitment of the current administration is focused
on advancing the completion of the Peace Accords and the aims established in the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

With this objective in mind, the Government is implementing a plan based on four
strategic programs: (i)Solidarity; (ii)Governance; (iii)Productivity; and (iv)
Regionalism.

Within the Productivity strategic program, the government has formulated the Policy for
Disaster Risk Prevention and Response, to tackle these challenges with the objective o f
avoiding or reducing loss of lives, as well as damages that can occur to material and
environmental assets of Guatemalans, as a result of existing risk that can occur in the
national territory. The basic objectives of the policy are: a) to reduce risk and prevent
disasters; b) to provide effective response in the case of a disaster; and c) to rapidly
reconstruct of affected zones.

Through the said Policy, the government aims to create the conditions for a more
sustainabledevelopment, less vulnerable to the effects of phenomenaof natural or human
origin, whose scope threatens social stability. Furthermore it aims to avoid loss of human
life through effective disaster risk management, prevention and mitigation of the negative
effects of disasters and to return the affected population to living conditions, adequate to
their cultural patronageand situating theminplacesthat are not vulnerable to newrisks.

Consistent with what has been said, the Government of Guatemala has formulated a
National Program of Emergency and Economic Reconstruction with the objective of
countering the effects of deceleration of the global economy, through its Financial Policy,
which considers the management of resourcesthat allows the country to face the eventual
external shocks. In this way it aims to accelerate the negotiation of contingent lines of
credit with International Financial Institutions, including those support programs against
the effects of the crisis placed at its disposition by the World Bank, the Inter-America
Development Bank andthe International Monetary Fund.




                                                                                         58

The assistance strategy agreed to betweenthe Government of Guatemala and the World
Bank considers, among other things, support of the implementation of the Government
Plan, in the theme of disaster risk management, through the granting of financing under
the CAT DDO, in an amount of US$85.0 million, which is foreseen to be obtained in
2009.

Considering this context, the Government of Guatemala has designed the National
Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction (2009-201l),          with the objective of
strengthening the process of disaster reduction and in coherence with the Government
Plan 2008-2012, in which it recognizes the necessity to get involved in activities of risk
reduction and prevention, with the participation and the work coordinated by civil society
and the private sector, the institutions of the state and the local government, in all
geographic areas.

This Program has verifiable indictors in a three-year period and the development of an
institutional platform that will permit the following and monitoring of actions to be
developed.

In this way it is part of the strategic goals and actions prioritized in the Hyogo
Framework of Action 2005-2015: "...to ensure that disaster risk reduction constitutes a
national and local priority" According to the lines established in the said Framework o f
Action, Guatemalacounts on a national platform for disaster risk management, consisting
of a legal and institutional framework that includes the National Coordination for the
Reduction of Disasters, and the National Program for Disaster Prevention and Reduction
inthe Development Plan, 2007-2012.

 To implementthe cited Program, four strategies have beendefined:(i)    Identificationand
monitoring of information; (ii)Risk reduction; (iii)Planning and institutional
strengthening; and (iv) Financial strategy, which will be implemented in the following
manner:

I.Identificationandmonitoringofrisk

Consists of projects and activities related to the identification and monitoring of risk,
through the following activities: a) promote the exchange and disclosure of existing
methodologies on the analysis and evaluation of hazards and vulnerability; b) develop
strategic studies that start with the hazard and vulnerability of the most important river
basins inthe country to determine the vulnerability of the population, vital infrastructure
and economic sector; c) create a National Geographic Information System that will
administer and formalize all the geographic information in the country, through a
Geographic Policy.

11.Riskreduction

This strategy allow for the development of normative frameworks related to secure
construction and mitigation projects, as well as activities related to regulation and



                                                                                        59

monitoring of public and private sectoral investments, especially inhealth and education.
The activities consideredinclude the following:

        Elaboration of a National Regulation for Secure Construction, with special
        attention to health and education sectors, which will be communicated to
        municipalities so that they can develop their own Construction Regulations

        Investment in slope stabilization to reduce landslides in certain settlements that
        are prone to this risk, and rehabilitation using secure construction measures.

        Inclusion of the General Accounting Auditor in the process of verification of
        disaster risk management incorporation in public investment, in order to
        strengthenthe auditing of public infrastructure. A convention, which was signed
        recently between the Minister of Public Finance, the Secretary of Planning and
        Programming of the President and the General Accounting Auditor, will be the
        basis for the strengthening o fthe area of infrastructure.


    0   Promotion through the Inter-institutional Coordinator of Slums o f a pilot model
        for settlements with the objective of reducing disaster risk.

        Systemization, through the Ministry of Communication, Infrastructure and
        Housing the information on bridges and roads that are structurally weak and that
        needinvestment to reducetheir vulnerability.


    0   Promote, through the Executive Secretariat of the National Coordinator for Disaster
        Reduction (SE-CONRED), of actions that permit strengthening municipal
        capacity inreducing disaster risk.

111.Planning and municipal strengthening

The strategy consists of SE-CONRED formulating a National Policy of Disaster Risk
Management and a National Disaster Risk Management Strategy, which will involve the
publicandprivate sectors.

It will also strengthen the National System of Planning, to guarantee that development
planning will contribute to the reduction of disaster risk and not to generate more
vulnerability. This strengthening will be carried out inphases throughout the execution o f
the National Program, and will count on the participation of the Development Council.
The first phase will directly involve SEGEPLAN, and will hopefully achieve the
strengtheningof the National System for Integral Territorial Strategic Planning (SINPET-
I); NationalPre-InvestmentSystem(SJNAPRE); andtheNationalsystemofPublic
   the
Investment (SNIP) to infiltrate and operationalize the variable of riskto disasters.

Within the INPET-I framework, SEGEPLAN in coordination with the Development
Council will set in motion departmental and municipal development plans that will
include the variable of risk to disasters. Inthe pre-investment framework and the Public



                                                                                       60

Investment the necessary instruments that incorporate risk will be identified, which
should communicate and incorporatethe SNIP norms.

The Territorial Planning strategy will be elaborated and should incorporate the guidelines
to orient localization o f vital infrastructure and the essential installations in the
municipality, as well as the productive areas with high exposure to hazards. The first
phase o f the project will be implemented inthirteen municipalities, and will fall under the
coordination o f the Ministry o f Environment and Natural Resources, the Secretariat o f
Planning and Programming o f the President and the Municipal Promotion Institute.

IV.Financial strategy

This sphere includes projects related to the identification o f investment that Guatemala
makes indisaster risk management. For this the Ministry will develop an index within the
budget classifier for the disaster risk management theme, which will help identify the
sectoral investment which will be made. A capacity building program for the
Implementing Units o f public institutions is planned, which will grant them the capacity
to report the expenditure related to reductiono f risk.

In addition, a study will be carried out to define the possibilities with respect to
contingent liabilities, which will permit the authorities o f the government to determine
whether it i s necessary to rely on a reserve o f contingent liabilities for disasters. This
study will include themes o f transference o f maximum probable loss risk and o f
insurance structures.

Conclusion

As one can see, the Government o f Guatemala is highly committed to better the disaster
risk management capacity inthe country by: i)improving efficiency and effectiveness of
the response mechanisms to disasters; ii)integrate the principles o f disaster risk
management in all the government institutions and iii)incorporating regulations on
territorial planningas a critical component o f disaster risk management.

Conscious o f the importance o f strengthening its national capacity to manage risk, the
Government o f Guatemala ratifies its request to the World Bank to obtain a reimbursable
financing under the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option C A T DDO, in the amount
o f US$85 million.
