Central America's largest economy,\n            Guatemala is a lower middle income country marked by social\n            indicators that often fall below those of countries with far\n            lower per capita incomes. The situation has been aggravated\n            since 2008 with successive fuel, food, and economic crises\n            as well as several natural disasters including a tropical\n            storm which have put the progress made in the last decade in\n            poverty and inequality reduction and health and education at\n            risk. International Bank Research Development (IBRD) lending\n            and technical programs have supported the country\u2019s efforts\n            to improve the lives of its people. The Bank significantly\n            increased its development policy lending, to support the\n            country in crisis response financing. The health project was\n            executing civil works in twenty nine health clinics to an\n            expected reduction in the ratio of indigenous to\n            non-indigenous infant mortality in the project area by 10\n            percent. The Rural Economic Development Project was\n            providing technical assistance, credit and seed capital to\n            twenty one indigenous producer associations to enhance their\n            productivity and market access. Moreover, a rural roads\n            project was rehabilitating close to 800 kilometers of roads,\n            enhancing access to primary and secondary roads for a rural\n            target population of 600,000. Assistance from the IBRD has\n            focused on inclusive growth, reduction of poverty, and\n            raising net primary school enrollment."}, "docdt": "2010-10-19T07:35:02Z"}
