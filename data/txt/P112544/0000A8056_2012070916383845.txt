                         disasters 2009-2011, approved by the GoG on January 2009. The DPL with a CAT DDO was meant to help reduce the GoG’s fiscal vulnerability in the event of a catastrophic natural
                         event, in line with the Bank’s Catastrophe Risk Financing Framework. The Bank maintained an open dialogue on DRM issues with the country, supporting three key policy areas of
                         Guatemala: (a) Promote Disaster risk management to become a development priority for the Government by its inclusion as a pillar in the National Development Plan 2008-2011; (b)
                         The mandate and obligation to identify and reduce at-risk populations, as defined in the Social Development Law, Decree 42-2001, which provides the legal grounds to implement
                         corrective actions such as investments in disaster risk reduction; and (c) The mandate and obligation to include disaster risk assessments as parameters in land use and
                         infrastructure planning processes, which provide the legal framework for prospective disaster risk management, as defined in the Law of Housing and Human Settlements, Decree
                         120-96.
