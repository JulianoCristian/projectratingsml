                         Few weeks prior to project closing on December 30, 2013, the likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is high. Access to improved water and sewerage
                         services has improved in six cities (Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Orhei, Soroca, and Ungheni) and five villages (Causeni, Floresti, Balti, Cahul, Ungheni, and Orhei). Works are ongoing in
                         five more villages and expected to be completed before project end. The number of people with access to improved water sources is 19,000. Operational efficiency of the six urban

                         utilities has improved through energy savings, reduced unaccounted for water, higher metering rates, and training/capacity building. Quality of water services has improved in all
                         targeted areas. Water supply systems were established in ten villages, of which five have potable water meeting Moldova standards, four are expected to receive potable water by
                         project end, and one has technical water. These villages did not have water supply systems before the project. At project end, all towns have 24 hour water supply. The water
                         treatment system in Cauceni was rehabilitated under the project leading to improved water quality in this town compared to the baseline before the project. Sewerage services

                         improved through rehabilitated pipelines and reduced system breakages. As a result of the project, the capacity of the Ministry of Environment (MoE) in managing the sector has
                         improved (the MOE assumed responsibilities for the water and sanitation sector from MCTD in 2009). In addition to training in project management and financial management
                         provided to the MoE and water utilities, the project supported the development of a Water Geographic Information System (GIS) database. A professional well performing Project
                         Implementation Unit (PIU) in the MoE is expected to be retained and will continue to support the Ministry after project closing.

                         The PIU and MoE are expected to continue intensive monitoring of all remaining activities to ensure timely implementation and satisfactory completion by project closing.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         While progress towards achievement of development objectives and current implementation progress are satisfactory, a few activities under the Rural Component are scheduled to
                         be completed by December 2013, which directly impact the project. In the village of Navirnet, where infrastructure has been financed under the NWSSP, the Government is
                         completing a Water Treatment Plant to ensure the provision of potable water in the village. In the villages of Valeni, Colibasi, and Sarata Noua, corrective measures to improve water

                         quality are underway. The MoE and the PIU are monitoring progress to ensure timely completion of ongoing activities. The Bank team will conduct a final implementation/supervision
                         visit in December 2013 and will review the results of water quality tests before project closing.

                         The Government and the Bank agreed to conduct a project stakeholder workshop in January 2014 to capture lessons learned and encourage experience sharing. Preparation of an
                         Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report has commenced and will be finalized before June 2014.
