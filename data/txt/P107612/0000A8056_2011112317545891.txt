                         The results from the Mid-Term Review confirmed the need to better align the project objectives and targets with the activities to be financed under the project. This will require a

                         completed in two sites (Balti and Floresti), are ongoing in three others (Cahul, Causeni and Ungheni), and the works contract has been signed in September for the last site (Orhei).
                         All the designs for Part 2 (Rehabilitation of Rural Water systems in villages) have been finalized, and works recently started in 2 villages (Sarata Noua and Valeni). The Government
                         has requested to maintain the existing PIU until the closing of the project so the activities to be financed under the institutional strengthening sub-component of Part 3 (Institutional

                         The project will undergo a restructuring process to reflect the needed adjustments to better align the project objectives and targets with the activities to be financed. These changes
                         will be included and formalized in an amendment to the Financing Agreement to be countersigned by the Government (Ministry of Finance) and IDA.
