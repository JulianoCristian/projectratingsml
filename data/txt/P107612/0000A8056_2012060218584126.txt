                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The project restructuring will be processed to reflect the needed adjustments to the project objectives, targets, and scope with the activities to be financed, as requested by the
                         Government of Moldova. The Bank team is reviewing the proposal and will prepare the restructuring package. These changes will be included and formalized in an amendment to the
                         Financing Agreement to be countersigned by the Government (Ministry of Finance) and IDA.

                         Project success and completion by the closing date in June 2013 will require a pro-active approach by the Moldovan counterparts and the PIU to comply with each implementation
                         milestone. Failure to comply with the agreed milestones or the need for further re-biddings would jeopardize timely completion of works that could lead to potential cancellation of the
                         loan proceeds. Regular and timely communication to the Bank on the Project developments is critical. It was agreed that during this period the Project Implementation Unit will
                         regularly update the Bank team through weekly progress updates and regular monthly video-conferences.
