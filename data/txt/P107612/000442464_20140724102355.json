performance was\n            moderately satisfactory.

Structure, staffing, internal\n            organization, reporting lines, decision authority, and\n            performance incentives should be carefully crafted and\n            closely monitored at all times during implementation.\n            Support towards institutional arrangements in rural areas\n            should be based on an agreed strategy.
