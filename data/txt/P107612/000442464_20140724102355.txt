1.       Project Context, Development Objective and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Background. Moldova is a small country with a population of 3.6
million people. It is mostly rural, with around 60 percent of the population living in towns and
villages with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and 20 percent living in the capital Chisinau. Like
many Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, Moldova underwent a series of economic and social
challenges during its transition to a market economy following independence in 1991. The
economy registered a period of steady growth between 2000 and 2008, halving the national
poverty rate from 70 percent to 35 percent, largely fueled by remittances. With a per capita Gross
National Product (GNP) of US$ 1,696, Moldova was still the poorest country in Europe at
appraisal in March 2008.

2.       Moldova inherited most of its water and sanitation infrastructure from the Soviet Union.
Since independence, the quality and reliability of these services deteriorated due to ageing, lack
of investments and under-maintenance. At the time of appraisal, about 45 percent of the existing
infrastructure was in need of rehabilitation. Only 80 percent of urban residents had access to
centralized water supply and 63 percent to sewerage services. Access to services in rural
communities was lower, at 50 and 40 percent respectively. Utilities were financially unviable and
could not support capital investments and routine maintenance while funding from the public
sector was minimal. Utilities operated at a loss due to a combination of factors including outdated
equipment, high physical losses, inefficient operations, low staff productivity, and low tariffs.

3.       Government Strategy. Increasing access to water and sanitation services and improving
the performance of the sector was a high priority for the Government. The key objective of its
strategy adopted in 2005 was to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for water and
sanitation by 20151. It envisaged urgent rehabilitation, technical renewal, and development of
municipal systems across the country. In 2007 the Strategy was updated and investments in the
magnitude of US$65 million per year were prioritized for the period until 20122. The
responsibility for implementing the Strategy was assigned to Apele Moldovei (AM), which in
2008 became part of the Ministry of Construction and Territorial Development (MCTD). Since
the national budget was unable to finance required investments, the Government focused on
attracting external funding. In December 2007, it organized a Donor Coordination Workshop and
presented its Strategy to international partners. This coincided with the aftermath of the 2007
severe drought which devastated more than half of Moldova’s principle crop and left many
villages in the South without access to potable well water. A number of agencies3 expressed
interest in assisting the sector, including IDA. The Government planned to channel all donor

financing through a single executing agency to be established, which was reflected in the original
design of the National Water Supply and Sanitation Project (NWSSP).

4.       Rationale for Bank Assistance. Revitalizing the water and sanitation sector was
identified as a priority in the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period of fiscal
years 2005-09 (FY05-09) and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY09-12.
The second pillar of the CAS aimed to “minimize social and environmental risks, build human
capital and promote social inclusion” with the specific objective to “improve quality of water and
sanitation services”. The CAS envisaged lending assistance in FY08 that would focus on
medium-size towns and villages where the problem with potable drinking water and inadequate
sanitation was most acute. The first pillar of the 2008 CPS aimed to improve economic
competitiveness and support sustainable economic growth. It had the specific goal to “improve
access and quality of water and sanitation services”. The CPS also emphasized that donor
coordination in the sector is critical.

1.2      Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      Original PDO: (i) to improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of
water and sanitation services in selected urban and rural communities; and (ii) enhance the
capacity of MCTD to prepare and supervise the implementation of investment program and to
provide technical assistance to the operating Apa Canals.

6.       Key Outcome Indicators of the project at approval:4

To improve coverage of water and sanitation services in urban communities:
            (1) The share of households connected to a piped water network.
            (2) The share of households connected to a piped sewerage network.
 To improve quality of water and sanitation services in urban communities:
            (3) The number of hours of daily water service.
            (4) The share of water supply samples meeting Moldovan water quality standards.
 To improve the efficiency of water and sanitation services in urban communities:
            (5) The non-revenue water (NRW), i.e. the ratio of (metered and estimated water
                 production) less (metered and estimated water consumption) divided by (meter
                 and estimated water production) (%).
 To improve the financial sustainability of water and sanitation services in urban communities:
            (6) The financial working ratio, i.e. the ratio of cash operating costs (without
                 depreciation)/cash operating revenue.
 To rehabilitate water supply services in selected rural communities:
            (7) The number of rural water supplies that have been rehabilitated.

  Some PDO-level indicators in the main text of the PAD differ from PDO-level indicators in Annex 3: Results Matrix
and also from indicators in the Supplemental Letter to the Financing Agreement and the initial ISR. This ICR uses the
indicators included in the Supplemental Letter to the Financing Agreement which are identical to these in the Results
Matrix Annex of the PAD and the initial ISR.

              (8) No of drinking water samples meeting Moldovan bacteriological standards from
                  participating villages’ water supply systems.
    To enhance the capacity of the line Ministry:
              (9) No of MCTD staff proficient in fiduciary aspects of the project.

1.3   Revised PDO and key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority) and
Reasons/Justification

7.     Revised PDO: to increase access, quality, and operational efficiency of water and
sewerage services in selected areas.

8.        Revised Key Outcome Indicators:

              (1) Number of people provided with access to improved water sources;
              (2) Average electricity consumption (measured in MWh per m3 water produced);
              (3) Annual electricity consumption of sewerage in Orhei in MWh;
              (4) NRW (measured by the ratio of metered water production less metered water
                  consumption to metered production);
              (5) Share of drinking water samples meeting Moldovan standards.

9.      The PDO was revised during level I restructuring approved by the Board on August 10,
2012. The sustainability objective and the second part of the original PDO related to improved
capacity were dropped. The justification included: (i) the need to align the PDO with the project
design (corrective change); and (ii) the Government’s decision to retain the PIU as the NWSSP’s
executing agency instead of having it absorbed within the Ministry of Environment (MoE)5 to
become a hub for all donor investments in the sector (adaptive change).

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

10.      The main beneficiaries would be residents of seven towns6 and fifty villages to benefit
from improved service coverage and quality (Components 1 and 2). The MCTD would receive
technical assistance and benefit from enhanced capacity in the preparation and supervision of
sector activities (Component 3). Seven water utilities7 would benefit from energy audits as well
as associated works and equipment (Component 4). Following restructuring, the number of urban
and rural areas benefiting under the project was reduced to six and ten respectively8. The scope of
the originally planned capacity building to MoE9 was reduced. The beneficiaries under the energy
efficiency component remained unchanged. By project end, the number of beneficiaries directly

  The water utility in Soroca was excluded from the project. The ten beneficiary villages included Bestemac, Colibasi,
Dubasarii Vechi, Navirnet, Pirita, Sanatauca, Sarata Noua, Valeni, Zahorna and originally Pohrebeni. Because the
reservoir at Pohrebeni was located on private land and this could not be resolved within the project’s framework,
during implementation Pohrebeni was substituted with the village of Recesti.

impacted by the project through improved access to water sources was more than 22,300
(exceeding the PDO-level indicator).

1.5      Original and Revised Components

11.       Four components were approved originally. At restructuring in August 2012, the
components were revised as follows: (i) The scope of activities in each participating village was
expanded in order to maximize the impact of the investment, while at the same time the number
of participating villages was reduced (to ten). Under the expanded scope of activities, household
connections were added in addition to improvements of the water source ; (ii) the town of Soroca
was excluded from the Project due to the cancellation of the complementary GEF financing10; and
(iii) activities under Component 3 were modified following the Government’s decision to retain
the PIU. The original and revised components are presented below.

1.6      Other Significant Changes

12.      Project Restructuring. The project was restructured four times. Three of the
restructurings were level II and one was level I.

13.      Level II restructuring (April 2009) changed the implementation agency from MCTD to
Agency Apele Moldovei as the statutory agency responsible for the water supply and sanitation
sector11.

11
   Apele Moldovei was established in August 2007 with the key responsibility to implement the Government Strategy
in the water and sanitation sector. In December 2007, the PIU under the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(PWSSP) was transferred intact from the Agency for Construction and Territorial Development to Agency Apele
Moldovei. In March 2008, the Ministry of Construction and Territorial Development (MCTD) was established, Apele

                                                       5
14.      Level II restructuring (March 2011): (i) changed the implementation agency from
Agency Apele Moldovei to MoE; subsequently, the PIU was subordinated to MoE that became
the main recipient of capacity building under Component 3; (ii) eliminated one of the legal
covenants under the Financing Agreement12 requiring utilities to maintain a debt service ratio of
1.3; the covenant was considered overly restrictive for utilities and inconsistent with their
financial situation since it limited their ability to leverage investments for system rehabilitation;
and (iii) included a definition of incremental operating cost.

15.       Level I restructuring (August 2012) revised the PDO, the project components, the results
indicators and removed the remaining legal covenant related to the financial performance of
utilities13. Changes to the PDO, the project components and PDO level indicators are discussed in
Sections 1.3 and 1.4 above. The intermediary results indicators were revised as presented in the
table below. The legal covenant requiring utilities to maintain a cash operating cost to revenue
ratio below 90% was removed. The covenant was considered unrealistic since, in the absence of
effective regulation and enforcement mechanisms to complement a possible tariff increase, water
utilities would not be able to maintain such ratio.

Moldovei was abolished and its responsibility transferred to MCTD. In September 2008, Agency Apele Modovei was
reestablished as the statutory agency responsible for the water supply and sanitation sector in Moldova. In March 2009,
the implementing agency was moved from the MCTD to Apele Moldovei. Later, in December 2009, the PIU was
moved under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, which later became the Ministry Environment
(MoE). The reporting line of the PIU was directly to the Minister of MoE.

16.      Level II restructuring (May 2013) extended the Closing date with six months from June
30, 2013 to December 30, 2013. The extension was needed to (i) complete water system
rehabilitation works in one village (Component 2); (ii) undertake corrective measures to bring
water quality to standard in three villages (Component 2); and (iii) deliver water Geographic
Information System (GIS) for sector institutions and conduct training of MoE and utilities staff
(Component 3).

17.      Reallocation of Credit Proceeds. Credit proceeds were reallocated at the time of level I
restructuring to reflect the exclusion of the town of Soroca from Component 1 and the
transferring of the respective amount from Category 1 to the Category 2, as presented below.

18.       Changes to legal covenants. Both legal covenants in the original Financing Agreement
were removed. As discussed above, the legal covenant related to the debt service ratio of water
utilities was eliminated during level II restructuring (March 2011). The legal covenant related to
the working ratio (cash operating costs to cash operating revenues) of the water utilities was
removed during the level I restructuring of August 2012.

19.     Closing date. The Closing date was extended with 6 months to December 30, 2013 (see
paragraph 16).


2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

20.     Soundness of the background analysis and lessons learned. The NWSSP was a second
generation project following the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project (PWSSP)14 that closed
in June 2008 with a satisfactory outcome rating. The PWSSP supported targeted investments and
provided capacity building to selected water utilities. The objectives, components, results
indicators, and implementation arrangements of the NWSSP were similar to those under the
PWSSP. The NWSSP took into consideration some lessons learned under the pilot project and
secured strong client involvement in the prioritization of investments. The PIU that had

   In 2003, the World Bank approved a US$12 million IDA Credit for the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project
targeting the cities of Balti, Cahul, Orhei, Soroca, and Stefan Voda.

                                                       7
successfully implemented the pilot project was designated to implement the NWSSP. Established
capacity was therefore retained and continuity was ensured.

21.      Despite being a second generation project, the NWSSP’s PAD did not present a
comprehensive analysis of the sector. In fact, the PAD does not offer any significant assessment
of the legal, institutional, regulatory, financial or operational environment, whether the prevailing
sector environment would support the achievement of the PDO, or whether the Government
needed assistance to improve it. A quick review of the PWSSP PAD by the ICR team reveals that
this project, despite being a pilot, offered a substantive presentation on issues like sector
fragmentation, regulation, cost recovery, affordability and willingness to pay. The ICR team
could not identify a comprehensive analysis of sector issues that had informed the preparation of
the NWSSP. The NWSSP is structured as an isolated investment operation despite one of its
objectives to enhance sustainability. As a second project in the sector, the NWSSP could have
built upon available knowledge and engaged the Client in a substantive policy dialogue. Not
doing this was a missed opportunity.

22.     Assessment of project design. Project design supported the achievement of the PDO in
terms of coverage, quality, and efficiency of water and sanitation services. These objectives were
supported by project activities and aligned with the results indicators. The sustainability
objective, on the other hand, was not sufficiently supported by design. Improving sustainability
would have required policy reforms and changes in the institutional and regulatory environment.
Possible activities could have been related to a tariff reform, setting an independent regulator
(which is in process at the time of the ICR), assistance to improve the institutional environment
especially the relationship between utilities and municipalities and reduce political interference,
review of the financial and commercial performance of participating utilities and assistance with
improvement plans, assistance with improved management, professionalization and increased
productivity of utilities, and institutional support for service providers. The project did not
support such efforts (except for staff training on billings and collections). It focused only on
reduction of technical losses and energy efficiency as means to improve sustainability.

23.       The disconnect between the sustainability objective and proposed activities was
recognized at the time of preparation. First, the Project Concept Review in July 2007
recommended that a thorough assessment of issues and lessons from the PWSSP in each
municipality analyzes the level of recovery of operations and maintenance costs as well as tariff
and subsidy levels. This was said to serve as a basis to inform the need for new legislation in
tariff setting and other regulatory matters, including the need for an independent regulator.
Second, the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) recommended that the PAD be explicit about
the Government’s readiness to increase tariffs and discuss the readiness of the population and
local institutions to do so. These recommendations were not addressed to a satisfactory level in
the final project design. A review of the decision meeting documentation prior to appraisal
reveals that the requirement that utilities increase tariffs prior to receiving project funds was
introduced hastily as a result of discussions during the decision meeting. The final PAD envisages
tariff increase in the magnitude of 25 percent and comments that such increase remains within the
affordability level. During implementation, tariffs were initially increased but soon after that

                                                 8
reduced under social pressure. Two financing ratios (utility debt service and cash revenue to
expenditure ratio) added as legal covenants were intended to motivate participating utilities to
establish stringent controls and improve their financial position. In reality, the covenants proved
ineffective. Most utilities could not meet the ratios during implementation.

24.      Project design supported the objective to enhance the capacity of the line Ministry
through trainings, advisory services and implementation support, as required, throughout the life
of the project. Indirectly, the Project intended to assist the Government in leveraging parallel
financing from other institutions by providing sector information and sharing studies with
potential financiers (EU, EIB, the ADC, Sida, etc.). The intention was that, prior to project
closing, the PIU would be absorbed by the Ministry and become a conduit for all donor financing
in the sector. During implementation, the Government abandoned this objective and made plans
to preserve the PIU for purposes of implementing the NWSSP alone till project end.
Consequently, the capacity objective was dropped from the PDO since the project would not
contribute directly to strengthen the capacity of MoE to prepare and supervise investment
projects. The design of the revised at restructuring Component 3 was aligned with the results
indicators and the agenda of the Government at that time.

25.      Assessment of risks and mitigation. Three risks and their mitigation were identified at
the project preparation stage. These included (i) the public being unable or unwilling to pay for
service; (ii) limited human and financial resources of water utilities to adequately operate or
maintain the system; and (iii) capacity to implement the project. The overall risk rating was
assessed as Moderate. A related but additional risk that materialized and was not identified at
appraisal was the lack of political will among municipal authorities to raise tariffs. With the
exception of implementation capacity, none of the identified risks was sufficiently mitigated. In
fact, as early as January 2009 (one month after Effectiveness), the Government requested that the
terms and conditions of the subsidiary agreements with the water utilities are changed to grant
terms in order to provide sufficient resources to water utilities to meet their operational expenses.
The Bank disagreed with the request stating that “repayment of part of the investment by the
water utilities aims at improving their financial sustainability by enhancing their capacity to
collect tariffs and manage their finances [more efficiently]”. The risk related to tariff increase
was also not mitigated properly as discussed in earlier sections.

26.     Adequacy of Government’s commitment. The government was committed to the
objectives in its Strategy and meeting the targets of the MDGs for water and sanitation. However,
this commitment fell short in terms of supporting socially unpopular measures related to tariff
adjustments to cost recovery levels.

2.2     Implementation

27.     Project restructuring. The project was restructured four times as discussed in Section
1.5 above. Three of the restructurings were level II and one was level I. The level I restructuring
introduced changes to the PDO, project components, results indicators, and removed the



                                                 9
remaining legal covenant related to the financial performance of water utilities. The restructuring
was necessitated by shortcomings in the original project design.

28.      Midterm review (MTR). MTR took place in September 2011, two months later than
originally planned. At that time, only US$ 4.7 million or 33 percent of the total credit amount was
disbursed and the project was in breach of the Financing Agreement on two accounts: (i) as per
Schedule 2, Section I.A.1(c), the PIU had to be abolished and absorbed into the line Ministry by
no later than 30 June 2011; (ii) only two of the seven participating utilities (Cahul and Causeni)
were in compliance with the conditions specified in Schedule 2, Section V.1(a) requiring utilities
to maintain an operating ratio at or below 90 percent. The MTR concluded that the PDO is
unlikely to be achieved with the resources available and made the following recommendations:
(i) that the PDO is revised to include less ambitious objectives which are supported by project
activities and align the project’s targets and indicators; (ii) that the second part of the PDO is
revised, if the Government decides to keep the existing PIU; (iii) to reduce the number of villages
benefiting under Component 2 and focus on communities where cost estimated are already
completed and the communities are committed to having adequate tariffs, operation and
maintenance in place; (iv) to include, under Component 2, a stronger social component and
training to communities; (v) to reallocate funds under Component 1 (in reference to funds
originally assigned to Soroca), under Component 2 (in reference to the selection of villages to
benefit under the project), under Component 3 (to reflect changes in the implementation
arrangements where the PIU remains intact by project end), and under Component 4 (in reference
to the remaining funds after the completion of the energy audit). The recommendations of the
MTR were incorporated in the restructured project design and during implementation.

29.       Factors that contributed to successful implementation.

         The single most critical factor that made possible the successful achievement of the PDO
          despite implementation delays and difficulties in the early phases of the project was the
          appointment of an excellent PIU following restructuring. Staffed with professionals with
          excellent skills, dedication, integrity, capacity and willingness to deliver, the PIU
          managed to turn around this project in less than 1.5 years and successfully deliver the
          revised PDO. The subsequent decision of the MoE to incorporate the PIU into the
          Ministry to manage multi donor implementation helped accomplish the initial objective
          of the PDO to prepare and supervise the implementation of investment programs and TA.

         The second critical factor that contributed to successful implementation was the proactive
          supervision of the Bank’s team and the excellent relationship established between the
          Bank, the MoE, and the PIU following restructuring. Initial delays and the significant
          disbursement lag were caught up and only a six month extension of closing date was
          required.
         The Government and the Client were proactive during implementation. After recognizing
          that the original PDO could not be achieved with activities and resources planned under
          the project, it was recommended that the PDO needs to be amended or additional
          resources need to be added to the project. The decision to restructure the project and align

                                                  10
            the PDO, activities and results indicator increased the likelihood of achieving project
            objectives.
           The Bank showed flexibility when Government priorities changed with regards to
            investments under the rural component (see Section 3.1), and agreed to reduce the
            number of beneficiary villages but increase the scope of the investment in each
            participating village.

30.         Factors that gave rise to problems in implementation.

           Frequent institutional changes in the early stages of the project disrupted the PIU’s
            operations and delayed implementation (see footnote 11). In 2009, during a period of
            political instability and several election processes15, the position of the PIU Director was
            vacant for months causing lack of progress and significant delays.
           Perhaps the single most critical factor that gave rise to problems in implementation
            related to conflicts between MoE and the PIU in the period prior to restructuring. This
            had a profound effect on the ability of the PIU to fulfill its functions. Delays were
            accumulated and the project suffered multiple setbacks. The situation improved
            drastically following the change of the PIU Director and restructuring.
           The GEF grant that was going to finance a wastewater treatment plant in Soroca was
            cancelled in 2010 due to opposition by villagers and the legal status of ownership of the
            land plot assigned for the construction of facilities. The complimentary investments in
            sewerage network planned under the NWSSP were therefore cancelled and corresponding
            credit proceeds were reallocated during the restructuring in August 2012.
           Multiple flaws in technical designs, especially for rural investments, caused
            implementation delays. Delays were caused also within Component 1. Initially
            investments were chosen without a prior strategic assessment of utility
            investment/rehabilitation needs. In some instances, a new prioritization of investment had
            to be carried out causing implementation delays.

2.3         Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, Utilization

31.      M&E Design. The sustainability part of the PDO was not supported by specific
activities and the indicators related to financial ratios could not be achieved. The rest of the PDO,
project activities and performance indicators were aligned, and indicators adequately captured
progress under respective components and activities. Baseline values were determined at
appraisal for both PDO and intermediate indicators. By 2009 however some of them became
obsolete and had to be revised (see below). The PAD did not make specific provisions how the
M&E data will be collected except stating that this would be done by MCTD. The positions at the
PIU did not include and M&E officer.

32.     M&E Implementation and Utilization. By 2009, many of the baseline values of the
project outcome indicators were not any more accurate. Some indicators showed better values

15
     Two local elections, three parliamentary elections, and one referendum took place within the course of the project.

                                                             11
than the targets without any actual work being performed. Actual values were therefore
recalculated based on current conditions at the time of restructuring. Data was collected
throughout the life of the project based on submissions from individual utilities and participating
villages. An M&E officer joined the PIU in 2011. Reporting by the PIU was regular (quarterly)
and of an adequate quality. The water GIS established under the project was recognized as an
important management tool. It is publicly accessible and facilitates the work of Government and
other donors in the sector.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.       Environmental and social safeguards. The project triggered OP 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment), OP 7.50 (Projects on International Waterways), and OP 4.11 (Cultural Property)
and was classified as category B. OP 4.11 was triggered at project design in case that construction
was going to take place near historic buildings or other physical cultural resources. There were no
such cases during implementation so compliance is not assessed for OP 4.11. OP 7.50 was
triggered although the project investments dealt only with rehabilitation and improvement of
existing water supply and wastewater schemes and could not change the volume of
extraction/discharge water or quality of water of two international waterways, the Nistru and Prut
Rivers. Given the rehabilitation nature of the implemented activities, the project was subject to an
exemption to the notification requirement under paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy and obtained it
from the ECAVP before project appraisal (on March 10, 2008). Mitigation activities within OP
4.01 were included in specific Environmental Mitigation Plans (EMPs) for the selected towns and
these were embedded in respective bidding documents. A separate EMP was prepared to reflect
mitigation and monitoring aspects for the rural investments under Component 2. Throughout the
life of the project, implementation of EMP measures remained satisfactory.

34.     In 2012, water quality tests failed to meet national potable standards in five villages
(Valeni, Colibasi, Sarata Noua, Navirnet and Bestemac). The issue was addressed in consultations
with the Ministry of Environment and the Moldova National Center for Public Health. Corrective
measures were introduced in four of the villages. In the fifth village – Bestemac, a technical
solution could not be found and only technical water was made available to the population. A
broad public awareness campaign was initiated to avoid any public health risks in this village. At
the time of the ICR, water quality in Valeni and Colibasi met fully national quality standards.
Water quality in Sarata Noua was nearly in compliance with national standards and expected to
be fully compliant by May/June 2014 following remaining minor technical adjustments. In
Navirnet, the project brought improvements to the water source and the water distribution
network. The water quality at source meets standards but by the time it reaches households, some
quality parameters deteriorate due to issues with the water main under rehabilitation with
Government funds. Works on the water main were delayed due to funding issues. At the time of
the ICR, the Government has confirmed the remaining funding of USD 1 million for the
remaining few kilometers water main expected to be rehabilitated by July 2014.




                                                12
35.     Fiduciary Compliance. Two cases16 were brought to the attention of INT. No other
major fiduciary issues were identified during implementation.

36.     Financial Management (FM). The FM risk at project appraisal was rated high before
mitigation measures and substantial following agreed mitigation. FM remained in the satisfactory
range throughout the life of the project and was carried in accordance with project design and the
Legal Agreement. The project was in compliance with FM covenants (timely submission of IFRs
and annual audit reports, the FM Department was adequately staffed). The FM systems including
budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow, auditing and reporting were also satisfactory
and acceptable to the Bank’s financial management requirements. Annual project audits were
carried out and received in a timely manner and contained unqualified audit opinion on the
project financial statements. Audit qualifications were present for the audit of the financial
statements of the water utilities which were also audited as per the provisions of the legal
agreement. Targeted FM training of utilities in 2011 focused on selected areas of concern.
Nevertheless, their audits remained problematic until project end. Audits of project accounts were
unqualified throughout project’s life.

37.      Procurement. The Procurement risk was rated high at appraisal. Adequate mitigation
measures were put in place and procurement remained in the satisfactory range throughout the
life of the project. The latest ISR rated Procurement as Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the
capacity of the PIU to implement procurement activities was satisfactory despite that the
Procurement position in the PIU was vacant at certain occasions during the life of the project. The
various procurement reviews performed by the Bank (post reviews, mission reviews and MTR)
confirm compliance with the Bank’s procurement guidelines.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.      At the time of the ICR, the Bank finalized a Water Sector Regionalization Review
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). It advocates the regionalization of water and sewerage
services in Moldova as a means of improving the performance of the sector. Regionalization is
expected to foster economies of scale by pooling of capacities, means and resources, increased
equity of access to services, and improved access to funds and to private sector participation. A
road-map that spans over 10 years and acknowledges key challenges is also proposed. The
Government has endorsed the recommendations of the review. It is expected to facilitate future
policy dialogue with the Government and contribute to sustaining benefits achieved under
NWSSP. In addition, analytical work is being planned under Moldova’s CPS on integrated water
resource management. As a next step, the Government has recommended investments in
sanitation/sewerage network for villages that now have access to water supply. Whereas the cost
efficiency and feasibility of such investments needs to be studied on a case by case basis,
preliminary evidence suggests that servicing septic tanks is uneconomical for users who, during
the beneficiary workshops, expressed strong preference for follow-up to NWSSP investments to
develop sanitation network capacity.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation

39.     Relevance of Original Objective. The original PDO was relevant to conditions in
Moldova at the time of appraisal and remains consistent with current development priorities. The
original PDO was ambitious given available resources and the readiness of the Government to
undertake difficult policy reforms required to achieve sustainability of utility providers. At
appraisal, the PDO was aligned with the country’s National Development Strategy (NDS) for the
period 2008-11 as well as the Bank’s CAS for the period FY05-08. At the time of the ICR, the
PDO is consistent with current Government priorities as evidenced by: (i) the updated Water
Sector Development Strategy; (ii) the Government's commitment to meet the Millennium
Development Goals; and (iii) the planned alignment with EU environmental regulations in the
water and sanitation sector as provisioned by Moldova’s agenda to harmonize its standards with
EU. The relevance of the original PDO is therefore assessed as substantial.

40.      Relevance of Revised Objective. The revised PDO is similar to the first part of the
original PDO but excludes the sustainability objective. The revised PDO eliminated the second
part of the original PDO related to capacity of MoE. The new objectives remain relevant, though
narrower in scope, to conditions in Moldova at the time of the ICR. The relevance of the revised
PDO therefore remains substantial.

41.     Relevance of Original Design and Implementation. Planned project activities did not
support the achievement of the sustainability objective of the PDO. Project activities did not
include policy dialogue, assistance with tariff reform, regulation or improved management and
performance of utilities. Consequently, the PDO results indicator related to the financial working
ratio could not be achieved, and utilities could not comply with the financial legal covenant on
debt service ratio. The remaining objectives of the project were adequately supported by project
design and implementation. The overall relevance of design and implementation is assessed as
modest.

42.      Relevance of Revised Design and Implementation. Following restructuring, the project
became a linear physical infrastructure investment seeking to improve efficiency, coverage and
quality of service through physical investments. Since the institutional strengthening approach
changed, Component 3 focused primarily on support for project implementation and some
capacity building in fiduciary responsibilities and sector/project management. The scope of the
rural component was also revised. While the original design was undertaken in response to
drought and aimed to rehabilitate the water source of some 50 villages, by the time of
restructuring the Government had managed to overcome the immediate impact of the drought. On
its request, the focus of the rural component was changed and it now sought to achieve greater
impact in a lesser number villages (10) by building water distribution system and allowing
individual connections. In addition to households, public institutions such as day care facilities,
schools, health facilities and some administrative offices were connected to the water supply

                                                14
networks. As such, the scope of the rural component increased substantially.. The revised results
framework was aligned with the new project objective, activities and implementation
arrangements. The relevance of revised design and implementation is therefore substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

43.      Original PDO. Achievements against the original PDO are substantial in terms of
coverage, quality and efficiency of water and sanitation services in selected urban and rural
communities. The objective under the original PDO relating to sustainability was not fully
achieved as demonstrated in the failure to achieve the original PDO indicator related to the
financial working ratio of utilities and the fact that nearly all utilities failed to sustain the
determined debt ratio. The sustainability of services objective was addressed only through
improved operational efficiency, i.e. reduced unaccounted for water, improved metering and
billing, and energy efficiency. Achieving financial sustainability through tariff reform was not
supported under the project neither improved management or broader sector performance.
Achievements related to the improved capacity of the MoE to prepare and supervise the
implementation of investment programs and to provide technical assistance to water utilities were
modest. Activities included training of MoE and water utility staff in the areas of project
management and the establishment of a water GIS. The WGIS is publicly available and
accessible through the MoE Website (www.gis.mediu.gov.md) and is acknowledged as an
important management tool. The GIS technical platform enables instant data exchange between
all existing geographical information systems. The Ministry has plans to assign staff and make
institutional arrangements for maintenance of the GIS. At project end, given that the PIU has
evolved into an excellently performing unit, MoE has decided to retain and integrate the PIU
within the Ministry structures, to serve as a single conduit for financing in the sector. Overall
achievements against the original PDO are therefore assessed as modest.

44.      Revised PDO. The revised PDO was achieved in full as demonstrated by the PDO-level
and intermediate level results indicators which are well aligned to measure the development
objective. Under Component 1, all sub-projects in all towns were completed satisfactory. For all
towns combined, the PDO and intermediate results targets, set at restructuring, have either been
met or exceeded. In Balti, results exceeded all targets; in Cahul, four results exceeded targets and
one was below target with 8 percent; in Orhei, the target was surpassed; in Causeni, all six results
were achieved, four of which exceeded targets; in Floresti all six results were achieved; three of
which exceeded their targets; in Ungheni all six results were achieved, five of which exceeded
targets. Under Component 2, all sub-projects in all towns have been completed satisfactory. For
all villages combined, the new connections target was achieved at 93%. Results exceeded targets
in Colibasi, Dubasarii, Sarata Noua, Valeni; in Bestemac and Pirita more people were provided
with connections than planned; in Navirnet, Sanatauca and Zahorna two targets were not met at
the time of the ICR but connections have been increasing weekly as people continue to connect to
the system which was finalized at the latter stages of the project. Under Component 3, all capacity
building activities identified at restructuring have been delivered satisfactory and the intermediate
indicator target has been exceeded. Under Component 4, all activities have also been completed
satisfactory. Targeted energy savings (measured by average electricity consumption in MWh per

                                                 15
cum produced) have been met or exceeded in Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Orhei (sewerage system),
Floresti, and Ungheni.

45.     Specific achievements against the PDO are as follow: Coverage of water and sanitation
services improved:
             59.14 km of water supply network was rehabilitated in participating towns, and
                149.55 km of water supply network was constructed in participating villages.
                These villages did not have water supply networks before the project.
             8252 water connections were rehabilitated in towns exceeding the intermediate
                results indicator target.
             1228 new connections were established in towns and 3649 in villages, or a total
                of 4877 new connections under the project as of the time of ICR preparation.
                This number is 96 percent of target but is increasing daily as more people in the
                villages connect to the distribution network. The target is expected to be
                exceeded within the next few months.
             The new connections include mostly households but also public offices and
                facilities such as kinder gardens, public facilities, administrative offices,
                gymnasiums. Received feedback (during the beneficiary workshop with village
                representatives as well as during site visits of the ICR team) points at significant
                impact of the investments made in villages. Beneficiaries indicated that young
                families are relocating to their villages for the first time in a decade since piped
                water is now available. Village representatives expect that improved water
                supply will benefit small local businesses and lead to more local investments and
                more new settlers,
             7.67 km of sewerage pipeline was rehabilitated in two towns and a sewerage
                pressure collector was constructed in Orhei. The length of
                rehabilitated/constructed sewerage pipelines exceeds the intermediate result
                indicator target.
             Number of people provided with new household water connection was 22,305,
                exceeding the PDO performance indicator target. In addition, there were 7,759
                additional beneficiaries in villages, and 298,100 beneficiaries in towns.
             Deep wells, pumping stations, water towers were also rehabilitated or constructed
                in the targeted villages and their numbers and location is presented in Annex 2.

Quality of service improved in all areas targeted under the project in terms of quality of supplied
water, hours of service provision, access to water supply, and installation of meters (see table). In
Causeni, 92 percent of water samples met Moldova standards prior to the project. At completion,
100 percent of samples met national standards as a result of project interventions. In other
participating towns, 100 percent of water samples met Moldova standards at completion though
this could not be attributed directly to investments under NWSSP. Service delivery hours
increased to 24h/day in both Causeni and Cahul due to project interventions. Cahul had 19h/day
supply and Causeni had 15h/day supply prior to the project. Several outer areas supplied by the
Floresti and Ungheni utilities also increased their supply to 24h/day as a result of the project.
Balti had 24h/day water supply prior to the project so no change is reported for this utility. Water

                                                 16
supply systems were established in ten villages, of which nine have potable water and one –
technical water (see also section 2.4). These villages did not have water systems before the
project and relied on shallow wells with poor quality (high levels of nitrates, iron, bacteriological
contamination, etc). Other investments in villages included water treatment solutions, disinfection
station, and bactericide installations.

46.    Operational efficiency of the six urban utilities has improved through energy savings,
reduced unaccounted for water, higher metering rates, and training/capacity building.
            Three water and two waste pumping stations were rehabilitated in Ungheni,
               Orhei and Causeni; two water pumps and one sludge pump were supplied and
               installed in Cahul; the water treatment plant in Ungheni was rehabilitated;
               SCADA system was supplied for Floresti and Cahul; 6460 water meters were
               procured and installed.
            As a result of project interventions, average electricity consumption (MWh per
               cum produced) in each of the targeted towns declined more than the PDO-level
               target indicator. On average, electricity consumption declined 17%, and as much
               as 36% in Floresti. In Orhei, the annual electricity consumption of the sewer
               system was reduced with 34%, exceeding the PDO-level indicator target.
            Non-revenue water declined in each of the towns and exceeded the PDO-level
               indicator target for each of the participating towns (Balti: 44 percent surpassing
               target of 52 percent; Cahul: 43 percent surpassing target of 47 percent; Causeni:
               43 percent surpassing target of 50 percent; Floresti: 50 percent in line with target;
               Ungheni: 36 percent surpassing target of 40 percent). Overall achievements
               against the revised PDO are therefore assessed as substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

47.      The economic analysis applies the cost-benefit methodology to assess the project's
effectiveness. It evaluates the economic efficiency of the project by estimating the present value
of incurred costs and projected benefits, and by calculating the internal rate of return of the sub-

                                                                   17
projects. The key determinant of the cost-benefit analysis results is the magnitude of the assumed
and estimated future benefits that are likely to result from project implementation. The
assumptions that underlie these estimates were made conservatively in order not to overestimate
the potential future benefits. The economic analysis estimates the effectiveness of Component 1,
2, and 4 of the project. The nature of component 3 (Capacity Building and Project Management)
makes it difficult to identify and quantify the specific economic impacts and benefits of
investments and is therefore excluded from the analysis.

48.      The quantifiable economic benefits estimated and included in Component 1 evaluation
include the value of reduced water system losses; the value of the fixed system capacity
investments recovered as a result of additional customer connections; the value of water
consumption savings that resulted from increase in metered connections; and the value of
customers' health, productivity, and time saving improvements that result from improved access
to more efficient water and wastewater services. Component 2 benefits also include the value of
utility system investment recovery and health, productivity and time saving benefits to the target
population. Component 4 benefit estimates are limited to the value of reduced electricity
consumption that resulted from the investments made under this component. Estimated internal
rates of return are 22.55 percent for Component 1, 10.65 percent for Component 2, and of 38.81
percent for Component 4. At 10 percent assumed opportunity cost of capital, all three
components have positive net present values at about US$6.0 million, US$139.0 thousand, and
US$1.78 million respectively. The cost benefit ratios are 2.11, 1.05, and 3.75 respectively. A
more detailed discussion of the actual costs, benefits, and the assumptions made as well as the
analysis results is presented in Annex 3. The results of the analysis suggest that investments in all
three Components reviewed are likely efficient and justified, and the efficiency is rated
substantial.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

51.      The project leveraged additional investments from development partners and government
resources (the National Ecological Fund and local governments). This expanded the impact
beyond the original scope and benefitted urban and rural systems. The project successfully co-
financed the Waste Water Treatment Plant in Orhei (main financing came from EU-financed and
Bank managed trust fund), the first constructed wetlands in Moldova and the largest in Europe. It
also contributed to building sector capacity through: (i) providing analytical base for energy
efficiency investment planning as well as showcasing impacts of energy efficiency investments,
and (ii) delivering a water GIS database as a tool for management and planning.


4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

52.      The risk to developmental objective is substantial due to a substantial risk related to the
ability of villages to finance maintenance of rehabilitated or newly developed assets, and a
moderate risk related to investments benefiting utilities under Components 1 and 4. The project
improved the efficiency of operations (by reducing non-revenue water and improving the energy
efficiency) of participating utilities and the risk to sustaining these achievements and the
development outcome (through maintenance of newly acquired or rehabilitated assets) is little. In
villages, institutional arrangements to manage newly built water systems did not exist, therefore
technical assistance and information was provided under the project to local councils, mayors,
and community representatives on models of institutional organization of rural water supply, on
planning and operating water systems, and community awareness. As potable water is a new
service for most villages, no single management model exists and villages are inexperienced in
the management and maintenance of networks. This risk is partially mitigated through an
informal agreement between the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the MoE,
to provide information on management of water systems to villages which participated in the
NWSSP, after project closing. More generally, the recently finalized ESW on Water Sector
Regionalization supports the policy dialogue in the sector on issues related to longer-term
sustainability and management of the large number of utilities in the sector. Its recommendations
to amalgamate small service providers have the objective to improve performance, efficiency,
capacity, as well as sustainability in the sector.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

53.      Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry. The project was consistent with the
Government’s development priorities and the Bank’s CAS and CPS under preparation.
Safeguards and fiduciary mitigation measures were appropriately designed, were consistent with
the Bank’s fiduciary role and ensured smooth project implementation. The Bank team facilitated
the preparation and appraisal of the project such that it was likely to achieve the planned outcome
in terms of improved coverage, quality, efficiency of water and sanitation services and enhanced
capacity of the MoE. Activities planned under the project did not support the achievement of the
sustainability part of the PDO. This particular objective was ambitious given available resources,
the Government’s readiness for reform, and the lack of a sound background analysis to underpin
project design. Despite being a second generation project, lessons learned from the pilot project
were not fully taken into consideration. The last project audit of the PWSSP reveals that
participating utilities in the PWSSP were not compliant with set financial ratios within that
project. Still, the exact same financial ratios were used in the NWSSP. Important risks related to
the financial capacity of utilities to operate and maintain their systems, and the political will
towards tariff reform were not well mitigated. The Bank performance in the identification,
preparation, and appraisal of the project is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory.

54.      Quality of Supervision. The Bank performed its fiduciary role satisfactory, and ensured
the Client is compliant with safeguards policies. It proactively identified that the sustainability
part of the PDO is unlikely to be achieved. It advised the Client accordingly and recommended
project restructuring but managed to process the restructuring only in 2012, two years after
recognizing that the original PDO could not be achieved. By the time of restructuring, more than
50 percent of credit proceeds were disbursed against a PDO that was not fully supported by
project design or commensurate with Government’s ambition for reforms. Difficulties in the
communication between the Bank and the PIU also contributed to delays in implementation.
Following restructuring supervision intensified. Given earlier accumulated delays, the Bank
initiated a hands-on approach for guiding implementation. An effective communication channel
was established between the TTL, the PIU and MoE. Frequent missions, technical visits and
continuous communication resulted in rapid improvement of implementation and project’s
performance. Earlier delays under the rural, institutional and energy efficiency components were
expeditiously caught up, disbursements picked up, and the IP and PDO ISR ratings transitioned to
the satisfactory range. The Bank performance during implementation is therefore rated
moderately satisfactory.

55.      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Given the overall outcome
rating for the project, the overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

56.      Government Performance. During the early stages of the project, multiple changes in
the institutional set up caused by shifting the PIU from one agency/Ministry to another affected

the performance of the PIU and led to delays in implementation. MoE took long time to
restructure the project as well as to resolve a lengthy dispute with the PIU in the period prior to
restructuring. This was followed by a period of vacant key positions within the PIU, impacted the
motivation of the remaining staff, and caused delays. Following restructuring, MoE appointed
new professional staff, including a new PIU Director. This change in leadership secured a much
needed enabling environment to complete project activities. MoE’s commitment and ownership
for the project improved, implementation issues were timely resolved, fiduciary oversight was
adequate. This ultimately led to the achievement of the PDO. Throughout the life of the project,
the Government took timely decisions on various co-financing elements of the project, which
facilitated complementarity of investments and broadened project’s impact. Despite difficulties
during the early stages of implementation, given the importance of the Government’s
performance during the latter stages for the achievement of the PDO, the overall performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

57.      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. The performance of the PIU was
uneven over the life of the project. Prior to restructuring, the PIU Director seems to have been in
the center of multiple disputes and disagreements with the Ministry and other government
agencies and also among PIU staff. Implementation suffered and serious delays were
accumulated. Following restructuring, the PIU performance improved noticeably. A new PIU
Director was appointed, along with the Procurement Specialist, Engineer, and Community
Mobilization and Institutional Development Specialist. They changed the modus operandi of the
unit and transformed the PIU into an exemplary unit with efficient internal functions,
organization and controls. The PIU, together with the Ministry and assisted by intensified
supervision assistance by the Bank’s team, managed to turn around the project and successfully
finalize activities and achieve the project’s objectives. Given the capacity of the PIU and the
efficiency of its operations, by project end the MoE has decided (subject to availability of funds)
to absorb the PIU within the Ministry and have it function as a hub for all donor financing in the
sector. Given the critical role of the PIU in the latter implementation stages in achieving the PDO
and despite earlier difficulties, overall PIU performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

58.     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Based on above, the
overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


6.      Lessons Learned

59.     Lessons learned under this project relate to the soundness of the background analysis and
the ambition level of second generation projects, design features related to integrated investments
in water and sanitation and institutional arrangements in rural settings, as well as the importance
of well-functioning PIUs. These lessons are presented below in no particular order.

60.     Lesson 1: Second generation projects must build on earlier operations, rely on
adequate sector assessment, be calibrated with government’s commitment to reform, and
maintain a continuous policy dialogue with clients. The NWSSP was a second generation
project following the earlier PWSSP. Despite that, NWSSP kept a narrow infrastructure

                                                21
rehabilitation focus. It was less than modest in its ambition to address underlying sector issues. It
was not well aligned with the Client’s commitment for reforms. For instance, tariff increase was a
precondition for utilities to receive funds under NWSSP. At the beginning of the project, tariffs
were briefly increased allowing utilities to access project funds. Soon after, under social pressure,
tariffs were lowered to their original levels. The background analysis for the project did not offer
any significant assessment of underlying sector issues and project preparation was not sufficiently
advanced in terms of policy analysis and recommendations. The policy dialogue intensified only
in the latter stages of the project when NWSSP became a platform for intense policy discussions
on regionalization. The Water Sector Regionalization Economic and Sector Work (ESW) outlined
a roadmap for improved sector performance through institutional and regulatory reforms. Its key
recommendations have been formally endorsed by the Government and are expected to define the
future organization of the sector in Moldova.

61.      Lesson 2: Well-functioning PIUs are essential for project implementation. Their
structure, staffing, internal organization, reporting lines, decision authority, and
performance incentives should be carefully crafted and closely monitored at all times
during implementation. Following NWSSP restructuring, the PIU staff was replaced and the
unit evolved from a slow and problematic one into an exemplary PIU. It managed to achieve
results within the rural and energy efficiency components within record time. It turned around the
implementation of the project and is, arguably, the single most important factor that contributed
to the successful completion of NWSSP.

62.      Lesson 3: Support towards institutional arrangements in rural areas should be
based on an agreed strategy. Investments should be accompanied by technical assistance for
management and maintenance of acquired assets and infrastructure, improved service
delivery, and social engagement. By design, the rural component under NWSSP included
merely infrastructure rehabilitation. Intended to assist with the aftermath of the 2007 drought, the
rural component was structured much like an OP8.0 emergency assistance operation. The
institutional arrangements in rural areas were not properly analyzed during preparation. By
design, the project did not envisage any support towards the organizational structure and
functioning of rural water systems. During implementation, technical assistance was provided
with planning, management tools and community awareness, but remained on an ad hoc basis and
catered towards the needs of individual participating villages. The lack of a systematic
institutional approach presents a high risk to sustainability of results.

*Zahorna and Recesti are two neighboring villages and share the same local Government
(Primaria). Before it was decided to count Recesti village as a beneficiary locality, the progress
results were reported to Zahorna. Recesti was not initially part of the project, but delivery of
potable water in Zahorna opened the possibility to connect Recesti to the same water supply
system and provide its population with the potable water. Therefore, results in Recesti are also
captured under the project. The share of household connections performed is reported as follows:
Recesti connections – 40% and Zahorna connections – 60%.

Annex 3: Economic Analysis

This economic analysis evaluates the economic impact of improvements under the National
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (NWSSP). The analysis evaluates economic impact of
infrastructure investments under Components 1 (Water Supply and Wastewater Services in
Participating Water Utility Entities), Component 2 (Water Supply Services in Selected Rural
Communities, and Component 4 (Energy Efficiency). Component 3 (Capacity Building and
Project Management) encompasses intangible benefits that are difficult to identify and quantify
with reasonable accuracy, and therefore this component is excluded from the economic analysis.


Cost-Benefit Analysis Methodology

The cost-benefit analysis estimates the economic effectiveness of the project by calculating the
present value of cost and benefit streams and by determining the internal rate of return of the
project. The analysis estimates, based on the types of investments made under each component
and the development objectives of these investments, the different categories of project benefits
that are likely to occur as a result of implemented improvements. The goal of this type of cost-
benefit evaluation is to reasonably estimate the expected benefits that will likely occur in the
future as a result of project implementation.

The analysis assumes that the time period in which the benefits of the project will occur is 20
years. This assumption has a significant effect on the results. Since the project implementation
costs are given, the longer the assumed time horizon of the project is, the larger the magnitude of
incremental benefits will be, and, all other things being equal, the higher the internal rate of
return that will result. It can be argued that the investments implemented under the project have
longer potential benefit time horizon and therefore their estimated benefit streams included in the
analysis could be extended beyond 20 years. However, to remain conservative in our estimates,
all benefit streams of infrastructure investments are limited to 20 years for the purposes of this
analysis.

It should be noted that, besides direct economic benefits identified and considered in this analysis,
there are other potential benefits that are not factored in the cost-benefit calculation described
here. For instance, improved water supply can have a significant economic benefit for various
industries and encourage additional investments and economic growth. Improved wastewater
system can also have environmental benefits. The real benefits accruing to the population may
also not be solely financial or economic in nature. Improved water and wastewater services
provide significant comfort, dignity and general welfare to the affected population. Such benefits
cannot be included in the cost-benefit analyses because either the data needed to estimate the
monetary value of these benefits is not available or because it is not possible to estimate the value
of these benefits in monetary terms. For this reason, cost-benefit analysis that considers only
direct and quantifiable benefits may somewhat underestimate the true value of the project.


Estimated Project Benefits

Component 1 of the project was in significant part designed to address system deficiencies in
several water utility entities. Therefore, the major benefit category for this component is the
projected monetary value of reduction in the non-revenue water, or the physical water losses in
the transmission and distribution systems that result from deteriorated physical infrastructure.
Approximately 68% of project investments made under Component 1 were made to improve

                                                 28
water system distribution networks.       Consequently, it is not surprising that the monetary value
of reduction in water system losses is also the main benefit category of this Component,
comprising almost 70% of the total estimated value of the Component’s benefits (about $8
million, in present value terms, out of the total Component 1 benefit of about $11.4 million).

Component 1 also includes investments in water meters. Approximately 11.5% of the project
investment costs were incurred for installing new water meters. This made it possible to bill
more connections based on metered consumption (rather than at a fixed rate), which in turn
resulted in reduced consumption of water. The estimated value of reduced water consumption is
about $1.14 million in present value terms, which is about 10% of the total benefits under
Component 1.

The implementation of Component 1 and 2 resulted in additions to the customer base of some
utilities and creation of additional revenue stream as a result. Because this additional revenue
stream makes it possible to recover the commensurate cost of fixed system investments, the value
of this revenue stream is included as one of the benefits of the investments under Components 1
and 2. This benefit is relatively small at $609 thousand or about 5.3% of the total benefits for
Component 1 and $1.7 million or about 59% of total benefits for Component 2. The larger share
of this benefit under Component 2 is a result of smaller share of other types of investments under
this Component as well as higher quantity of new customer connections under this component.

Project benefits for Component 1 and 2 also include the value of health, productivity, and time
savings benefits that are likely to be enjoyed by the beneficiary population as a result
improvements in the quality of water and wastewater services. The estimation of this category of
benefits relies on the methodology and data developed by the World Health Organization17,
which includes the following benefits for water and wastewater interventions: avoided direct
health expenditures, both by the health sector and by patients, due to decrease in illness; income
gained as a result of productivity improvements that result from decrease in water-related illness
in working age population; estimated value of loss-of-life avoided as a result of improvements;
and estimated value of time savings resulting from improved convenience of access to water and
improved wastewater service.         Calculation of these benefits involves the examination of
statistical and economic data of past costs from water, sanitation and hygiene (WSH) related
illnesses, the estimation of the likely frequency and severity of potential future occurrence of
WSH illness incidence in targeted population, the estimation of future economic costs of these
incidences, and the estimation of the share of these costs that are likely to be avoided as a direct
consequence of the project implementation and water supply improvements.               This benefit
category is applicable to both Components 1 and 2 of the project. This amount of estimated
benefit for this category is $1.73 million for Component 1 (15.17% of the total) and $1.19 million
for Component 2 (41% of the total).

Finally, Component 4 of the project includes only one benefit category, which is the estimated
value of savings achieved as a result of reduced electricity consumption. Based on the energy
savings data for each utility obtained from energy audits and the average electricity tariffs paid by
the utilities, the total estimated value of these savings is about $2.4 million per year, which is
more than a third of the initial investment amount for this component. Such a high estimated
annual benefit relative to initial costs suggests excellent economic efficiency of this component,
which is further illustrated by a very strong 39% EIRR for this component (see below).

Cost-Benefit Analysis Results

Based on the assumptions, project costs and benefits discussed above, the estimated economic
internal rates of return of the project are 22.55% for Component 1, 10.65% for Component 2, and
38.81% for Component 4. The respective benefits-to-costs ratios are all above 1, and the ratio for
the project overall is 1.89. At 10% assumed opportunity cost of capital, all three components
achieve positive net present values, and the overall net present value of the costs and benefits for
the project is about $7.94 million. The following table summarizes these results.

The result indicates that the project overall, as well as each of its components separately, surpass
the benchmark for economic efficiency. While Component 2 appears to be least economically
efficient at just over a breakeven point, Components 1 and 4 show very strong economic returns.

                                                      (Chisinau) and WSSPIU team. (List of
                                                      participants attached)
                                                      During the workshop the participants have
                                                      discussed and presented the overall project
                                                      implementation         process:    completed
activities, outcomes, impediments encountered, the lessons learned and formulated further
development directions so as to ensure the sustainability of project results and achievements.

Main rationales for NWSSP implementation presented by the participating WUEs: Lack of
adequate utility vehicles, advanced mechanisms and equipment, or availability of such inventory
in quite obsolete condition; deteriorated water supply networks; huge expenditures on repair
works; considerable water leakages and unbilled water loss; frequent interruption of water supply
(in some WUEs); tremendous energy consumption; reduced number of billed connections; lack of
financial resources for system rehabilitation and reorganization of the entire management system
(assessment, design, construction, automation of technological processes and monitoring); losses
from the operational activity – unadjusted tariff (Cahul WUE); Non corresponding water quality
indices in some segments of obsolete water supply networks (Causeni WUE); consumers
dissatisfied by the quality of provided services, etc.

Main deficiencies encountered during the implementation process: Poor quality of the
detailed designs which fact led to additional expenses and time necessary for the required
adjustments and works completion; placement of water supply networks in areas with high risk
impact for execution of construction works; disturbances in WSSPIU activities; political
instability, multiple elections; lack of professionalism proved by several selected companies;
limited borrowing capacity of WUEs and municipalities.

Main social effects reached following project implementation: Enhancing consumer’s quality
of life through the access to improved water sources; reducing the time necessary for repair works
on the network; reducing the negative impact on environment through the extension of sewerage
networks; providing consumers with guaranteed quality drinking water 24/7, improved the social
situation of consumers and gave the opportunity to gain comfort in everyday life (purchasing
modern household equipment – boilers, washing machines, etc.); extending the water supply
networks in new construction areas of the towns.

Main       lessons    learned:    Correct
identification of priorities for efficient
investments; familiarizing with the
procedures of national and international
bidding processes; improved public
relations and media; proper supervision of
construction works; World Bank Projects
– a good trigger for new projects
implementation; reduced development
capacities due to established social-
oriented tariffs.

Main actions to follow: Continuing the
implementation of energy efficiency
recommendations; tariff adjustment so as to ensure the loan repayment; attracting new sector
investments so as to enable a continuous company growth; improving the company`s
management through continuous staff training; improving the relationship Customer - Operator;
establishing an efficient collaboration with LPAs; adjustment of the tariff policy; de-politicization
of the tariff policy in water supply and sanitation services; effective monitoring of the entire
water supply and sanitation system operation; installation of high measuring class equipment;
regionalization of water supply and sanitation sector.

Project results:
Urban Component: As a result of Project implementation there were developed the detailed
designs for interventions planned in 3 urban localities (Cahul, Causeni and Ungheni),
rehabilitated about 60 km of water distribution pipelines, 7.67 km of sewerage pipelines,
rehabilitation of 1 WTP, 2WPS, 2WWPS, 1 ChS, construction of one pressure collector to the
WWTP, procurement of utility vehicles and specific required equipment (water meters, SCADA
Systems, laboratory equipment, pumps, etc).

Strengthening Capacities Component: There were unfolded specialized training programs in
Romanian language in Project Management, Financial Management, Project Evaluation and
Monitoring and in Selected Areas of Financial Reporting; Development of Concept and Structure
of Water Geographic Information System.

Energy Efficiency Component: There were carried out construction, rehabilitation and
equipment replacement works following Energy Efficiency Audit findings.
By the end of Project completion date all activities envisaged for the Beneficiary WUEs have
been completed and the established performance indicators reached or almost achieved

                                                        participants attached)

                                                       During the workshop the participants
                                                       have discussed the overall project
                                                       implementation       process:     completed
                                                       activities,    outcomes,      impediments
                                                       encountered, the lessons learned and
formulated further development directions so as to ensure the sustainability of project results and
achievements.

Main rationales for NWSSP implementation presented by the participating Mayoralties:
Insufficient water resources in mine wells and springs for drinking, household and agricultural
purposes during the drought periods; health problems caused by insufficient water resources:
scabies, pediculosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis; social conflicts due to scarce water resources; the
inhabitants were using water resources from the existent mine wells (non-potable water with high
concentration of nitrates); the public institutions were supplied from large brought water tanks;
migration of population due to unfavourable living conditions; lack of /obsolete water supply
systems/poop quality of piped water/limited access of the population to water supply.

Main deficiencies encountered during the implementation process: Poor quality of the
developed detailed designs; adjustment of project design during the execution of construction
works; execution of construction works on the national roads; reduced development capacity due
to the social-oriented tariffs; non relevant legal and regulatory framework (outdated SNIP); low
awareness of the population towards project benefits; seasonal migration of population; poor
financial situation of the locality inhabitants; high level of bureaucracy; political instability –
delays in project implementation; disturbances in WSSPIU activities.

Main social effects reached following project implementation: Improving the living conditions
of the population, creating new working places; improving the population health; increased birth
rate; reduced difference between the living conditions in towns and rural localities; increased
quality of services provided in schools, improved working conditions for the employees;
expansion of locality – construction of new houses; reduced migration; multiple social-oriented
projects generated by NWSSP implementation: opening public cafeterias, asylums, local CPHs,
etc.

Main lessons learned: Correct identification of priorities for efficient investments; familiarizing
with the procedures of national bidding process; proper supervision of construction works; World
Bank Projects – a good trigger for new projects implementation; possibility to implement project
in limited/record time period; public awareness a key prerequisite for a successful project
implementation.

                                                36
Main actions to follow: Extension of the centralized
water supply system of the locality; construction of
the centralized sewerage system and WWTP;
regionalization of the water supply and sanitation
sector; improving the quality of services provided;
strengthening the capacities of the rural water
companies; tariff adjustment so as to allow the
coverage of the operational, maintenance and
development costs of the centralized water supply
system; full metering of the population.

Other issues:
        During the NWSSP implementation the
number of beneficiary rural localities has decreased
from 5 to 10, and at the same time was adjusted the
objective initially established for the Rural Component;
        The Rural Component implementation schedule remained a critical issue throughout the
project. A considerable progress was registered over the last months of project implementation;
        NWSSSP implementation facilitated the improvement of the water supply systems in 10
villages, but potable water was supplied only to 9 of them;
        Water quality corrective measures were implemented in 4 rural localities: Valeni,
Colibasi, Sarata Noua and Dubasarii Vechi;
        In Bestemac, for which was not possible to identify reasonable solution in due time was
delivered only technical water. In this regard, there were organized public awareness campaigns
with the participation of WSSPIU and NCPH representatives;
        In villages, the capacities were enhanced through technical assistance to the local
councils, Mayors and community representatives. These tips have included information on the
patterns of institutional organization of rural water supply entities, methodological materials on
planning and operation of the system, raising awareness of the community on issues related to
water supply services.

Project results: As a result of Project implementation there were developed the detailed designs
for 15 rural localities, constructed about 150 km of water supply networks, rehabilitated 9 deep
wells and drilled other 3 new wells, there were rehabilitated 2 PS, procured and installed 4 water
towers, 9 water reservoirs, 9 bactericide installations, 1 disinfection facility as well as
design/construction/installation works for 3 water treatment installations. Water supplied to
inhabitants 24/7. The established performance indicator were largely achieved, the deviations
committed to be removed by the end of project closing period, i.e. April 30, 2014.
As of February 13, 2014 a number of 3.961 of household connections were performed out of the
established target of 4.730.
                                                          PDO #1 including people provided with
                                                          access to improved water sources being
                                                          even exceeded – 18.379 out of 17.260
                                                          as target value.

        experience:

                  Initial Project Provisions: December 2008 – August 2012
Project Development Objective
   (i)     to improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water and
           sanitation services in selected urban and rural communities and
   (ii)    enhance the capacity of MoE to prepare and supervise the implementation of
           investment projects and to provide technical assistance to the operating apa canals
           (WUEs).

Project Design – Components and Activities

Component I – Water Supply and wastewater Services in Selected Water Utility Entities –
improvement of the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water and sanitation
services in selected urban municipalities including Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Floresti, Orhei, Soroca
and Ungheni through carrying out rehabilitation works, including: (a) installation of water pipe
in the municipalities; (b) rehabilitation of a water treatment plant; (c) rehabilitation of networks
and pumping stations; (d) supply of construction machinery and trucks, and (e) construction of
new sewage collectors.

Component II – Water Supply Services in Selected Rural Localities - rehabilitating water supply
services in selected rural communities: preliminarily, 50 rural communities but this number
could be scalped up where more funding to become available. This component would finance: (a)
rehabilitation of existing deep wells and piped water systems in 50 villages, identified as priority
villages within the Government 2007 water and wastewater strategy, the majority of which were
affected by the 2006/2007 drought in order to provide safe water to each village school, health
center or administrative center, and to those villagers who are willing to pay to connect to the
piped system, (b) Programs of health and sanitary education in the 50 villages to teach safe water
consumption habits, including drawing drinking water only from the rehabilitated water system,
and relegating dug wells for watering livestock and irrigating garden crops. The rural water
supply component was designed to establish a paradigm for efficient and sustainable investment
in the rural sector that could readily be scaled up with financing from other external agencies.

Component III – Capacity Building – provision of assistance to MoE to enhance capacity and
enable it to prepare, apprise, and supervise the implementation of water supply and sanitation


                                                39
activities through provision of equipment, provision of technical assistance through consultants
services and assistance with incremental operating costs and carrying out of training programs.

Component IV – Energy Efficiency – demonstration and dissemination to Water Utility Entities of
appropriate means of increasing energy efficiency in municipal water and wastewater operations
and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through, inter alia, carrying out of energy audits,
provision of hydrological optimizations, and rehabilitation of electromechanical equipment, as
necessary.

Specific Goals /Key indicators
The project Specific Goals were grouped per levels of intervention and type of beneficiary. Based
on these criteria, the project specific goals were to:
- In urban localities:    (i) improve the coverage, of water and sanitation services; (ii) improve
the quality, of water and sanitation services; (iii) improve the efficiency of water and sanitation
services in selected urban municipalities (Apa canals); (iv) improve the financial sustainability of
water and sanitation services;
- In selected rural localities (villages): (v) rehabilitate water supply services in selected rural
communities; and (vi) improve the quality of water in selected rural communities.
- Capacity building of the MoE: (vii) Enhance the capacity of the MoE to enable the Ministry to
prepare and supervise the implementation of investment projects and to provide the needed
volume, relevance and quality of technical assistance to the operating apa canals.

In compliance with the initially settled Legal Agreement, starting July 01, 2011 the existing PIU
for the Bank`s financed projects must have been abolished and absorbed into the MoE with its
functions, duties and authority transferred to MoE, thereafter, MoE had to appoint sufficient staff,
appropriately trained, in accordance with the established requirements, to take over
implementation and supervision of the project. Before declaring the PIU abolished and
transferring its function to MoE, the Recipient had to ensure that the fiduciary arrangement of the
MoE were assessed and deemed satisfactory to the Association.
Nevertheless, the MoE has reviewed this possibility and decided to maintain the existing PIU
until project closing date, i.e. June 30, 2013. Such decision has been approved by the Inter-
ministerial Committee for Strategic Planning on October 17, 2011.
In such scenario, the second part of the development objective needed to be adjusted as the
project would not be directly contributing to “strengthening the capacity of the MoE to prepare
and supervise its investment program”. Moreover, during the Mid-Term Review of the Project,
carried out during September 06-12, 2011 it was assessed that the development objective of the
Project was not likely to be achieved with the resources available and the investments to be yet
financed; therefore, it was decided to restructure the Project Financing Agreement to either
consider less ambitious objectives, or to revise the targets and indicators to reflect more modest
achievements.
Thus, the Bank team requested the authorities to present a comprehensive proposal for project
restructuring, which required adjusting the targets and indicators to measure success and also the
project objectives, which would match the available funding under all components. The team
requested the Government to evaluate the investment needs, reconsider the proposed activities
aiming at increasing the impact of the investments to be financed under the project, and would
reflect the costs of the implementation arrangements (project management) until project closing
and any relocation of credit proceeds.

Revised Project Provisions: August 2012 – December 2013

                                                40
Project Development Objective
   (i)     to increase access, quality and operational efficiency of water and sewerage services
           in selected areas


In order to achieve satisfactory Project outcomes, it was decided to adjust PDO, although still
keeping the proposed activities intended for MoE strengthening capacities in Component III.

Project Design – Components and Activities

Component I – Urban Component - Improvement of the quality and operational efficiency of
water and sanitation services in the Participating WUE`s (Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Floresti, Orhei,
and Ungheni), through carrying out rehabilitation works, including: (a) installation of water
pipes; (b) rehabilitation of a water treatment plant and supply and installation of equipment in a
wastewater treatment plant; (c) rehabilitation of networks and pumping stations; (d) supply of
construction machinery and trucks, laboratory equipment, and water meters; and (e) construction
of new sewerage collector.
Initially, NWSSP provided an amount of USD 500.000 credit to the town of Soroca, for the
construction of a pressure collector. Following the World Bank letter of January 14, 2011,
regarding the cancellation of Moldova Environmental Infrastructure Project (P074139) Global
Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund Grant (TF058310)- for the construction of a Waste water
treatment plant in Soroca, and Worls bank Aide-memoire of January 18, 2011, it was agreed to
exclude Soroca town from the first Project Component. The Credit amount envisaged for such
locality was reallocated from Category I (Goods, works and Consultant`s services for Part I of the
Project) to Category 2 (Goods, works and Consultant`s services for Part2, 3 and 4 of the Project),
in order to cover the operating expenses of PIU until June 30, 2013.

Component II – Rural Component - Rehabilitation of water systems and provision of assistance
in selected rural communities, consisting of: (a) rehabilitation of the existing deep wells and
piped water systems through provision of goods, works and consultant`s services; (b) engineering
design and engineering technical assistance support, through provision of consultants ‘services.
The rural component was originally designed in response to the 2007 severe drought. It aimed to
address water source issues at 50 villages. However, a few years into implementation the effects
of the droughts were largely addressed by the Government. The concept of the rural component
therefore evolved to include not only water source issues but also the entire supply system, i.e.
distribution networks and house connections, This necessiated to reduce the number of
beneficiary localities to 10 (Bestemac village of Leova rayon, Colibasi village of Cahul rayon,
Dubasarii Vechi village of Criuleni rayon, Navirnet village of Falesti rayon, Pirita village of
Dubasari rayon, Sanatauca village of Floresti rayon, Sarta Noua village of Leova rayon, valeni
village of Cahul rayon, Zahorna and Recesti villages of Soldanesti rayon).

Component III – Capacity Building - Provision of assistance to MoE and to the selected
Participating WUE to enhance capacity and enable them to supervise the implementation of
water supply and sanitation activities through: (a) provision of IT equipment, technical
assistance and training for MoE`staff and the selected Participating WUEs; (b) provision of
consultant`s services and training for the selected Participating WUE to develop activities related
to improved accounting system; and (c) provision of incremental operating costs for the PIU and
audit reports.




                                                41
Component IV – Energy efficiency - Provision of consultants services, goods and works to carry
out energy audits of energy efficiency, and pilot interventions to optimize energy use in selected
water and sewerage systems.

The list of outcome results indicators was adjusted so as to match the revised project activities
and objectives.
At the same time, the FA restructuring included as well the elimination of the existing Financial
covenants – upon the detailed examination, it was concluded that the lack of an effective
enforcement mechanism to approve cost recovery tariffs for WUEs result in non-compliance with
financial covenants by participating WUEs under the NWSSP. As a result Section V of FA –
Other Undertakings was excluded.

Further to FA Restructuring, one project extension was provided for the NWSSP in May 2013, so
as to enable a full implementation of all project envisaged activities:
Given the complexity of several activities to be implemented under the Project, factors that affect
their accomplishment and considering the time needed and available until initial project closing
date – June 30, 2013, it was assessed the risk of failure to succeed with the implementation of the
following tasks: Rehabilitation of water supply system in Dubasarii Vechi village, Criuleni rayon
(Rural Component); Developing and implementing appropriate technical solutions for Valeni,
Colibasi and Sarata Noua villages` water supply system, in order to ensure the supply of safe
potable water, compliant with the sanitary norms in force (Rural Component); Developing the
Concept and structure of Water Geographic Information System (Capacity Building Component).
Therewith, failure to implement the afore mentioned activities would have involved a lower
disbursement percentage, fact that would have adversely affected the development of the water
supply and sanitation infrastructure as well as negatively influence the NWSSP assessment
following the completion of the investment program. Thus, non-accomplishment of the invoked
activities would have caused an un-disbursement of over USD 1,1 mil.

Implementation and operational experience:
Although during the project implementation, there have incurred a range of changes on various
levels – starting with changing the implementation and institutional arrangements within the
project, repeating several tenders or parts of the procurement procedures, which supposed some –
minor, in most of cases – delays in Project’s progress, issues related to the PIU staffing capacity
(mid 2012), and at the same time considering that following Mid-Term Review the Project was
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, we could notice though, a stable trend of progress by the end
of Project Closing Date, which led to the accomplishment, to a full extent, of all targets and
objectives established.

The performance of stakeholders was quite uneven due to high discrepancy of capacities for
implementing projects of such importance, budget and complexity. The PIU and the World Bank
compensated a range of gaps in local entities institutional capacity for implementing the project.
At the same time it was important to provide the beneficiary WUEs sufficient capacity, good
practice, experience and knowledge in implementing rehabilitation and improvement projects in
the future, even after the NWSSP, which will enhance the sustainability dimension of the
technical assistance provided under the project as well as the efficiency and sustainability
dimensions for the technical rehabilitation component of the project and of the utilities’ activity in
the future.

The cooperation between the involved parties – the World Bank, the Ministry of Environment,
the PIU – proved to be satisfactory. The parties showed political will and willingness to cooperate
and were responsive to each other’s requirements, needs, standards, rules and regulations.

                                                 42
All relevant safeguard policies were strictly followed, the MoE, the PIU and the WB cooperated
efficiently in ensuring a proper monitoring and prevention measures’ undertaking in order to
ensure the adequate implementation of the Project. Under most of contracts the
Contractors/Consultants provided/ goods, works, services of acceptable quality, the Project
implementation scheme foresees exterior supervision on both technical level (Supervising
Company) and general implementation level (the PIU, the MOE, the WB) which ensure the
needed level and quality of performance monitoring, supervision, ad-interim changes and
regulation etc. Nevertheless the implementation context put the stakeholders in front of a range of
challenges most of which, with an efficient management, could be surpassed.

The NWSSP design and implementation scheme have been elaborated, proposed, negotiated and
approved in the context of the need to solve acute issues in the WSS sector and the lack of
financial means in the country for performing the urgent rehabilitation activities on technical
level and capacity strengthening measures on institutional level. The context in which the project
has been designed was quite complex and complicated struggling with a range of issues on all
levels – technical performance, financial and general institutional performance in the sector,
political and economic instability which have their strong impact on the social level (diminishing
public support to tariff modifications, public willingness to timely pay for the WSS services,
public awareness of the reforms in the sector, supposing as well a change of mindsets and
attitudes towards the sector problems, the costs and expenditures, the potential and inevitable
increase of tariffs, the importance of quality changes for both the services provided and the
products delivered).

It is obvious the issues’ solving process needs huge inputs in terms of financial means,
mobilization of technical, financial, institution management capacities, strategic visions and
willingness to implement the sector strategies, reforms, action plans.

Major issues are the obsolete and deficient state of the sector infrastructure, the poor service
coverage, the groundwater quality and contamination levels, lack of efficient regulation and
control over the water supply and consumption from artesian, shallow wells and springs which
represent a key source of water supply in rural areas, not complying at the same time to the norms
and standards of potable water quality, the lack of institutional capacity particularly on LPAs
level to coordinate a rehabilitation process, insufficient public support of sector reforms and
awareness on sector problems.

The lack of adequate service coverage, poor water quality, economic problems faced by the
WUEs (due to the fact that tariffs do not cover their O&M costs the utilities are not able to
improve their financial and technical performances on their own) etc. cause increased water
wastages, financial losses, high operation and maintenance costs, repair expenditures; inefficient
utilities becoming burdens rather than active productive management and decision-making
entities in the sector.

Major features that affected the Project implementation:
    The change of entities coordinating and taking political decisions in the sector and in the
        project implementation, the need of constant and substantial effort to keep the interest,
        the involvement, the participative approach of the concerned authorities, as the project
        has to follow very well defined and concretely formulated institutional and sector
        development goals and objectives, whereas the political entities meant to maintain,
        control, initiate, strengthen, justify and give substance to the decision-making process in


                                                43
        the sector change quite often for such short periods of time, which creates a range of
        difficulties and risks in the context of expected outcome and impact generation.
       Changes in PDO, Project Design and Activities considerably influenced the
        implementation tempo. Nevertheless, such changes were absolutely necessary since the
        initially established development objective was not likely to be achieved with the
        resources available, nor the targets envisaged to be accomplished per each on the four
        Project Components. The overall decision making towards restructuring was very slow.
       Political instability, multiple elections.
       WSSPIU crisis in mid-2012.
       In certain cases, by mid-2012, the issuing of “No objection” note and registration of
        Contracts in the WB’s specialized system took more than initially foreseen when
        establishing the time schedule and elaborating the procurement plan, which caused in its
        turn delays in activating and starting the Contracts and the foreseen activities.
       Estimations under some packages of Project’s main components have substantially vary
        from the prices proposed by the bidders which led to need of re-tendering, respectively,
        delaying the further activities from the earlier established time schedules.
       Some of the Contractors delivered with delays their outputs/products under the Contracts
        which led whether to sanctioning them and respectively to delaying some of the activities
        which were connected to the respective delivery of outputs/goods.
       Institutional capacity issues in rural localities.
       Delays in performing the water quality tests in the selected villages and subsequently
        identifying corresponding water treatment solutions for some of the villages


    (2) Assessment of the outcome of the operation against agreed objective:

A range of project’s outcomes has been examined during the project preparation, some of
proposed indicators have been removed as these indicators were not any more relevant to the
project purposes or did not reflect the quality changes targeted by the project activities or some
indicators have been reformulated during project implementation due to changes interfered,
whereas other new indicators have been added in order to completely and appropriately assess the
measure in which the implementation of the NWSSP generated the expected immediate,
intermediate, long-term outcomes, perpetuating further in generating at a longer term the
expected sectorial and social impact.
Results Framework




                                               44
Such tendency is maintained for each of the two components assessed:




Infrastructure rehabilitated under NWSSP created good opportunities for connecting new
consumers with relatively small effort. In Floresti, and villages of Colibasi, Pirita, Navirnet, and
Valeni, implementation of the NWSSP leveraged water projects financed by other development
partners (EBRD, Social Investment Fund, Mormons, and National Ecologic Fund).

Indicator Two: Average electricity Consumption.
Such indicator comprises five beneficiary WUEs: Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Floresti and Ungheni.


                                                 45
A 35 % decrease of the average electricity consumption/m3 was registered by all beneficiary
companies. Such improvement was largely achieved due to the energy efficiency interventions
undertaken under Component IV of the Project.


Indicator Three:
Annual electricity consumption of sewerage system in Orhei – MWh (Baseline of >327):
At the end of 2013 year, Orhei WUE registered a consumption of 103,93 MWh for the sewerage
system. Such result reported to the baseline and established target value of 157 MWh, defines a
considerable decrease of electricity consumed, and a 34% exceeding of the planned consumption.
The improvements were generated by the implemented energy efficiency measures, performed
according to the investment priority list elaborated following the Energy Efficiency Audit.

Indicator Four: Reduction of Non-Revenue water
The indicator includes the results achieved concerning the non-revenue water in five participating
WUEs: Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Floresti and Ungheni. All companies have achieved good results
and whether correspond or even exceed the target value. The diagram bellow presents the three
key values and highlights the end of project outcome. As a result it was registered over 10% of
the end target as network losses. This target was over-achieved throughout the indicator. The
most significant reduction (24%) registered WU Balti (baseline- 58%; Achieved-43,6%; Target-
52%); WU Floresti reduced non-revenue water only by 7,6%, relatively modest achievement is
due to the fact that during implementation period WU started management of two surrounding
villages with obsolete distribution network, the fact after which the company incurred additional
water loses.

Indicator five:
Share of drinking water samples meeting Moldovan standards in Causeni (Baseline – 92%):
The Target value of 95% was over-achieved; NWSSP intervention ensured that all water samples
in Causeni are fully compliant (100%) with Sanitary Norms.

Intermediate Indicators
Intermediate indicator one: New piped household water connections that are resulting from
Project intervention.
By the end of 2013 such indicator was accomplished at 93% (achieved value- 4744 connections;
target- 5087 connections). Construction works in the villages of Sanatauca, Dubasarii Vechi, and
Zahorna were completed in November, 2013, and obviously consumers less actively requested to
be connected during winter time. The execution of individual household connections is still on-
going, and is supposed to reach the established target value by the end of Project closing period,
i.e. April 30, 2014. If we break the achievements on the urban and rural components, the situation
will be as follows:
     ‐ Full accomplishment and even exceeding the planned amount for the Urban Water Utility
         Entities: 783 new connections performed vs. 357 planned, and
     ‐ A slight non-achievement of the indicator for the rural component – 84%: 3961 new
         connections performed vs. 4730 connections planned.

Intermediate Indicator Two: Piped household water connections affected by rehabilitation
works undertaken under the Project.
Such Indicator presents the rehabilitated connections performed under the Project and looks at
urban part of the Project only: Cahul, Causeni, Floresti and Ungheni. The results achieved
(Achieved- 8434; Target- 7902 connections) fully accomplish the established target, and even
register a 6% exceed of over the target.

                                               46
Intermediate indicator three: Increased number of billed connections based on metered
consumption.
This indicator refers only to citiesof Floresti and Ungheni, which benefited of procurement of
water meters under the Project. Indicator fully achieved for Floresti WUE and 92% accomplished
for Ungheni WUE. The defined deviations were committed to be removed by the end of project
closing period, i.e. April 30, 2014.

Intermediate indicator four:
Number of KM of Sewerage pipelines laid/rehabilitated (target value – 5.5 km)
Indicator achieved – 7.67 km, accomplished amount exceeds the established target value by 40%.

Intermediate indicator five:
Number of Rural Water Systems Rehabilitated (target value – 10 localities): achieved value
- 10
Although Pohrebeni village of Orhei rayon couldn`t benefit by the end of NWSSP intervention,
due to some technical problems, involving some interventions on private property location, by the
end of Project implementation Recesti village substituted the 10th locality. Recesti was not
initially part of the project, but delivery of potable water in Zahorna opened the possibility to
connect Recesti to the same water supply system and provide its population with the potable
water. Therefore, results in Recesti are also captured under the project. Zahorna and Recesti are
two neighboring villages and share the same local Government (Primaria). Before it was decided
to count Recesti village as a beneficiary locality, the progress results were reported to Zahorna.

Intermediate indicator six:
Number of water and sewerage utilities that the Project is supporting (target value - 6):
achieved value – 6
Such indicator comprises the beneficiary Water Utility Companies of the Project: Balti, Cahul,
Causeni, Orhei, Floresti and Ungheni. All activities envisaged to be accomplished under the
project for the WUEs have been fully completed.

Intermediate indicator seven:
Number of other water service providers that the Project is supporting (target value - 10):
achieved value - 9
Such indicator couldn`t be fully achieved since Pohrebeni village of Orhei rayon couldn`t benefit
by the end of NWSSP intervention, due to some issues involving certain interventions on private
property location.

Intermediate indicator eight:
Number of MoE and WUEs staff to be trained in fiduciary aspects of project management
(target value - 55): achieved value - 65
Such outcome exceeds the planned number of people trained by 18%. The activities that led to
the achievement of the indicator are Training courses organized for WUEs and MoEs staff in
selected areas of financial reporting, Training programs for MoE specialists unfolded abroad at
International Training Centers and Specialized training programs in Romanian language for MoE
and beneficiary WUEs staff in Project Management, Financial Management and Project
Monitoring and Evaluation, undertaken under the provisions of Component III.

Implementation of Urban Component:
Rationales: Lack of adequate utility vehicles, advanced mechanisms and equipment, or
availability of such inventory in quite obsolete condition; deteriorated water supply networks;

                                               47
huge expenditures on repair works; considerable water leakages and unbilled water loss; frequent
interruption of water supply (in some WUEs); tremendous energy consumption; reduced number
of billed connections; lack of financial resources for system rehabilitation and reorganization of
the entire management system (assessment, design, construction, automation of technological
processes and monitoring); losses from the operational activity – unadjusted tariff (Cahul WUE);
Non corresponding water quality indices in some segments of obsolete water supply networks
(Causeni WUE); consumers dissatisfied by the quality of provided services, etc.
Project Implementation Outcomes: As a result of Project implementation there were developed
the detailed designs for interventions planned in 3 urban localities (Cahul, Causeni and Ungheni),
rehabilitated about 60 km of water distribution pipelines, 7.67 km of sewerage pipelines,
rehabilitation of 1 WTP, 2WPS, 2WWPS, 1 ChS, construction of one pressure collector to the
WWTP, procurement of utility vehicles and specific required equipment (water meters, SCADA
Systems, laboratory equipment, pumps, etc).
Actions to follow: Continuing the implementation of energy efficiency recommendations; tariff
adjustment so as to ensure the loan repayment; attracting new sector investments so as to enable a
continuous company growth; improving the company`s management through continuous staff
training; improving the relationship Customer - Operator; establishing an efficient collaboration
with LPAs; adjustment of the tariff policy; de-politicization of the tariff policy in water supply
and sanitation services; effective monitoring of the entire water supply and sanitation system
operation; installation of high measuring class equipment; regionalization of water supply and
sanitation sector.

Implementation of Rural Component:
Rationales: Insufficient water resources in mine wells and springs for drinking, household and
agricultural purposes during the drought periods; health problems caused by insufficient water
resources: scabies, pediculosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis; social conflicts due to scarce water
resources; the inhabitants were using water resources from the existent mine wells (non-potable
water with high concentration of nitrates); the public institutions were supplied from large
brought water tanks; migration of population due to unfavourable living conditions; lack of
/obsolete water supply systems/poop quality of piped water/limited access of the population to
water supply.
Project Implementation Outcomes: As a result of Project implementation there were developed
the detailed designs for 15 rural localities, constructed about 150 km of water supply networks,
rehabilitated 9 deep wells and drilled other 3 new wells, there were rehabilitated 2 PS, procured
and installed 4 water towers, 9 water reservoirs, 9 bactericide installations, 1 disinfection facility
as well as design/construction/installation works for 3 water treatment installations. Water
supplied to inhabitants 24/7.

Actions to follow: Extension of the centralized water supply system of the locality; construction
of the centralized sewerage system and WWTP; regionalization of the water supply and sanitation
sector; improving the quality of services provided; strengthening the capacities of the rural water
companies; tariff adjustment so as to allow the coverage of the operational, maintenance and
development costs of the centralized water supply system; full metering of the population.

Implementation of Capacity Building Component:
Rationales: There is an insufficiency of both financial and human resources capacity in
implementing donor-financed WSS sector rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in the
Ministry of Environment and in its subordinated agencies and water utilities. This created a
potential risk area for investments not being efficiently planned, implemented, attracted,
distributed, capitalized and for delays or inconsequence in implementing the WSS sector
strategies and policies, as well as difficulties in adequately monitoring and evaluating the sector

                                                 48
situation and its developments. The water utilities also confront for the last decades with quite
complex issues such as the need for technical rehabilitation and reconstruction of networks,
modernization of equipment, structural reorganization, need for human potential use
optimization, change of patterns for strategic planning, financial management, including IFRS-
based reporting issues, social media and communication with customers being another area of
concern.
Project Implementation Outcomes: Financial Audit Services for the participating Water Utility
Entities and WSSPIU; Training organized for WUEs and MoEs staff in selected areas of financial
reporting (with the purpose to provide the selected entities and MoE accountants/financial
managers with practical knowledge and appropriate professional skills, which will help them to
prepare a better quality financial statements); Training programs for MoE specialists abroad at
International Training Centers; Development of Concept and Structure for the Water Geographic
Information System (enabling the access to a Water Cadaster, compliant to the provisions of
Water Law of the Republic of Moldova, no. 272 as of December 23, 2011); Specialized training
programs in Romanian language for MoE and beneficiary WUEs staff (Project Management
Module, Financial Management Module and Project Monitoring and Evaluation Module);
Procurement of office equipment for Moe and PIU (Computers, Servers, Storage, Rack cabinet,
Notebooks, Projectors).

Implementation of Energy Efficiency Component:
Rationales: Obsolete, energy-consuming, inefficient electromechanical equipment in the WSS
sector causing; high operation costs related to deficient management of energy and water
demands and provoking losses and additional expenditures on both technical and financial levels
(increased operation, maintenance and repair costs), generating into deficient functioning of the
WSS infrastructure objects and frequent breakouts; environmental issue: there are used fossil
fuels for energy generation related to high emission of greenhouse gases from the WSS sector etc.

Expected benefits: Reduction of maintenances costs through replacement of obsolete
electromechanical equipment; reduced operational costs related to optimization of processes and
water demand management, including the reduction of physical losses; adding value and
efficiency to the energy generation process by using renewable energy sources available and cost-
efficient in each specific country. Benefits expected from the efficient implementation of this
component were substantial as the energy sources (of various types) are used practically in the
majority of technical activities performed by the selected water utilities (water production, water
treatment for domestic consumption or industrial use, water distribution, including pumping;
wastewater collection, pumping and treatment; a range of auxiliary activities such as space
heating, illumination, operation of vehicles etc.).
Project Implementation Outcomes: Energy Efficiency Audit; and subsequently, based on the
recommendations of the Audit findings (and the developed investment priority list) there were
carried out construction, rehabilitation and equipment replacement works in all six beneficiary
WUEs. As a result, it was registered a 35% decrease of the average electricity consumption of the
companies.

(3) Evaluation of the borrower’s (Government/PIU) own performance during the
preparation and implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned
that may be helpful in the future:
Miscommunication between PIU and the Ministry of Environment. Along the first half of FY
2012 relation between PIU and the line Ministry was marked by prominent miscommunication.
As a consequence, on October 16, 2012, new PIU director was appointed in October 2012, at that
moment following PIU positions remained vacant: Engineer, Procurement Specialist, Accountant,
Community Mobilization and Institutional Development Specialist, and Monitoring and

                                                49
Evaluating Specialist. Given extensive staffing issues in PIU, setting project implementation on
the right track was a tough task. Nonetheless, with the substantial support from the Bank’s
mission a significant increase of disbursed funds was achieved. In this regard, PIU managed to
increase Loan disbursement.

Inadequate estimation of target values for Navirnet. The value of 800 as target for the
intermediate indicator one was initially specified by LPA based on the understanding that 75%
households of the locality are eager to benefit from the connection to the improved water supply
system, for which the LPA confidently subscribed. However the mayoralty of Navirnet village
misunderstood the time period, in which such indicator must be achieved, their perception being a
reasonable timeframe and not until the end of the ongoing construction works in the locality
(under the Contract no.NCB-W-0019-IDA), which location covers only about 167 households.
At the same time, while establishing the target indicator, the LPA envisaged that newly
constructed segment of water supply system will be interconnected with the one constructed
under the National Ecologic Fund financing (competed in 2012), supporting about 300
households and currently supplying technical water, and subsequently connected to the new
Water Treatment Plant Falesti.
Considering the above mentioned, although LPA, and PIU deployed maximum of their effort,
Navirnet, by the end of 2013, was not be able to report more than 460 new piped household water
connections, with the target equal to 800. Target values should have been better clarified to the
beneficiary localities while Project design.
Extension of the Project Closing date until December 31, 2013 Given the justified delay in the
implementation of the following Project’s activities:
             - Rehabilitation of water supply system in Dubasarii Vechi village, Criuleni rayon;
             - Rehabilitation of water supply system in Sanatauca village, Floresti rayon;
             - Developing and implementing appropriate technical solutions for Valeni,
                 Colibasi and Sarata Noua villages` water supply system, in order to ensure the
                 supply of safe potable water, compliant with the sanitary norms;
             - Developing the Concept and structure of Water Geographic Information System,
the Bank approved extension of the Project closing date until December 31, 2013. The extension
ensured a full project implementation and achievement of all NWSSP components` objectives.

Prompt execution of works in Dubasarii Vechi, Sanatauca despite water quality issues. In
November, 2012, as water quality issue in the Rural Component emerged, selection of the
Contractor for villages of Sanatauca, and Dubasarii Vechi was underway. Although the selection
for the said localities was completed in December, 2012, PIU was not allowed to award the
contract before water tests in all villages were undertaken. The testing revealed that the water
source in Sanatauca was compliant, and the Contract was awarded in February, 2013. In
Dubasarii Vechi, however, all boreholes registered various nature of deviation, the most frequent
pollutants being Nitrates, Iron, and Ammonium. It took a long time until National Center of
Public Health of Moldova proposed a solution for Dubasarii Vechi, which envisaged mixing
water in big water tanks before it gets in the distribution network. Following to water testing, as
well as after long period of identifying treatment solutions the Contract for Dubasarii Vechi was
awarded in May, 2013. Despite of the late award the Government ensured timely completion of
construction works under two the most important Contracts under the Rural Component
(Sanatauca - 7,1 mln. MDL; Dubasarii Vechi- 9,1 mln.MDL).

Prompt elaboration of WGIS. In November, 2012, shortly after new PIU head was appointed, it
turned out that activity foreseen under Component III of the NWSSP (Elaboration of the database
which would embrace all water projects in the country financed by development partners), was no
longer relevant. The said activity was cancelled given that the State Chancellery of Moldova had

                                                50
just announced about hiring a consultant under the Project “Aid Management Platform”
(http://public.amp.gov.md/) which had very similar objectives. Thus, only six months before
Project closing date, PIU was urged to identify new needs in the water sector of Moldova that
would generally comply with the scope of the cancelled activity. It was decided, therefore, to
develop Water Geographic Informational System (WGIS) which would be first in Moldova to
provide a comprehensive hydrological map of the country providing public access to descriptive,
and statistical data regarding lakes, rivers, channels, boreholes, protected zones, hydrometric
stations, etc. This target was timely achieved by reason of the Government’s confident actions in
hiring a qualified consultant and involving key stakeholders (Agency “Apele Moldovei”, State
Hydro-meteorological Service, and Moldova Hydro-geological Expedition „EHGeoM”). The
Consultant managed to elaborate an information system which facilitated access to structured
information, ensured data recording and synthesis of hydrographic network, with emphasis on the
water quality and environmental status as a whole, and also enabled data sharing between the
institutions involved in water management sector.

Ensuring additional funding to complete works at Falesti WTP. Compared to other villages the
Project “Water supply in the village of Navirnet”, was substantially more complicated given that
it should have been the product of two concurrent projects:
         - Construction of distribution network and the pipeline to the Falesti Water Treatment
            Plant, commitment under NWSSP;

        -   Construction of the Falesti Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which would deliver
            treated water to the city of Falesti, neighbor villages and Navirnet village,
            Commitment of the Falesti Raional Council;

Although constructions works in Navirnet, under NWSSP, were completed in time, the villagers
are still awaiting for potable water from the WTP. During FY 2013 construction costs of the WTP
increased twice by totally 17.0 mln. MDL, and both times financial gap was promptly covered by
the Ministry of Environment through the National Ecological Fund. The last raise of WTP’s
construction costs came out in January, 2014: after finalizing WTP the contractor started pumping
raw water from the Prut River, and immediately reported that the water main Prut-WTP was
completely deteriorated, and rehabilitation costs would go up to 20.0 mln. MDL. The Ministry of
Environment again is ready to provide financial support until NWSSP key performance indicators
related to the Navirnet are fully achieved. In other words, despite difficulties during construction
of the Falesti WTP, NWSSP keeps the Government committed to enable supply of potable water
to Navirnet, the fact which triggered extensive investments in the Raion of Falesti, which
otherwise could not have been available.

(4) Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other partners
during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of
their relationships:
Initially, the Rural Component envisaged rehabilitation of water source in 50 villages. The
concept evolved to include water source as well as the entire supply network (distribution lines
leading to household connections). Subsequently, the list of participating villages reduced to 10,
and even though, implementation was complicated as a consequence of water quality issues.
During Project Preparation more consideration should have been given to assessment of the
quality of the water source in the proposed rural localities.
Project implementation boosted up sharply as a consequence of appointing new Project TTL in
May, 2012. Prior to the said changes in the Bank’s team implementation progress was modest,
given that PIU’s requests seeking for TTL approval took long, causing delays in implementation.

The World Bank monitored the project through semi-annual support visits, with more intense
supervision in the last 18 months. The Government believes that, in general, the Bank provided
timely and qualified support and remained active even after closing date the Project. Since May
2012, TTL and her team continued supporting PIU with ample assistance in solving technical,
financial, juridical, and managerial issues.

(5) Description of the proposed arrangement for future operation of the project:
Lessons from the implementation of NWSSP include the following;
Consultants responsible for technical design should have been selected and monitored
meticulously. Throughout the NWSSP project implementation was frequently confused by
inaccuracy in technical design, which led to wrong estimation in terms of financial input, volume
of works, and time frame. In order to avoid similar impediments in the future projects, technical
documentation should go through more rigorous procedures of verification and approval, which is
the responsibility of the State Direction for Verification and Approval, under the Ministry of
Regional Development and Construction. Improvement in the activity of Direction for
Verification and Approval would also minimize the risk of getting technical water under the
Projects, which initially were designed to deliver potable water.
Rural localities with little experience in delivering water services should receive institutional
support at earlier stages. Ensuring sustainability under the Rural Component is very much
function of the institutional support delivered to the local government. Almost none of the
villages under NWSSP had experience in delivering water supply services to population, and
obviously technical, financial, and human capacity shortages in the activity of potential operators
were registered.
PIU staff was involved in delivering institutional support based on the following principles:
    -   Reasons, advantages and disadvantages of organisational alternatives;
    -   Role of the Local Government in the operation of water utility;
    -   Local opportunities for income diversification within institutions managing water supply
        systems;
    -   Aspects of water tariff elaboration and approval;
    -   Obstacles, and concerns met along managing water supply system;
    -   Best practices in management of water supply system;
    -   Public participation in decision making;
    -   Income and expenditures of the institution;
    -   Structure of production costs;
    -   Monitoring economic, financial, and operational indicators;
    -   Maintenance and intervention activities;
    -   Billing and collecting payments;
    -   Technical enhancement the water operator;
    -   Human resource management.

Given the extensive agenda for institutional support, it would have been more effective to start
mentioned activities at earlier stage, ideally - in parallel with construction works.
World Bank Project is a good leverage for more funds and new projects in the area (city or
village). This assumption is true for the city of Floresti, and villages of Colibasi, Pirita, Navirnet,
and Valeni, in which implementation of the NWSSP leveraged water projects financed by other
development partners, and donors (EBRD, Social Investment Fund, Mormons, and National



                                                  52
Ecologic Fund). The reason is that water infrastructure rehabilitated under NWSSP created good
opportunities for connecting new consumers with relatively small effort.
The output under Energy Efficiency Component overweighed Key Performance Indicators. There
are strong incentives, to further promote similar projects. All Water Utilities managed to reduce
sharply electricity consumption; the target was over-reached throughout the indicator. WU Balti
(42%), and Causeni (51%) registered the most significant drop in electricity consumption per
each m3 of water produced. According to "Energy Audit in six WU", 2011, total annual savings
under Component IV constitute 1,9 mln.kWh/year, which is over 3,6 mln. MDL/year; and
Investment Payback period of 30 months.


The risk of non-accomplishment of the objectives is higher when the Project is funded and
implemented by two or more donors.
Navirnet village, Falesti rayon – as initially envisaged the new constructed water supply system
of the village was supposed to be connected to the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) of Falesti town,
rehabilitated under the Project implemented by local government of Falesti raion. Construction of
the WTP was in delay given the financial issues, and inaccurate estimation of the volume of
works. The Plant was completely rehabilitated by the end of 2013. In December 2013, the start-
up of the plant demonstrated that the Prut - WTP Falesti water main required serious
rehabilitation, without which further operation was simply impossible. The Contractor was
striving to mobilize the team and get the work done, nevertheless such couldn’t be completed by
the end of Project closing date. The undertaken alternative – connecting the newly constructed
water supply system of Navirnet village to Falesti water supply network represents a temporary
solution - December 2013 – April 2014. Water quality tests confirm that water quality is nearly in
compliance with Moldovan standards. A few minor deviations will be eliminated in April 2014 as
a result of completion of pipeline rehabilitation to connect with the WTP.

Sarata Noua village, Leova rayon – construction of the water tanks, and distribution network
was implemented under NWSSP, whereas the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) financed implementation of two boreholes, as part of its current water
development program, and therefore committed to ensure the locality with appropriate water
sources. What was revealed afterwards - the water quality does not comply with the sanitary
norms - has led to the decision of implementing the water treatment installation in the village,
subsequently financed under the NWSSP. Last water quality tests revealed slight improvement of
the water quality, which should be eliminated in March 2014 some following weather permitting
works.

Bearing this in mind that all activities foreseen under NWSSP were completed and successfully
executed, and the encountered deficiencies with water source came largely from the failure of
implementing the other projects.
