efficiency, and to study future options for Lilongwe's\n            water disposal and sanitation systems.  The project includes\n            construction of a new earthfill dam, remedial works on an\n            existing dam, extension of the water treatment plant and of\n            the water distribution system. Further to this, training and\n            management support for LWB, and feasibility studies on\n            Lilongwe's sanitation and sewerage systems will be\n            provided by the project.  As a result of this undertaking,\n            safe water will be provided for an additional 110,000\n            inhabitants of Lilongwe."}, "docdt": "1986-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
