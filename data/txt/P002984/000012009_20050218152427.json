The water hyacinth is currently under\n            control and three trash booms have been installed. The\n            environmental monitoring plan proposes to monitor the\n            potential resurgence of the water hyacinth and will use\n            mechanical harvesting when needed and monitors the quantity\n            of surface water at points downstream, water content and\n            quality, vegetation samples, the biology and ecology of the\n            fish population, the stability of the shoreline, and silt\n            removal from storm drains. Since this project will take over\n            the temporary infrastructure used for construction under the\n            Third Power Project (Report no. 9153), any negative\n            environmental impacts due to demobilizing and re-mobilizing\n            construction contractors to the site will be eliminated and\n            the risks associated with construction and rehabilitation\n            minimized. A de-commissioning plan will ensure safe removal\n            of the temporary infrastructure and a return of the project\n            area to its original state after construction activities\n            end. An environmental audit will assess the extent of\n            environmental liabilities and identify potential social\n            impacts, propose appropriate costed remediation measures as\n            well as effective arrangements for implementing the\n            remediation plan."}, "docdt": "2004-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
