A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex l)
The objectives of the project are to: (a) improve power supply to meet demand by supporting critically
needed investments in the sub-sector; and (b) strengthen Borrower capacity to manage reform,
privatization, and development in the power and the petroleum sub-sectors. The project would bridge the
electricity supply deficit during the period 2003-2005. After that time, the Government plans for the
private sector to take over financing of system expansion. The project complements three other Bank
operations now in progress. These operations are all supporting the Government's reform and privatization
program for the power sub-sector.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Output Indicators
* An increase of between 80 and 120 MW in the capacity of the Kiira hydro power plant by early
2004;
* Rehabilitation of critical aspects of power system transmission and generation by early 2004;
T raining of a rninimum of 15 staff at MEMD and that of the recently established power sector
regulator, Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) by end-2003;
* Establishment of petroleum sector monitoring guidelines by mid-2003;
* Procurement of equipment to test the quality of petroleum supply, by end-2002; and
o  Establishment of the operating regime for Lake Victoria by end 2003.
Outcome Indicators

Document number: IDAIR2000-187 [IFC/R2000-202]         Date of latest CAS discussion: 11/30/00
Economic and Sector Background
Uganda's economic performance during the past decade has been impressive. The average real rate of GDP
growth has been about 6.7 percent per annum since 1990/91. During the period 1992-2000, this growth
rate brought about an annual 3.6 percent increase in real GDP per capita and over a 20 percent decline in
poverty. Also, on an average annual basis, consumer price inflation fell from 38 percent in 1990/91 to -0.2
percent in 1998/99. Since President Museveni came to power in 1986, the reform program has focused on
establishing fiscal discipline and opening up the economy by promoting greater reliance on market forces.
This program has been successful both in establishing fiscal discipline and in restructuring public
-2 -



expenditure. The Government also has made progress in trade liberalization, privatization, civil service,
and financial sector reforms. At the same time, there is an impressive ongoing decentralization effort,
which should improve public service delivery by, among other things, promoting better matching of public
services with local needs. Furthermore, the country's high stock of debt, a significant constraint to
economic development in the past, has become a smaller obstacle due to Uganda's participation in the
initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative.
Despite notable past economic achievements, the Government is concerned that the lack of adequate energy
supply in recent years will be a serious obstacle to equitable, sustainable growth of the economy. The
modem segment of Uganda's energy sector - electricity and petroleum - is small. Despite Uganda's vast
hydropower resources, concentrated on the White Nile River, only 5 percent of the population has access to
electricity. In fact, a mere 12 percent of the domestic population concentrated in the Kampala metropolitan
area, and in the nearby towns of Entebbe and Jinja -- consumes about 72 percent of total electricity that the
public electricity system produces.
Recent surveys indicate that private sector managers perceive the quality and adequacy of power supply to
be the most serious constraints to private investment. A shortage of electricity has arisen because the
expansion of Uganda's generating capacity has not kept pace with its rapid economic growth in recent
years. The commissioning of the Kiira hydro power station in August 2000 increased installed capacity to
260 MW and has helped to alleviate supply constraints. However, the power utility still has to curtail
power supply during the daily peak periods. With continued strong economic growth and concurrent high
electricity demand growth -- projected at about 8 percent per year -- Uganda needs to better utilize its
domestic energy resources, mainly hydropower.
Regarding petroleum fuels, the Government liberalized both the importation and pricing in 1994. However,
the regulatory framework governing the sector is still inadequate and the capacity to monitor the sector is
weak. Because Uganda is land-locked, the cost of delivering petroleum products to markets is significantly
higher than in many other sub-Saharan African countries. This higher cost mainly results from the high
transit cost of importing products through Kenya and Tanzania. The cost of oil imports was about USS
122 million in 1999, amounting to the equivalent of 27 percent of the country's export revenue. As the
economy continues to grow and modernize, petroleum demand is likely to rise rapidly, from the current
level of some 500 million liters per year, absorbing even more of the country's export earnings. Therefore,
the provision of incentives for greater efficiency in petroleum supply is critical to improve the country's
balance of payments as well as the energy balance.
Development Goal Supported by the Project
In November 2000, the Bank presented a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uganda to the
Board. This strategy emerged from consultations with the Government, private sector, civil society, and
other donors. It seeks to build on the 1997-2000 CAS by continuing to focus on poverty reduction through
sustained growth. The overriding objective is to support Uganda's economic transfonnation and poverty
reduction strategy in line with the Government's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (a progress report,
IDA/SEC M2001-0219, was discussed by the Board on April 17, 2001). An important component of this
plan is the creation of an enabling environment for economic growth and structural transfornation.
Consequently, the Government has identified improving access to and quality of power. transport, and
telecommunications as priorities for the country's development.
The proposed project is included in the CAS and it is an integral part of the CAS emphasis on
infrastructure improvement. More specifically, for the power sector, the CAS plans to improve
- 3 -



infrastructure delivery through the least-cost development of the power system, sector reform, and
privatization. The expansion and rehabilitation of the power system is required to encourage private
industry investment in Uganda by alleviating concern about the lack of adequate power. In parallel, power
sector reform and privatization is necessary for commercial operation of the sector and to reduce the
burden of the sector on public finances. The proposed project will continue supporting the sector reform
process that the Government initiated under the Third Power Project, including the unbundling and
privatization of the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB). The Government is now in the process of privatizing
UEB by granting private operators concessions for its distribution and generation businesses.
In addition to the proposed project, there are three energy-related projects that help promote the CAS in the
power sector: the Bujagali Private Hydropower Project; the Energy for Rural Transfornation Project; and
the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project.
1.    The proposed Bujagali Hydropower Project includes the construction of: (a) a 200/250 MW
run-of-the-river power plant on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer basis, at Bujagali Falls located
about 8 kilometers downstream of the Nalubaale and Kiira Hydropower Plants; and (b) about 100
km of 220 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and associated substations. The project sponsor is
AES Corporation (AES), Arlington, VA, and AES Sirocco, Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of
AES. The privately owned and operated project company (Nile Independent Power) will sell
electricity to UEB (or its successors) under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement. According to
current plans, this US$530 million project should be completed in 2005/2006. In addition to
private equity, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) would partly fund the project, with the
support of an International Development Association (IDA) Partial Risk Guarantee.
2.     The Energy for Rural Transformation Project, has two objectives. The first is to improve the rural
quality of life and facilitate significant rural non-farm income by accelerating rural electrification
from the present 1 percent to about 10 percent in ten years. The second is to develop Uganda's
indigenous, renewable energy resources on a cost-effective basis. The financing of the total project
cost of US$375 million would come from the following sources: IDA (US$75 million APL, with
a first phase of US$30 million) GEF (US$30 million total), the private sector, the Government and
bilateral donors ($195 million).
3.     The objective of the ongoing Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project is to improve the
quality, coverage, and economic efficiency of commercial and utility services through privatization,
private participation in infrastructure, and an improved regulatory framework. The project will
achieve this objective in part by promoting a higher level of private investment along with better
quality of telecommunications, water, electricity and transport services and expanded access of the
population to them. The financing for the US$95 million project is coming from IDA (US$48
million) and the Government of Uganda (US$47 million).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Uganda faces several challenges in the power and petroleum sectors:
Power Sector
Background: The Government established the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) in 1948 as a
quasi-independent, vertically-integrated monopoly to generate, transmit, distribute and supply electricity
within Uganda and to other countries in the region. The enactment of the Electricity Act of 1999 removed
- 4 -



the legal monopoly the UEB had in the power sector. However, the UEB continued to operate generation,
transmission and distribution facilities until March 31, 2001. After that date the Government divided the
UEB into three independent corporate entities - one each for generation, transmission, and distribution.
These government-owned entities now operate the country's power system. This system includes the 180
MW Nalubaale power station (formerly Owen Falls), the Kiira power station with 80 MW installed
capacity, and about 10 MW in diesel and mini-hydro capacity. It also consists of: an interconnected 132
kV and 66 kV transmission network; a 33 kV sub-transmission network; a distribution network at voltages
11 kV and below; and isolated diesel generators and distribution systems. Total generation was about
1,520 GWh in 2000 and the system peak was 242 MW in August 2000. Consumer demand at peak times
exceeds available grid connected generating capacity by about 20 MW currently. Supplementary power to
fill the deficit comes from privately-owned generators that are mainly diesel-driven.
Issue # 1: Poor Performance. The power sector has for a long time suffered from a number of
fundamental problems that have led the Government to develop plans for its reform. These problems
include:
* Poor supply reliability characterized by extensive load shedding and reductions in voltage
* Inadequate investment in all parts of the sector and an inability to finance future required
investments, particularly in distribution,
*   Poor commercial performance characterized by collections being received from less than 50
percent of the electricity sent out from the power stations
H High technical and non-technical losses, which are about 35 percent of electricity generated.
3 High accounts receivable, which are currently equivalent to almost seven months of billings.
* Low productivity despite the retrenchment, in 1998, of about 30 percent of UEB's employees.
Currently, UEB's successor companies combined have about 1,800 employees serving fewer than
170,000 customers.
These inefficiencies have left UEB and its successor companies in a weak position. Now they are, by
normal standards, close to insolvency. UEB has not been able to generate an adequate cash flow from its
average retail tariff of about US 5.6 cents/kWh. To reduce non-technical (i.e. commercial) losses, UEB
has established campaigns to reduce electricity theft and engaged private debt collectors to improve
collection performance. However, these losses and non-payment of utility bills remain serious problems
and ongoing programs in these areas need reinforcement. Various factors such as an inadequate billing
system, metering inaccuracies, and the existence of un-metered supply have exacerbated the problem. The
public sector, which consumes roughly 10 percent of the electricity, is a major defaulter on its payment
obligations to the power utility. In order to reduce the technical losses to economic levels, heavy
investments in the network, especially for distribution, will be necessary over the coming years.
The major cause of the poor state of the power sector has been UEB's lack of management and financial
autonomy from the Government. This situation has hindered the development of a commercial business
orientation, accountability and modem utility management practices. Government influence in
tariff-setting, investment decisions, personnel deployment, and other areas have made it difficult to develop
the performance incentives necessary to improve service.

Strategy: Realizing the potential deleterious impact of a weak power sector on economic growth, the
Government has begun the implementation of a comprehensive reform and privatization program
(Govemment's Power Sector Policy statement is attached in Annex 11). The Government approved a
power sector restructuring and privatization policy in June 1999. The 1999 Electricity Act and the Public
Enterprise Reform and Divestiture Statute provide the legal basis for this policy and provide for the vertical
unbundling of UEB and its conversion from a Statutory Corporation to a public company limited by shares.
The Electricity Act also provided for the establishment of an independent power sector regulator. This
entity has been in place since April 2000. As a prelude to the privatization, in April 1999, the Government
appointed a new management team with private sector experience to manage UEB. The new management's
commercial approach has made improvements in UEB's performance (see Section E.2 for details). The
preparatory work for restructuring and privatizing UEB began in April 2000 with the hiring of
Privatization Advisers.
In March 2001, the Governnent divided UEB into three independent corporate entities, one each for
generation, transmission, and distribution. The division of UEB into these entities also affected the
allocation of the former UEB's assets. The Government has re-allocated these assets according to the
requirements of the 1999 Electricity Act. As a result, the Distribution Company now owns all power
supply assets operating at 33 kV and below, along with assets associated with the retailing of electricity.
The Transmission Company owns all assets operating above 33 kV. The Uganda Electricity Generation
Company owns the Nalubaale and Kiira hydro power stations. During a transitional period, the UEB
Statutory Corporation will retain some liabilities that the Government could not delegate to the successor
companies without the prior permission of counter-parts to the contract (for example some multilateral and
bilateral long-term debt). Upon settlement of these liabilities, or their delegation to one of the successor
companies with permission of the counter parts, UEB will cease to exist, according to the 1999 Electricity
Act. The diagram below illustrates the current sector structure, which will be in place until the generation
and distribution businesses are concessioned out to the private sector.
Current Power Sector Structure

Ltd.                   Company Ltd .                    L td.
In addition to the unbundling of UEB into separate generation, transmission, and distribution companies,
the restructuring policy requires the privatization of the generation and distribution businesses through the
establishment of long-tern concessions. Under concession arrangements the existing assets will remain in
public ownership but the private companies will have the right to operate and expand them.
Upon establishment of the concessions, the power sector will have the following structure:
One distribution company that a private company will operate as a concession;
- 6 -



*   One generation company that a private company will operate as a consession, including the
existing Nalubaale and Kiira hydro stations;
*  Two separate Government-owned holding companies for the existing generation and
distribution assets; and
*  A separate Government-owned transmission company acting as a single buyer that will hold
existing power purchase agreements (i.e. Bujagali and the future generation concession
company). The Government's medium term objective is, however, for the private sector to
operate the transmission company as a concession and also to allow for direct contracting
between the generation and distribution companies.
In addition, the Electricity Act allows Independent Power Producers (e.g. Bujagali) and rural energy supply
companies to apply for operating licences.
The Government and the Bank have agreed on the details of the restructuring and privatization program, as
well as the specific implementation steps. The program resulted from the recommendations of a Power
Sector Restructuring and Privatization Study, completed in May 1999, and those of the Government's
privatization advisers. So far, progress on implementation has been satisfactory, with the Government
taking full ownership of the process, as evidenced by the timely achievement of several milestones of
reform, as summarized in the table below.

Issue # 2: Electricity tariffs. Until recently, electricity tariffs had been declining in real terms. However,
an increase was difficult to justify to consumers during a period of supply rationing. Following the
operational improvements due to the availability of additional electricity from the Kiira station, the ERA
authorized a 70 percent increase to the average level of tariffs, with effect from June 1, 2001. This
increase raised the average tariff revenue from about US cents 5.6/kWh to UScents 9.5/kWh, a level that
- 7 -



would be adequate to ensure the financial viability of the project. This increase was necessary to improve
the power sector's financial position and to ensure that sufficient revenue would be generated by the sector
entities to finance investment in rehabilitation and expansion of the system. At the same time, the ERA
also approved improvements to the structure of the tariffs, through the removal of cross subsidies between
the different consumer groups. Most notably, it removed the subsidy from industrial to residential
consumers. This new tariff structure should provide better incentives for suppliers to extend electricity
service to rural areas. The ERA also approved an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to prevent the
erosion of the tariff due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and domestic inflation. Under this
mechanism, the Distribution Company can adjust the retail tariffs quarterly on the basis of an ERA
endorsed formula.
Issue # 3: Inadequate and Unreliable Electricity Supply. As noted earlier, inadequate, unreliable
electricity supply is stifling economic growth. Although the supply situation has improved since the
commissioning of 80 MW at Kiira in August 2000, the utility is still forced to curtail about 20 MW during
2-3 peak hours daily. There is no adequate reserve margin, which in turn prevents the utility from
adequately maintaining its generating assets. Furthermore, a number of the generation and transmission
substations are old and in poor condition due to lack of adequate maintenance. System interruptions
therefore occur frequently.
Because of economic expansion, Uganda's electricity demand is expected to increase rapidly. In February
2001, Electricite de France (EdF) updated Uganda's electricity demand forecast. The base case forecast
estimates energy demand to grow at an annual average rate of 10 percent during the period 2001 to 2010.
After taking account of decreasing losses, the forecast indicates that the system's energy requirement will
increase by about 8 percent per year. This rate appears reasonable given expected annual GDP growth rate
of around 7 percent, continued strong industrial production, and the current peak load shedding. Another
indication of the market's growth potential is the recent survey of private industries. This survey indicated
that industries have installed up to 100 MW of back-up capacity in response to the poor quality of UEB's
supply and the continued load shedding. With improved service from the grid system provider, these
industries are likely to rely less and less on their own generators and instead, gradually increase puchases
from the grid system. The high and low annual demand growth scenarios are 9 percent and 11 percent
respectively (assumptions are in Annex 4). A comparison of the forecast with the available generation
indicates that the existing system will not be able to balance demand and supply.
Strategy: The Government's long-term strategy is to develop Uganda's large hydro power resources
through Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Based on current plans, the first IPP plant (Bujagali) should
be operational around the year 2005/2006. To meet the growing demand in the meantime, a new
hydroelectric generation plant -- the Kiira power station (formerly the Owen Falls Extension) -- is under
construction. It is constructed adjacent to, but not connected to the existing Nalubaale plant. The plant is
designed for 5 x 40 MW generating units (please refer to illustration of the plant at the end of Annex 2).
The Third Power project financed the construction of a new dam, a power house, a diversion canal, a
spillway, civil works for generating units 11 through 15, and the installation of 80 MW (Units 11 & 12) of
generating capacity. The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and Norwegian Agency for
Development Corporation (NORAD) are financing the installation of Unit 13. The addition of this unit by
the end of 2002, will increase the installed system capacity to 300 MW.
The Government plans to install the remaining two units to complete the Kiira plant. Since the civil work
structures are already in place, these two units can begin operation with a short lead time. The units will
provide 80 MW of additional capacity. The additional power will reduce the need for electricity rationing
before the first IPP comes on-line. However, even this extra power is only a partial solution; the forecast
- 8 -



indicates that demand will outstrip supply until Bujagali comes on strearm. To fuirther reduce the supply
deficit, the Energy for Rural Transformation Project will explore the possibility of generation from small
renewable energy sources, such as sugar mills, that are close or already connected to the main grid. Energy
efficiency measures will supplement this increase in generation capacity. These measures include ongoing
programs for reducing non-technical losses and improving billing and collections. One of the ongoing
programs is the distribution strengthening and technical loss reduction project, with fimancing from the
African Development Bank (AfDB). To reduce interruptions in the transmission system, the Government
plans to rehabilitate a number of critical transmission substations, the old substations at the Nalubaale
hydropower plant, and extend the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to cover the
whole transmission system.

The table above shows that the system will continue to operate on a negative reserve margin until the Kiira
power plant has been completed at the end of 2003. After that time, the system will have adequate capacity
reserves but it will not be able to meet energy demand fully until the commissioning of Bujagali. However,
as discussed later in Section D, the Government has indicated that, at this stage, it is not willing to install
large scale oil thermal plant, because of the high cost of fuel and problems transporting large amounts of
fuel through Kenya and Tanzania. Furthermore, investment in such a plant would, in effect, duplicate
investments in back-up diesel generators, which industries already have made.
Issue # 4: Low Access to Electricity-Particularly in Rural Areas. Uganda currently has one of the
lowest levels of per capita electricity consumption (44 kWh/year) in the world. This ievel reflects the fact
that only an estimated 4-5 percent of population has access to public electricity supply. Currently there are
only about 170,000 customers connected to electricity lines. Most of these customers live in urban areas.
In the recent past, UEB connected fewer than 10,000 customers per year. Even under the best of
circumstances, restructuring of the power sector alone is unlikely to improve the rural access picture
perceptibly. For example, an optimistic assumption for growth in the number of rural households
connected to the main grid during the period 2001 to 2010 is an average annual rate of 15 percent. At this
rate, the total number of rural households connected to the main grid would increase from about 30,000 in
2001 to about 125,000 in 2010. Under this assumption, rural access would increase from 1 percent to 3
percent.
Strategy: The Government, in consultation with the Bank, has adopted a commercially-oriented approach
-- with the Government playing the role of a market enabler to increase rural electrification. The main
elements of this strategy are: (i) level playing field for private sector participants; (ii) a regulatory
framework that supports private sector development; (iii) cost recovery and cost-based tariffs; and (iv) a
transparent subsidy transfer and financing mechanism. In line with this approach, the Government has
initiated discussions with the Bank for financial support for rural electrification. The Banks analyses so
far have concluded that Uganda offers good prospects for a commercially oriented rural electrification
program with the private sector taking the leading role. However, the first step is to establish a supportive
institutional and regulatory framework. The Bank and the Government plan to support such a development
under the Energy for Rural Transformation Project. The Bank appraised the proposed project in May
2001, at which time the Government began the implementation of its recently completed Rural
Electrification Strategy.
Issue # 5: Hydrology. Uganda's existing hydro power plants are located along the Nile river, which flows
out of lake Victoria. The long-term level of Lake Victoria naturally varies over a range of about two
meters. Despite Uganda's ability to regulate outflows from the lake using the Nalubaale Dam, this
regulation capability is generally not used because of a bilateral agreement between Uganda and one of the
riparian countries. This agreement regulates the quantity of flow discharged from the lake (through the
powerhouse or dam spillway) according to an "agreed curve". The purpose of this curve, which relates the
water outflow to lake levels, is to reproduce the natural outflow which would have occurred prior to the
construction of the Nalubaale power plant and spillway in 1954. While Uganda has some flexibility to
regulate flows on a weekly basis to match power demands, it cannot utilize Nalubaale's very large
capability to regulate flows on a seasonal or yearly basis to optimize the use of Lake Victoria outflows for
power generation.
There have been proposals for regulating the outflow from Lake Victoria but as yet no detailed studies have
been carried out. The objective of such regulation would be to enhance hydropower production at
- 10-



Nalubaale, Kiira and any subsequent plants downstream. There may also be potential benefits to
downstream riparian countries through increased dry year flows and flood attenuation. From Uganda's
viewpoint the main benefit of such a regulation policy is the ability to firm up energy production of the
Nalubaale, Kiira, and Bujagali power plants. This would allow delaying the construction of subsequent
new plants until system demand exceeded "average energy" rather than "firm energy". It could be possible
to further increase these benefits by short term variations in operating policy. For example, there could be
an increase in the outflow for two or three years prior to installing new power plants (drawing from
storage), thus allowing the postponement of new investment in generation capacity. Then, during the
period immediately after installation of the new plants, there could be a reduction in outflows to allow
recovery of lake level (replenishing storage). Outflows would then be gradually increased to average levels
in line with system demand increases. Under the proposed project, the Government has requested financing
for a study that would evaluate the impact of this regulation policy on the power investment program and
on the downstream riparian countries.
Petroleum Sector
Issue # 6: Lack of Monitoring of Petroleum Operations. In 1994, the Government liberalized the
downstream petroleum sector but the legal and regulatory framework governing the sector is still
inadequate and the capacity to monitor the sector is weak. Some six years after the liberalization, Uganda
still has no law or mechanism to enforce anti-competitive behavior. The only law in effect at the moment
which relates to the downstream sub-sector is the Petroleum Act of 1957. It appears that only the oil
companies have benefited from the liberalized market since 1994. It has not resulted in much increased
competition, lower consumer prices, or improved quality at the pump. In 1999, the Government prepared
an analysis that indicated an increase in the oil companies' margins from about US$0.24/liter
pre-liberalization to in excess of US$0.30/liter after liberalization. Consumer prices per liter have ranged
between $0.7 and $0.9 for petrol; $0.5 and $0.7 for kesosene; and $0.6 and $0.8 for diesel during the
period January 2000 to date. Regarding the quality of the products, there is a problem of product alteration
especially for kerosene and diesel. A procedure called bio-coding, which the Government recently
introduced to control petroleum smuggling, has established that products imported through the proper
channels are sometimes mixed with smuggled ones. A major deficiency in the management of the sector is
the Government's lack of capacity to adequately control the quality of petroleum products entering the
country.
Strategy: The Government is committed to improving the operation of the petroleum sector by enhancing
competition through a number of measures: (i) actively monitoring and disseminating market information to
the public; (ii) establishing a legal and regulatory framework; and (iii) attracting new entrants to the
market. To this end, Government has initiated the drafting of a new Petroleum Supply Law with the
assistance of GTZ. It has requested IDA assistance in implementing the law including the establishment of
a body to monitor petroleum operations. This assistance will include technical assistance for: Preparing
and setting up the new regulatory framework and monitoring; building institutional capacity; and acquiring
equipment.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will address the following issues: promoting further power sector reform and development;
increasing and improving supply of electricity, including the optimization of Lake Victoria's outflows; and
promoting further petroleum sector reform and development.
Promoting Further Power Sector Reform and Development. The Government has demonstrated
- 11 -



ownership of sector reform and its progress in implementing agreed reform measures has been steady. The
proposed project will facilitate the Government's privatization program by financing critically needed
generation capacity and transmission rehabilitation. This financing will ensure availability of generation to
support the private sector distribution company's efforts to increase coverage. Also, the project will
finance training and advisory services for increasing the Government's capacity to deal with the complex
issues related to power sector reform and utility privatization. The Privatization and Utility Reform project
is providing complementary assistance. Furthermore, to ensure sustainability of the proposed project, for
which a reformed power sector is essential, several key decisions on the project will depend on the
Government maintaining its comnmitment.
The project would also, together with the NORAD-financed Regulatory Support Project, support the
setting-up of the legal and regulatory framework -- in particular, technical assistance and training to the
recently established Electricity Regulatory Authority. The Bank and the Borrower will identify specific
activities to be financed during the course of implementation.
Increasing and Improving Supply of Electricity to Meet Demand: The project will install Units 14 and
15 at the existing Kiira power station. These units will provide up to 80 MW in additional installed
capacity by the end of 2003. The project also will facilitate the speedy commissioning of Unit 13 by
financing the civil works that SIDA and NORAD could not finance due to unavailability of funds. The
credit for the proposed project would allocate about US$ 2.5 million (3.2% of the total) to the retroactive
financing of the initial portion of the required civil works. Such advanced procurement is necessary to
complete installation of Unit 13 on time to meet growing demand.
Finally, the proposed project will finance the rehabilitation of critically needed transmission system
improvements to reduce losses and blackouts. Analysis indicates that the existing transmission network
capacity combined with current investments in new capacity should provide the main load centers with
sufficient power. However, the appraisal mission established that although some rehabilitation of the
electromechanical equipment at Nalubaale power station was carried out under the Second Power Project,
some of the original (1954) equipment remains un-refurbished. Hence, the proposed project will finance
the rehabilitation of the necessary critical circuit breakers and spare units for the transformers. It also will
rehabilitate and extend several other grid substations for effective distribution of the increased supply.
Finally it will upgrade and extend the SCADA system to reduce the time required to identify a fault and
restore supply after fault rectification.
Optimizing Lake Victoria Outflows: The project will finance the required studies to provide the
Government with information on the merits of the short-and long-term regulation of Lake Victoria outflows
to Uganda and the downstream riparian countries. The study would contribute to a strategy to manage the
hydrology in an environmentally satisfactory way for Uganda and all riparian countries.
Furthering Petroleum Sector Reform and Development: The project will provide technical assistance to
the Government for the overall reform and development of the subsector, including the establishment and
implementation of a monitoring and regulatory function. The project will also finance the procurement of
petroleum quality monitoring equipment. This assistance will complement that of the GTZ, which is
financing the drafting of a new Petroleum Supply Bill. The Government will submit the Bill to Parliament
prior to the implementation of this component.
Strategic Choices
Public vs. Private Sector Project: Given the cost of power shortages to the economy, the proposed
- 12 -



project will finance a public sector investment because it is the fastest way to increase generation capacity.
The project team considered the installation of the two generating units by the private sector. However, the
team rejected this alternative because it would require more lead time than a public sector project. Since it
is expected that the operation of the Kiira power station would be offered to a private sector concessionaire
through tendering by the end of 2001, procurement of the units by the private concessionaire could only
start during 2002, meaning at least a one year delay in installation. This would lead to intensified power
rationing. The Government therefore decided not to delay the installation until the generation
concessionaire has been selected.
Sector Reform: The dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Uganda on power sector reforns
has been going on for several years. The Government recognizes that it can justify additional investment in
the sector only with major reform of the sector. In view of this, the proposed assistance strategy includes
three elements. First, release of funds by IDA for the installation of the generating units will take place
only after Government has approved a satisfactory list of pre-qualified firms for the distribution
concession. It should be noted that confidence of generation availability is a crucial aspect in investor
readiness to be involved in a distribution business. Hence, the second element is that the project will assist
the reform program by improving the availability of power in the short to medium term, before private
sector financing becomes available. Third, the proposed project will provide technical assistance for the
implementation of the reform program in coordination with the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform
Project, the proposed Bujagali IPP Project, and other donor assistance programs.
Project Size: A third strategic choice in the design of the project is the phasing of the financing for
investment in new generating units. During project preparation an analysis indicated that under "base case"
assumptions -- for the capital cost of the unit; the commissioning date of Bujagali; and the inflows to the
lake prior to the planned commissioning dates of the new units -- only one of the two would be
economically justified at present. The Bank and the Government agreed, however, to include the two units
in the project but make the disbursement for the second unit conditional on demonstration of its viability at
a later stage, likely to be towards the end of 2001. At that time, the Bank and the Government will review
three key factors: the capital cost of the additional unit based on bids received; the most probable on-line
date for Bujagali; and the latest lake level (and hence implications for short-term outflow). The appraisal
team's analysis shows that the viability of the second unit is mostly sensitive to when Bujagali comes on
stream. However, the short-term outflows from lake Victoria, will also have an impact. In addition, if
Uganda were to negotiate a change to the agreement with the riparian countries on flows, making larger
outflows from the lake to the river possible, the energy generation capability of the second unit would
increase markedly thereby improving its economics.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project will support the ongoing reforms in the power and petroleum sub-sectors in particular, the
privatization through long-term concessions of the power distribution and generation businesses and the
implementation of a modem legal and regulatory framework for the petroleum sub-sector. Most of the
assistance will be in the form of capacity-building and training, both in-house and outside Uganda.
In the power sector, the Government has made several legal and institutional changes up-front, including:
(i) amendment of the Public Enterprise Reform and Divestiture (PERD) Statute to improve the
privatization process; (ii) enactment of legislation to create a separate electricity regulatory agency; (iii)
adoption of procedures for competitive and transparent divestitures; and (iv) adoption of transparent
guidelines for the use of divestiture proceeds; (v) filled management positions at UEB with a qualified
management team to manage the utility on a commercial basis in the interim period before privatization;
and (vi) separated UEB into three corporate entities. In addition, GOU has decided to adopt evolving
approaches towards the regulation of utilities framework. In the short term, it will create sector-specific
regulatory agencies to ensure autonomous arrangements for each sector. In the longer-term, the
Government is looking into a broader concept of multi-sector agencies in an effort to increase the efficiency
of regulation. In the petroleum sector, the Govermment is in the process of modemizing its Petroleum
Supply Law and creating effective market monitoring arrangements.
Finally, the project will help build the institutional capacity for project implementation and management by
supporting: (i) the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which is in charge of the implementation of the
generation and transmission components of the project; and (ii) the MEMD's project implementation team.
The project will also promote Uganda to make better use of regional energy trade opportunities.

3. Benefits and target population:
The primary beneficiaries will be electricity consurners in Uganda, who will receive more electricity and a
better quality of service. In particular, private industry will benefit from increased grid supply and reduced
load shedding. All taxpayers who subsidize UEB, will benefit from power sector reform and improved
financial management of the power industry. In particular:
* Increased power supply with improved reliability will facilitate higher economic growth;
* Power sector reform and privatization will improve the sector's performance thereby reducing the
power sector's drain on public expenditures, and thus freeing-up resources for the implementation
of the Government's poverty eradication program; and
* Fewer blackouts and brownouts will reduce the need to operate expensive back-up generators.
Thus, industry will benefit from reduced cost of electricity. Also, increased power supply will
allow for increasing the access to electricity.

Project Management Arrangements
The existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU), located at the UEB Statutory Corporation, will provide
implementation support to the Generation and Transmission companies (for Parts A and B). The unit
recently received strengthening under the ongoing Third Power project. A dedicated individual with
international experience has been hired as Project Manager to head the Unit. The Unit also includes a
project accountant, and staff with procurement expertise. An environmental officer started work on June 1,
2001. The Implementation Unit has proven experience in implementing similar projects as it provides
support to the implementation of all the ongoing power sector projects.
MEMD has assigned the Assistant Commissioner for Energy Efficiency as a full time Project Coordinator
responsible for the implementation of its components. Other members of MEM'Ys project implementation
team include a deputy project coordinator (the Assistant Commissioner for Petroleum) and an accountant.
In issues relating to power sector privatization, MEMD will consult with the Minister of State for Finance
(privatization) responsible for privatization. In implementing the Water Management Study, MEMD will
co-ordinate with the Ministry of Water, Lands, and Environment. MEMD has experience in
implementing similar projects through participation in previous IDA and donor financed projects.
Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangements
* An independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, will audit project accounts, including special accounts
and all disbursements under Statements of Expenditure annually. The auditor will apply auditing
standards acceptable to IDA; and
* The implementing agencies will submit the annual audit report to IDA within six months of the end of
each fiscal year.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
* The implementing agencies will prepare quarterly project management reports and semi-annual
progress reports on the basis of the agreed project implementation plan;
* The Bank's supervision missions will take place twice a year and there will be a mid-term review of the
project in 2003. The project's co-financiers (NDF and NORAD) have agreed to participate in these
missions to the extent possible;
* Implementation progress and achievement of objectives will be monitored on the basis of agreed
- 17-



indicators and targets; and
*   The Government will transmit to IDA a completion report, within six months of credit closing.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Previous studies have established that the generation system in Uganda should be based on hydro power.
This is a function of two factors. The first is the abundant power potential available for development on
the Victoria Nile. The second is the relatively high cost of alternative thermal generation - a consequence
of Uganda's landlocked location. The development of a generation system in Uganda was studied in detail
in 1997 by Kennedy and Donkin, as part of the IDA-financed Third Power project. The study provided a
long-term approach to defining the evolution of the generation system. It concluded that developing the
hydropower resources on the Nile is the least-cost option for Uganda. It consequently outlined a long-term
development plan for the power system and recommended the development of Bujagali in 2003 as the next
power generation project. The plan included Kiira Units 14 and 15 in all the expansion sequences it
analyzed. The least-cost plan recommended the installation of Unit 14 before Bujagali and Unit 15 after it.
However, substantial power shortages have resulted from a combination of: High load growth; delays in
completing the first phase of the Kiira power plant (3x4OMW Units 11-13); and a delay in the date
Bujagali will come on stream. The power shortages will continue until the commissioning of Bujagali now
expected in 2005/2006. The Government is considering an immediate further extension at Kiira (2x40MW
Units 14 & 15) as a partial stop-gap solution. Since the required civil works (for example, the
powerhouse) already are complete, the two units could be operational before the end of 2003.
The viability of this extension is, however, not clear cut because energy production of the additional units is
strongly influenced by the amount of flow available from the Lake Victoria over the short term. This, in
turn, is a function of the uncertain hydrological regime (an analysis of the hydrology by Mr. Dennis
Creamer, Water Resources Specialist, is available in project files). Moreover, the Government has
emphasized that the installation of new stop-gap generation should not detract from the economic viability
of Bujagali for which the decision to proceed in principle has been taken. Therefore after commissioning of
Bujagali, the operating regime of the generating plants should reflect that power from Bujagali would be
dispatched first to meet the domestic load and export commitments; other plants would provide peak and
surplus energy. However, there is a general agreement that additional firm energy arising from the new
Kiira units could affect the next hydropower addition after Bujagali, by delaying it slightly or reducing its
capacity.
Four alternatives were studied to compare the costs of reducing the energy shortfall before Bujagali:
*   A) Installation of no additional generation prior to Bujagali. Instead, shortages are dealt with,
as has been the case in the past, by relying on industrial, commercial and high-income
residential consumers to continue running their own existing back-up generation for essential
services. A few new consumers would also install small- to-medium sized diesel plants to meet
essential services. This plan would inevitably lead to some loss of economic activity as some
loads would not be served either by the grid or by private back-up generators. It should be
noted that under this scenario GENCO would not have adequate capacity to serve peak loads,
and would also have insufficient hydroelectric energy to meet the system demand. It would,
however, have some flexibility to schedule outages to times of day when effect on economic
productivity would be less.
- 18 -



*  B) Installation of a 40 MW distillate fired gas turbine power plant to meet the projected load
growth prior to Bujagali under most hydrological scenarios, such that no new back-up
generation by consumers would need to be installed. After Bujagali comes on line, the full
capacity of this gas turbine would not be needed in the grid system in the short to medium
term.
*   C) Installation of Kiira Unit 14. Considerable back-up energy generation by consumers would
still be required under lower flow hydrological scenarios. Also, some additional back-up
generation capacity would need to be installed by new consumers, though less than in
alternative A). The additional capacity of Unit 14 would give the GENCO improved
capability to schedule outages at times of day when effect on economic productivity is less. It
could also consider an energy exchange program with Kenya such that Uganda exported
energy in peak load periods in return for a greater quantity of imported energy during off-peak
periods. After Bujagali comes on stream, the additional energy generation of Unit 14 would
need to be considered as surplus, available for export until the domestic demand had grown
sufficiently to absorb it. By that time, the firm energy component of this additional energy
would allow some delay or reduced size in the next hydropower plant after Bujagali.
*   D) Installation of both Kiira Units 14 and 15. Since Unit 15 does not provide additional
energy except for above average hydrological scenarios, the amount of additional back-up
generation capacity installed by consumers would probably not decline in comparison with
alternative C) above. However, in higher flow scenarios, the additional energy from Unit 15
would save fuel in back-up plant before Bujagali, and increase surpluses available for export
after Bujagali. It would also allow for an additional small delay in the next plant after Bujagali
or alternatively a small reduction in its size.

Table I above shows that, under "average" flows (defined as 1,004 m3/sec.), both alternative C) and D)
would reduce total system costs. The table also shows that adding unit 15 would only marginally reduce
the system costs when compared with Alternative C. This is because under average flow conditions, the
unit would not produce a large amount of energy.
A risk analysis reveals further, that adding Unit 14 leads to reduced system costs under virtually all the 24
flow sequences studied (ranging from 757 m3/sec. to 1,067 m3/sec.). Only under the very lowest flows,
would Unit 14 not produce enough energy to reduce system costs. Overall, there is a 90 percent probability
that Unit 14 would produce a net cost saving for Uganda. For Unit 15, on the other hand, the probability
of a net cost saving is only 37 percent. Its viability increases with high flows and later date for Bujagali
coming on stream. In conclusion, Unit 14 is cost effective whereas Unit 15 is marginal at best. Because
the viability of Unit 15 depends in addition to water flows on the date Bujagali comes on stream, which is
currently uncertain, the unit is included in the project as an option. IDA disbursements for it will be
conditional upon confirmation of its viability once Bujagali's timing has been firmed up.

The choice of the Kiira extension is reinforced by unit price comparison. The weighted average (over all
flow sequences used) incremental cost of the energy generated by Units 14 and 15 is UScents 7.4/kWh and
UScents 8.9/kWh respectively. This is a very competitive price for a peaking power plant. The average
energy cost of a gas turbine unit installed in alternative B) is about US cents 17/kWh, because its expected
energy generation would be low. The reason for this is because it would be mostly needed only before
Bujagali. After Bujagali it would not be needed to operate for the next five years or so except for providing
standby capacity. In fact, the Government explored the possibility of thermal generation through
competitive bids in 1998. The competitive bid for up to 90 MW of thermal capacity resulted at a cost of
about US cents 17/kWh. The Government did not follow through this bid given the financial implications to
the power sector of such a project. Moreover, it considered that installation of such a power plant would
duplicate the existing privately-owned back-up generating capacity. These total about 100 MW and have
- 20 -



been the source of supply for about 77 percent of the larger businesses during the shortage of grid-based
supply.
The above analysis assumes that energy losses will decline from the high level of about 35 percent in 2000
to about 25 percent by 2005, as forecast by EdF. Reduction in the level of losses is critical for the viability
of the project. Therefore, the project includes the rehabilitation of the most critical elements of the
transmission network and the installation of a SCADA to improve the management of transmission outages
with a view of reducing their impact on the economy. In the distribution network, major loss reduction
work is best left for the future private sector concessionaire. It is expected that by the time this project is
operational in late 2003, the private concessionaire will have initiated loss reduction programs mainly
through reduction of theft, but also some rehabilitation and extension of the network. In the meantime, the
Uganda Electricity Distribution Company is implementing an AfDB-fmanced loss reduction program in
Kampala which is expected to be completed ahead of this project in 2003.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Key lessons learned in the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Power project:
Lesson 1: Bank's over optimism about UEB's implementation capacity led to an unrealistic
timetable for project implementation.
* Reflected in design: The project will finance assistance for project implementation, including
procurement. Bidding documents for the project's main component and the pre-qualification of the
contractor were finalized before Board presentation.
Lesson 2: Measures to improve institutional and financial performance have to be initiated
up-front and they should be comprehensive. Weaknesses in power sector management, including
lack of autonomy and commercial orientation of UEB's operations, should have been addressed.
* Reflected in design: The Government already has initiated a comprehensive reform and
privatization program. In line with the agreed implementation plan for the privatization of the
power sector, the Government restructured and unbundled UEB before Board presentation. A
major tariff increase was approved before the project began implementation.
Lesson 3: The Bank should have been more decisive in enforcing compliance with financial
covenants, especially the covenant requiring UEB to maintain an agreed relationship between
accounts receivable and its annual operating revenues.
* Reflected in design: The proposed project requires that the Government take key actions
regarding sector reform and tariffs before implementation begins. Furthermore, the commercial
orientation of the power sector entities should improve with the ongoing privatization. As the
public sector will implement the proposed project, prior to turning the operation of the system to
private concessions, the project will focus on ensuring that an adequate public sector management,
with accountability, is in place.

Global lessons
Three main lessons emerge from the Bank's power sector operations:
Lesson 1: Increasing private participation relieves Government budgets, improves service quality
and expands access.
*   Reflected in design: The Government has successfully initiated the reform and privatization of the
power distribution and generation businesses. The proposed project will aid this privatization
through improving supply capacity.
Lesson 2: Implementing reform requires political commitment.
*   Reflected in design: The Government has demonstrated its commitment to reform by starting the
implementation of a satisfactory Power Sector Reform and Privatization Program, including the
enactment of a new Electricity Law and the unbundling of UEB.
Lesson 3: Expanding access to modern energy requires specific focus on reform design and
implementation.
e   Reflected in design: The government has adopted a satisfactory commercially-oriented approach
towards rural electrification -- with the government playing the role of a market enabler. The main
elements of this strategy are: (i) level playing field for private sector participants; (ii) enabling
regulatory framework; (iii) cost recovery and cost-based tariffs; and (iv) transparent subsidy
transfer and financing mechanism.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to a coherent power sector reform strategy and
to the proposed project. Uganda's very good track record for implementing the macroeconomic reform
program, is now being followed by similar performance in utility sector reforms. The expression of
Government commitment at the highest level (the President) in favor of ambitious privatization, has made
possible the achievements to date. The private sector and Parliamentarians have also endorsed the
privatization process, on the condition that their concem about transparency will be addressed. The recent
privatization of Uganda Telecommunications Ltd. (UTL), with bids awarded in February 2000, gave
further testimony of GOU's commitment to address these concems.
In the power sector, the Government has recently completed recruitment of an investment bank for
marketing and closing the transactions of the generation and distribution privatization. Preparatory work
for UEB restructuring and privatization began in April 2000. Since that time the Government has
completed the following activities:
* Inventory and valuation of UEB assets and liabilities;
* Analysis of the investment needs of the power sector;
* Legal and environmental due diligence work;
* Preparation of pro-forma financial statement;
* Creation of financial and tariff models for the successor companies and future concessions;
* Drafted concession contracts, licenses, power purchase agreements and regulations required to
affect the privatization and handed-over these to the Electricity Regulatory Agency (ERA);
- 24 -



*   Made recommendations on tariff adjustment and restructuring to the ERA;
* Completed unbundling of UEB into three separate corporate entities;
* ERA has approved a 70 percent tariff increase and improved the structure of tariffs by eliminating
cross-subsidies from industries to households.
As an indication of its commitment to the project, the Government has accelerated project preparation over
the past months. Following the appointment of UEB's new management team in the middle of 1999, the
preparation of the project's power system components picked up speed. Procurement is now well advanced.
Consultants for the design and supervision of the project are in place. Contractors for the installation of
Units 14 and 15 have been pre-qualified and bidding documents are being issued. Bids for the transmission
rehabilitation components have been received. A project manager and an environment officer have been
appointed. Finally, UEB, from its own resources, has financed a preliminary assessment of the power
sector's financial position. Both implementing agencies prepared their respective draft project
implementation plans ahead of negotiations. Similarly, MEMD has accelerated its preparation. A
competent project coordinator is in place. MEMD is in the process of engaging a consultant to prepare
bidding documents for the petroleum monitoring equipment; it has drafted a training plan for the first year;
prepared draft TORs for the studies included in the project; and improved its procurement filing
arrangements as agreed with IDA. MEMD has also facilitated quick turn-around time on decisions
requiring co-ordination with other Government agencies.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The key value added arises from the Bank's experience in sector refonn and privatization. Bank
participation has helped to accelerate reform. Several donors (NORAD, DflD, GTZ, SIDA, JICA, AfDB,
NDF, DANIDA) have assisted the Government and the UEB in financing needed investments and providing
technical assistance to sector reform. However, the Government needs the financial and coordinating
resources of the Bank to implement a broad based sector reform, such as the privatization of UEB. The
Bank has also facilitated the adoption of an optimal power sector expansion sequence to meet demand.
This is particularly important as the project is located in an international waterway. Bank involvement has
also served as a catalyst for securing other donor financing to the project. Finally, Bank participation will
increase transparency in procurement.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
* Cost benefit    NPV=US$32 million; ERR = 20 % (see Annex 4)
o Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
A. Economic Analysis of Generating Units 14 and 15
The economic analysis for the project includes: (i) a cost-effectiveness analysis for the expansion of the
power system to bridge the electricity supply deficit in an interim period before the next major hydropower
plant is commissioned: and (ii) a cost benefits analysis to calculate the economic intemal rate of return to
the project's proposed investments.
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
The cost-effectiveness analysis in Section D showed that the installation of Unit 14 at Kiira is the least cost
- 25 -



means of meeting demand in the interim period before the next major hydropower plant comes on stream.
However, the analysis also showed that viability of Unit 15 will depend on water flows and has a 60
percent probability of not being the least-cost solution. As a result, its installation should proceed only if
water flows continue at high levels or if there is a postponement of the next major hydropower addition.
Thus, the project has included this unit as an option only. The unit's actual inclusion in the project will be
subject to the confirmation of the unit's economic viability towards the end of the year 200 1.
Economic Internal Rate of Return
The basis for the evaluation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) on the proposed generation
investment is a comparison of the incremental economic benefits of the project with its economic costs.
Economic benefits. The analysis has valued the economic benefits in terms of incremental electricity sales
that the project will make possible relative to the lower level of sales that that would result with no new
capacity addition to the system. These incremental sales are equal to the output from the project after
adjusting it for transmission and distribution losses. Depending on water flow levels, the project can
produce up to 100 GWh per year. The value of this incremental electricity varies among different groups
of electricity users. To account for these variations, the analysis divided consumers into two groups --
residential and non-residential. These two groups correspond to the categories in the electricity tariff
schedule and EdF's load forecast. Currently, about 44 percent of electricity sales go to the residential users
and 56 percent to non-residential. However, EdF's load forecast estimates that the composition of sales by
2010 will change to 42 percent residential and 58 percent non-residential. The economic analysis has taken
this new configuration into account. In addition to meeting domestic demand during the period before the
commissioning of the Bujagali IPP, the project would also make available surplus energy that could be
exported after Bujagali begins meeting Ugandan demand. The economic analysis has added the eamings of
these exports to the project's benefits.
Value to residential consumers. The analysis estimates the value of the incremental electricity to the
residential consumers as the area under their demand curve for electricity. Since the shape of the true
demand curve is not observable, the analysis assumed a semi-log demand function of the form: Q = A + B
In P, that passes through two points. The first point at the "upper" end of this demand curve is the
price-quantity pair of altemative energy sources. This point represents consumers willingness to pay for
higher valued uses of electricity (such as lighting). For residential consumers, this alternative energy is
kerosene. The second point at the "lower" end of the demand curve is defined as the price-quantity pair
denoting the quantity of electricity that households use at UEB's marginal tariff rates. This area under the
demand curve provides an estimate of a consumer's annual economic benefit in US$. On the basis of these
benefits and the incremental electricity demand as forecast by EdF, the analysis estimated the average
benefit per incremental kWh served at about US$0.1 8/kWh.
Value to non-residential consumers. The value of the benefits to non-residential consumers derives from the
cost that these users would incur if they had to meet their electricity needs by operating existing back-up
diesel generators in their own premises. This avoided user cost is an estimate of the operating costs of the
mix of different sizes of diesel generators installed in Ugandan industries. The analysis estimated this cost
at US$0.23 per kWh.
Economic costs. The incremental costs are the difference between the power system costs with the
proposed pToject investments and the system costs without these investments. The economic costs of the
proposed project include: (i) investment cost in Units 14 and 15; and (ii) incremental operation and
maintenance costs. The investments in capacity that will become available before the project, as well as the
- 26 -



investment and operating cost of the Bujagali IPP are the same in both cases. The analysis expresses all
costs in end-year 2000 prices, net of taxes and duties.
EIRR. The analysis calculated the EIRR at 22 percent for unit 14 and 18 percent for unit 15. The
estimation of net present values (at 12 percent discount rate) are $16.8 million and $8.7 million
respectively.
Sensitivity Analysis
This sensitivity analysis indicates how the EIRR would change relative to modifications in the planning
assumptions and key variables. The results show that the EIRR remains robust relative to the changes in
project capital cost, export revenue, a delay in the commissioning of the project, and a 25 percent reduction
in the economic value of incremental electricity consumption. In sum, all reasonable changes in key
variables produce an acceptable EIRR for Unit 14, exceeding the 12 percent opportunity cost of capital
necessary to justify the project for financing. However, the results also show that Unit 15 is very sensitive
to changes in the available water flow - which affects its output - and estimated benefit values.
Risk Analysis
The project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are mostly external and outside the
control of project design. The major risks concern: (i) hydrology; (ii) project cost estimates; (iii) export
sales; and (iv) scheduling. In addition, the timing of Bujagali would have a major impact on the project's
viability -- postponement of Bujagali increasing the EIRR. The risk analysis also considered the impact of
the proposed Kakiira bagasse plant, which the Energy for Rural Transformation project is planning to
finance. The graph below shows the probability distribution of the expected EIRR for Units 14 and 15.

The above probability distribution of the expected EIRR shows that the range of EIRRs for both units is
rather broad ranging from I percent to 32 percent for Unit 14. This broad range reflects the impact of the
available water flow. However, the analysis indicates that the chance of the EIRR falling below 12 percent
is an acceptable 5 percent for Unit 14, while it is 13 percent for Unit 15. The expected EIRRs for both
- 27 -



units are slightly higher than the EIRRs from a deterministic evaluation because the probability
distributions are positively skewed. The probabilities assigned to the risk variables are discussed in Annex
4.
B. Economic Analysis of Transmission Rehabilitation and SCADA components
A separate cost-benefit analysis calculated the economic viability of the project's transmission rehabilitation
and SCADA components. The basis for this analysis is the findings of UEB's consultants (NORPLAN),
who studied the rehabilitation requirements of the transmission system. The project includes those
investments that the consultants and UEB identified to be the most critical for improving the system's
reliability and reducing losses.
Rehabilitation of Grid Substations
The major benefits of the rehabilitation of the transmission substations are: reduction of service
interruptions (system outages) to improve the reliability and stability of the power system; and the
increased capacity of the substations to meet increasing demand.
Installation of SCADA
The main benefits of extending the SCADA system are: the reduction in energy lost during outage as a
result of faster fault identification and restoration of supply; and the reduction of the cost of operating the
power system as a result from a shift from manual to automatic operation. Over the longer term, the
SCADA system could incorporate an Energy Management System (EMS) that would further enhance
performance and facilitate the monitoring of spot prices in a deregulated power market. The design of the
system that the project will install, will enable such future extension.
Rehabilitation of the Nalubaale Switchyard
The work at Nalubaale will consist of replacement of old circuit breakers and transformers. All this
equipment is about 46 years old and past its expected average economic life of 25 years. The poor
condition of the transformers, which use an inefficient water cooling system, is exacerbated by the fact that
they have been overloaded since the Nalubaale generators were upgraded from 15 MW to 18 MW in the
middle of the 1 990s. The main benefit of the rehabilitation is the avoidance of loss of supply due to a
faulty transformer or a circuit breaker.
The worst case scenario would be that of a circuit breaker failing to open on a fault and resulting in
cascaded tripping of other generators and subsequent black-out. Whereas the length of time it would take
to restore supply after a black-out is known, it is difficult to determine a reasonable probability of for the
black-out. The analysis, therefore, considers a scenario where two of the 10 old transformers fail over a
period of 5 years within the next 10 years. This is an optimistic scenario, considering the age of the units
and the poor condition they are in, and it would not be unreasonable to expect more of them to fail. Should
a transformer develop an winding fault, it would take at least 6 months to get a replacement.
The estimated EIRRs for the three components are:
Component:                                                 EIRR

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ -11 million; FRR = 8 % (see Annex 4)
The NPV is calculated at 12 percent discount.
Financial Aspects of Power Sector
Past Financial Performance (1996-2000). The UEB has had difficulty raising enough funds to: Cover its
operation and maintenance costs; meet its debt service requirements; and make a reasonable contribution to
its investment program. As a result, the company has deferred the maintenance of its investment capital
and system losses have remained high. UJEB also suffered from revenue shortfalls due to poor collection
rates and inefficient operations.
The Government took decisive action when it recruited a new management team with private sector
experience and a more commercially-oriented focus. It replaced five key management positions at UEB
with external experienced staff, including the Managing Director who was appointed in April 1999. This
team has made significant improvements to UEB's operational and financial perfornance. Its
achievements during the past eighteen months include:
* Increased domestic cash collection by about 40 percent from USh 61.7 billion in 1998 to USh 86.7
billion in 2000;
* Increased billing for domestic consumption of about 33 percent, from Ush 73 billion in 1998 to
Ush 97 billion in 2000. Average domestic revenue per kWh in US dollar terms, however, declined
between 1998 and June 2001 by 23 percent, to 5.2USc/kWh at present due to the depreciation of
the Uganda Shilling vis-a -vis the US Dollar. The average revenue increased to about 9.5
Usc/kWh, the June 1, 2001 tariff increase;
- Reduced network losses from 35% to about 33%, as a result of meter audits and installation of an
improved billing system;
* Reduced administration and overhead expenses;
* Retrenched 1,100 staff; and
*   Increased debt service payments to the Government from UShl.5 billion in 1999 to USh7.4 billion
in 2000.
The above improvements are commendable. Yet, UEB receives no compensation for approximately 40
percent of the energy it sends out to the domestic market, due to system losses, uncollectible bills, illegal
connections, etc.. Thus, Power sector management still faces considerable challenges, such as: (i)
reducing high total system losses; (ii) meeting the significant investment for the network, especially for
distribution facilities to expand access to new consumers; (iii) further improving cash collection for energy
consumption to reach an optimum target of about 98 percent; and (iv) reducing accounts receivable to a
more economic level of 45 days of annual billing (which is 145 days at present). Table 4.1 below
illustrates the power sector's performance from 1998 to 2000.

Power Sector Reform and Financial Policies. In accordance with the Government's power sector reform
strategy, in April 2001, the Government divided UEB into three autonomous operating companies -
generation, transmission and distribution. While the Government plans to own and operate the
transmission company, it will turn over the distribution and generation businesses to private sector
operators who will operate them as concessions and also take responsibility for making new system
investments. The Government will call for bids to establish distribution and generation concessions in June
2001. The selection of the winning bidders should take place by November 2001, with the takeovers
targeted for early 2002.
The proposed project will begin implementation before the completion of the concession arrangements.
Until that time, UEB's successor companies will continue to operate on a consolidated basis. Thus, this
financial analysis and projections for the power sector serve mainly as a proxy for the sector's expected
overall financial performance. It takes into account the proposed restructuring of UEB's debt, which the
Government has allocated the three successor companies. The analysis also accounts for: anticipated
efficiency improvements from private sector operation of the distribution business; an expected increase in
customer connection rates; planned tariff increases; and the introduction of dividends and price-indexed
valuation of fixed assets resulting from the concessioning of distribution and generation.
In accordance with its power sector restructuring program and as a basis for proceeding with the proposed
project, the Borrower made commitments with regard to the following three issues: increasing tariff levels;
adopting an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to account for inflation and exchange rate movements;
and setting up a satisfactory mechanism to ensure that Government agencies and parastatals remain current
in their bills for electricity consumption. Progress to date has been adequate and the Borrower has
- 30 -



delivered the following:
*   ERA has approved a 70 percent increase in the average level of the retail tariff;
*   ERA has approved the establishment of an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to ensure that
the retail electricity tariff will not erode due to the effects of inflation and exchange rate
movements;
* One of UEB's largest debtors, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation, has settled its
electricity arrears and is now current in its payments; and
* The Government has made progress in settling the electficity arrears of Government entities:
-The Treasury has improved the performance of releases against budget estimates in the
present financial year. In past years, the value of funds the Treasury released to Government
departments often fell short of their budgets for electricity consumption. As of end March
2001, the Treasury had released 75 percent of the budget estimates of electricity supply for the
year. Government is therefore on track to achieve a 100 percent performance of releases
against budget estimate for electricity supply for fiscal year 2000/2001;
-Since June 1999 the Government has operated a 'commnitment control system', meaning that
Governnent departments are not permitted to reallocate funds budgeted for electricity supply
to other expenditures. The improved performance in releases and the commitment control
system together are significant progress towards ensuring that new arrears do not accrue in
fiscal year 2000/2001.
-The Government has agreed to settle all outstanding arrears for the fiscal year 1999/2000
before the end of June 2001, and prepare an action plan to ensure that Government agencies
stay current in their electricity payments even beyond fiscal year 2000/2001.
Future Prospects. The financial analysis indicates that a 40 percent increase in the average retail tariff by
mid-2001 is the minimum necessary to ensure the financial sustainability of the sector (this assumes some
restructuring of UEB's debt). Tariffs, however, will need to increase further over the next couple of years
to ensure that sector entities are in a position to: (i) meet their increasing debt service obligations; (ii) pay
for the power purchase costs of the proposed Bujagali hydropower project and other IPPs; (iii) finance
from their own resources a reasonable proportion of investment needs; and (iv) provide adequate returns to
shareholders. On June 1, 2001, ERA approved a 70 percent increase to tariffs. This increase assumed no
restructuring at the power sector's debt.
In order to ensure the financial viability of the power sector for the sustainability of the project, the
financial analysis used the following financial targets to determine the sector's revenue requirements:
* Debt service coverage of 1.0 times in 2001 and 1.3 times from 2002 onwards of net operating
revenue before depreciation; and
* A current ratio of 1.0 times in 2001 and 1.2 times from 2002 onwards.

These financial projections indicate the likely financial performance of the sector overall, and the required
minimum retail tariff levels under a set of specific assumptions (Annex 5). ERA is determining the bulk
tariffs for generation and transmission, based on the allocation of UEB's assets and liabilities amongst its
successor companies. The ongoing financial restructuring of the power sector's existing debt portfolio will
play a key role in determining the revenue requirements of the new generation, transmission, and
distribution companies and thus, the required bulk tariffs for generation and transmission and retail tariffs
for distribution. Following the transfer of UEB's assets and liabilities and the conclusion of the concession
arrangements for the distribution and generation facilities, the Govermment, ERA, and IDA will review and
revise the above financial viability targets, as appropriate. The focus will be on ensuring that these targets
conform with: the sector structure; the contractual agreements entered into with generation and distribution
concessionaires; and with the efficiency and other financial targets that the Government will establish for
them.
On-lending of the IDA Credit
The Government will on-lend US $49 million of the proposed IDA Credit to the Uganda Electricity
Generation Company Ltd. (GENCO) The on-lent loan will be at 7.1 percent interest for a period of 15
years including 3 years grace. GENCO will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Fiscal Impact:
The fiscal impact of the project is positive. The Government would receive increased revenue mainly from:
* The VAT on additional electricity sales revenue earned by the power entities during the lifetime of
the project;
* Additional interest revenue and earlier repayments to the Government by the Generation and
Transmission Companies of loans from IDA, NDF, and NORAD for the Fourti Power Project;
and
*  Additional Corporate taxes.

3. Technical:
The proposed investments under the project are technically sound and their implementation will pose no
unusual demands on the staff or contractors of the power entities. The components do not involve any
unusual or unproven technologies. The project consists of extensions and improvements to existing, similar
systems, which UEB and its contractors have installed. The equipment that the project will procure and the
related installation are up to international standards. The specifications for procurement reflect these
standards. UEB and MEWD prepared the proposed project, in consultation with external consultants with
financing under the proposed project's PPF and the Third Power project. Bank staff have reviewed the
components and are satisfied that they will contribute to the achievement of the project's objectives.
4. Institutional:
Major institutional issues concern: (i) the overall project management capability of the power sector
entities, given recent unbundling of the sector into three separate comt.mies and the forthcorning
concessioning of the generation and distribution facilities; (ii) the project management capability of MEMD
in light of its shifting role in the reform process and its involvement in the implementation of several
- 33 -



projects; (iii) the effectiveness of the ERA; and (iv) the Government's management of the reform and
privatization process.
*   UEB has satisfactory project management and financial management and accounting practices in
place. The detailed project implementation arrangements are set out in the project's implementation
plan. In addition, the GENCO and TRANSCO will enter into a contract with UEB for project
management that will specify the implementation arrangements, including staffing. The Bank and
the Borrower do not expect the concession arrangement to affect the physical implementation of the
project;
*  Following the ongoing implementation of the regulatory framework, which the Electricity Act of
1999 stipulates, MEMD's focus is shifting towards the purely policy making functions. This
transition, combined with work on sector reform and the preparation of several investment projects
could possibly divert the Ministry's attention away from project implementation. As a safeguard,
the Bank and the Borrower have agreed on detailed arrangements for the Ministry's participation in
the project. These arrangements are available in the MEMD's project implementation plan. Also,
a dedicated project manager will oversee its execution;
*   The Electricity Act of 1999 also provided for the establishment of an autonomous power sector
regulator -- the ERA. The Government established the ERA in April 2000; the next step is to
make it fully functional. This will include: Providing it with the required financial support and
autonomy; enabling it to staff itself appropriately; and providing it with expert advice for
developing its conduct of business regulations, tariff and revenue methodologies, licensing
arrangements, and other elements of regulation. The project will provide support to these
objectives through technical assistance and training; and
v  A main challenge is of course the Government's management for the reform and privatization of the
power sector. The key issue is whether the process proceeds without major delays or set-backs.
To keep the process well-organized and coordinated, the amendment to the PERD Statute sets forth
a clear institutional framework and implementation arrangements for privatization. It clarifies the
institutional responsibility for privatization among the Minister of State responsible for
Privatization, line Ministers, such as the MEMD, and DRIC. Accordingly, the Minister of State
responsible for Privatization, under the MFPED, will assume full responsibility and accountability
for the privatization and utility sector reform program. The Government has streamlined the role of
DRIC to that of advising the MFPED and approving policies for the reform and privatization of
the public enterprise sector.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The executing agencies for the proposed project will be the two power entities that own and operate the
power system of Uganda, GENCO and TRANSCO. The UEB Statutory Corporation will assist in the
implementation of
GENCO and TRANSCO components. In addition, MEMD and the new power sector regulatory agency
(ERA) would receive technical assistance under the project.
Uganda Electricity Generation Company Ltd. (GENCO): Became a corporation with limited liability
under the Uganda Companies Act on March 26, 2001. The Government has full ownership of the
company. A Board of Directors supervises the company and the Government appoints the Board's
members. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is an Associate Dean at the Makerere University.
The GENCO has three departments: Technical Services, Operations and Maintenance, and Finance and
Administration. The heads of these departments report to the General Manager, who in turn reports to the
Board of Directors. The Operation and Maintenance Department operates Uganda's two existing
- 34 -



hydropower plants (Nalubaale and Kiira on the Nile river). The GENCO has a total staff of 201.
Uganda Transmission Company Ltd. (TRANSCO): This company incorporated with limited liability
under the Uganda Companies Act on March 26, 2001, as one of the successor companies to UEB. The
Government has full ownership of the company and selects the members of the company's Board of
Directors. The Chairman of the Management Board is from the private sector. The Company has five
departments: Finance and Administration, Secretariat, Operation and Maintenance, Transmission Systems,
and Audit. The heads of these departments report to the General Manager, who in turn reports to the Board
of Directors. The Company operates the national grid at voltage 33 kV and above, including the SCADA
system. It has a total staff of 253.
IJEB Statutory Corporation: A Board of Directors consisting of Government-appointed members
supervises UEB. The Chairman of the Board is from the private sector. UEB has 55 employees. The
Company owns isolated diesel generation and distribution systems and manages the implementation of
public power projects, including the proposed project. UEB will act as Project Manager for the project on
behalf of GENCO and TRANSCO. By retaining UEB as the sole manager of public power projects, the
Governnent wants to ensure that the Government's interests in these projects are looked after in a
consistent manner. This arrangement also results in resource savings.
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD): MEMD is responsible for the promotion,
development, strategic management, and the safeguarding of rational and sustainable utilization of energy
and mineral resources for the social and economic development of the country.
The Ministry has one Directorate consisting of the departments of Energy Resources, Petroleum
Exploration and Production, and Geological Surveys and Mines. Kilembe Mines, Uganda Electricity
Generation Company Ltd, Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd., Uganda Electricity Distribution
Company Ltd., and Uganda Electricity Statutory Company, all operate under the auspices of the Ministry.
The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) is an autonomous and independent body. Its administrative
head is a Chairman. In addition to the Chairman, it has a Board of four members. The Minister
responsible for Energy selects the Board members among the nominations made by Cabinet Ministers. The
Electricity Act 1999 stipulates the professional qualifications of the members.
4.2 Project management:
UEB will manage the project's power system expansion and rehabilitation components. The PIU located in
UEB has been in charge of the ongoing Third Power project for six years. This Unit has received
institutional support from the Fourth Power project and now includes a Project Manager, Procurement
Expert/Project Coordinator, Accountant, and an Environmental Officer. The Bank and the Government
have agreed on the terms of reference for the implementation team for the proposed project. The recently
recruited Project Manager has solid international experience making him well-placed to lead the Unit. The
project will finance the Project Manager, the Environmental Officer and assistance in construction
supervision. In light of the implementation experience of the Third Power Project these arrangements are
adequate for the proposed project.
To ensure effective implementation of the environmental monitoring plan, UEB has hired an Environment
Officer, who reported on duty on June 1, 2001. This officer will be located at the project site and be a
member of the PIU with the responsibility for the implementation of the monitoring plan, including the
preparation of quarterly reports of the monitoring activities. The Officer will cooperate with NEMA,
FIRRI, DWD, and local authorities. The Officer will monitor the implementation of the decommissioning
- 35 -



plan as well as the mitigation measures originally planned under the Third Power project. This officer also
will be responsible for disseminating relevant information on HIV/AIDS and raise the awareness of these
issues among the workers employed by the project.
In addition, the main contractor will take over the Health Clinic that the Third Power project is providing.
The contractor will employ appropriate personnel to staff it and provide HIV-AIDS prevention information
and facilities, as well as disseminate relevant information on all sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

MEMD's project implementation capacity is limited, although it has experience implementing IDA's
Second and Third Power Projects. For the proposed project, MEMD has assigned the Assistant
Conmnissioner for Energy Efficiency to head the Ministry's Project Implementation Team. He will report
directly to the Permanent Secretary for Energy through the Commissioner of Energy and receive support
from an assistant coordinator with the Petroleum Division. The MEMD is in the process of appointing a
project accountant. The Bank and Borrower have agreed that appointment of the accountant would be a
condition of Credit Effectiveness. The Bank and the Borrower agreed on the TORs for the Implementation
Team at negotiations. During preparation, MEMD's ownership of the project has been high and
preparation progress satisfactory. These institutional arrangements are considered satisfactory, especially
given that MEMD will be executing only a small part of the proposed project (3.6 %). The implementation
of the Water Management Study will take place in close collaboration with the Ministry of Water and
Natural Resources.

4.3 Procurement issues:
In accordance with IDA procedures, a fortnal assessment of the procurement capacity and systems of the
UEB and the MEMD took place during the pre-appraisal mission for the proposed project. The assessment
concluded that UEB has the organizational and staff capacity to handle procurement following World Bank
guidelines and procedures. However, UEB's main weakness has been the lack of a  good record keeping
system, both at the project site (where the Project Manager will be based) and at the Head Offace (where
the Project Coordinator and Project Accountant will be based). The assessment found MEMD's capacity
to be weaker; consequently the Bank and the Borrower agreed on  measures to strengthen its capacity
though: the training of staff, both locally and within the region at ESAMI in Tanzania; improvement of
record-keeping; and appointment of a dedicated project coordinator. The Borrower appointed this
doordinator soon after  compani  Howeverway to set up a dedicated filing system for the project.
Both organizations have previous experience with procurement under IDA-financed projects. In addition,
both UEB and MEMD will receive assistance from consultants in the major procurement matters.
ahis assessment still stands after the unbundling of UEB, because UEB's existing Project Implementation
nit will execute the procurement for the power investment components.
4.4 Financial management issues:
5he financial management arrangements currently in place for projects managed by UEB and MEMD are
sufficient to comply with minimum IDA requirements. However, they are not yet adequate to provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the proposed project as required by
the IDA for PMR-based disbursements. The appraisal mission for the proposed project's prepared a plan
of actions necessary for compliance. The Bank and the Borrower agreed on this plan during negotiations
and its implemnentation is progressing satisfactorily. Annex 5 provides details of the Financial Management
Assessment. This assessment was carried out on the Uganda Electricity Board, which has recently been
divided into three different companies. However, since the implementing agencies for the project (GENCO
and TRANSCO) will contract UEB to manage the project, including its financial management aspects, the
above assessment is still valid.
5. Environmental:                   Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparafion (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The Government completed an Enviromnmental Analysis (EA) for the project in April/May 1999 in
- 37 -



consultation with stakeholders. In June 2000, a Bank pre-appraisal mission visited the project area. The
mission met with Govermment officials and environmental groups to discuss the content of the EA and an
Environmental Monitoring Plan. The findings of this pre-appraisal mission have been incorporated into the
final EA report dated August 31, 2000.
The pre-appraisal mission confirmed the main finding of the EA -- that the project would not have any
major environmental impacts because it did not involve the construction of new structures. The proposed
project would install two generating units in an existing power house. There were some initial
environmental concems related to the proposed Project. These included: (i) mosquito breeding; and (ii)
uncontrolled future growth of the water hyacinth, which could impair water discharges. However, the
Bank mission concluded that these potential threats would not materialize for several reasons. First, the
proposed project will install the generating units in two existing bays, which are currently covered by steel
plates. Thus, there will be no open construction pits that could lead to mosquito breeding. Second, at the
time of the pre-appraisal mission, UEB had almost eliminated the water hyacinth in the project area,
through mechanical removal, and had put in place adequate safeguards to prevent its future growth. These
safeguards include: (i) water hyacinth harvesting equipment at the power station; (ii) construction of a
concrete-surfaced road at Rippon Falls (upstream of the Kiira power station) for safe removal of the wet
water hyacinth by truck; (iii) installation of a water hyacinth boom in Rippon Falls; (iv) a safety boom at
the entrance of the power canal; and (v) a floating boom before the Kiira power station intake structures.
The project will not involve resettlement or cultural heritage issues.
The only environmental mitigation measure required under the project is a decommissioning plan for the
project (including restoration of the project area) based on an environmental audit. The preparation and
implementation of the decommissioning will take place at the end of the project. Such a plan is a
requirement under Ugandan law. It will involve the removal of temporary infrastructure such as sewage
lines, electricity lines, buildings, construction materials, used oils etc.. The scope of the decommissioning
plan will depend on the amount of temporary infrastructure from the Third Power Project to the proposed
Fourth Power Project. The scope of the deconmmissioning will become clearer towards the end of the Third
Power Project. Transferring the use of facilities from the Third Power to the Fourth Power Project will
eliminate any negative environmental impacts due to the demobilization and remobilization of construction
contractors to the site, and minimize the risks associated with construction and rehabilitation services.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is not required for the project, since the EA report has
indicated that the installation of the two generating units would not have negative environmental impacts.
However, the project will include an Environmental Monitoring Plan as well as related capacity-building.
The Environmental
Monitoring Plan will focus on water quantity and quality, the biology and ecology of fish populations, silt
accumulation and its removal, and shoreline stability. The plan will thus address the issue of vulnerability
of Lake Victoria to fish processing factories along its shorelines, the number of which may increase as a
result of the improved power supply from the project. The plan will also monitor the implementation of the
decommissioning plan. To the extent necessary, the Environmental Monitoring Plan will include mitigation
measures related to the Third Power Project (landscaping downstream of the old dam, and buttressing of
the old dam upstream). This plan is adequate to ensure effective implementation and build enviromnental
monitoring capacity under the proposed project.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:

5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
The Government conducted the EA in consultation with the officers of UEB and relevant authorities in the
public and private sector such as the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment, Kampala; the Fisheries
Resources Research Institute (FIRRI in Jinja), Enviro & Industrial Consult (U) Ltd., Makerere University,
the Assistant Commissioner, Survey and Mapping Division in Entebbe, and the National Environment
Management Agency (NEMA).
The pre-appraisal mission met with representatives of UEB, NEMA, FIRRI and the Water Resources
Department (WRD). In the development of the Environmental Monitoring Plan there was cooperation with
NEMA based on the discussions with the stakeholders.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
UEB will be responsible for implementing the Environmental Monitoring Plan. To do this effectively, it has
hired an Environmental Officer to be responsible for this activity. NEMA will exercise oversight of the
implementation as required by Ugandan law. The Environmental Management Plan, attached to the EA
Report, gives detailed parameters for the monitoring of water quantity and quality, fish populations etc..
These indicators, discussed with NEMA, reflect the objectives and desired outcomes of the plan, namely
safe and reliable power production at Kiira.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
*   Improving the quality of electricity supply and expanding the access to a greater number of people
in Uganda;
a  Restraining the rapid expansion of small, expensive and inefficient diesel generator use by
industries and businesses; and
3   Contributing to the reduction of poverty by removing one of the most significant obstacles to
private sector development -- limited and unreliable electricity supply.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Government: UEB and MEMD prepared the proposed project. Also, from the outset, there have been
consultations among UEB, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, the Ministry of Finance and
Planning and the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment during the preparatory work in order to
ensure effective participation.
Private Sector: The proposed Project's preparation included a survey of 243 randomly selected private
enterprises in 1998. The sample is representative for 5 major economic sectors: Commercial agriculture,
agro-processing, manufacturing, tourism, and construction. The survey identified inadequate
infrastructure, particularly the shortage of power, as the leading constraint to the expansion of private
sector investment in the economy. The survey's results led to the acceleration of the proposed project. The
Uganda Chamber of Commerce and the Uganda Manufacturers' Association have been consulted on the
project.
- 39 -



Various public and private stakeholders reviewed the new Electricity Act. The Government has taken their
comments into consideration in finalizing the Act. There have been other consultations with a variety of
groups, including potential private investors. The first investor conference took place in Kampala in June
2000 and a second one in London in October 2000.
Parliament and Civil Society: In April 1998, the Government organized a seminar on privatization for
members of Parliament as well as journalists and civil society to heighten their awareness of the process.
The design of the privatization process has taken account of this seminar's proceedings. In late 1998,
following concerns about the integrity, transparency and efficiency of the privatization program, the
Parliament launched comprehensive investigations. The findings of these investigations led to substantial
institutional reforms. The Parliament's collaboration was also essential to pass the relevant legislation.
Environmental Agencies: The Fisheries Resources Research Institute, the Enviro & Industrial Consult
(U) Ltd., Makerere University, the Assistant Commissioner, Survey and Mapping Division in Entebbe, the
Water Resources Department and the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) have been
consulted on the project. Their proposals have been included in the design.
Labor Unions: The Government has briefed the representatives of the labor unions and a Member of
Parliament for Workers on the sector reform and UEB's privatization. It has consulted with them on the
potential impact of the process on workers. Two key recommendations emerged: (i) the need to inform
workers of individual Public Enterprises early in the divestiture process and to keep them informed
throughout; and (ii) the need for fair and prompt payment of retrenchment benefits and severance to those
workers whose positions become "redundant" as a result of the process. The Utility Reform and
Privatization Project will address these concerns through its comprehensive communications program and
through the policy, guidelines and financing of retrenchment benefits.
Other Donors: During the preparation of the proposed project, the Bank and the Borrower have consulted
with donors supporting Uganda's power sector programs. NORAD and NDF are co-financing the project.
NORAD has already approved a credit for the project and NDF has scheduled the Board presentation of
its credit to July 12, 2001.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
The MEMD will carry out surveys of electricity consumers to follow-up on the project's development
impact (the project provides financing for these surveys). IDA and MEMD will consult with stakeholder
organizations during supervision missions. The co-financiers have agreed to participate in joint supervision
missions with IDA, as often as practical.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
N/A.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
It will carry out surveys of electricity consumers.
7. Safeguard Policies:
7.1 Do any of the following safeguard policies apply to the project?

Environmental Assessment: The Governnent has completed the EA and has developed an environmental
monitoring plan to be financed under the proposed project.
Safety of Dams. Strengthening of the old Nalubaale dam (formerly Owen Falls) is in progress under the
ongoing Third Power Project. The Government awarded a contract to remedy the possible problems with
the 1954 dam in April 2000. Work is on schedule for completion of the work in July 2001. The work
consists of: (i) constructing a Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) prop on the downstream side of the dam,
to counteract uplift forces; (ii) sealing the upstream section of the dam to reduce water sippage; and (iii)
drilling drainage holes. In addition, GENCO has an emergency preparedness plan in place for the
Nalubaale and Kiira dams. Finally, a consultant employed by GENCO monitors the condition of civil
works of the Nalubaale power plant, in particular the dam and powerhouse.
Projects in International Waters. In line with the cooperative spirit of the Nile Basin Initiative, the
Govermment, through the Bank, notified the Executive Directors representing the riparian countries of the
project on August 14, 2000. The Initiative, launched in February 1999, includes 10 Nile riparian countries
(Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and
Uganda). None of the above parties has objected to the proposed project.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The proposed investments will only be sustainable if the performance of the power sector improves. This
improved performance requires sector reformn to ensure that the power sector entities operate according to
sound business principles. The proposed project is part of the Government's overall power sector reform
strategy. The Bank's CAS aims to help the Government implement the reforms and promote private
investment that will ensure a sound financial basis for the power sector. In line with this strategy, the
process of privatizing UEB's distribution business and generation has started.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found in the fourth column of Annex 1):

Unfavorable hydrology conditions            S         Hydrology is a substantial risk for Unit 15. A
study to confirm hydrological conditions will
take place in connection with the review of the
viability of Unit 15. Given the probability of
low hydrology, the project may abandon the
construction of Unit 15. Hydrology is a lower
risk for Unit 14.

for the NORAD financed transmission
components and it is preparing the bidding
documents for the NDF financed components.
Furthermore, the Borrower has taken several
steps to strengthen implementation
arrangements. First, UEB's Project
Implementation Unit has adequate staffing,
including a Project Manager, an accountant, a
procurement expert, and an Environmental
Officer. Second, MEMD has engaged a full
time Project Coordinator and has allocated
adequate budget resources for implementation.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Some NGOs are questioning the environmental sustainability of hydropower development along the Nile
River, in particular the planned Bujagali project. Although the proposed project has no negative
environmental impacts, it might receive heightened attention from environmental groups because of
Bujagali.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
UGANDA: FOURTH POWER PROJECT
By Component:
Project Component I - US$83.91 million
Power System Expansion and Rehabilitation (Part A)
Installation of Units 14 and 15 at Kiira. The Kiira (Owen Falls Extension) power plant was designed for
5 x 40 MW units comprising propeller turbines and synchronous generators (please refer to illustration of
Kiira at the end of this annex). Two of these units (11 and 12) were installed under the Third Power
Project (commissioned August, 2000) and work to install the third unit, Unit 13, is underway. The canal,
dam, spillway, power house and transmission system extensions to cater for all 5 units were completed
under the Third Power Project.
The project will finance the supply and installation of the remaining two 40 MW units and associated
equipment at Kiira Power Station. The supply and installation contract will consist of:
* Two propeller turbines and govemors.
Two synchronous generators and exciters.
Hydromechanical equipment (gates, gate guides, hoist and trashracks).
3 Concrete embedment and grouting works for the two turbines.
3  Unit transformers and switchyard extension equipment.
The equipment and minor civil works required will be included in one supply and installation contract.
Completion of the Installation of Unit 13 at Kiira
*   Civil Works, comprising embedment and grouting works for the two turbines. The project will
provide retroactive financing for the works, which will be undertaken by the civil works contractor
for Units 11 and 12, whose contract has been extended.
v  Hydromechanical Equipment, comprising gates, gate guides, hoist and trashracks. As for the
civil works, the work will be undertaken by the hydromechanical contractor for Units 11 and 12,
whose contract has been extended.
Upgrade of SCADA and Telecommunications System. Under the Second Power Project, NORAD and
NDF funded a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system in 1994. Since then, UEB
constructed several other substations, but they are not yet connected to the SCADA system. The project
will therefore include the supply and installation of SCADA, and corresponding telecommunications
extensions for these substations, supply of spare parts, and training of UEB personnel.
The work will cover 132 kV and 33 kV substations between Kampala and Jinja, Soroti in the East, Lira in
the North and Mbarara, Masindi and Nkenda in the West, and will comprise the following:
* Modifications at the System Control Center to upgrade the software and hardware and incorporate
the extensions.
* Installation of remote terminal units and data collecting equipment at each of the new substations.
- 51 -



* Extension of the telecommunication systems (power line carrier and microwave) to cover the
extended area of coverage.
System Rehabilitation, comprising critically needed improvements to ensure operational safety and
reliability, and efficient evacuation of the increased output from the power stations. Of particular concern
are the generator circuit breakers and transformers at the Nalubaale switchyard. First, the fault rating of
six out of the ten 132 kV circuit breakers could be exceeded when Bujagali is commissioned. Second, there
are no reliable spare units for the 46 year old generator transformers and spare paits for the circuit
breakers are not readily available. Failure of either could compromise the continuity of supply from the
whole system. The project would finance, in particular:
*   Replacement of six of the ten 132 kV circuit breakers at Nalubaale Substation, before additional
generation capacity is connected to the network, with circuit breakers of adequate fault rating.

Annex 4: Cost Benefit Analysis Summary

Net Benefits:                   32                -11               36
USS million                     20
IRR:                            20                 8
The above present value flows are for Units 14 and 15 combined. If only one unit is installed, the
economic and financial IRRs are 22 percent and 10 percent respectively. The present values of flows have
been discounted at 12 percent discount rate.
The present value of financial benefits is lower than that of economic benefits, because the electricity tariff
revenue is the basis for the financial benefits while the economic value of electricity consumption, including
consumer surplus, is the basis for estimating the economic benefits. The financial analysis was based on
the actual average tariff revenue as of June 1, 2001 of US cents 9.5 per kWh (excluding VAT). The
economic and financial costs are the same because there are no taxes or duties on the project's inputs.
Also, because all project inputs are imported, local costs are minimal - making shadow price adjustments
marginal.
The fiscal impact is calculated on the whole project, including the transmission rehabilitation and SCADA
components. The fiscal revenue includes VAT on electricity sales, corporate taxes, and the revenue the
Govermment will receive from the interest rate differential between the IDA credit terms and the comrnercial
on-lending terms that apply to the power companies.
If the difference between the present value of financial and economic flows is large and cannot be explained by
taxes and subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is warranted, e.g. "The value of financial benefits is less
than that of economic benefits because of controls on electricity tariffs."

Main Assumptions:
1. Load Forecast Assumptions:
The EDF's forecast, the basis of the economic analysis of the project, made the following assumptions.
*   GDP will growth at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent from the year 2000 to 2020. This
reflects the actual growth rate Uganda achieved over the period 1990 to 1999.
*     Industrial product will grow  at an average annual rate of 12.5 percent until 2005, and then
gradually decline to 7 percent after the year 2015. The justification of this growth path is that,
usually, the industrial growth is high in the early years of industrialization. However, it
subsequently declines following the development of the early growth opportunities that have the
major impact on increasing the size of the industrial base.
*     The household (residential) forecast assumes that with the easing of the generation constraint in
- 58 -



2000, new urban connections will increase from an actual level of about 9,000 per year in 1999, to
15,000 per year in 2000, and further to 30,000 per year by 2010. In addition, the Government's
rural electrification program would connect an additional 20,000 rural consumers per year. This
rate of connections will increase the electricity access rate from the current 4-5 percent of the
population to about 10 percent in 2010. The forecast also incorporated an estimated price effect
by constraining consurner's consumption to 6,5 percent of their disposable incomes. The use of
this method was necessary because there is no reliable data on the price elasticity of Ugandan
households. The "mature" consumption levels of residential consumers are: High income urban:
9,281 kWh/year; middle income urban: 2,966 kWh/year; and low income urban: 590 kWh/year.
*   The basis of the industrial and commercial forecast is the estimated income GDP elasticity of
demand -- ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 for industries and from 1.2 to 1.8 for the commercial sector.
These elasticities are broadly characteristic of economies at Uganda's stage of development. The
estimated price elasticity for these consumers' is about -0.2.
*   Non-technical losses are currently estimated at 12 percent of generation. The forecast assumes
that these will reduce to 4.5 percent by 2008 and remain constant thereafter.
*   Technical losses in the transmission and distribution network are currently above 20 percent. The
forecast assumes that these will reduce to 10 percent by 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.
3   The forecast included a 50 percent and 73 percent nominal tariff increase for the residential and
non-residential consumers respectively.
*   The forecasts predicts total energy demand to grow by 10 percent per year during the period
2000-2010 and by 8 percent thereafter.
2. Assumptions in the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and the Cost Benefit Analysis of Units 14 and 15
Economic Costs
All costs are in end-year 2000 border prices. The incremental costs of the project include: (i) capital
expenditures on the installation of the two Kiira turbines and generators, and ancillaries such as unit
transformers and switchyard extension equipment (US$ 23.7 million for unit 14 and US$ 19.2 million for
Unit 15); and (ii) operation and maintenance costs, estimated as 1.5 percent of cumulative
investments/year. Since the project involves only the installation of two generating units in an existing
powerhouse which does not require additional civil works, local cost components are negligible and thus the
analysis makes no shadow price adjustments to local costs.
Economic Benefits
The project's benefits are the incremental sales that the proposed investments make possible. The economic
value of these benefits varies among different groups of electricity users. This economic analysis has
estimated the value of the benefits for two groups of users: residential and non-residential users. In
addition, the economic analysis includes in the project's benefits earnings from the exports of the project's
surplus electricity.
- 59 -



Benefits to Residential Users. The analysis estimates the value of the incremental electricity to the
residential consumers as the area under their demand curve for electricity. Since the shape of the true
demand curve is not observable, the analysis assumed a semi-log demand function of the form: Q = A + B
In P, that passes through two points. The first point at the "upper" end of this demand curve is the
price-quantity pair of alternative energy sources. This point represents consumers willingness to pay for
higher valued uses of electricity (such as lighting). For residential consumers, this altemative energy is
kerosene. Based on studies by ESMAP households generally use an average of two kerosene lamps for 5
hours per day. Assuming that one kerosene lamp is equivalent to a 40 W light bulb, this usage is
equivalent to 144 kWh per year. The average cost to the consumer of this kerosene lighting is about US$
0.42/kWh at a crude oil price of US$ 20/bbl. However, this level of kerosene use would not be affordable
for the lowest income groups, and hence, for these, the usage is assumed to be half or 72 kWh per year.
The second point at the "lower" end of the demand curve is defined as the price-quantity pair denoting the
quantity of electricity that households use at UEB's marginal tariff rates. The analysis used the same tariff
rates as the demand forecast. These included a 50 percent increase to UEB's year 2000 tariffs. The rates
are:
Monthly consumption less than 30 kWh:               USS0.017/kWh
Monthly consumption between 30 and 200 kWh:         US$0.058/kWh
Monthly consumption above 200 kWh:                  US$0.083/kWh
Monthly service charge:                             US$0.55/month
The analysis further disaggregated the projected sales to residential consumers among the three income
groups and four levels of consumption that EdF used in its load forecast. The analysis calculated the
benefits for a representative consurner in each income class and consumption level. These representative
consumer groups included users that are already connected to the grid but who will be increasing their
consumption and users that will be first connected when the project comes on line. The results show that
there is a difference between the economic value of electricity sales to consumers in different consumption
levels and income groups. For a high-income urban residential user who has reached a "mature"
consumption level (as defined in the EdF load forecast), the benefits are about US$1,600 per year,
representing about 13 percent of this consumer's annual income. In comparison, the benefits are about
US$402 and US$111 per year for middle and low-income users respectively. The benefit for the low
income consumer represents about 24 percent of the consumer's annual income. The annual economic
benefits of additional electricity that resulted from the above analysis were converted into average benefit
per incremental kWh served to allow the modeling of the project under different hydrological conditions and
scheduling scenarios etc.. The value of this average incremental benefit is US$0.1 8/kWh. Detailed
calculations are available in Project Files.
Benefits to Non-Residential Consumers. The basis for valuing the benefits to residential consumers is the
cost that these users would incur if they had to meet their electricity needs by operating existing back-up
diesel generators on their own premises. This avoided user cost is estimated on the assumption that a mix
of different sizes of diesel generators would be used for user-owned supply. The assumed capacities are
taken form Uganda import data for the period 1993-1997. The imported capacity was roughly equally
proportioned between units less than 75 kVA; between 75 kVA and 375 kVA; and units larger than 375
kVA. According to an industry survey in 1999, the average and median sizes of a back-up generators were
270 kVA and 140 kVA respectively.
Benefits from Surplus Exports. US cents 4.5 per kWh.

Fuelprices
The analysis assumed a base case crude oil price of US$20 per bbl. The risk analysis included US$15 and
US$25 (latter is OPEC target price). The Bank's crude oil price forecast predicts prices to fall from about
US$20.5 per bbl in 2001 to around $16 per bbl by 2005 (in 2000 prices). However, the confidence interval
(70/o) for the 2005 price is from US$10 per bbl to US$22.5 per bbl. Due to uncertainties and major
importance of short term prices on the analysis, a crude oil price of US$20 per bbl was used as a base case.
After adjusting the crude oil price for product differentials, transportation costs and taxes, the cost of diesel
fuel to industrial consumers is estimated at $0.62/A, which translates to about US$0.21 per kWh.
Oil transportation costs
* Pipeline from Mombasa to Eldoret: US$ 90.30 per tonne
*   Road (350 km) from Eldoret to Kampala: US$24.5 per tonne
Cost of back-up diesels
*  Estimated installed investment costs in Uganda vary from $300 per kW for very large units to
$900 per kW for residential sized units. A weighted average of $500 per kW is used.
3   Taking into account the effects of running at less than rated capacity, reduced efficiency with wear
and use of lubricants, the analysis assumes an average fuel consumption of 0.34 I/kWh.
3 Variable Costs (border prices) per kWh: Fuel: US$0.14; O&M: US$0.02; Total US$0.16
* The financial operating cost (consumer's cost) per kWh is estimated at US$0.23 per kWh. This
includes fuel, taxes, and operation and maintenance. This compares favorably with the 1999
survey of Ugandan industry managers, which suggested that the operating costs were about three
times the electricity tariff i.e. in the order of US$0.21 to 0.26 per kWh.
Cost of gas turbine power plant
*   $600 per kW of sent-out capacity is used after factoring in plant auxiliaries costs and de-rating for
altitude and temperature.
*  Fuel consumption (30 % efficiency based on size, altitude, humidity): 12.36 MJ/kWh = 0.01236
GJ/kWh
*  Variable costs (border prices) per kWh: Fuel: $0.115; O&M: $0.01; Total $0.125
Outputfrom Units 14 and 15
* At flows below 620 m3/s the project will not produce any additional energy since virtually all of
the flow can be passed through the existing hydro plants;
* At flows up to 820 m3/sec Unit 14 can provide up to 50 GWh/year;
* At flows above 1,020 m3/sec Units 14 and 15 together can produce up to 100 GWh per year.
* The "average" flow referred to in this report is defined as 1,004 m3/sec.

Network losses
*   Transmission and distribution losses retained at 25 percent of generation over the evaluation
period. This is the forecast level of losses in 2004, the first full year of the project's operation.
Economic life of assets:
*   Units 14 and 15: 35 years
The Hydrology Issue:
*   The viability of Units 14 and 15 is complicated by the uncertainty on future available flow from
Lake Victoria. Beyond the inherent variability of the natural weather cycle, this is a matter in
dispute among some of the consultants who have studied the problem - the Hydrology Issue. The
main point of contention is the validity of the historical flow record and its application to develop a
scenario, or scenarios for future flows. In brief, one view is that only the record since 1960 is
relevant - outflows from Lake Victoria to the Blue Nile since 1960 have averaged over 1,100
m3/sec., with a low annual flow of about 900 m3/sec. The contrary view is that the recorded flows
prior to 1960 are also relevant and thus, the average flow is only about 600 m3/sec. with an annual
low of around 500 m3/sec.. However, in the short-term, the lake outflow is controlled not only by
the natural inflow to the lake (the hydrological regime) but it is also strongly influenced by the
initial level of the lake. As of January 2000 the lake level was 12.20 m. The equivalent outflow is
1,130 m3/sec and even with an immediate onset of low inflows, the lake outflow would remain at
more than 900 m3/sec. for at least the next two years. In May 2001, the lake level had dropped
slightly to about 11.9 m with an equivalent outflow of 1,050 m3/sec.
-   To assess the merits of the additional units under these uncertain hydrological flows, independent
consultants carried out a Study during project preparation. The Study compared alternative
expansion plans for the Ugandan generation system under different hydrological conditions. The
key data required for the Study was the future lake outflow, i.e. the flow available for generation at
both Kiira and Bujagali. For Units 14 and 15, the flow available in the short-term (in particular
during 2003-5 (before Bujagali) is the most critical. For reasons discussed above, the Study did
not utilize the controversial historical outflow records but derived a total of 20 outflow sequences
by starting from the January 2001 lake level and applying to it the selected historical inflow
sequences. The analysis emphasized the more reliable inflow records of 1965-98 - neglecting the
extremely high 1961-64 inflows. Finally, the analysis applied the "Agreed Curve" to control
outflows.
3. Assumptions in the Economic Analysis of Transmission and SCADA Components

*   SCADA:                            12 years
*   Substations and transformers:     25 years
Operation and maintenance cost
*   Substations:                      1.5 percent of investment cost annually
*   SCADA:                            I percent of investment cost annually
Value of economic benefits
*  Residential users: US$ 0.18/kWh; non-residential users: US$ 0.23/kWh (the average benefit,
valued at transmission level is US$0.17/kWh)
* Cost of unserved energy due to un-announced outages: US$ 0.30/kWh
Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
1. Unit 14 and 15
The results from the sensitivity analysis show that the EIRR is robust to the changes in project capital cost,
export revenue, delay in commissioning, and 25 percent reduction in the economic value of incremental
electricity consumption. However, the results also show that Unit 15 is very sensitive to the available
water flow - it will not produce any benefits if the water flow is below 750 m3/sec. (at the end of May,
2001, the actual flow was about 1,050 m3/sec.). For Unit 14, all reasonable changes in the key variables
produce an acceptable EIRR, exceeding the 12 percent opportunity cost of capital that is used for project
justification. The demand forecast has only a marginal impact on the EIRR, because the project's output is
limited by the available water flows. The table below shows the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis.

2. Transmission Rehabilitation and SCADA Components
The transmission rehabilitation and SCADA components are robust to changes in key variables. The
switching values, i.e., values of key variables that produce a negative NPV (at 12 percent discount rate)
and reduce the EIRR to below 12 percent are: more than 20 percent increase in the capital cost; a reduction
in the estimated cost of unserved energy from UScents 30 to US cents 25 per kWh; and a 50 percent
reduction in the value to consumers of the benefit of additional energy.
However, the EIRR for the rehabilitation of the Nalubaale switchyard is very sensitive to the investment
cost and the value of benefits. A 20 percent increase in the investment cost would reduce its EIRR to 5
percent. Similarly, if the cost of unserved energy is only US cents 25 per kWh, the EIRR drops to 5
percent. However, the cost of this rehabilitation should be seen as an insurance because it is difficult to
estimate the probability of a total system failure that could result from the failure of the switchyard.
Should the switchyard fail, the whole country could loose supply with devastating impact on the economy.
After such a failure, it would take several hours to restore supply, and at least six months to fully restore
the supply.
Risk Analysis
The quantitative risk analysis of Units 14 and 15 assessed the impact on the project's economic returns of
uncertainty in underlying assumptions and predictions. To deal with this uncertainty, the analysis assigned
probabilities to the values of the key variables. The key risk variables and the probabilities of the values
these variables will assume in the future, emerged from the Bank's and the Government's estimates. Each
of the risk variables was matched with a probability distribution of its future values. The analysis assumed
this distribution to be triangular, i.e., it assigned a minimum, most likely, and maximum values to each of
the risk variables. The stochastic nature of the project's implementation was then modeled using a
commercially available risk analysis program. The model determined the expected EIRR and NPV with
their probability distributions through a "Monte Carlo" simulation process. The list of the risk variables
and the probabilities assigned to them is below:
Hydrological flows:
? 16 average to high flow scenarios (varying from 930 m3/sec to 1188 m3/sec. These represent flow
levels observed since 1965 but excluding the all time highs): 5% each;
* 8 low flow scenarios (varying from 605 m3/sec to 757 m3/sec. These represent flow levels
observed during 1925 to 1965): 2.5 % each.
Higher probability is given to the more recent higher flows because: the starting level of the lake, which is
input to all flow sequences is fixed at its current rather high level; and from a hydrological viewpoint it is
more likely that the higher post 1965 inflow pattem will continue as opposed to a reversion to the older
lower flows. The actual flow in end-May, 2001 was about 1,050 m3/sec.
Project capital Cost:
Base: 60%
+10% 10%
-10%   30%
The base cost is derived from the cost of Units II through 13, which were not competitively bid. Since

Units 14 and 15 will be procured through ICB, the probability of lower price is assumed higher than the
probability of higher cost.

Annex 5: Financial Summary
UGANDA: FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Executing Agencies and Accounting Responsibility:
The project has three implementing agencies: the Uganda Electricity Generation Company (GENCO), the
Uganda Electricity Transmission Company (TRANSCO), and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Development (MEMD). GENCO will be responsible for the implementation of the power generation
expansion and environmental monitoring components, TRANSCO for the transmission rehabilitation and
SCADA components, while the MEMD will be responsible for the components covering the power sector
development and reform and petroleum sector development and reform. GENCO will contract with the
UEB for the day to day implementation of the project, including for procurement and financial
management.
Institutional arrangements for GENCO, TRANSCO, and UEB: Both UEB as well as GENCO and
TRANSCO (the latter two were part of UEB until the April 1, 2001 restructuring), have experience in
managing World Bank financed projects, having implemented a component of the Third Power project.
UEB already has a well functioning Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the implementation of the Third
Power project, headed by a project manager. The accounting section of the PIU is headed by a Project
Accountant. The Project Manager reports to the Managing Director. Initially, the project's financial
management arrangements will be based on those for the Third Power project.
The project accounting function forms an intrinsic part of the UEB Corporate Finance Department. This
Department is headed by the General Manager, Finance and Information Systems. Reporting to him, the
Manager, Finance, is responsible for the supervision of the Department's project accounting function. This
function includes the Project Accounting Unit, which is headed by the Project Accountant who is
responsible for day to day project accounting matters, including the recording of transactions, maintenance
of proper books of accounts and the preparation of periodic reports for management, Government, and
Donors. The Unit also includes an Assistant Project Accountant, three Accounts Clerks, and a filing clerk.
The Manager, Information Systems has the responsibility for the overall information needs of UEB,
including the project. Responsibility for the Chart of Accounts, including that for project accounts, belongs
to the Corporate Accountant who reports to the Manager, Accounts. UEB also has an Intemal Audit
department whose function includes the inspection of project transactions. UEB is undertaking various
reforms including the recruitment of a Finance Manager who will supervise the project accounting function
and a review of the direct accounting responsibilities for project transactions.
Institutional arrangements for MEMD: MEMD's components will be implemented by the Department of
Energy. The Department of Energy is headed by a Commissioner. The Permanent Secretary, MEMD, is
the "Accounting Officer" for the project. This means that he has the overall responsibility for accounting
for the project funds for the MEMD's components. MEMD has appointed the Assistant Commissioner for
Energy Efficiency to be responsible for the implementation of the components of the Fourth Power project.
He will report to the Commissioner and the Permanent Secretary, MEMD. In issues relating to power
sector privatization, MEMD will consult with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
responsible for privatization.
MEMD is also the implementing agency for the IDA financed Third Power Project in addition to other
donor financed projects, and it is expected that initially the Fourth Power project will use the same financial
- 66 -



management arrangements that the Third Power project uses.
The accounting unit in the MEMD is headed by a Senior Accountant. Under the Third Power project,
responsibility for day to day project accounting matters lies with an accounts clerk who reports to the
Project Coordinator under the supervision of the Senior Accountant. However, this arrangement is not
suitable for the Fourth Power project because it has stronger accounting and staffing requirements than the
existing Third Power project. The reasons for these stronger requirements are the transactions resulting
from the management of a dollar denominated Special Account and the new disbursement arrangements.
Government has therefore agreed that it will appoint a suitable person with appropriate qualifications and
experience to take responsibility for the day to day accounting function for the Fourth Power project,
preferably at a grade higher than accounts assistant. MEMD has agreed to clearly demarcate and
document the accountant's duties within the Energy Department, including reporting lines, and supervisory
responsibilities.
Major accounting policies: MEMD prepares its financial statements on the basis of generally accepted
accounting principles. It accounts for transactions on an accruals basis.
Overall policy guidance for UEB: For the UEB, overall policy guidance for financial management
policies is handled at two levels: there is the Board of Directors, and a Management Board. The
Government appoints the Board of Directors, and they consider financial matters relating to UEB in the
meetings that they periodically hold.
Overall policy guidance for MEMD: A Financial Management Committee provides overall policy
guidance to MEMD. The Minister of State for Energy is its chairman and the company's senior
management team are its members. Suitable Terms of Reference for the Committee in relation to the
Fourth Power project will be drawn up as part of the agreed Financial Management Plan.
Books of Accounts: Both implementing agencies have accounting units responsible for the maintenance of
the books of accounts for their projects. These books are separate from those used for recording other
assets and transactions of the agencies and include:
a) Cash Book;
b) Ledgers;
c) Journal Vouchers; and
d) Fixed Asset Register.
Internal Controls: The MEMD uses the Government Treasury Instructions as documentation of its
financial management procedures. These are generic in nature and do not address specific procedures used
for project transactions. They do not also contain clear guidelines for the review of financial information
that is generated from the accounting system, and reporting lines for financial management are not defined.
MEMD has agreed to prepare a Financial Management Manual for the project. This Manual will
document the internal controls and accounting procedures to be employed in the financial management of
the projects.
For UEB, the audit report for the Third Power project for the year ended 31 December 1999, prepared by a
firm of auditors, notes that the company did not have significant weaknesses in its internal controls for the
project. The audit opinions on the Project accounts and the Special Account Statements were unqualified.
The UEB is currently updating the documentation of its accounting and internal control systems (in the
- 67 -



form of an accounting manual) to take into account the various reforms that it is currently undertaking in
its Finance Department and for the Fourth Power project.
Accounting system software: MEMD's current accounting system is a manual system. It records
transactions manually into books of accounts and reports, and produces analyses on computer
spreadsheets. Given the small size of the MEMD's project components, this system is sufficient for the
project.
UEB has installed the SunSystems software and a separate Project Module is also being installed which
will maintain project accounts. This module will have the flexibility to automatically produce project
management Reports (PMRs).
Books of accounts and list of accounting codes: Both GENCO and MEMD will maintain similar books
of accounts to those for the Third Power project. The books of accounts for the Fourth Power project
include:
a) Cash Book;
b) Ledgers;
c) Journal Vouchers; and
d) Contracts register
Both implementing agencies will also draw up a Chart of Accounts that will match the classification of
expenditures and sources and application of funds in the Development Credit Agreement.
Financial Reporting: UEB and MEMD currently regularly prepare quarterly reports on all projects they
implement and circulate them to funding agencies and management. The implementing agencies have
agreed to adopt a more structured approach and formats for this quarterly reporting for the Fourth Power
project. These reporting arrangements will form a suitable basis for the preparation of PMR's for the
project.
GENCO and IDA will sign a separate Project Agreement, in addition to the Development Credit
Agreement. As such, the Project Agreement will reflect the requirement of annual submission of financial
statements for the GENCO entity, in addition to the project accounts.
Audit Arrangements: MEMD and GENCO will have their accounts audited by a private firm of auditors,
that the Auditor General appoints. The final audit report is signed by the Auditor General and is based on
the private auditing firm's conclusions. With some exceptions in the meeting of agreed deadlines, both
implementing agencies have in the past submitted project accounts to the IDA as required by the terms of
the credit agreement. The implementing agencies will develop the terms of reference for the annual audit
and include them in their Financial Management Manuals.
Bank accounts: GENCO will open two bank accounts and a Special Account denominated in US dollars
for its project components. It will provide counterpart funds for project expenditures on the basis of
budgeted sums in its Operational Accounts. Its Financial Management Manual for the project will
document the required control procedures over all bank transactions.
MEMD does not currently manage a US Dollar Special Account under the Third Power project. For the
Third Power project MEMD operated a bank account denominated in local currency. It used this bank
account for payments in local currency below a certain level. It also made periodic transfers to it from
- 68 -



UEB's Special Account to cover payments of MEMD's project components.
Under the Fourth Power project, MEMD will open two bank accounts as follows:
*   Special Account: Denominated in US dollars, disbursements from the IDA credit will be deposited
on this account.
*  Project Account: For counterpart funds.
Project Documentation: GENCO and MEMD are currently finalizing their respective Project
Implementation Plans, which will address the following issues:
* Arrangements for recording inputs and outputs of financial information required to track project
implementation.
* Arrangements for recording inputs and outputs of physical information so that it will match the
financial information required.
*  Arrangements for recording project impacts, outcomes, outputs, and inputs that are required to
assess project progress toward project objectives.
The Project Management Reports (PMR): GENCO and MEMD will develop formats of the Project
Management Reports (PMR) required by the Bank under the Financial Management Initiative (FMI) in
accordance with IDA requirements.
Conclusion: Although UEB's and MEMD's current financial management arrangements for projects they
manage are sufficient to comply with minimum IDA requirements, they are not yet adequate to provide,
with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the Project as required by the
IDA for PMR-based disbursements. Both agencies agreed to a plan of actions to achieve this compliance
during negotiations. The implementation of this action plan so far is satisfactory. UEB has implemented
the majority of the agreed actions, including the completion of a draft accounting manual for the project,
opening of books of accounts and completion of Chart of Accounts, agreeing with IDA on financial
reporting formats, and opening of bank accounts. MEMD, on the other hand, is behind schedule. It is,
however, in the process of recruiting a project accountant and it has opened the required bank accounts. In
addition, as a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government has agreed to provide IDA with assurances
that UEB's successor companies will follow the agreed financial management arrangements for the project.
Furthermore, these arrangements should form part of the understanding reached between the Government
and the successor companies at the time of the privatization of the successor companies.
The Bank carried out the assessment of UEB's financial management capability before UEB was
restructured into three separate companies and it based its conclusions on the plans of the UEB to
strengthen its financial management system at that time. Since UEB will remain the key implementor and
guardian of the financial management arrangements for the project (under a contract with GENCO) even
after the restructuring, the Bank is satisfied that the financial management arrangements are adequate for
the project. However, the terms of the project management services contract between GENCO and UEB
need to state explicitly that UEB has the responsibility for the project's financial management, including
ensuring adequate staffing of its accounting department and computerization of the accounting function as
per the originally agreed financial management arrangements.

Main Assumptions
Principal Assumptions for Financial Projections (2000 to 2006)
General
The financial projections (2000 to 2006) are based on the latest available data and information obtained
from UEB and other appropriate sources. The base data for 1999 and 2000 was obtained from UEB's
audited financial statements for 1999 and its approved budget for 2000 and latest quarterly management
accounts to August 2000.
The Govemment has began the restructuring of the power sector. As a first step it divided UEB into three
corporate entities in late March 2001, one each for generation, transmission, and distribution. In a second
step, it will concession out to the private sector the operation and management of the generation and
distribution facilities. The three entities will continue to operate on a consolidated basis until the
concessioning has been completed. Since the proposed project will be under implementation prior to the
completion of the concessioning, the financial analyses for the project has been based on the unbundled
power sector for which data is available. The financial projections have considered appropriate financial
restructuring, efficiency improvements, dividends and price-indexed valuation of fixed assets.
Tables B through E above provide the "Base Case" financial projections. In addition to the "Base Case",
the analysis considered two alternative debt restructuring options which are provided in Table F at the end
of this section.
Macroeconomic Assumptions
The financial projections are prepared in current Uganda Shillings, using the following inflation and
exchange rate forecasts:
2000      2001      2002       2003      2004       2005      2006
Domestic inflation              5.0%      5.0%      5.0%       5.0%      5.0%       5.0%      5.0%

Ave ex rate (USh/IUS$)          1657      1873       1918      1965      2013       2062      2102
Ex rate at Dec 31 (USh/IlUS$)   1850      1895       1941      1989      2037       2087      2117
Source: World Bank
Exchange rates (USh to US$) have been estimated on the basis of inflation differential.
Energy and Sales
Forecast of energy requirements is based on the "base" case load forecast, as reviewed by Electricite de
France (EdF) in January 2001. The financial analysis restricts energy demand to available energy supply
due to hydrological constraints. Units 13, 14 and 15 at Kiira are assumed to be commissioned on January
1, 2003, October 1, 2003 and December 1, 2003 respectively. The first unit (50MW) of Bujagali IPP is
forecast to come on line on July 1, 2005 and the remaining units (150MW) are expected to be operational
- 76 -



on January 1, 2006. In addition, supply from the proposed Kakira sugar plant is assumed to go ahead and
come on line in 2003. The analysis further assumes that the level of losses will be reduced over the years
following investments in rehabilitation and reinforcement of the network and because of measures the
utilities will take to cut non-technical losses. Exports to Kenya are estimated at the existing contracted
supply of 1OMW (for 12 hours during peak and daytime) and 30MW (for 6 hours during off-peak
nighttime) up to June 30, 2005. Thereafter, exports to Kenya are assumed at the rate of 80MW firm supply
for 24 hours a day, based on 200MW supply from Bujagali. Exports to Tanzania (5MW) and Rwanda
(lMW) are assumed at current levels throughout the forecast period. For the years up to 2005, the analysis
assumes that the domestic market will take up the balance of available energy supply. The following table
provides a summary of forecast energy sent out, energy sales, sales growth and losses.
2000     2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006
Energy sent out (GWh)             1570      1591      1679      1831      1926      2127      2989
Energy sales: domestic (GWh)      877       1005      1091      1226      1324      1444      1672

Domestic Electricity Tariffs
The analysis assumed that the FY2001 weighted average domestic (i.e. excluding exports) tariff is
95USh/kWh (after this financial analysis was finalized, electricity tariffs were increased to 172 USh/kWh
on June 1, 2001). From 2002 onwards, the analysis assumes that domestic electricity tariffs are adjusted
annually for the effects of forecast inflation and exchange rate movements. For this purpose, the power
sectors' revenue requirements each year are split between foreign and local cost components, these average
67/33 for the first three years and 81/19 in 2005/06. The weighting of foreign cost component increases
significantly in 2005/06 due to the impact of the Bujagali hydropower project capacity payments.
In addition, the analysis rises domestic electricity tariffs in real terms to meet the following minimum
financial criteria over six years from 2001 to 2006:
* Debt service cover of 1.0 times in 2001 and 1.3 times from 2002 onwards of net operating
revenue before depreciation,
* A current ratio of 1.0 times in 2001 and 1.2 times from 2002 onwards.
Table F summarizes the required tariff levels and tariff increases over the next six years to 2006 under
three different financial restructuring options.
Export Tariffs
The following table shows the projected export tariffs used in the analysis:

The current contracted tariffs with Kenya (as shown in the above table under 2000) are assumed to be
renegotiated at lower rates, applicable from 2001 to 2005. A flat tariff of 6.8OUSc/kWh is assumed to
apply from the commissioning of Bujagali in 2006. The current contracted tariffs with Tanzania and
Rwanda is assumed throughout the forecast period, with no escalations for inflation.
Other Operating Revenue
Wheeling charges to Tanzania and Kenya are kept constant at present levels. All other operating revenue
(line rental, reconnection fees) is assumed to increase in line with domestic inflation.
Operating Expenses
Concession Payments. Until the concessioning agreements have been negotiated, it is not possible to
estimate with any reasonable accuracy the likely structure and level of concession fees and returns on their
investment. This analysis, therefore assumes that all payments by or to concessionaires will be met through
tariffs. The financial projections make the following allowances as from 2002:
3 Annual concession fees payable by concessionaires' to the Government is assumed at US$2.5
million from 2002 onwards.
* Return on concessionaires' investment is provided at 23%, less interest on debt financed element of
the investments. It is assumed that Concessionaires' equity capital is to be repaid over 10 years. No
separate provision is made for management fees payable to concessionaires.
Power Purchase and Imports. Power purchases from Bujagali are provided at take or pay fixed costs of
US$97 million for the first three years of supply. This analysis assumes that the first unit (50MW) of
Bujagali IPP will come on line on July 1, 2005 and the remaining units (150MW) will be operational on
January 1, 2006. Power purchased from existing co-generators is priced at current levels in US cents and
indexed for foreign inflation. Purchase tariff for Kakira sugar plant is assumed at a fixed cost of
5.5USc/kWh from 2003 onwards. Import tariffs are linked to export tariffs.
Fuel for Own Generation. Cost of fuel for own generation is provided on the basis of present
consumption rate and price expressed in US dollars. The latter is adjusted for forecast changes in
international fuel product prices and converted into U Shillings at forecast exchange rates.
Payroll Costs. Employee numbers are forecast to be reduced overall by 60 staff in 2001. Thereafter, one
new employee is added for every 1000 new customers connected to the UEB distribution system. Budgeted
monthly payroll cost per employee in 2000 is escalated in line with domestic inflation in future years. No
allowance is made for any "real" increases in pay.

Repairs and Maintenance for Operations. Repairs and maintenance costs for generation, transmission
and distribution are provided in terms of units of energy produced, sent out and sold in the domestic
market. Budgeted unit prices in 2000 are expressed in USc/kWh. In recognition of past inadequate
maintenance of the network, costs are assumed to increase in real terns by 5% annually from 2001 and
2002. Thereafter, costs are escalated in line with international inflation. The derived US dollar costs are
translated into U Shillings at forecast exchange rates.
Transport and Traveling. Budgeted 2000 costs are increased in real terrns by 10% in 2001. Thereafter,
costs are increased line with domestic inflation.
Administration and overheads. Budgeted 2000 costs are assumed to decrease in real terrns by 5%
annually from 2001 to 2003. Thereafter, costs are assumed to increase in line with domestic inflation.
Depreciation. Depreciation is provided on opening net revalued fixed assets at the following rates:
Existing at 12/31/99            Additions post 1999
Generation assets:
Civil works                                                                   1.25%
Plant & machinery                            2.85%                            2.50%
Transmission assets                           5.20%                            2.50%
Distribution assets                           5.58%                            3.33%
All other assets                              16.81%                           20.0%
Bad Debts and Obsolete Stock Write-off. Bad debts and obsolete stocks are assuned at the following
rates:
2000     2001     2002    2003     2004    2095    2006
Bad debts as % of current year billing  10%    8%       6%       3%       2%       1%       1%
Obsolete stock as % of closing stock  2%       1 .5%     1%      0.5%     0.5%    0.5%      0.5%
Retrenchment Costs. Provision is made for costs of projected retrenchment. Average cost of retrenchment
per employee is assumed at USh 6.7 million in 2000 prices. A provision of UShl billion was set aside in
1999 for costs of retrenchment in 2000.
Pension Liabilities. An actuarial valuation of UEB's pension liabilities up to end 2001 has been estimated
at UShI3.9 billion. For this purpose, an exceptional provision of UShl.5 bil'ion has been charged against
income in 2000.
-79 -



Non Operating Income - net. 1999 non-operating income is escalated in line with domestic inflation in
future years.
Corporate Income Tax. Provision is made for corporate income tax based on the present tax rate of 30%
and applied to taxable income according to current legislation. Deductions for capital allowances are based
on the recently announced rates. Tax liability, if any, is assumed to be paid 50% during the current year
and the balance in the next following year. In view of planned heavy investments during the forecast period,
it is unlikely that any corporate taxes will arise over the next seven years.
Dividends. Dividends (or returns) to concessionaires' are provided as from 2002 onwards. As indicated
above, return on concessionaires' investment is provided at 23%, less interest on debt financed element of
the investments. No dividends are provided on Governnent equity as the Government does not expect to
receive any returns on its investment in the power sector. It is assumed that 50% of all dividends are paid
during the current year and the balance in the next subsequent year.
Investments, Fixed Assets and Work in Progress. Projected investments and financing thereof are
detailed in the table below. Investments during 2001 to 2006 are provided at US$101 million for
generation, US$128 million for transmission and US$106 million for distribution. All new investments in
generation (purely rehabilitation) and distribution from 2002 onwards are assumed to be funded by
concessionaires through debt (75%) and equity (25%) funding. Investments in generation are restricted to
rehabilitation of existing facilities. Investments in new generation in the future are assumed to be
undertaken by IPP's.

Assets under construction are shown under work in progress in the balance sheet. Costs of assets, including
interest during construction, are transferred from work in progress to fixed assets on their commissioning.
Fixed assets in the audited financial statements were last revalued in 1997. Fixed assets in the projected
balance sheets are stated at revalued amounts. The latest valuation carried out by the transaction advisors,
is reflected in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2000. Preliminary estimates indicate a valuation of
US$454 million of all of UEB's fixed assets other than land, buildings, vehicles and office equipment. In all
future years, fixed assets are indexed to inflation and exchange rates, as forecast. Costs of all assets are
assumed to be split 70 percent foreign and 30 percent local.
Revaluation surpluses on fixed assets are taken to equity. All exchange losses on long-term loans are
set-off against fixed assets revaluation surpluses taken to equity.
New Connections, Customer Contributions and Deposits. New customer connections are forecast at
12,775 in 2000, 12,000 in 2001 and 15000 annually thereafter. The analysis does not consider new
connections through the rural electrification program as it assumes that Governmnent will finance such
investments in the future. Customer contributions and deposits per new connection are forecast at actual
1999 average and escalated by the projected annual average increase in electricity tariffs for the domestic
market. Customer contributions are classified as deferred long-tern liabilities. Deferred contributions are
amortized over 30 years, being the average life of distribution assets, and recognized as income in the
income statement.
Project Funds. Project funds in the balance sheet are retained at US$1.5 million equivalent throughout.
Investment in Amber House. The historical cost of investment in Amber House Limited (investment
holding company for UEB head office building) is retained in the balance sheet at constant value
throughout.
Security Deposit for Bujagali. The analysis assumes that Government shall place US$20 million into an
escrow bank account as security. The funds are to be built-up during construction of the Bujagali project.
Such a deposit has been set aside in two equal installments of US$ 10 million each in 2004 and 2005.
Accounts Receivable and Payable. Accounts receivable and payable at the balance sheet date are forecast
as follows:
2000    2001     2002     2003    2004    2005       2006

Note: The table shows the receivables and payables in number of days.
The analysis assumes that the Government and the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)
have settled their overdue electricity bills of Ush 14 billion and USh2.2 billion respectively in early 2001.
For GOU accounts, the settlement may be by way of exchange of cheques against UEB's debt service
obligations to GOU. The NWSC will settle its electricity accounts on the understanding that GOU will
settle its old dues to the water utility. It is further assumed that all GOU agencies will promptly pay their
electricity bills from 2001 onwards.
Other Debtors and Prepayments. Other debtors and prepayments as at 12/31/99 are assumed to increase
in line with domestic inflation in future years.
Stock. Stock of goods and materials at the balance sheet date is forecast at 3.0% in 2000, 2.5% in 2001
and at 2.25% thereafter of closing net fixed assets value.
Long-term Loans and Deferred Debt Service (principal and interest). Three financial restructuring
options involving UEB's existing debt portfolio (including deferred debt service) have been considered and
detailed in Annex 5, Attachment 3. In cases of existing on-lent loans where on-lending agreements between
GOU and UEB are not in place, terms similar to those previously negotiated and involving the same donors
are assumed. For all proposed future borrowing, the following terms have been assumed:
Fourth Power          Fourth Power             All other
(IDA)             (Co-financiers)         Investments

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
UGANDA: FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Procurement
General:
1.    Procurement of all goods, civil works, supply and installation of plant and equipment and services
to be financed under the IDA Credit will be procured in accordance with the appropriate Bank's
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, (January 1995 and as revised in January
and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). Consulting services by firms or individuals to be
financed by IDA will be awarded through contracts in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, (January 1997 and as revised in September
1997 and January 1999). The appropriate World Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for all International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) with any appropriate modifications,
will be used. The World Bank's Standard Request for Proposals (RFP) will be used for the selection of
consultants. For details on project costs by procurement arrangements refer to Table A.
Procurement Organization and Capacity Assessment:
2.    Procurement of all goods, civil works, supply and installation of plant and equipment and services
under the project will be the responsibility of the UEB and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Development (MEMD) with assistance from procurement consultants. The procurement capacity
assessment carried out at appraisal concluded that UEB has the general organizational and staff capacity to
carry out procurement under the proposed project. Most members of the implementation unit will comprise
of staff from the Third Power Project and several of the staff are already familiar with Bank procurement
procedures. In addition, UEB has recruited a project manager, with expertise in management of power
plant projects, and will strengthen the project accounting team.
3.    However, UEB's main weakness is the lack of a proper record keeping system, both at the project
site (where the Project Manager will be based) and at the head office (where the Project Coordinator and
Project Accountant will be based). UEB has agreed to take immediate action to implement good
record-keeping systems at both the project site and the head office.
4.    The detailed assessment for MEMD shows that the following actions are required to strengthen its
procurement capacity: (i) provision of procurement training (available within the region at ESAMI) for
members of the project unit; (ii) appointment of at least one dedicated member (coordinator) for the project
implementation unit; and (iii) implementation of a proper record-keeping system for the project. The
project coordinator has been appointed.
5.     Advertising: A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in the UN Development
Business (UNDB) on April 16, 2000. It indicated all the procurement contracts estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$100,000 or more where the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) method of
procurement would be used. The GPN will be updated annually. All consultancy assignrnents estimated to
cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more will be advertised in an international newspaper and in the
UNDB. In addition, expressions of interest may be sought from prospective consultants by advertising in a
national newspaper and or technical magazine. In the case of assignments estimated to cost US$100,000 or
less the assignment may be advertised nationally and the shortlist may be made up entirely of national

consultants provided that at least three qualified national firms or individuals are available in the country
and foreign consultants who wish to participate are not excluded from consideration.
6.    Procurement Planning: A final Overall Procurement Plan (OPP) for goods, works, supply and
installation of plant and equipment and consultant services which will be part of the Project Implementation
Plan PIP was reviewed at appraisal and finalized at negotiations. The OPP includes relevant information
on goods, works, supply and installation of plant and equipment and consulting services as well as the
timing of each milestone in the procurement process. The first year's Detailed Procurement Plan (DPP)
was agreed upon at negotiations. The DPPs for the remaining years of the project, indicating the
procurement method and processing time for each contract, will be submitted to IDA every year for its
review and comments not later than three months before the end of each fiscal year.

President,
Intemational Development Associanion

Dear Mr. \Volfensohn,
RE: LETTER OF POWER SECTOR POLICY
Introduction
i.    This letter summarises the major policy objectives and the strategy that the
Govermment of Uganda (GniJ) is implementing in order to transformn the power
sector into a financially viaLie electricity industry that is able to supply reasonably
priced and reliable electriciTy co the population and ma4ce its contribution to the
further social and economic development of Uganda.
2.     Government's strategy to achieve this goal includes the reform and privatisation
of the Uganda Electricity B1o4jrd (UEB), attracting new private sector investments
to increase and improve electricity supply, and acceleraTe rural electricity access
This strategy is consisienm  with the Government's overall macro-economic
policies as well as the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). An important
component of the PEAP is the creation of an enabling environment for economic
growth and structural transformnation. As it has been identified that inadequate and
unreliable electricity supply is the major infrastructure constraint to growth, the
reform of the electricity industry is the major priority area for intervention
The Power Sector Strategic Plan
3.     The power sector reforms that the GoU is undertaking are guided by the Power
Sector Strategic Plan of lune 1999. Thr Plan was designed to meet the following
specific objec:tives:
.  making the power sector viable and able to perform without subsidies from
the Goverunent budget;
* increasing the sector's efficiency,
-100 -



*  increasing the sector's commercial performance;
* rneeting the growing demands for electricity and increasing area coverage;
 improving the reliability and quality of electricity supply;
* attracting, private capital and entrepreneurs, and
* taking advantage of export opportunities.
4.    The Strategic Plan spells out the GoU's policy on the reform of the sector and
privatisation of UEB. It proposes the unbundling of UEB into three separate
companies for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. The
unbundling process is already underway and the new successor companies will be
incorporated by the end of M4arch 2001.
5.    The Strategic Plan also proposes that the distribution and the generation
businesses should be concessioned to private sector players while the transmission
business remains in public hands in the medium term. GoU has adopted the
following structure for the power industry:
*  The existing distribution network will be concessioned to one private
compay y.
*  Both the eKisting generation plants (Nalubaale and Kiira) will be concessioned
to one private company
* The transmission company will remain with Government acting as a single
buyer that will hold existing power purchase agreemenls.
e Existing UEB assets are tc. remain in Govemrnment hands.
  Further investments iti get eration are to be undertaken by the private sector.
Legal Framework in the Power Sector
6.    In November, 1999, the pazilmrnent ot Uganda enacted the Electricity Act,1999,
which gives the legal backing to the various reforms in the power sector.
Th-e Electricity Regulatory Authoriy
7.    The Electricity Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of an independent
regulatory Authority for the electricity industry, the ERA. Government has
already embarked on the establishment of the institutional framework by
appointing the ERA Board in April, 2000. ERA is nowv operational.
Improving the Sector's performance and Efficiency
8.    The Government is committed to improving the management, commercial and
technical efficiency of the sector, in particular UEB In this regard, Govcrnzment
has moved decisively to improve top management in UEB and down-size the
utility. IJEB has undertaken ineasures to reduce electricity thefts and improve
debt collection and the billing and collection system.
- 101 -



These measures have resulted in improved performance of UER For instance, in 1999,
collections increased from 50% to 79% of the electricity generated.
Meeting the Growing Demand and Increasing Electricity Access
9.    In order to meet the growing demand for electriciry, Government has opened up
the sector to private participation in the provision of new generation capacity in
that regard, Government hds already licensed an independent power producer
(IPP), AES Nile Power, to develop the 250 MW  Bujagali Project on the River
Nile. Government is also in contact with other IPPs for the subsequent
development of other projects.
10.   To increase access to electricity in the rural areas, GoU  is developing a
comprehcnsive rural electrification program meant to increase rural electrification
access from the present level of 1% to at least 10% by the year 2010. The
program, called Energy for Rural Transformation, is designed to have four main
components, namely;
* grid extension and intensi"ication for those areas which are close to the grid;
X  development of renewable energy resources to provide at lrast 70 MW  of
electricity;
* development of decentralesed or mini grid systems including from renewable
eniergy resources; and
*  solar PV systems for izotated households and institutions.
The program also has linkages with the telecommunications, health, agriculture
and education sectors.
Financial Viability
11    In order to improve the financial viability of the power sector, the Electricity
Regulatory Authority is working on a stepwise tariff increase to reflect the cost of
supply. Government in December 2000, recommended to the Regulator that the
last increment should be effected by June 2001 and the tariff should be indexed to
inflation and currency fluctuation. IT is also anticipated that there will be marked
improvement when the distribution business is let out to the private sector.
Settlement of Government Electricity Bill Arrears
12.   Governrnent is committed to impcoving its clectricity bill payment record in ordcr
to ensure a financially sustainable power sector and to provide an amactive
enviroranent for private entrants. To this end Government will release 70% of
financial year 2000/01 budget estimates for current electricity supply by May
2001 and also verify and settle arrears for financial year 1999/00 by end of June

200 1. I sent a letter to this effect to your Country Director for Uganda on March
14, 2001
Power Export Opportunities
13    GoU is maYcing efforts to increase power exports given the country's comparative
advantage in hydro power resources. Negotiations are in final stages with Kenya
to increase exports.
Environmental Sustainabiliry
14.   In April/May 1999, Government carried out an Environmental Analysis (EA) in
consultation with stakeholders as a preparation for the Power IV Project. The EA
established that the project would not have any major environmental impacts
because it did not involve construction of new structures- the two generating units
would he installed in an existing power house. The project will not involve
resettlement and cultural heritage issues. The main environmental mitigation
measure required under the project is a decommissioning plan, including
restoration of the project area, which will have to be prepared and implemented at
the end of the project. An Environmental Monitoring Plan as well as capacity
building will also be included
Implementation Plan for UEB Privatisation
1 5 The pnvatisation process for UE-B is on course. Evaluation of assets was finalised in
August 2000 and The investment needs analysis done in September, 2000. So far,
there have been two successful rvarket consultartons w'ith interested parties, one in
June anid the other in October, 2000. Draft contracts and licences were prepared in
August and recommendations on tanff reform made in November, 2000.
Government shalJ establish thxzt independent corporate entities - generation,
transmission and distribution - operating under separate boards of directors and
management. The assets and liabilities of UEB will then be assigned to those
successor companies.
16. A transitional step is necessary because there are a number of contracts the liabilities
for which cannot be delegated without the pernission of the counter-party to the
contract, for cxamplc long-tern  debt and contracts with international suppliers.
These liabilities shall remain with UEB Statutory Corporation, which will hold the
liabigfnes which cannot be delegated in the first instance until they art either settied,
ass$ned directly by the Govermnent, or, with the concurrence of the counter-party,
6fgatcd to one of the successor compazies. Once all the liabilities have been dealt
itl accordingly, UEB Statutory Corporation would cease to exist in accordance with
the 1999 Electricity Act.
17. The next steps will include the following,

* approval of shortlists - end of May. 2001;
receipt of bids - end of Augusl,200 1
*  4ward of contracts - mid OcTober, 2001.
Government will ensure that the UEB successor companies follow the financial
management procedures established for the implementation of the project.
Petroleum Subz-Sector Reforms
Ig     Government liberalised the petroLeum sector in 199q. While the liberalisation
measures have been implemnentea under existing law, Government has now
formulated a new comprehensive Petroleurn Bill and is making efforts to put in
place a monitoring unit for the sector To ensure the quality of the products and
also curb smuggling.
Conclusion
19    1 trust that the above measures give confidence that a viable and efficient energy
sector is one of Uganda's piiorities and that the Govemrnment is committed to
ensuring that this objective is achieved.
Yours sincerely,
Gerald M. sendaula
