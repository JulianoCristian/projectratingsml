satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) the project included both specific investments\n            and policy issues, such as enactment of the petroleum law,\n            energy sector reforms and establishment of a conducive\n            regulatory environment to attract private operators in the\n            generation and distribution areas. The project covered a\n            menu of options aimed at long term sector reliability,\n            efficiency and sustainability, though the available\n            financing could not support all the required interventions\n            apart from maintaining a strong dialogue with the respective\n            stakeholders; 2) privatization of power generation and\n            distribution does not necessarily provide quick remedies in\n            terms of ensuring efficient operations of the power sector\n            and improved quality of supply and access, as demonstrated\n            by the difficulties in reducing distribution losses in\n            Uganda. However, over time a financially viable generation\n            and distribution business will help to mitigate the\n            perceived risks of future private investors; 3) water\n            resources management and energy planning and development in\n            the Lake Victoria Basin need to be integrated on the basis\n            of a shared vision plan; and 4) the project design contained\n            a number of very specific performance indicators. Some of\n            the indicators such as reducing load shedding and loss\n            reduction, were beyond the control of the project hence\n            cannot be easily used to evaluate the project performance."}, "docdt": "2009-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
