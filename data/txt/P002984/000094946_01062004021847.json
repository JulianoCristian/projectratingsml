Borrower capacity to manage reform, privatization, and\n            development in the power and the petroleum sub-sectors. The\n            project consists of four components: 1) The first component\n            will support power system expansion and rehabilitation. The\n            project will finance the supply and installation of the\n            power plant Units 14 and 15 at Kiira; system rehabilitation,\n            and institutional support. 2) The second component will\n            finance procurement of required equipment for the\n            implementation of the environmental monitoring plan and the\n            recruitment of an environmental officer to oversee it. 3)\n            The third component will support power sector development\n            and reform via a study on Water Management at Lake Victoria,\n            development of an energy end-use efficiency program, annual\n            consumer satisfaction surveys, and sector studies and\n            preparation of future projects. 4) The last component will\n            support petroleum sector development and reform via\n            acquisition of petroleum product quality monitoring\n            equipment, specialized advisory services to Ministry of\n            Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), training of MEMD staff."}, "docdt": "2001-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
