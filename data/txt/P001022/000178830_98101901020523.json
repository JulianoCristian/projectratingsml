The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower acted satisfactorily. There is one major lesson\n            that can be learned from this project. The success of the\n            project stemmed from the work done at preparation and\n            appraisal phases and its concentration on the right issues:\n            1) smooth introduction of road maintenance which allowed\n            road users and local authorities to witness its beneficial\n            effects and push for extension; 2) monitoring of the use of\n            equipment which ensured that project use was given priority\n            over other uses; and 3) appointment of consultants whose\n            help was fruitful and led the way to the continuance of\n            foreign expertise, which was and is still needed."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
