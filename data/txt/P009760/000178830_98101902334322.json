The project\n            will include construction elements for dams, main, branch\n            and distribution canals, drains, and new and improved link\n            roads in the command areas of the Krishna, Kukadi, Upper\n            Wardha, Upper Penganga and Warna irrigation schemes.\n            Existing canals and drains in the commands of the Girna and\n            Mula schemes will be modernized. The project will further\n            expand the Government of Maharashtra's (GOM's)\n            pilot water management program and provide assistance for a\n            training program for land development and water management specialists."}, "docdt": "1979-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
