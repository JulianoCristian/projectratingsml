{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Diversified Farm Income\n            and Market Development Project for Philippines were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: National\n            Program Support (NPS) projects, which employ a Sector\n            Investment and Maintenance (SIM) loan instrument, are used\n            to implement sector and Public Expenditure Management (PEM)\n            reforms in the Philippines. As an instrument for difficult\n            institutional reforms, the Diversified Farm Income and\n            Market Development Project (DFIMDP) experience shows that a\n            National Program Support (NPS) would be appropriate and\n            effective only when the client agency, especially its\n            management, is fully committed and operationally prepared to\n            implement and mainstream these reforms during the project\n            period. This is especially true for Philippines which have\n            shown a systemic dichotomy between policy and operations,\n            especially in the agriculture and fisheries sector. Without\n            strong evidence that reforms are indeed already firmly\n            implemented on the ground level, the Bank should consider\n            very carefully before becoming fully engaged in a reform\n            program with a client agency. The Bank is better positioned\n            to facilitate, rather than lead or catalyze, reforms, at\n            least within the current political economy of the\n            Philippines. The World Bank (WB), therefore, should be\n            reluctant to fully enter the reform picture in the country\n            until these reforms are already well entrenched among the\n            clients, especially among the government managers."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
