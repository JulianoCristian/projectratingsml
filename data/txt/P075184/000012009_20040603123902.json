"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Diversified Farm Income and Market\n            Development Project will assist the Government in\n            strengthening the Department of Agriculture's (DA)\n            capacity for the provision of market-oriented services, thus\n            increase agricultural competitiveness, and rural incomes.\n            Given the deeply entrenched nature of many areas requiring\n            reform, this process of institutional, and attitudinal\n            change will take time, and sustained efforts to achieve.\n            Components will support market development services, and\n            collaboration in market promotion, trade fairs, etc., with\n            the private sector. Further support shall strengthen the\n            core functions of the DA and Government agencies concerning\n            agricultural statistics, information technology for\n            agriculture and fisheries, and agricultural training.\n            Initially, it would be implemented in the four Focus Areas\n            supported by the project, complemented with community-based\n            information dissemination systems available to various types\n            of farmers/growers and the general community. Market\n            development investments will focus on rural roads, and other\n            rural infrastructure, strengthened through an appropriate\n            selection, approval and implementation criteria and\n            procedures, to ensure demand-driven, market-oriented\n            investments, supported, primarily through local government\n            units (LGUs) and producer groups. The safety and quality\n            assurance systems for market development will be achieved by\n            strengthening the implementation capacity of the DA's\n            regulatory services, as well as institutional strengthening,\n            and, coordinating with other regulatory agencies to complete\n            a review and action plan, aimed at rationalizing the\n            technical, physical and financial needs for the\n            strengthening, operation and maintenance of laboratories\n            needed to service the DA's overall regulatory system.\n            Furthermore, seeds and horticultural planting material will\n            be supported through the expansion of scion groves to\n            propagate vegetal species, while training and facilitation\n            should significantly expand accredited private sector,\n            operated seed farms, and nurseries. Market-linked technology\n            development and dissemination is designed to leverage a\n            change, by modifying and strengthening implementation of the\n            DA's competitive research grants scheme, and, through\n            partner-LGUs, information training provision will be\n            available also to farmers not affiliated to organized\n            growers/farmers groups. Such participation to, and adoption\n            of training shall enable the DA in assessing the extent of\n            training reach, and success. Technical assistance will be\n            provided to help implement Intellectual Property Rights\n            provisions, to promote better dissemination of technology,\n            and greater private sector involvement, as certification of\n            improved seed and vegetative products evolve. Finally,\n            improvement of public expenditure management will focus on\n            public resource allocation, and utilization, which includes\n            better linkages between planning and budgeting."}, "docdt": "2004-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
