sector-led investments. This report discusses\n            expected negative environmental impacts and measures to\n            mitigate them. During construction, likely impacts are\n            surface runoff, soil erosion, and siltation and\n            sedimentation of nearby water bodies. To offset them,\n            provide slope and road cut protection; construct a road\n            drainage system; install riprapping (stone foundation),\n            wattling (a fabrication of interwoven poles), and fascines\n            (bound wood sticks) to shore up embankments; plant\n            vegetation (shrubs, bushes, and selected trees), especially\n            along road shoulders; properly manage the site; dispose of\n            solid wastes and earth spoils; construct sediment sediment\n            traps to prevent drainage canal clogging; and regularly\n            sprinkle water to control dust. In addition during the\n            project's implementation phase, remove rubbish to dump\n            sites; compact topsoil; haul, spread, and compact filling\n            materials from earth cuts and borrow pits; divert rainwater\n            through canals; provide traffic warning signs, barricades,\n            and flagmen and schedule construction delivery and waste\n            material transport during off-peak hours to control traffic;\n            install silencers on exhaust mufflers and maintain machinery\n            properly to reduce noise; restrict work operations, reduce\n            speeds, use signage, and inform community to prevent\n            vehicular accidents; and require workers to strictly observe\n            safety standards."}, "docdt": "2003-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
