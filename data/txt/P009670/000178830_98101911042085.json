The\n            investments would comprise construction of about 25,000 new\n            dugwells, improvement of 15,000 existing dugwells and the\n            installation of about 29,000 electric and 12,000 diesel\n            powered pumpsets and about 2,700 Persian wheels. Shortages\n            and unreliability of electricity supplies in the State make\n            it necessary to finance diesel as well as electric operated\n            pumpsets. Because the terrain in the project area is not\n            uniformly level, some related land development of about\n            30,000 ha to enable water from the wells to be constructed\n            to be used will be necessary and is included in the proposed\n            financing. About 70 pneumatic boring drills to be financed\n            from sources other than the proceeds of the credit will be\n            procured by the State of Madhya Pradesh to meet the\n            incremental needs of the program."}, "docdt": "1973-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
