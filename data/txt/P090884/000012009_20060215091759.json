The project will finance\n            primarily technical assistance and training, including\n            stakeholder workshops, consultations, etc., a limited number\n            of small goods, and operating costs. The project components\n            are: 1) creation of policy and administrative framework, to\n            create the framework for policy-making processes, and\n            administrative decision-making within the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA), and between the MOA and its associated\n            national, and local level institutions, municipalities (and\n            other local governmental structures), and communities,\n            through the provision of technical assistance; 2) mapping\n            component, whose main goal is to create a specialized map of\n            the rural areas in the Slovak Republic, with specific\n            delineation of possible micro-regions which could be\n            eligible for inclusion in the Leader Axis, according to the\n            EU relevant criteria. The mapping will also help\n            municipalities in defining the opportunities for cooperation\n            among themselves; 3) formation and training of local action\n            groups, and implementation of pilot projects, entails the\n            formation of a \"Local Action Group\" (LAG) as the\n            administrative unit, responsible for implementing Leader\n            projects. According to EU regulations, a LAG should\n            represent no more than 100,000 and not less than 10,000\n            persons. The LAG's responsibilities include project\n            screening and approval, monitoring (both physical and\n            impact), payments, etc. This component will finance TA to be\n            provided to selected groups, in order to become fully\n            functioning LAGs; and, 4) creation of national rural\n            network, to serve as the Leader Contact Point, and rural\n            information and data collection center for the country,\n            tasked with supporting a broad range of rural development\n            activities throughout the country. Technical assistance will\n            be provided to MOA to undertake a broader assessment of all\n            rural actors, necessary to make the Network functional, and\n            able to manage its operations."}, "docdt": "2006-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
