The EAGGF are\n            grant funds and are therefore \"free.\" At the time\n            of Loan Approval, guidelines from the EU on the use of these\n            funds after 2006 were not clear. The new Government decided\n            to substitute Bank loan funds with the grant funds that\n            became available. It should be noted that the Project\n            Objective remains valid; preparation for the Leader Axis\n            remains critical for utilization of the next phase of EU\n            funding (from 2007-2013) and the Government expects to\n            implement the key activities planned under the Project.\n            Although there were no disbursements under the loan at the\n            time of loan cancellation, a number of Project activities\n            had been completed and financed by the Government through\n            the Slovak budget. As a result, the Project achieved a\n            number of the agreed goals."}, "docdt": "2007-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
