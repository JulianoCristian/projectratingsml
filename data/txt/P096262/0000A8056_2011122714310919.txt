                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project aims to minimize the threat in Turkey posed to humans by the highly pathogenic avian influenza infection and other zoonoses in domestic
                         poultry and prepare for the control and response to an influenza pandemic and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three areas
                         will be supported: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning and (iii) response and containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the
                         burden of disease and loss of productivity in Turkey, limiting the regional spread of AI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional,
                         and global levels.

                         successfully carried out public awareness activities on the pandemic (A)H1N1, Avian Influenza, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and other high priority zoonotic diseases. The
                         vaccine warehouse is nearing completion and the monthly MOH progress reports indicate it will be completed prior to the end of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Treasury formally requested an extension to December, 2011 and reallocation of loan proceeds under all components of the project. The Bank has therefore processed and approved
                         a Restructuring Paper and Loan Amendment for a Level Two Restructuring. A supplementary reallocation has been processed to provide some additional essential equipment and
                         storage racks for the warehouse. The extension and funds reallocation provide time and resources for construction of a modern vaccine and drug warehouse and completion of the
                         critical activities under the Animal Health component.
