The purpose of this restructuring\n            paper is to seek the Country Director's approval for\n            the reallocation of funds, in the total amount of Euro 3.6\n            million. The reallocation would provide funds for the\n            construction of a larger than previously anticipated vaccine\n            storage warehouse under the human health component of the\n            project. The additional funding for the construction of the\n            vaccine storage warehouse is consistent with the original\n            project development objective, project components and\n            activities. The current closing date of the loan is December\n            31, 2011, and the need for an extension is not envisaged at\n            this time.  The bidding process for the warehouse\n            construction has been completed and the contract is ready\n            for signing.  No other changes are to be made to the project\n            at this time."}, "docdt": "2011-07-21T00:00:00Z"}
