The bidding process for the additional warehouse\n            goods is underway, with contract signing expected by\n            November 15, 2011.  The contract duration will not extend\n            beyond the loan closing date and it is therefore expected\n            that the goods will be delivered within the remaining period\n            of the loan."}, "docdt": "2011-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
