                     RESPONSE PROJECT
                       Loan No. 4822-TU
                                       Restructuring Paper

Background:

1.      The Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness (AIHP) project supports
the Government’s efforts to minimize the threat posed to humans by highly pandemic
avian influenza infection and other zoonoses in domestic poultry and to prepare for,
control, and respond to an influenza pandemic and other infectious disease emergencies
in humans. The project is financed by an IBRD Loan in the amount of Euro 27.3 million
(US$34.4 million equivalent1), a European Commission grant in the amount of US$12.73
million equivalent, and a USAID grant in the amount of US$1 million.

2.      The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to seek the Country Director’s approval
for the reallocation of funds, in the total amount of Euro 0.6 million, from Category 2 (b)
Works and Category 3 (b) Consultant Services and Training to Category 1(b) Goods.
The proposed reallocation would provide funds for the goods for the vaccine storage
warehouse under the Human Health component of the Project. Goods include complex
shelving throughout multiple vaccine warehouse buildings, supplementary refrigeration
equipment, forklifts, and ancillary equipment and supplies. The proposed reallocation is
based on a request from the Republic of Turkey via letter no. 41444 dated September 23,
2011 from the Acting Director General of the Undersecretariat of Treasury to the Bank.
The activities that were originally intended to be carried out using these funds will
continue to be carried out by the Ministry of Health (MoH) from savings realized under
works and consulting services contracts. This is the fifth reallocation of loan proceeds.

3.     The additional funding for goods for the vaccine storage warehouse is consistent
with the original project development objective, project components and activities. The
additional funding for goods is needed due to changes in the design of the warehouse
which requires much more storage space and thus additional investment in complex
shelving, forklifts, refrigeration equipment and related equipment and supplies.

4.     The current closing date of the Loan is December 31, 2011, and the need for an
extension is not envisaged at this time. The bidding process for the additional warehouse
goods is underway, with contract signing expected by November 15, 2011. The contract
duration will not extend beyond the loan closing date and it is therefore expected that the
goods will be delivered within the remaining period of the loan.

5.       In addition to the warehouse furnishings contract described above, the remaining
activities to be completed under the project primarily comprise the supply of goods and
training for Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. These activities are also expected
to be completed prior to the closing date.

  Note that US$ 34.4 million equivalent was the projected amount based on the US$:Euro exchange rate at
project approval. Subsequently, due to currency fluctuations, the US$ equivalent has increased to US$38.4
million.
                                                    1
6.     In view of the significant appreciation of the Euro, since approval of the Loan,
which is denominated in Euro, disbursements in USD terms for the remainder of the loan
period may be lower than originally anticipated. As a result, some funds may remain
undisbursed and would be cancelled at loan closure. Such cancellation may be in the
order of Euro 1.5 million.

Proposed Changes:

8.       No other changes are proposed to be made to the Project at this time.

9.      Safeguards: The Bank’s Safeguards Specialist visited the warehouse site and
reviewed the terms of reference for the design of the warehouse during a June 2010
implementation support mission. That mission confirmed that the construction site is
owned and controlled by MoH, is well secured, and is currently being used only as a
depot for medical supplies, and does not present any issues of concern related to
conflicting usage, resettlement, etc. Procurement of interior furnishings does not pose
any additional safeguard concerns. The Environmental category (B) for the project has
not been changed.

10.     Financial Management: The latest financial management supervision of the
project was carried out in February 2011 and the arrangements continued to be
satisfactory to the Bank. Audit reports for the project (provided separately for MoH and
MARA) for the year ended December 31, 2010 were received on time and both had
unqualified (clean) audit opinions. Since the auditors did not encounter any material
internal control issues, there was no need to issue management letters.

11.     Implementation progress: There are no changes proposed for the implementation
arrangements under the Project. AIHP implementation has further accelerated. Progress
towards the Project Development Objective (PDO) continues to be satisfactory. AIHP
now displays satisfactory disbursement and commitments as reflected in the end-of-
project workplans received from MFAL and MOH during the August 2011
implementation support mission. Project implementation is well on track in approaching
the targets set for its key performance indicators. The implementation has improved
considerably. The August mission discussed in detail use of the remaining balance and,
in particular, the risks associated with completing construction of the vaccine warehouse
by end December 2011. The implementation progress rating has been upgraded to
satisfactory, considering that reasonable progress has been made on the warehouse
construction and that timely completion should be achieved.
