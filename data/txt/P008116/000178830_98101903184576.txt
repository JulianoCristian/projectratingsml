REPORT AID RECOTIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY FOR THE THIRD
LIVESTOCK PROJECT - SUPPLENENTARY
1.        I submit the followring report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$4.0 million to
the Repu'blica Oriental del Uruguay for a Third Livestock Project -
Supplementary.
PART I - HISTORICAL
'2.       The proposed loan would supplement the US$6.3 million loan
I 698-UR) made in June 1970 to finance the foreign exchange component of
'Uruguay's national Iivestock development program in 1971. Rancher in-
terest in participating in the program has greatly exceeded original
expectations, and the Borrower has urgently requested the Bank to provide
additional financing to help carry out an incre:ased program during the
p.resent year.  The proposed loan would help tb maintain the momentum of
Uruguay's livestock development pending the appraisal of a more comprehensive
Fourth Livestock Development Project, covering the 1972-73 period, for
wlhich the Borrower has requested Bank assistance..
3.        A Bank mission visited Uruguay to appraise the Borrower's
request for additional funds during February 1971 and negotiations were
reld at the Bank during Aay.  The Government was represented by Dr. Hector
I.uisi, Uruguayan Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Benito Mledero, Vice-
r-resident, Honorary Livestock Conmission, 11r. Carlos Debat, Central Bank,
and IFr. Rodolfo Olivet, Bank of the Republic.
4.        The proposed loan would be the ninth made to Uruguay and would
increase the total amount of Bank loans to US$130.5 million (net of
zancellations). The following is a summary statement of the Bankts loans
to Uruguay as of April 30, 1971:

5.        The road project (324-UR), wjhich was originally scheduled for
zompletion by the end of 1966, has encountered delays for a variety of
reasons, the most important of which was a lengthy disagreement between
the design consultant and the Government.  !.Thile recent progress has been
satisfactory, unfavorable weatlher and unexpected delays in land acquisition
nor the final road sections to be constructed have made it necessary to
postpone Closing Date from IJay 31 to the end of 1971. The loan for power
(712-UR) approved last Movember has not yet become effective owing to
Jielays in obtaining satisfactory legal opinions from the Guarantor.

6.        In addition to the aforementioned pronosed Fourth Livestock
P iject, which would be submitted to the bcecutive Directors for conside-
ration in FY 1972, the Bank has been discussing with the Government
possible future projects in highway maintenance and power generation.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN

PART III - THE PROJECT
o.        The progress of the project and its current status are described
in the attached report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Livestock Develop-
ment Project - Supplementary" (PA-88a). The Appraisal Report (PA-38a)
distributed to the Ececutive Directors in support of Loan 698-UIR, contained
a detailed description of project operations and administration.
2.        Loan 698-UR was intended to provide technical and financial
assistance to ranchers for one year, to allow time for the Government to make
further progress in resolving sector policy problems and carry out necessary
institutional reforms, especially in the meat packing industry. The progress
miade to date has, if anything, exceeded expectations.  Labor and other
reforms in the meat packing industry have enabled the packing houses to
operate more efficiently and, thereby, to pay higher prices to ranchers;



-14-
substantial neu investments are being made to miodernize the paclcing
Dlants; and sanita-ry standards have been raised and the Goverrmient in-
spection services reorganized and strengthened. Another important
element in the Government's meat policy has been to periodically readjust
consumer prices to keen them in line width rising wTorld market prices,
thus restraining domestic demand and freeing production for export. As
a result of these internal reforms, and a substantial rise in world
marlket prices, ranchgate livestock prices have risen appreciably and the
incentives to invest in the livestock! sector in Uruguay are today most
attractive.
10.       Under the uroject, participating banks extend ranch develop-
ment loans to farmers to help finance investments in pasture improvement,
fencing and water supolies under approved ranch development plans. Tech-
nicians provided by the Honorary Livestockc Commission, an agency of the
ilinistry of Livestock and Agriculture, assist farmers in drawing up their
ranch developnment plans and supervise their implementation. The ranch
loans are made for 7-10 years, including a two-year grace period; in-
terest is charged at ll-' per year and service Doa-7ments are adjusted in
accordance rith indices of the price of livestock products, or the cost
of living index, whichever is lower.  The particinating banks finance
25'/ of ranch loans from their owni resources and refinance the remaining
75;t with the Livestoclk Developiment Fund established in the Central Bankc.
The Livestocl: Develooment Fund receives its resources from the loan in
the form of the local currency equivalent of Bankc disburse-,ents on ac-
count of iimported items (i.e., seeds, fertilizer and agricultural machli-
nery) and from direct reimbursement of 392 of ranch loans made.   The
state-owned Banc of tle Pepublic is the only participating bank at
present, but narticipation is open to -rivate cormercial bank;s, several
of which have exo-ressed interest.
11.       In addition to the improvement in sector conditions, the
increase in rancher demand for development credit reflects widespread.
enthusiasm for the new pasture improvement and the favorable reaction
to several new features incorporated in the third project. The latter
include (1) the adjustment of service payments in accordance with price
indexes, which appears to have been fully accepted by ranchers, and
which made it possible to extend the maturities of sub-loans to a minimum
of 7 years, compared with a maximum of 3 years available under the orevious
project; (2) the limitation of this "indexing" to t-he amount of the in-
crease in the cost of living, index, thereby avoiding excessive adjust-
ments in periods of particularly sharp   increases in livestockc prices
and (3) the opening of lending under the livestock. program, which had
previously not been available to ranchers having more than 2,500 hectares
to all ranchers regardless of the size of their holdings.



12.       The original 1971 program was ex-pected to involve about 3,000
ranchers and the imnrovement of some 200,000 hectiares of pasture.  Based
on revised estimates, some 3,400 ranchers are now likely to borrow under
the program.  These ranchers will imorove about 375n,!J0  hectares,
nearly double the area originally contemplated. Of this total, 279,)00
hectares will be improved by ranchers with less than 2,50C) hectares and
96,)00 hectares by ranchers with holdings over 2,50O hectares.
13.       The following is a sumnary of the increased progra,m in US$
millions:

14.       Of the 3,360) ranchers expected to participate in the 1971
)rogram, 71 percent have ranches of less than 5`0 hectares and 54 percent
have ranches of less than 206 hectares. The average holding is estimnated
at 500 hectares carrying about 400 cattle and 89o sheep-z. A typical
project rancher now has a net annual income in cash equivalent to about
US$3,10":  in six years this should rise to US'45,200.
PART IV - LEGAL ITNSTRUITENTS AID AUTIHORITY
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Government
of the Republica Oriental del Urugua-y, the Report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) and the draft of a Resolution
aporoving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors seoarately. Since the proposed loan would supple-m-ent Loan
698-UR, the draft Loan Agreement incorporates by reference the relevant
sections of that Agreement.



-6-
PART V - TIHE ECONOIEY
16.       A report on Uruguay's current economic situation and prospects
(ITH-205a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on Februiary 8, 1971.
The report concluded that during 1969 and 1970 the econamy began to emerge
from a prolonged period of stagnation and that, both in terms of internal
reforms and long-term balance of payments outlook, Uruguay appeared to
have made good progress in establishing a basis for a period of sustained
economic growth. Output rose by 5 in each of the past two years, exports
increased, there was a rise in public and private investment, public fi-
nances were strengthened and inflation was sharply curtailed. Last year's
210 increase in the general price level was sharper than in 1969, but the
bulk of the increase was attributable to corrective adjustments in public
sector tariffs, and to higher meat prices.
In the latter part of 1970, however, the economic situation
began to be overshadowed by a sizeable drain on the foreign exchange
reser-ves which, by the end of last year, had declined by US$38.8 millicn
to US$65.6 million or about three and a half months of imports. While
there was a sharp increase in imports and cther current account expendi-
tures in 1970, the major cause of the reserve drain was the flight of
capital which began in the wak-e of the devaluation of the Argentine peso
last June.  Contributing to the outflow of capital was a relaxation in
credit policy and the erosion of confidence as the result of internal
terrorist activities and the growing uncertainties surrounding the national
elections scheduled for November of this year.
18,      VThile the growing disparity betIwieen internal and external prices
has weakened the competitive position of Uruguay's non-traditional
exports on world markets, and no doubt also helps to explain the poor
tourist season just experienced, the all-important livestock sector has
continued to flourish under the stimulus of rising w-iorld prices and internal
policy reforms. Preliminary indications are that the record level of beef
exports achieved in 1970 (153,0OC metric tons worth US$88 million) is being
maintained so far in 1971. Although the Government took steps towards the
end of last year to limit payments for certain purposes (e.g., private
overseas travel) and to directly restrain the build-up of imports, the
reserve drain continued during the first quarter of 1971, albeit at a
reduced pace. At the end of April the Government imposed commissions of
50-100 pesos per dollar on the sale of foreign exchange for travel, in-
surance, family remittances and consular fees, thus effectively devaluing
the peso for these purposes. For merchandise imports, foreign exchange
is available at the official exchange rate of 250 pesos per dollar, but
im.porters are now required to obtain foreign financing af at least 180
days. In order to bolster their foreign exchange position and meet



-7-
external debt anortization requirements, the authorities have also over
the zast several months been borrowing abroad on medium and short-term,
thus tarnishing one of the most remarkcable aspects of recent Uruguayan
economic perfon!rance-- the rapidity wiith which Uruguay amortized the
short-tern, official debt which accumulated in the mid-sixties in the
form of rescheduled commercial and financial arrears.   However, bor-
rowing on the recent scale cannot continue and, if the reserve drain
persists, the authorities w-ll be impelled to correct the disparity
between internal and external prices. On this basis Uruguay can be
regarded as creditworthy for some limited borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART VI - COIPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEIMEITT
19.       I am satisfied that the oroposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank,:.
nART VII - RECOITRMIDATIOiNI
20.       I recormiend that the xcecutive Directors approve this loan.
