The\n            lessons learned indicate that this project could have\n            benefited from better technical preparation, especially in\n            the studies leading to the construction of the power plant,\n            the transmission lines, and the dispatching center.\n            Procurement should be completed before negotiations. Project\n            implementation needed better and more timely coordination\n            among co-lenders on issues involving procurement and\n            processing of payments, since the project's complex\n            financing arrangements undermined project execution. Bank\n            financing should have been conditional on the successful\n            prior implementation of an Environmental Impacts Mitigation\n            Program, because the delay in implementing the Water Charter\n            and the resulting Manantali Reservoir Management Program\n            could have damaged the environment and undermined the\n            resettlement of expropriated populations. An action program\n            has been implemented to mitigate the environmental impacts\n            of construction of the dam, the power plant, and the\n            electricity transmission system. Reliable supplies of water\n            and electricity are encouraging income-generating\n            activities, and contributing to micro and small business\n            investments schemes. An environment monitoring unit and an\n            environmental database have been created. This will be\n            further strengthened and extended to Guinea through the\n            ongoing GEF Regional Senegal River Basin Water and\n            Environmental Management Project."}, "docdt": "2005-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
