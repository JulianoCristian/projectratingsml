{"cdata!": "The ratings for this project are as\n            follows: The project outcome is satisfactory, project\n            sustainability is likely, the institutional development\n            impact is substantial, Bank performance overall is highly\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance is overall\n            satisfactory. This project was one of the first efforts by\n            the Bank to simultaneously address reintegration and\n            rehabilitation issues. The division of labor between the\n            implementing agencies worked well. Originally, these two\n            functions were housed in the same unit, but it was decided\n            to manage the demobilization and reintegration function as a\n            separate unit to ensure a greater impact. Keeping these\n            functions separate also makes sense from a service delivery\n            perspective. Consider separating disarmament and\n            demobilization activities(DD) from the reintegration (R)\n            program.  Be realistic about how much community\n            participation is feasible during the early phase of a\n            post-conflict situation. The Bank played an important role\n            in creating the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which made it\n            feasible to rapidly scale up the response in accordance with\n            the higher than expected number of ex-combatants seeking\n            reintegration services. Independent financial management and\n            procurement unit may increase effectiveness of post-conflict\n            investments. Conduct capacity assessment of nongovernmental\n            organization sector and plan up-front capacity-building\n            program during design phase. In the context of the economic\n            causes of conflicts, consider establishing investment\n            targets. Project design should be structured around few\n            easy-to-monitor key performance indicators, based on\n            relatively simple base line studies. When appropriate\n            address DDR issues at the regional level. In post-conflict\n            situations, it is difficult to envisage requirements and\n            thereby plan for bulk procurement. There should be\n            flexibility in setting the aggregate thresholds, and the\n            full scenario of procurement methods should be available."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
