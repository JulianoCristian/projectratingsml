          former combatants and the population and communities\n            affected by the conflict return to normal, productive lives.\n            The number of potential beneficiaries is estimated to reach\n            1.5 million, close to one third of the population. The\n            project is expected to have a significant impact on reducing\n            war-induced poverty throughout Sierra Leone, particularly by\n            helping reinvigorate the local economy. The project will\n            entail two components: 1) Emergency Recovery Support Fund,\n            and related institutional support to the National Commission\n            for Reconstruction, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation and\n            partners will facilitate the social and economic recovery of\n            communities and the restoration of basic social and economic\n            services through demand-driven, community-oriented projects\n            that target individuals, groups and the community affected\n            by the conflict. 2) Training and Employment Program, and\n            related institutional support to the National Committee on\n            Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration will support\n            the social and economic reintegration of former combatants\n            through targeted counseling, training, and employment\n            creation efforts."}, "docdt": "1999-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
