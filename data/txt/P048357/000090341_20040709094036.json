sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that it was\n            important for the Bank to establish credibility as a partner\n            in furthering reforms in the financial sector. Flexibility\n            of design works well in a fluid environment but efficient\n            implementation under those circumstances depends on having a\n            combination of a good implementing agency and a good Task\n            Manager. Analysis of government budgetary processes\n            regarding execution of Bank projects including sensitivity\n            analysis should be formalized as part of a project appraisal\n            report. This Project dealt with numerous soft management\n            issues for which a qualitative evaluation is more\n            appropriate. It is important to focus on development of\n            human skills when modernizing management practices. Project\n            preparation needs to perform a careful assessment of IT\n            needs and the capacity of the implementing agency to meet\n            the demand."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
