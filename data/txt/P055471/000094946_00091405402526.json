assist the Government in its\n            regional integration, through macroeconomic stabilization,\n            and the promotion of private sector development. The project\n            will improve competitiveness, through trade liberalization,\n            easing trade and taxation, and supporting regulatory\n            programs that promote competitive pricing of public utility\n            inputs to the productive sector. The first tranche of the\n            operation, will finance the implementation of the tariff,\n            and tax reforms, adjustments in customs, and tax procedures,\n            and the establishment of performance criteria for these\n            reforms. The second tranche, will support an adjustment\n            program, with full data links between the customs, and tax\n            departments. The legislative framework will be developed, to\n            define the regulatory system for public utilities, and\n            infrastructure. Nonetheless, competitiveness measures rely\n            on an integrated plan for Government data systems, which may\n            encounter implementation difficulties, and, some economic\n            entities may try to regain their lost import protection.\n            These risks would be mitigated by sound competitive\n            practices, successfully integrated in developing countries,\n            while the West African Economic and Monetary Union, restrict\n            the recourse to increase import protection."}, "docdt": "2000-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
