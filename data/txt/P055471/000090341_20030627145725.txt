3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The original objectives of this credit are to improve the competitiveness of the Senegalese
economy by liberalizing trade, facilitating trade and tax procedures, and supporting regulatory
programs that promote competitive pricing of public utility inputs.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Development objectives of this adjustment program credit have remained unchanged and
unrevised throughout- a testimony to their appropriateness.

3.3 Original Components:
The program credit has four components that support building a more competitive economy.

3.3.1. Trade Liberalization

The credit was part of an existing comprehensive commitment on the part of the GOS to embark
on trade and tax reform in its fight against poverty. The desired goal of reduction of poverty was
consistent with the objective of this credit being a more open and competitive economy with its
emphasis on liberalizing trade and developing the private sector. Timing was critical as the credit
came at just the right moment in the sequencing of reforms. It came only after the GOS had
demonstrated its commitment to reform as set out below when it had already:

·       Implemented the Common External Tariff (CET) of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) on January 1, 2000. This had the effect of cutting maximum tariff
rates from 65% to 20% and of simplifying the tariff structure through reduction of tariffs
categories from seven tariff categories to four.
·       Combined customs with fiscal duties
·       Reduced the statistical tax from 5% to 1% on all imports
·       Adopted WAEMU approved safeguard protection measures covering a few basic goods
to ensure that any already agreed to tariff reductions on other goods will not be subsequently
re-imposed.
·       Renounced a previous request for Temporary Protection Surtax (TPS) on a long list of
goods that was subsequently approved by WAEMU.
·       Eliminated many existing tariff discounting measures ("precisions tarifaires")

The effect of these initiatives demonstrates the firm commitment of the GOS to trade
liberalization prior to implementation of this credit.

3.3.2. Trade Facilitation

This purpose of this component is to reduce the number and length of procedures required for
customs clearance in order to overcome delays and provide for more efficient, transparent, speedy
and modernized customs operations.

A central feature of this component is the implementation at Customs of an electronic data


                                                 - 2 -

communication system and the adoption of a program (Trade Point) that would provide for
paperless pre- clearing of goods at ports. This will considerably reduce the paperwork required
and speed up clearance and passage through ports of entry while at the same time minimizing
avoidance and improving collections of customs duties from importers.

This component also requires that specific performance criteria be put into place to measure all
aspects of customs operations (from assessments to inspections to collections) and the results to
be publicized. The GOS has committed itself to improvements in line with these performance
criteria.

3.3.3. Tax Facilitation

The purpose of this component is to enhance ability of the tax department to collect and more
accurately assess tax levies, perform audits and to provide improved level of services to taxpayers.
Adoption of a modernized and computerized data base and information sharing system will
facilitate the broadening of the tax base, improve communications between the public and the
department and go a long way towards the meeting of these goals.

The adoption of a single tax payer identification number and the sharing of a common data base
with the customs department is also an important feature of this new system. Single taxpayer
identification numbers will facilitate identification of importers responsible for customs duties and
match them with sellers responsible for VAT remittances enabling cross checking to take place at
both departments. Implementation of the new system will thus improve the ability to make tax
collections easier, faster and more accurately thereby eliminating the need for lengthy dispute
resolutions and time consuming paper audits.

From a development perspective there will be increased transparency and improved management
of tax collection activities of benefit both to the tax department and to the taxpayers.

The tax department has developed performance criteria to benchmark progress.

3.3.4. Regulatory Reform

The general purpose of this component is to support a new regulatory framework for public
utilities that will lead to a more competitive environment. New legislation will encourage "best
practices" as applicable to public utilities from an international perspective by taking into account
the interests of all stakeholders. This will lead to an improvement in the level and quality of public
services and lower costs through competitive pricing of public utility inputs. Lower costs,
improved level and quality of services and improved financial performance will benefit
consumers and producers alike. From a development perspective, adoption of this legislative
framework will provide for increased coherency, independence, accountability and transparency in
public utility operations.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Consistency with IPSRP

This program credit is consistent with the Government's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (IPRSP). Development of new employment opportunities through stimulation of the private
sector is at the heart of Senegal's poverty fighting strategy. In addition to budgetary support for
targeted social sectors, Senegal's IPRSP promotes institutional reform and an improved
regulatory environment for the private sector.

This program credit will provide temporary budget support to social sector targets so needed
because of the temporary revenue shortfall resulting from the introduction of tariff and tax
reforms. This program credit will also support private sector development through trade
liberalization, reform of trade and tax procedures and new legislation that will create a more
competitive regulatory environment for public utilities.

Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)

The adjustment program credit supports the specific goals of the (CAS) being (1) regional
integration(WAEMU) (2) macroeconomic stability(provision of budgetary support for social
programs) and (3) private sector development (new regulatory framework for public utilities).

Consistency with Credit Development Policy Letter of GOS

The set of reform measures called for and the performance indicators mentioned in the Trade
Reform and Competitiveness Credit (see Annex 1, Performance Indicators of this ICR) fully
support the proposed strategy and action program as set out in the Minister of Finance's Credit
Development Policy Letter addressed to the President of the World Bank (see Annex G of the
MOP).

Consistency with Economic Backdrop and Macro Economic Policy Framework of GOS

More generally at the time, the background economic setting and macroeconomic policy
framework of Senegal was most receptive and appropriate to implementation of these trade
reform initiatives.

Early Disbursement of First Tranche and the Setting of Conditions for the Second Tranche

Upfront conditions were met for the disbursement of the first" tranche" on the date of credit
effectiveness being November16/2000 approximately two months after board approval on
September 14/2000. Disbursement of the second tranche was tied to progress in the adjustment
program establishing data links between Customs and Tax departments, in the establishment of a
single taxpayer identification system, in the publishing of performance criteria for both
departments and in adopting a new regulatory environment governing the operation of public
utilities.




                                                 - 4 -

Conclusion

"Assessment of Development Objective and Design and Quality at Entry" is therefore rated as
Highly Satisfactory.


4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
From an implementation and administration point of view, there were no major problems. All four
remaining conditions for disbursement of the second tranche were satisfied a month before its
release and the credit closed in September of 2002. These conditions were (i) implementation in
the use of a single taxpayer identification number system, (ii) implementation of a formal data link
between customs and tax departments that would automatically include all imports in the VAT
base, (iii) establishment of full electronic information sharing between customs, tax and treasury
departments, and (iv) introduction of a legislative framework defining the architecture of a
regulatory system for public utilities.


The credit never needed to be restructured or revised, all disbursements were made and all
conditions of the IDA Development Credit Agreement were otherwise satisfied. There was only
one short extension of the closing date from June to September of 2002. This happened only
because of delay at the National Assembly in regards to passage of a new "organic law" regulating
public utilities (see (iv) above). This short delay in passage was difficult to anticipate and is
regarded as of minor significance in overall performance.

As regards achievement of its development objectives, implementation of this credit has been a
success. The program has allowed the GOS to achieve a number of its own objectives including
the improvement of tax administration, reduction of clearance times at customs, improved
capacity at the tax department and an improved environment for the private sector.

4.2 Outputs by components:

4.2.1. Trade Liberalizationn

On January 1/2000 Senegal implemented the last step of the WAEMU Common External Tariff
(CET) reform. Senegal's implementation of the CET was evaluated as part of the Integrated
Framework study. (Many of these measures were reproduced above under 3.3.1) This study
found that Senegal has maintained its CET liberalization and continued in its limited use of
safeguard measures. As a cautionary note, some tariff lines were found however which were not
in the CET schedule-a practice not uncommon amongst other members apparently

4.2.2. Trade and Tax Facilitation

The new computerized management information system providing for sharing of data between
customs and tax departments enabling automatic entry of imports onto the VAT tax base and the


                                                  - 5 -

interconnection of tax, treasury and customs departments has been completed on time.
Subsequent trial runs prompted satisfaction of disbursement conditions of second tranche release
though setting up the system was slow off the mark. Notwithstanding these delays, installation for
use of the new system was regarded as reasonably satisfactory (based on communications with the
chief technical person responsible) following trial runs demonstrated to and accepted by World
Bank officials. Putting the system into full use by the departments has been gradual. We now
understand that as of this year customs made a decision to extend the new management system for
custom clearance operations to all its bureaus.

As part of GOS's Credit Development Policy Letter, the goal of trade facilitation was to increase
yields from the Customs Administration by modernizing the Automated Customs and Trade
Information Management System (GAINDE). This would result in:

·       Automation of certain formalities and computerization of all customs bureaus: This would
mean lower costs in clearing and elimination of         delays.
·       Interconnection of Directorate at Customs, Tax, Treasury and Planning and Statistics:
operators and investors will have access to this               network.
·       Gradual replacement of certain manual procedures: this will allow for new facilities such
as electronic management of Treasury receipt forms,            exonerations and other exemptions,
supplementary payments, warehouse receipts, customs clearance forms at borders and points of
entry.
·       Interface with external systems: this will make it possible to take advantage of the
applications and tools used by Trade Point Senegal and the Autonomous port of Dakar for
electronic collection of customs pre-clearance documents and reception of electronic manifests.

Performance criteria have been developed against which to establish benchmarks and monitor
progress. This however is an ongoing process whose consequences will be most appreciated in
the fullness of time.

Regarding tax Facilitation the GOS in its Credit Development Policy Letter to the World Bank set
out a number of initiatives with regard to tax facilitation.

·       Foremost is the introduction of a single taxpayer identification number system alluded to
in above paragraph 3.3.3.. This was instituted by       decree # 7329 and issued by the Minister of
Finance in late 2000.It was not until 2002 that parallel taxpayer number identification number
systems was phased out. As a result the tax department can cross check a given taxpayer across
different tax systems according to a single    number.
·       Implementation of a formal data link between customs and the tax departments will now
automatically include all imports into the VAT tax      base.
·       Full electronic information sharing between tax, customs and treasury has by and large
been implemented but not without delays along the way. In January 2002 the project follow up
committee for the GOS published a strategic plan for implementing this computerized data
        exchange system within the Ministry of Finance. The plan describes the data to be
exchanged and the technical protocol for exchanges.                    World Bank staff were able to
verify on a pilot run that the necessary technical infrastructure had been set up and the majority of



                                                 - 6 -

the data          reports identified in the strategic plan were loaded and capable of being shared.
·       This new system of data sharing and linking has been instrumental in meeting a number of
objectives including: improved services for               taxpayers, improved working conditions and
time savings, increased capacity to manage budgets, greater transparency and efficiency etc.

4.2.3   Regulatory Reform :

The National Assembly of Senegal in August of 2002 passed an" organic law" governing the
regulation of public utilities. The idea was to establish an effective regulatory regime marked by
coherency, independence, accountability and transparency. A review by former OECD regulatory
experts found that the law contained adequate provisions to ensure competent staff, independence
from the executive and legislative branches, accountability to independent review, due process
review provisions for interested parties, reasoned justifications for actions taken, and stipulation
of deadlines for reaching of decisions. These criteria were minimal conditions stipulated by the
World Bank and their compliance helped trigger the release of the second tranche of this credit.
This was found to be in line with the government goals of strengthening price competitiveness and
promoting efficient operations of infrastructure services.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

The institutional development impact of these reforms is rated as substantial. Depending on
maintenance, upkeep and sustainability, the potential benefits of computerization of operations at
customs, tax and treasury can only be described as very significant when compared to the "old
paper" system. Computerization, creation of shared data links, and interconnection of the various
departments at the Ministry of Finance do present scope for many benefits. A modernized
information system will help these institutional departments combat and monitor corruption,
encourage greater transparency and procedural efficiencies, improve governance, promote
accountability, greatly speed up processing times, improve the quality of the work environment,
improve communications with the tax paying public and amongst the departments themselves,
promote accurate record keeping, facilitate reorganization change along functional lines, help
resolve taxpayer disputes, create new types of jobs with new skill sets, present new training
opportunities, offer more scope for professional growth, increase collection revenues and reduce
operating costs, improve policy- making through reliance and access to up-to-date data records,
provide more accurate and informed advice, and the list goes on. What is important is that the
GOS has embarked on this office modernization process and only time will reveal the true extent
of these benefits.

Achievement of Objective and Output (4) is rated as Satisfactory.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

War, famine, insurrection, floods, acts of God, international commodity price collapses,
breakdowns in the international trading order, lack of commitment by the lender, etc. were not at
play and fortunately did not impact implementation and outcome of this credit.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

·       Ongoing compliance with the tenets of WAEMU and the commitment to continue with
tax and trade reform.
·       Passage of legislation required to promote private sector development through more
effective regulation public utilities.
·       Continued budgetary support for the Ministry of Finance as implementing agency to
continue with the trade and institutional reform agenda.
·       Implementation of the new organic law on regulation of public Utilities to ensure
fulfillment of desired objectives.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

·       Implementation of the strategic plan designing and implementing the new management
information system (interconnection and sharing of data            amongst the various departments)
and ensuring that such is utilized to maximum effect and maintained. For this, resources will be
needed not       only for upkeep and maintenance of hardware and software systems but also for
hiring and training of personnel to operate these systems.         Reports received from the field
indicated that initially there were lags in setting up and organizing the system (trial runs) but that
by and large     this was viewed as having been completed on time in a satisfactory manner.
·       Continued follow up, monitoring and evaluation of trade and tax reforms.
·       Continuing with institutional reform measures particularly at the customs and tax
departments including monitoring and evaluation.

5.4 Costs and financing:

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

Once treaty commitments have been entered into (WAEMU), it is highly unlikely that the GOS
would breach these commitments save in the most compelling of circumstances. While these
commitments to freer trade (lower tariffs and reduced barriers to trade) are not irreversible, this is
unlikely given the movement towards free trade and emphasis on private sector development.

The passage of new legislation regarding regulation of public utilities is also an act that is unlikely
to be repealed or reversed. Implementation of this legislation is another matter and much depends
on political will. Nevertheless this legislation is likely to stand as part of the new architectural


                                                     - 8 -

landscape for utilities in Senegal for some time to come.

Likewise institutional reforms given the promising and rewarding benefits that are likely to accrue
are unlikely to be reversed or stalled.

Users of the new system at the tax and customs department have reported increased satisfaction
with better turn around times, level and nature of services. This has yet, however, to be
documented in a formal systematic manner.

The major caveat to these reforms is the GOS's commitment and financial capacity to maintain
their momentum as this will require ongoing support by way of maintenance of systems, training
and new capital outlays.

Three factors indicate that this kind of ongoing support is likely: One is the financial support
already assigned to sustain and expand this project. A second is that a follow-up committee has
been set up to monitor the continued implementation of the system, including needed training.
Finally, the IMF's PRGF is supporting the government's public expenditure management program
which includes specific actions to sustain and expand upon information systems set up under the
current credit.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
N/A

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Identification: The bank identified this project as being consistent with government development
priorities and in particular its fight against poverty as outlined in its IPRSP. This credit was also
consistent with the CAS and other policy initiatives as noted under paragraph 3.4 Quality at entry.

Project preparation: The bank in preparation for this credit held several meetings to review the
concept paper behind this credit. One such meeting held on June 20/00 took into account the
comments of an external advisor who had previously worked in Senegal and who had significant
appreciation and understanding of the Senegal's trade policy. His comments strongly confirmed
the big improvements in Senegal's trade policy and noted the value of supporting further reforms.
ROC meetings were also held that took into account various aspects of the project including
discussions about performance criteria for tranche releases, relationship to PRSP, monitoring and
performance indicators, transparency, budget and financial management, public information and
support.

The structuring of the credit into a two tranche operation facilitated disbursement of the credit
and acted as an incentive. The first tranche in the amount of $50 million provided budgetary
support to Senegal's social programs as a result of declining revenues directly attributable to
reform implementation. The second tranche in a like amount was conditional upon demonstrated
progress in implementation of the management information system, the single identification


                                                  - 9 -

number system as well as passage of legislation regulating utilities. The Bank, in preparing this
credit, wisely enabled the GOS to focus on specific goals, objectives and achievements and
assume ownership rather than having the Bank getting directly involved in micro-managing the
activities of the GOS. It was clear from the outset that the bank structured the credit to
complement internally reforms already being undertaken rather than to stimulate reforms
externally.

7.2 Supervision:

The bank conducted at least six missions to appraise progress being made during the length of this
credit. Credit effectiveness date was November 16/00 and Revised Closing Date was September
30/02. The first supervision mission was conducted in January 2001 at which time the GOS
provided a letter advising of the establishment of a follow up committee on the action plan set out
in its Credit Development Policy Letter. The second mission was held in June of 2001 when the
government progress report and "aide memoir" were reviewed. A joint mission followed with the
AfrDB in November of 2001. Another supervision mission took place in February of 2002 at
which time the technical plan drawn up by the government for the new management information
system was adopted. These site visits along with the preparation of independent third party
reports on the new computerized system and the effectiveness of the new proposed legislation,
bank attendance live pilot demonstrations of the new system and interviews with key personnel
(staff and management as well as Ministers) on site, show evidence of the bank's keen
involvement in monitoring and evaluating components of this project throughout the life of this
credit.

In June 2002, the fifth mission determined that the data exchange system (management
information system) set up was satisfactory after a pilot demonstration. Finally in November 2002
after the credit was closed, the government coordinator presented a commitment letter form the
Minister of Finance to implement the system.

7.3. Banks Role in Contributing to Transparency and Efficiency of Governance of the Trading System:

The Bank has in conjunction with this trade reform credit, provided advice and literature on the
essential elements of a new organic law regarding public utilities, brought together various GOS
ministries for talks and helped to secure agreement on the need for sharing of information
between and within ministries (treasury and customs) and the need for a modernized
computerized systems. These reforms are in turn beneficial to all stakeholders including traders,
consumers and, government departments involved in the delivery of public services. The Bank has
in this way contributed to the development goals of efficiency and transparency in the trading
environment.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
7.4. Overall Bank performance:

Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Much of the difficult task in implementing the
new management system was left to the Ministry of Finance for implementation whilst the Bank
retained for itself the crucial role of provider of strategic advice and support where needed most

in support.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.5. Preparation:

The borrower was well on its way to tariff and tax reform before this credit started. Consequently
it was in a good position to help the Bank in preparing its concept paper and paving the way for
board approval. All requests for information were attended to in a ready manner and this
cooperation speeded up the process for early implementation. The Minister of Finance at the time
was strongly committed to these reforms and in particular the management information system.
He issued a strong policy statement to this effect and was committed to establishing and
monitoring performance criteria for measuring processing at the customs and tax departments.
Moreover the then Minister appointed a committee to pilot the progress of this adjustment
program.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.6. Government Implementation performance:

Subscribing formally to trade liberalization and passage of a new law regulating utilities were the
two aspects of credit conditions that came under the domain of the government. As pointed out
earlier the government was well on its way to trade liberalization by signing up with WAEMU
prior to the implementation of this credit. The GOS had already committed to a series of trade
reform initiatives that would see lowering of tariffs and a reduction of non tariff barriers as well as
institutional reform of its tax and customs procedures. Likewise the government did pass the
required legislation to satisfy the fourth condition for release of the second tranche with only one
extension.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.7 Implementing Agency

The Ministry of Finance is the implementing Agency of this credit .In order to make up for lost
time in implementing the management information system following a change of Ministers, the
Ministry appointed a special consultant in November of 2001 to come up with a plan to
implement this system on time. This was accomplished and five months later the work was done
to the satisfaction of IT experts at both the bank and the AfDB.


7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.8 Overall Borrower performance

The borrower's performance is therefore rated as satisfactory.


8. Lessons Learned

The seeds of successful implementation stem back to basic concept design of the credit.
Noteworthy are the following:



                                                 - 11 -

·        The partnering and working together in common cause of the Lender and Borrower in
preparing, adopting, monitoring, implementing and evaluating the various components of the
credit account for the satisfactory ratings. Key here was the linkage of the credit to internal
reforms           currently being undertaken by the GOS and the level of communications and
collaboration established.
·        The credit was part of an existing comprehensive commitment on the part of the GOS to
embark on trade and tax reform in its fight against        poverty. The desired goal was consistent
with the objective of this credit being a more open and competitive economy with its emphasis on
demonstrated its commitment to reform as set out in 3.3.1.
·        Keeping disbursement conditions few in number and focused on specific objectives rather
than on actions requiring micro-management of              project components allowed for satisfactory
implementation of this credit. The key here was the emphasis on results leaving the means to the
borrower.
·        Key to successful implementation was the challenge of getting the GOS to take ownership
of the process.
·        Managing and assessing the risks at the outset are also important ingredients for successful
implementation. The facts that implementation of           similar management information systems had
been implemented elsewhere and that subscription to WAEMU tenets prohibited imposition of
new import protection measures served as mitigating risk factors.

(2) Ratings and Assessment of Achievement of
Objectives and Outputs


There were four components to this credit: Trade         The outcome in general has been a greater openness
liberalization, trade facilitation, tax facilitation and of the Senegalese economy with the lowering of
regulatory reform.                                       tariffs, reduction of tariff lines and elimination of non
                                                         tariff barriers (trade liberalization measures).
All four components received a satisfactory rating.

                                                      The GOS National Assembly passed a new organic
                                                      law governing the regulation of public utilities. One
                                                      central feature of this law has been to provide for
                                                      competitive pricing of public utility inputs. This has
                                                      been accomplished by empowering regulatory
                                                      authorities to submit to the courts instances of
                                                      anti-competitive behavior or abuse of dominant
                                                      position amongst suppliers of public utility inputs for
                                                      review (Articles 21, 22, 23) and to have same

                                                      The outcome of this is the making for a more
                                                      competitive legal framework for the provision of
                                                      competitive public utility inputs.

                                                      of new systems put into place have accounted for the

(4) Rating of Sustainability

The sustainability of reforms supported by this credit
is rated as likely.

As noted above the likelihood of backtracking on the
implementation of new computerized systems (tax
and tariff procedural reforms) within the various
departments is unlikely- short of lack of commitment
resource wise by the GOS. The major potential threat
would be the lack of continued support (provision of
financial and human resources) to these departments
by the GOS. Users of the system have reported gains
in efficiency to the point that where recently it was
announced the system was being extended to other
parts of the Customs department including outlaying
bureaus. This is but a beginning and the
performance benchmarks marks established at the
outset will have to be re-examined once experience
with the new system has been documented.

Likewise passage of new legislation regulating
public utilities and adoption of the Common
External tariff (trade liberalization) are initiatives
that once implemented do not normally unravel.
Once implemented they are there to stay baring
exceptional circumstances. The challenge that lies
ahead is to implement the legislation and make it
apply to all regulatory bodies. This is a question of
political will accompanied by adequate resource
allocation to make it effective.
(5) Rating of Overall Bank Performance

Bank performance as a whole is rated as
satisfactory.
Regarding the bank performance with respect to
design at entry this was noted earlier as highly
satisfactory being in tune with government needs
and policies of the day.
Regarding Bank performance with respect to
implementation, monitoring and evaluation, the
Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory.

Key here to the satisfactory performance of the
bank were its numerous site visits, interviews with
of staff and management of the departments
concerned on the effectiveness of the work being
undertaken, engagement and review of reports on
aspects of the performance by third party experts

and attendance at live pilot demonstrations of new
systems for a first hand impression ("kicking the
tires"). The fact that this is just the start of a
process and that progress is not as steady or as
speedy as could be expected is more a reflection of
the gradual nature of this challenge.
(6) Rating of Borrower's Performance

This has been rated as satisfactory both in terms of
preparation and implementation. The borrower's
commitment to tariff reform and trade liberalization
was amply demonstrated at the start of the project.
Likewise the keen interest of the Minister in
implementing the new system of computerized
operations and sharing of data across departments
was commendable. The lag in implementation across
the board as opposed to adoption of the computerized
system is a detraction however: likewise the delay
and debate surrounding adoption of new legislation
was a cause for concern. This is all behind us now
but it remains to be seen how the new legislation will
be applied and how effective it will be in creating a
new environment for the competitive pricing of
inputs to public utilities. The high cost of these
inputs has been a serious impediment to further
economic development resulting in a
non-competitive environment that gave rise to this
credit in the first place...
