 outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that the partnering and working\n            together in common cause of the Lender and Borrower in\n            preparing, adopting, monitoring, implementing and evaluating\n            the various components of the credit account for the\n            satisfactory ratings. The key here was the linkage of the\n            credit to internal reforms currently being undertaken by the\n            Government of Senegal (GOS) and the level of communications\n            and collaboration established. The credit was part of an\n            existing comprehensive commitment on the part of the GOS to\n            embark on trade and tax reform in its fight against poverty.\n            The desired goal was consistent with the objective of this\n            credit being a more open and competitive economy with its\n            emphasis on demonstrated its commitment to reform as set out\n            in 3.3.1. Keeping disbursement conditions few in number and\n            focused on specific objectives rather than on actions\n            requiring micro-management of project components allowed for\n            satisfactory implementation of this credit. The key here was\n            the emphasis on results leaving the means to the borrower.\n            The key to successful implementation was the challenge of\n            getting the GOS to take ownership of the process. Managing\n            and assessing the risks at the outset are also important\n            ingredients for successful implementation. The facts that\n            implementation of similar management information systems had\n            been implemented elsewhere and that subscription to West\n            African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) tenets\n            prohibited imposition of new import protection measures\n            served as mitigating risk factors."}, "docdt": "2003-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
