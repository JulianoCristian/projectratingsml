F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall policy objective of the Development Policy Loan (DPL) is to support the
Government's reform of the Ministry of Public Works by strengthening its planning functions;
developing performance standards for contracts and concessions; improving project management;
strengthening regulatory oversight of public works and private contracts; and embedding the
organizational changes in appropriate legal and normative structure. This, in turn, is meant to
contribute to the Government's objectives of greater efficiency in the use of public resources; and
increased transparency, competition and citizen participation in the contracting and concessioning
of public works.

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving
authority)

The PDO remained unchanged during the implementation phase.. The results framework of this
DPL intended to reflect the complexity and wide range of activities encompassed by the Ministry
of Public Work's Reform Program. It was ambitious in its overall scope and included outcomes
that are beyond the timeframe of the program. However, in accordance with Bank guidelines for
DPLs1, the Program Document indicated that the outcomes beyond the timeframe of the program
would be monitored within the framework of a Technical Assistance Loan that accompanies this
DPL.

In retrospective, and given the fact that this initiative was a breakthrough due to the Ministry's
size and to the multiple innovations being pursued, some (but not all) of the expected Project
outcomes should have been defined more carefully. A more conservative approach, in line with
Bank guidance would have helped establish a clearer distinction between end of program
outcomes (monitorable at the time of Completion) that could be attributed to the Project and those
that would materialize in the longer term as the reform process consolidates. Moreover, the
indicators present a number of issues related to their design: in general, they do not have an
adequate balance vis a vis the outcome that has to be measured. More specifically some are hard
to measure and not very realistic, especially because of the differences in costs and efficiencies
generated by new approaches introduced by the reform, such as performance based contract with
higher standards.

It is important to highlight that the PDO remained relevant and completely in line with the
objectives pursued by the Ministry of Public Work's Reform Program. However, the limitations
of the M&E framework described above make it difficult to establish objective measures to assess
the level of PDO achievement to date, as it does not provide ready information to make this type
of judgment. An additional obstacle is given by the short timeframe comprised between the
presentation of the Development Policy Letter (by which the intention to start the reform process
was made public) and this operation's closing date 2 . Thus, Table (a) below presents an
assessment on the likelihood of PDO achievement, based on qualitative evidence that results from
the multiple activities which are currently being carried out under the reform program, and
supervised under Technical Assistance Loan. Table (b) summarizes the achievement of indicators
designed to be complied with at the time of this DPL's ICR.

Bank, until December 2008, when the DPL was closed.

    Indicator        Baseline Value          Values (from        Revised          Achieved at
                                               approval           Target         Completion or
                                             documents)           Values          Target Years

Indicator 1 :    Ministry's investment program aligned with the new strategic plan..
Value
(quantitative or
Qualitative)
Date achieved
                 Achievement of this outcome is likely. Progress under the Strategic Planning
                 component under the TAL has a satisfactory pace. On one hand, the contracting
                 process for the design of a new planning methodology has already been
Comments         launched and is expected to be completed by the 3rd quarter of 2010. On the
(incl. %         other hand, and as noted in Table (b), multiple initiatives to engage all
achievement)     stakeholders involved in infrastructure planning have prepared the ground for
                 the implementation of the new methodology by strengthening consensus,
                 generating a common agenda, and creating institutional coordination
                 mechanisms.
                 Greater competition in bidding supported by fair risk-sharing arrangements

Indicator 2 :    embedded in contracts and consumer-responsive service targets.
                 Reduction in road network maintenance costs of at least 15% for performance-
                 based contracted covered roads.
Value
(quantitative or
Qualitative)
Date achieved
                 Achievement of this outcome is likely. The Roads Directorate has already
                 developed a sample of technical performance standards which have been
                 incorporated to road rehabilitation and conservation contracts for roads in
                 Coquimbo and O'Higgins. Efforts to introduce the concept of standards in other
                 transport infrastructure subsectors are under way, such as the definition of
                 performance indicators for airports with a view to their inclusion in the future
                 concession of the Santiago airport. Progress in technical standards is reinforced
Comments         by the satisfactory work carried out by the team working in regulatory issues
(incl. %         (see below) which focuses on standards from the users' standpoint, generating a
achievement)     positive balance between the two perspectives. Improvements in bidding
                 processes as well as those in the Contractor's Registry and Works Manual of
                 MOPW (see paragraph 42) is also satisfactory and contributes to the procedural
                 and administrative aspects required to foster competition.
                 An analysis of the impact on costs of performance based contracts will be done
                 by the Road Directorate of Chile. The analysis will be done once the first round
                 of performance based contracts expire.




Indicator 3 :    More accurate estimates for project cost and construction durations.

Value
(quantitative or
Qualitative)
Date achieved
                 Achievement of this outcome is likely. To date, the TAL's Project Management
                 (PM) component has achieved very significant progress. The appointment of 60
                 Project Managers that overview projects from an integrated perspective largely

Comments         surpassed the expected short term outputs for the DPL. Training on PM for a

(incl. %         large audience of project staff is being contracted under the TAL, which will

achievement)     help reinforce the new PM approach and the leverage of the recently appointed
                 Project Managers. Other initiatives under the component are under way to
                 empower the role of PMs, who will as a result have clearer incentives, larger
                 control on project design, resource allocation, and works schedules; and will
                 thus be accountable for project duration and costs deviations.
                 a. Greater responsiveness to consumer concerns related to levels of service;
Indicator 4 :    b. Greater oversight of performance of public sector service providers as well as
                 concessionaires
Value
(quantitative or
Qualitative)
Date achieved
                 The achievement of these two outcomes is likely. The Regulatory Strengthening
                 component under the TAL is developing a methodology for measuring user
                 satisfaction in infrastructure services. In addition, the completion of the design
                 of regulatory accounting systems is expected to be achieved by the end of 2009.

Comments         An ongoing consultancy that as of March 2009 completed the first phase (out of

(incl. %         8) will provide the MOPW the capacity to develop and feed economic and

achievement)     financial models to oversee concession contracts. In addition, the MOPW will
                 be able to simulate the economic impacts of changes to contract commitments
                 (including tariffs, investments, subsidies among other regulatory instruments)
                 resulting from contract amendments (Convenios Complementarios), an issue
                 that has generated controversy and has been identified as maybe the only weak
                 aspect of the concession program in Chile.
                 a. Presentation to Congress of Ley Organica or completion of normative

Indicator 5 :    arrangements that proxy law in separation of MOPW's functions;
                 b. Efficiency gains derived from the reform greater than its costs 5 years after it
                 was implemented.
Value
(quantitative or
Qualitative)
Date achieved
                 The process of drafting the regulatory framework for the new institutional
                 structure of the MOPW has proved to be a difficult exercise, as envisaged at
Comments         project appraisal. A number of initiatives have been carried out to facilitate and
(incl. %         improve the drafting of the new law: (i) a legal workshop that analyzed
achievement)     advantages and disadvantages of decentralizing Service Directorates; (ii) a study
                 tour to Colombia; (iii) a comparative analysis of the French, Brazilian and
                 Colombian legislation on the issue; and (iv) an analysis of possible alternatives

                 for the MOPW institutional architecture was commissioned to a consortium of
                 four universities. Finally, extensive consultations with MOPW's unions are
                 currently underway to reach a consensus on the main issues to be included in
                 the new Ley Orgánica.

                 Although it is considered that the implementation of all initiatives under the
                 Reform Program will yield important returns in terms of efficiency, efficiency
                 gains appear as extremely difficult to calculate. After the reform is completed,
                 the MOPW could conduct a regulatory impact assessment, following OECD
                 standards. This indicator, as stated, could only be measured at the earliest in
                 2013.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Macroeconomic Context. Over the 2001-2006 period, the Chilean economy had
reestablished solid economic growth, fueled by robust domestic demand and record high copper
prices. GDP growth had accelerated from 2 - 3 percent in 2001 and 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2005.
Growth in 2006 had slowed to 4.0 percent. Macroeconomic indicators also demonstrated strong
overall performance with declining levels of debt to GDP, rapidly increasing average income
levels, and low and stable inflation. With a disciplined fiscal policy, a broadly neutral monetary
policy, and foreign currency earnings expanding as a result of historically high commodity prices,
the Government's primary concern was the achievement of higher economic growth. Medium-
term macroeconomic projections of the Chilean authorities forecasted a stable GDP growth at
about 5 percent per annum, considering that adverse shocks would have been counterbalanced by
the Government's ability to pursue counter-cyclical fiscal policies.

2. The September 2006 IMF Article IV Review at the time of appraisal commended Chilean
authorities for their continued implementation of sound policies based on a cautious fiscal rule, a
good inflation targeting framework, and trade liberalization. The IMF noted that these policies,
combined with a solid financial system, have led to sustained economic growth and contributed to
poverty reduction.

3. Country Context. In March 2006, Michelle Bachelet succeeded Ricardo Lagos as Chile's
elected President--the fourth successive representative of the Concertación coalition to hold the
office since 1990. The new government reaffirmed its commitment to the prudent
macroeconomic management and the outward oriented economy of previous administrations
while expanding access to public services that would help more Chileans contribute to the
country's growth and development. The 2007 Budget, submitted to Congress on September 30,
2006, was in line with these priorities with a planned increase in spending of 8.9 percent in real
terms.

4. Since the start of its mandate in March of 2006, the Bachelet Administration committed itself
to achieving the goal of "Growth with Equality of Opportunity." This goal inspired an ambitious
Government Program that reflected a consensus on the need to move beyond the first generation
of reforms and to confront the remaining challenges to achieving higher levels of growth. In
promoting economic growth, the program put explicit emphasis on raising levels of income and
improving the quality of life so as to converge with the standards of the OECD.

5. Sector Background. In the early 1990s, the Government of Chile took stock of its
infrastructure needs and estimated its infrastructure deficit at US$11 billion with additional losses
due to lack of competitiveness of US$1.7 billion annually.3 In determining how to respond to this
need for massive investments and significant improvements in service delivery, the Government
also recognized that the public sector did not have the resources to carry out the major works
required, nor could it commit its budgetary resources exclusively to infrastructure investments
given the country's social investment needs.

                                                  1

6. To help face this challenge, the Government called on the private sector to take part in the
building, maintenance and operation of major road works. Thus, the Chilean Concessions System
was born, allowing the private sector to finance economically profitable projects and recover their
investment primarily through direct charges to users.           In the years since its inception, the
concession program has expanded both in terms of sectors and design. Sectorally, Chile had at
the time of appraisal (and still has today) what may be the world's most extensive concession
program encompassing roads, ports, railroads, bridges, tunnels, reservoirs, jails and canals.

7. President Bachelet launched the "Infrastructure Development for Competitiveness Plan" at
the inception of her administration to ensure that public infrastructure would help different
productive sectors be more efficient.4 The Plan called for a US$115 million increase in public
spending on infrastructure in 2007, and marked the first step in an ambitious program over four
years, from 2007 to 2010. The Plan depended significantly on private sector involvement through
improved collaboration and through tax incentives to stimulate private investment in public roads.
In announcing the Plan, the President noted that the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) would be
supervising infrastructure concessions worth US$2.2 billion between 2007 and 2010. The
administration recognized that both its growing public investment and concessioning programs
would require greater attention in terms of planning, contract design, project management and
oversight in order for them to maximize their potential as contributors to higher growth levels.

8. In addition, on March 13, 2007, the Government presented its "Chile Invests" Plan that
provided details on the context in which this greater emphasis on infrastructure investment would
be carried out.   5 The new plan included an initiative entitled, "Creating a More Agile
Government," which directly called for the modernization of the MOPW and described the key
points of an Institutional Strengthening Program. The Plan called for a new legal structure for the
Ministry that would separate out responsibilities for roles and functions (e.g., planning, contract
design, execution, oversight); strengthen technical capacities (e.g., through integrated project
management); and create the Superintendency of Public Works to regulate contracts and
concessions.

9. The MOPW represents, in many ways, a linchpin in the Chilean economy. Its own budget of
US$1.25 billion at project appraisal made it one of the largest financiers of construction in the
country. The additional US$600 million to US$1.1 billion per year in concession investments that
it leveraged made it the primary driver of public-private partnerships in the country. Its rural
infrastructure programs have been providing direct services for much of the country's poor.
Perhaps most profoundly, the infrastructure network that MOPW has been building and
maintaining underpins the competitiveness of most major industries in Chile. Thus, government's
efforts to reach a new level of efficiency and accountability in infrastructure investment had to
necessarily focus on MOPW's capacities to achieve significant impacts.

10. The MOPW's Institutional Reform Program is an ambitious effort to respond to the
challenges described in previous paragraphs. The overall reform objective is to achieve greater

11. The GoC requested Bank support in those areas that focused mostly on changes in the
Ministry's business processes, and on the key legal and organizational aspects that would
underpin those changes. In particular, the GoC requested the Bank's involvement in this initiative
in order to leverage the Bank's experience in logistics and territorial planning, the design of
public-private contracts, in project management and in the development of regulatory frameworks
for infrastructure. In fact, the Bank offered a comparative advantage in its ability to draw upon
global knowledge, sustain a policy dialogue, and exploit synergies with other operations and
technical support including, but not limited to, the Territorial Development Project, the Santiago
Urban Transport DPL and TAL, and the fee-for-service technical assistance projects on the
valuation of contingent liabilities in infrastructure and the definition of policy options to improve
the performance of EFE, the state owned Chilean rail operator.

12. The Ministry of Finance and the MOPW were attracted by the synergies that could be gained
from having both a DPL and a TAL to finance several of their key initiatives. First, because the
thematic and substantive linkage of the two projects was expected to provide an effective
framework for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Ministry's reform program
for a period long enough that exceeds the current administration. Second, by having both a DPL
and TAL, the political profile of the Bank-financed projects increased, making possible a
contingent role of the Bank as an honest broker between the Ministries of Finance and Public
Works in case the reform suffered major setbacks in the years to come.

13. Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Bank supported those areas that represent the pillars of
the reform where it was thought to provide the largest value added. These areas, as mentioned
above, focused mostly on changes in the Ministry's business processes, and on the key legal and
organizational aspects that would underpin those changes.

14. The choice of the lending instruments to implement Bank's support to the reform process was
discussed in detail with the Chilean authorities, and it was decided that a DPL together with a
TAL would be the most adequate option. The DPL was intended to speed up the achievement of a
set of policy-oriented prior actions (see a description of Prior actions in Sec. 1.4) that would
provide the basis (and pave the way) for the technical activities and initiatives to be implemented
under the TAL. The DPL would also entail the attainment of specific short term outputs and a
disbursement condition oriented to reinforce the reform pillars established by the prior actions. In
addition, and given the relative importance of the Ministry of Finance in Chile, the DPL was an
excellent tool for MOPW to ensure the Ministry of Finance's support from the beginning of the
reform process. The single- tranche operation, as opposed to a programmatic loan, aiming at the
first phase of the MOPW institutional strengthening reform, was effective. It responded
successfully to the needs of the authorities by providing timely support built upon clearly
established prior actions. Finally, the three elements described previously (prior actions, short
term outputs, and disbursement condition) were thought out carefully to ensure the maximum
impact possible given the short timeframe that is typical of this type of lending instrument.

15. The two loans focused on strategic interventions that reflect the Bank's infrastructure lending
and technical assistance program in many Middle Income Countries. Integrated planning, rational
project management, appropriate public-private contract design, and regulatory structures that
protect both consumers and investors are areas of core competence for the Bank. It is important to
outline that this reform initiative was a breakthrough in the LAC region, not only due to the
magnitude of MOPW (both in terms of budget it handles and the infrastructure sectors it
encompasses) but also as a result of the complexity of the objectives pursued in each of the policy
areas.

16. By supporting the implementation of the Government's Institutional Strengthening Program,
the DPL was in line with the goals and strategic approach set out in the relevant government
plans described above and in the latest joint IBRD-IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2007).
The objective of the joint CPS was to support Chile's efforts to converge with OECD income
levels and living standards by (i) accelerating growth and (ii) building a more equitable society.

17. The overall policy objective of the DPL and the TAL was to support the Government
modernization program of the MOPW. The five policy areas under the DPL represent a subset of
areas within a large modernization program where the Bank has been engaged. Thus, the Bank
supports specific policy initiatives oriented to: (i) strengthening its planning functions; (ii)
developing performance standards for contracts and concessions; (iii) improving project
management; (iv) strengthening regulatory oversight of public works and private contracts, and;
(v) embedding the organizational changes in appropriate legal and normative structure. This, in
turn, was meant to contribute to the Government's objectives of greater efficiency in the use of
public resources; and increased transparency, competition and citizen participation in the
contracting and concessioning of public works.

18. Short, medium and long term goals of the DPL and TAL. The DPL intended to achieve the
explicit short term outputs listed in the following Table. The DPL's policy matrix also defined a
subsequent series of tasks to be undertaken in each policy area that will require several years to
complete. These tasks that will be implemented under the TAL are aligned with both the overall
development objectives and will build upon the short term outputs defined for the DPL. It is
relevant to outline that although DPL and TAL objectives overlap in each of the policy areas both
operations differ in terms of their expected impacts. According to the Project Document the
single-tranche DPL is expected to achieve end of program short term outputs, while the TAL
should achieve its defined outcomes in a longer term. In accordance with the Bank guidelines for
DPLs , this ICR presents an analysis on the likelihood of PDO and related outcomes'

achievement at completion although the monitoring of progress of the TAL's components will
allow for the evaluation of mid and long term sustainability of DPL's objectives.

21. Prior Actions. The table below presents the prior actions and their link with each of the policy
areas supported by the DPL. In retrospect, the effort and time spent in establishing the set of prior
actions was fruitful. First, because these were well defined and actually yielded the expected
impacts in their respective policy areas. Second, because their achievement provided momentum
to kick-off the reform initiative. The GoC complied with all of them in a timely fashion, and thus
the Bank team proceeded to present both Projects (DPL and TAL) to the Board of Directors.

                                                                          responsibilities.

22. For the specific case of the fifth Policy Area, "Organizational Reform", no prior action was
set. Though, the presentation to Congress of a draft law establishing a new mechanism for
oversight of public works contracts and concessions (by the creation of a Superintendency of
Public Works) was established as a disbursement condition. The rationale for this was agreed
upon Chilean authorities and the Bank team: this law was considered to be at the core of the



                                                    9

reform initiative and its presentation to Congress had to be highlighted as the condition sine qua
non to define the success of the DPL.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

23. The policy areas were not revised during the life of the project.

1.6 Other significant changes

24. There were no significant changes made to the project from the design stage to the
completion of the operation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

25. The operation tranche.

The Institutional Strengthening of the MOPW DPL was approved by the Board of Directors of
the World Bank in June 2007. Formal Project preparation activities started with the Concept
Review meeting held in October 2006; and the appraisal mission was carried out in March 2007.
The single tranche was disbursed only a few days before the closing date, in December 2008. The
World Bank experience shows that countries that take DPL loans request the full amount of
available resources as soon as the conditions for disbursement are met. This was not the case for
this loan to Chile. The Ministry of Finance requested the single tranche disbursement only a few
days before the closing date of the loan which occurred several months after the condition for
disbursement was met. Given the sound fiscal policy Chile has been implementing during the last
several years, the delay in the request of total available funds responded to Government
optimization of its fiscal resources and expenditure management. By no means did it imply a lack
of commitment to the MOPW modernization program.

         mechanism for oversight of public works contracts and concessions.



27. The original draft Law creating the Superintendency of Public Works and amending the
Concession Law was split in two drafts. The draft amending the Concession Law was presented
to the Senate in 2007 and is expected to be approved by the Congress during calendar year 2009.
The Law creating the Superintendency of Public Works was first presented to the Lower House
of Congress (Cámara de los Diputados) in 2007. The draft was subsequently withdrawn in
December 2008 and resubmitted to the Senate in January 2009 by the Executive to expedite the

legislative procedure, though the Law is not expected to be approved until the end of the
presidential mandate.

28. Rationale of the disbursement condition: The disbursement condition specified in the Loan
Agreement responds to a request of the Word Bank to translate the reform pillars contained in the
Development Policy Letter and other documents into a legal commitment. The Government of
Chile supported this condition as it was viewed as a credible pledge to the start of the reform
process and a tool that would make it difficult to reverse the reform process.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

29. The endorsement by the MOPW leadership of the modernization program has ensured the
continuity of the reform. After Minister Bitrán, who was the original reform champion, left office
in January 2008, immediate support by his successor, Minister Bitar, was decisive to providing
continuity to the modernization program. This endorsement was critical at a time when support to
the reform was waning within the MOPW due to weaknesses in the internal communication of
the reform's principles and objectives among ministry's stakeholders. In this regard, it is worth
mentionioning that Minister Bitar, in coordination with the Directorate of Public Works
(Dirección General de Obras Públicas -DGOP), favored a more participative approach to the
implementation of reform and backed the empowerment of the project components. Both of these
actions served to enhance the ownership of the reform.

30. The commitment to the reform demonstrated by the highly qualified team leading the project
components contributed to the successful implementation of the reform pillars. Team leaders have
been key in involving MOPW senior and junior staff (both in Santiago, where the headquarters of
the MOPW are located and in all the country's Regions) in the modernization process. They have
fostered implementation pace of the reform by organizing trainings, strengthening the dialogue
and building coordination stages among ministry areas that had traditionally worked somewhat in
isolation.

31. MOPW leadership's remarkable efforts to involve the main stakeholders in the reform
process have been essential to maintain the pace of implementation. The new Minister (Bitar), the
DGOP, and the Undersecretary were key in backing a stronger consultation with the MOPW
internal stakeholders. MOPW unions were granted a direct dialogue with the Minister. The team
leading the project components involved MOPW's senior managers in the design and
implementation of the reform through a detailed consultation program. Furthermore, the team
leading the project components consulted with the MOPW unions through ad hoc committees.
Training associated with change management activities served also to communicate and explain
the principles and implementation priorities of the reform to non-managerial MOPW personnel
further expanding the acknowledgment of the reform. Finally, the Change Management
component also used the intranet to share the pattern and advancement of the modernization
process with the MOPW personnel.

32. A strong policy dialogue and analytical underpinning contributed to a sound project design.
The objectives and actions of the Institutional Strengthening Program were the result of more
than a year of work at MOPW and from consultations with relevant external stakeholders. The
effort has been coordinated by a multidisciplinary team composed of MOPW staff with specific
responsibilities for each technical area of reform. That team has worked to identify the main
shortcomings of the MOPW and has developed proposals for their improvement. The World



                                                 11

Bank has supported the work of these teams with technical and regulatory advice since the early
stages of the reform's inception. The result framework of the operation was very well focused
with significant prior actions each of which had a high degree of substance spanning an
appropriate range of five different policy areas.

33. Bank and country specific procurement processes coupled with high turnover of key staff in
the PIU have slowed implementation of Bank financed activites. The process for public
contracting in Chile mandates the revision and approval of all contracts by Contraloría (national
auditing body of Chile). The approval of Contraloría has to be obtained after the no objection to
the contracting process and outcome is provided by the Bank. The role of Contraloría is very
important and has helped Chile become the most effective country in Latin America in
controlling corruption7. However, the double approval process and the lack of a fast track
clearance process by Contraloría in Bank financed activities has had a negative impact in the
schedule of consultancies envisaged under the Bank financed Project. Although this observation
applies only to the TAL that accompanies the DPL, it is important to include it in this ICR
because it applies to the effectiveness of the Bank and MOPW partnership. Another factor that
has somewhat delayed Bank-financed activities is the very high turnover of the Project
Coordinator office in the PIU. The head of this unit has changed, on average, every six months
since the project identification mission.

34. Risk assessment at appraisal. Risks identified at appraisal were relevant and have been well
managed as mitigating factors were embedded in the design of the DPL.

    a.The risk of Minister Bitrán leaving the MOPW, an event that could threaten the
    sustainability of the reform process. The loss of the reform champion was correctly identified.
    As indicated by Minister Bitar during his inaugural speech, the presence of the World Bank
    was instrumental to guarantee the continuity of the reform process. In fact, one of the main
    reasons for requesting the participation of the World Bank as a partner (through the DPL and
    TAL) in the reform process was to ensure the continuity of the modernization program.

    b.The risk referred to the approval of laws by Congress (a new organizational structure for
    the MOPW, the bill creating the Superintendency and the amendments to the Concession
    Law) that were well identified at appraisal remain "Moderate" and will be dealt with in
    section 4 (Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome).

    c.The risk that broadening the MOPW's planning capabilities could slow down the MOPW's
    pipeline and hinder investment flow has not materialized. The organization of several training
    and capacity building activities, the advancement of prior actions as well as the negotiations
    of Programmatic Agreements with Regional Governments (outlining specific infrastructure
    works to be jointly financed between each of these and the MOPW) served to gradually
    merge the new principles of integrated planning methodologies within the pipeline
    development without disrupting the project implementation flow.




7The Governance Indicator database produced by the World Bank (available at
http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.asp) shows that Chile has the top ranking position among
countries in Latin America for the indicator Control of Corruption.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


35. The design of the Program Matrix did not include end-of program outcomes monitorable at
the time of completion. The Policy Matrix intended to reflect the complexity and wide range of
activities encompassed by MOPW's Reform Program is ambitious in its overall scope. It has been
already mentioned in section F above that some (but not all) of the expected Project outcomes
should have been defined more carefully. The result framework of the DPL lacked a clear
distinction between end-of program outcomes monitorable at the time of completion and
outcomes that would materialize in the longer term as the reform process consolidates.
Furthermore, the indicators for the medium term outcomes do not have an adequate balance vis a
vis the outcome that has to be measured; more specifically some are hard to measure and not very
realistic. These limitations of the M&E framework make it difficult to establish objective
measures to assess the level for the medium term outcomes achievement for this ICR, lacking the
information to make this type of judgment at completion. An additional obstacle to this is given
by the typology of the lending instrument (a single-tranche DPL) and the short timeframe
comprised between the presentation of the Development Policy Letter (by which the intention to
start the reform process was made public) and this operation's completion date.

36. M&E design tied medium and long terms outcomes in the key policy areas to actions to be
implemented under the TAL, thus ensuring DPL sustainability. The Project's M&E framework
reflects the linkages between the two loans and strikes a balance in terms of the outputs and
outcomes that result from each of them. Clearly defined short-term outputs were selected as
natural evolution of DPL prior actions, and were valuable in terms of measuring project
advancement. The set of medium term outcomes helped to narrow down and provided useful
milestones for each policy area objectives even though these are to occur outside the timeframe of
the single-tranche operation. The fine tuning of the indicators to ensure their alignment with the
expected outcomes, the availability of data for their periodic monitoring, and the establishment of
baseline values is being carried out as part of the supervision activities of the TAL.

37. M&E implementation was useful to strengthen the dialogue with the counterpart and identify
new opportunities for support. Both the interim semi annual report prepared by the MOPW and
the supervision missions were particularly useful to collect data relating to the project
implementation. The missions provided the framework for an in depth follow-up of the project
components' progress and served to highlight pending issues to the authorities. In addition the
supervision missions gave the Bank and the MOPW the opportunity to deepen the policy dialogue
and identify areas of joint cooperation that were not identified during project preparation. Finally,
a field visit conducted during project supervision served to corroborate the process of the reform
implementation in the regions. It also contributed to motivate the decentralized MOPW staff, and
was particularly useful to provide feedback to the component's team leader that attended the field
visit.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

38. TAL support and supervision to achieve medium to longer term outcomes. The TAL is
supporting the subsequent series of activities (consultancies, expert advice, capacity building and
training) to be undertaken in each policy area. Although implementation of these activities will
require several years, the TAL will ensure the continuous budgetary and technical support needed
for achieving sustainability to the project. The progress monitoring of the TAL's components will
allow for the evaluation of the progress against the medium to longer term DPL's objectives.



                                                  13

The results of the Bank support have underscored the added value of the operation. As discussed
in previous paragraphs of this ICR, the Government of Chile has put great emphasis on their
choice of the TAL as the best instrument to support the implementation of the reform initiative; as
a result, a second DPL request from GoC seems highly unlikely.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39. The loan objective remains relevant to the country and Bank agenda. The main objective of
the DPL remains extremely relevant to Chile's current agenda. The President restated her
commitment to the modernization of the State in her speech of May 21, 2008. To this end, the
MOPW committed to the achievement of 16 objectives with the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
which has been designated by the President to supervise the national modernization program that
includes all ministries and public agencies in Chile. The Ministry of Finance is supporting the
MOPW reform program by ensuring a stable amount of funds in the budget for adequate project
implementation. Furthermore, Chile's continued efforts to converge with OECD countries
performance provide a favorable support for the reform. Finally, in the current context of global
financial crisis, MOPW will have an even more active role in the Chilean economy as a vehicle
for implementation of countercyclical policies 8 . The need to improve the efficiency and
performance of the MOPW becomes even more important in the light of its increasing role as
growth and employment generator.

40. The objective of the loan also remains relevant for the achievement of the Bank strategic
objectives, which emphasized the need to continue to focus on the modernization of the state
through a close engagement with the Chilean authorities. Likewise the project objectives are fully
consistent with those set in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) endorsed by the Board in May
2007, contributing directly to objectives of supporting the efficiency of infrastructure and public
services in addition to decentralization and regional development.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

41. Integrated Planning. This component is rated Satisfactory.




8Chile has been cited as an example of how to implement adequate countercyclical economic policies. See
for instance the article titled "Stimulating" published by The Economist on February 19, 2009 (available at
http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145570)

42. The prior actions designed for this policy area were met, establishing the pillars for the
subsequent initiatives. These prior actions included the design of Competitiveness Plans for all
regions and the signing of two Programmatic Agreements with Regional Governments, which
outlined specific infrastructure works to be jointly financed between each of the Regional
Governments and the MOPW, thus strengthening a more coordinated and participatory approach
to planning.

43. The MOPW has gone further than what was established in the prior actions by carrying out
Competitiveness Plans for all Regions of the country. Furthermore, MOPW has also negotiated
and signed, by December 2008, Programmatic Agreements with all Regional Governments,
which represent a major step for the implementation of the Competiveness Plans.9

44. The planning approach discussed during Project preparation was based on productive clusters,
as it was considered that this methodology could yield better results in terms of investment
harmonization among regions, with MOPW acting as a coordinator. However, this proved to be
difficult to implement, as Chile did not have a shared and comprehensive vision of its
infrastructure needs in the long run. Productive clusters usually encompass two or more regions,
and reaching agreements on infrastructure requirements for a particular sector was complicated in
the absence of a consensus on what the regional or territorial needs were. Thus, MOPW
suggested changing the methodology toward a territorial planning approach, to lay the
foundations for subsequent discussions on cluster needs. This initiative was strongly supported by
the Bank's team, as it was understood that the construction of a country-wise strategic vision was
a fundamental requirement to conduct effective sectoral supply chain analysis in the future. To
build up the general vision on infrastructure needs, MOPW carried out 5 workshops at the central
government level and 15 in the regions, which were attended by approximately 1200 stakeholders
including MOPW officials and representatives of relevant line ministries, local authorities, and
the private sector. These workshops concluded in December 2008 and the main outputs were two
documents that present the agreements reached on the country's infrastructure and infrastructure
services needs to 2020: the Strategic Map for Chile's Infrastructure Development; and the
compilation of 15 Regional Infrastructure Development Maps for the same period. Another
important output of this complex process led by MOPW was the establishment of "counterpart
teams" at the regional level, which will represent the region in MOPW's planning exercise each
year.




9The territory of Chile is divided in 15 Regions

45. In spite of the change in the planning process' priorities just described, this component is
rated as satisfactory as the 15 Regional Competitiveness Plans completed by December 2008
include specific chapters in which the relevant regional clusters were analyzed in detail.

47. In the area of Standards, the component has developed a sample of performance standards for
low volume roads and for road networks concessions. In a good example of cooperation between
departments of the MOPW and tangible implementation of tools developed under the MOPW
modernization program, the newly developed standards have been adopted for the contract design
of the Coquimbo and O'Higgins road network concession. The Coquimbo network concession
contract deserves a special mention for two reasons. First, it is extremely innovative: the contract
combines elements of toll roads, shadow tolls, and performance based contracts (similar to
CREMA contracts financed by the Bank in other Latin American countries). Second, it was
jointly designed by the Roads Directorate (Vialidad) team and staff currently developing
standards of service for all of MOPW's infrastructure works. From this perspective, the
Coquimbo contract required a different level of dialogue that resulted in a balanced combination
of technical aspects with a new dimension of standards that focuses on users' needs. Thus far,
MOPW has received 10 bids for the Coquimbo network, of which 7 have been prequalified.
Additional activities in the road sector that include innovative aspects of standards include the
recent implementation by Vialidad of mixed input-based and output-based road management
contracts for 3-5 year periods.

48. Efforts to introduce the concept of standards in other transport infrastructure subsectors are
under way, such as the definition of performance indicators for airports with a view to their
inclusion in the future concession of the Santiago airport10. The definition of performance



10The airport that serves the city of Santiago was concessioned in 1998 for a 15 year term. The term of the
concession was made variable in 2004 with a maximum extension of 78 months from the original ending
date of the concession.




                                                    16

indicators will be the outcome of a consensus building exercise among the MOPW Airport
Directorate, the Civil Aviation Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Transport,
the MOPW Coordination Unit of Concessions and representatives from airports concessionaires
and major airlines.

49. In the area of Contracts and Competition, based on the results of a completed consultancy, a
proposal for the amendment of the regulatory framework for public works and consultant services
development is being drafted. This includes the modification and digitalization of the consultants
and contractors registry (registro de contratistas y consultores) as well as the production of new
regulation for public works contracts (reglamento de obras). This initiative is intended to remove
barriers of entry in the registry and enhance completion. The intention of the MOPW is to
complete within the year 2009 a comprehensive study to improve contract management. The
study will focus on two main aspects of public contracting: (i) the definition, improvement and
standardization of bidding documents (bases de licitación) for public works, with a view to
improving risk allocation as a means to increase efficiency of public expenditures; and (ii)
contract management, focusing on improving administrative processes and eliminating

51. The component has fully met the proposed short term goal as 60 project mangers have been
appointed by MOPW Service Directors11. Project managers operate in every Service Directorate
and in every Region covering 30% of the MOPW investment portfolio. About 50% of project
managers are based in the Regions. The regulation for public works (Reglamento de Obras
Públicas), which is completely drafted and is expected to be enacted during 2009, crystallizes the
concept, profile and instruments related to the figure of Project Manager (PM). The multiple
initiatives undertaken by MOPW have contributed to the clarification and more precise definition
of the PMs' role and duties. First, the implementation of supporting technologies such as the
integrated technological platform for project management coupled with the public works digital
book has contributed to enhance the PMs' roles. In addition, workshops and training programs
that will start in 2009 will allow the certification of 400 MOPW personnel in integrated project
management, including fiscal inspectors and senior mangers. A consultancy for implementing a

53. The component is developing a methodology for measuring user satisfaction in infrastructure
services. This task encompasses the definition and measurement of a baseline and its indicators
for 20 projects including airports and concessioned urban and interurban roads. The baseline and
indicators for service standards were developed for roads, as mentioned when describing the
achievements of the Standards component.

54. The component developed the integrated technological platform (used by the Standards and
the Integrated Project Management components) that serves the purpose of monitoring the
operation of concessions and the management of public works. This database, still in its early
stage of development, is expected to be a key tool for the Superintendency when it is created.

55. The completion of the design of regulatory accounting systems is expected to be achieved by
the end of 2009. An ongoing consultancy that as of March 2009 completed the first phase (out of
8) will provide the MOPW the capacity to develop and feed economic and financial models to
oversee concession contracts. In addition, the MOPW will be able to simulate the economic
impacts of changes to contract commitments (including tariffs, investments, subsidies among
other regulatory instruments) resulting from contract amendments (Convenios Complementarios),
an issue that has generated controversy and has been identified as maybe the only weak aspect of
the concession program in Chile. Once regulatory accounting systems are available, Chile will be
one of the few countries in Latin America that will have these systems in place. In transport, only
the surface transport agency (ANTT) in Brazil and the transport regulator in Peru (Ositran) have
operating regulatory accounting systems.

57. The process of drafting the regulatory framework for the new institutional structure of the
MOPW (Anteproyectos de Ley Orgánica) has proved to be a difficult exercise, as envisaged at
project appraisal. Even though several preliminary drafts were prepared, many issues remain to
be defined to reach a consensus on the final version of the law.

58. A number of initiatives have been carried out to facilitate and improve the drafting of the new
law: (i) a legal workshop that analyzed advantages and disadvantages of decentralizing Service
Directorates; (ii) a study tour to Colombia; (iii) a comparative analysis of the French, Brazilian
and Colombian legislation on the issue; and (iv) an analysis of possible alternatives for the
MOPW institutional architecture was commissioned to a consortium of four universities.

59. The draft organizational law (Ley Orgánica) is expected to be presented to Minister Bitar by
September 2009 and subsequently submitted to Congress. Extensive consultations with MOPW's
unions are currently underway to reach a consensus on the main issues to be included in the new
Ley Orgánica.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

60. The operation has met its project development objectives of creating the foundations for
increasing the effectiveness, and efficiency of the MOPW further cementing the sound reputation
of Chile public institutions. Specifically, this DPL has been instrumental to design and implement
a modernization plan for the MOPW that will certainly contribute to position Chile closer to the
ultimate goal of achieving standards of public sector performance of OECD countries. The
progress observed in the major project components (i.e strengthening the MOP planning
functions; development of performance standards for contracts and concessions; improvement of
project management capabilities; and strengthening of public works and private contracts'
regulatory oversight) provides a strong signal to all stakeholders about the commitment to the
modernization program and the irreversibility of the process. The achievement of the longer term
DPL's objectives of enhancing the quality of Chile's public expenditure increasing transparency,
competition and citizen-participation in the contracting and concessioning of public works will
require several years and the TAL will ensure the continuous budgetary and technical support
needed for reaching these objectives and granting sustainability to the project. In view of the



                                                  19

progress made so far towards the achievement of the PDO and the continuous relevance of the
agenda, the operation would justify a "Highly Satisfactory" rating; however the delay in the
approval by the Congress of the new organizational law for the MOPW, the law creating the
Superintendency of Public Works, and the amendments to the Concession Law, creates a
moderate uncertainty for the overall sustainability of the reform program. Therefore, the ICR is
rated overall as Satisfactory

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61. The operation built the foundations for generating an indirect impact on poverty alleviation
by inducing greater efficiency, effectiveness and accountability in the utilization of public
resources. It also broadened participation in public infrastructure investment, and fostered
transparency and accountability in infrastructure service delivery (principally by enhancing
oversight, and access to information). In addition, the project promoted instruments such as
strategic environmental assessments that have already fostered (and will continue to foster) the
integration of environmental aspects into the planning process. All the above, will help Chile to
achieve OECD standards for public works projects that contribute to sustainable development.

62. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning that during meetings with Minister Bitar and the
Strategic Steering Group that he leads the topic of climate change in general and glacier melt in
particular was identified. The Project team and the PIU made possible the interaction of sectoral
experts in the MOPW and the Bank in this area that prompted possible future partnerships
between the MOPW and the Bank.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening)

63. The operation's institutional impact was and will be substantial. On the one hand, it
established in the new draft law the foundation of a new institutional structure for the MOPW. On
the other, it implemented procedural changes that could be undertaken without legal changes.
This includes the creation of a single directorate of Planning designed to provide an integrated
strategic vision for all types of infrastructures. The operation introduced the profile of the project
manager which was key to create an integrated project management approach that covers the full
life cycle of projects. It also designed a Project Management Office (PMO) to improve the
management and oversight of the portfolio of projects under the responsibility of the MOPW.
The operation further developed an integrated technological platform that will build a database
for monitoring the performance of concessions and public works.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

64. The relevance of this project for the Bank agenda should be highlighted as Chile is an
example for the Bank in the area of infrastructure service provision. The Bank has constantly
relied on Chile to illustrate to other countries in different regions how infrastructure reforms
should be conducted, in particular in the area of attracting private sector financing and operators
through public private partnerships. In the last couple of years, World Bank staff and public
officials from East Asia and South East Asia have conducted study tours to learn from the
Chilean experience. Thus, the Bank will benefit significantly from the MOPW modernization
process as it will provide valuable lessons for other countries that request the assistance of the
Bank to follow a similar path of reforms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

65. Three sources of risk that were well identified at appraisal remain "Moderate". These risks
concern the approval of laws by Congress: (i) a new organizational structure for the MOPW, (ii)
the bill creating the Superintendency and (iii) the amendments to the Concession Law.

    a.The risk of Congress not passing into law a new organizational structure. The draft has not
    yet been submitted to the Congress. Minister Bitar entrusted the MOPW Chief Counsel
    (Fiscal) with drafting of the new law. The Fiscal has undertaken a drafting process involving
    MOPW unions. The draft is expected to be presented to the President before the end of 2009
    and subsequently to Congress. The moderate risk derives from: (a) the need to produce a draft
    text that is the result of an internal consensus building exercise with MOPW unions; and (b)
    resistance to institutional change.

    b.The risk of Congress not passing into law the bill creating the Superintendency. The Law
    creating the Superintendecy of Public Works was first presented to the Lower House in 2007.
    The draft was subsequently withdrawn in December 2008 and re-submitted in January 2009
    to the Senate by the Executive to expedite the procedure, though the Law is not expected to
    be approved until the end of the presidential mandate. The moderate risk derives from (a) the
    need to reach sufficient political support, in particular from the private sector (investors,
    operators, financiers); and (b) the limited availability of members of Congress and space in
    the Congressional agenda during the electoral year.

    c. The risk of Congress not passing into law the amendments to the Concession Law. The
    draft amending the Concession Law was first presented to the Senate in 2008 and was
    expected to be approved by the end of that year. Representatives of several key public service
    concession owners opposed the draft (particularly a new dispute resolution mechanism) and
    requested a two year delay for the enactment of the draft because of the financial crisis. The
    government (with support from several renowned Chilean economists) has thus far refused to
    consider delaying the discussion of the draft.

66. Two new sources of risk were identified at this point.

    a.The risk of change of government affecting or delaying project implementation. Although
    the current presidential frontrunners have expressed their intention to continue on the path of
    reform, the upcoming elections clearly bring uncertainty to the continuation of project
    implementation. However, the reform has achieved a degree of institutional maturity and has
    broader support among key stakeholders. The TAL, which provides resources for carrying
    out the reform as well as for its monitoring and evaluation, provides a sufficient mitigation
    measure to assure the project's continuity. This risk is considered "Low".

    b.The risk of cultural resistance and vested interests opposing project implementation. A well
    established organizational culture and self-interest inertia have resisted institutional change
    within the MOPW. Mitigation measures aimed at fostering stakeholders' participation and
    promoting change management served to counter-balance this resistance to change. The
    gradual integration of new profiles (such as the project manger) and the progressive definition
    of new institutional bodies for supervision and coordination, also served to mitigate this risk
    which is considered overall "Moderate".

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

67. The rating for Bank performance during the preparation phase is satisfactory. The
justification for this rating is as follows. Acknowledging the complexity of the reform, the Bank
assigned a highly qualified team with extensive experience in the relevant policy areas. The team
was able to maintain a close collaboration with the Minister and his team from the beginning, and
responded promptly and with high levels of flexibility to their requests for assistance in certain
topics (particularly the drafting of the Concessions and Superintendency of Public Works Law) at
the outset of the reform process. Experts from different parts of the world participated actively in
preparation missions and workshops, providing ad-hoc advice directly to the Minister and his
cabinet on specific issues. The team's appropriate skill mix helped deliver a well designed project
and provided value added to the Borrower. The Bank's performance assisting the Borrower in
identifying and appraising the project to ensure consistency with the CAS and with government's
priorities, and in a manner that would ensure attainment of expected outcomes, was also very
valuable. Performance at entry could have been highly satisfactory if design of the M&E
framework had included end-of-program outcomes monitorable at completion.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

68. A close follow-up dialogue was established to track the achievement of the short term outputs
of the DPL. In addition, traditional supervisory activities to monitor progress toward mid-term
outcomes are being carried out in the context of the TAL. Project execution was regularly
supervised and missions traveled to the field more than twice a year, with additional regular Bank
support provided directly by the Project team. Progress and ratings are adequately reported in the
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Beyond the focus on regular supervision matters, there is a
strong interest on the part of the Bank in assessing impact of project activities and, in doing so,
maintaining central government focus in the reform agenda. To ensure that impact analysis is
feasible, the M&E framework for the TAL is currently being revised with Chilean counterparts to
ensure that indicators are objective and that the required data to monitor their evolution
throughout project implementation is available.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory




                                                 22

69. Government performance is rated satisfactory due to the commitment and involvement in
MOPW's reform initiative, as evidenced by: (i) the active participation of the Ministry of Finance
in the definition of the prior actions and triggers for the DPL. The positive commitment of the
Ministry of Finance, given the structure of power in Chile, is a sine qua non condition for the
successful implementation of any institutional reform in Chile; (ii) the explicit support from the
highest levels of government to the reform program in public speeches and press releases; (iii) the
continued and timely budgetary support from the Ministry of Finance to ensure smooth
implementation of the activities envisaged by the reform program; and (iv) the valuable
contributions and participation from staff of other public agencies in multiple initiatives of the
reform program (in particular, involvement of multiple agencies in the seminars carried out by
MOPW under the Integrated Planning policy area).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

70. Implementing agency performance is rated as satisfactory. From the beginning of project
implementation, MOPW has assigned a qualified team to lead the initiatives under each policy
area. These teams have worked hard in the production of terms of reference, and in the
organization of trainings and other events; strengthening the dialogue and building coordination
stages among Ministry areas that had traditionally worked in relative isolation. The Project
Coordinating Unit has complied with all of its fiduciary responsibilities in a satisfactory manner,
and played an important role in providing relevant information to assess the attainment of outputs
established for the ICR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(of wide general application)

71. Leadership, integration, and commitment are critical for success. The leadership of MOPW's
top management (Minister, DGOP, and Undersecretary), was fundamental for overcoming the
uncertainty generated by the loss of the minister who conceived the original reform program. This
was also possible because MOPW's top management empowered the project components and
backed a more integrated approach to the reform. This favored the integration of the project
components that was critical for combining their corresponding outputs (such as, digital
interfaces, project management processes, output-based standards etc.). However, the alignment
of the components was possible mainly due to the commitment to the reform demonstrated by the
highly qualified team leading the project components, which was able to motivate the entire
group working on the reform and win the trust of MOPW senior managers.

72. Consultation with stakeholders and an effective communication strategy enhance the
ownership of the reform. The reform objectives were defined by the MOPW in close and
extensive consultations with stakeholders internal and external to the MOPW. The World Bank
has supported this participative approach and has encouraged the continuous monitoring and
evaluation of the reform's analytical underpinnings. At the implementation stage, the MOPW


                                                23

leadership has strengthened the initiatives aimed at guaranteeing the continuous support of
stakeholders. To this end, the change management component turned out to be critical to expand
support for the reform. MOPW leadership also decided to increase training, capacity building,
and technical support activities to facilitate the implementation of the reform. In addition, the
project components--supported by the MOPW Human Resources Department--have established
ad hoc committees, which serve as platforms for consulting with the MOPW unions. The Bank
team highlighted during supervision missions the need to involve non-managerial personnel
within the MOPW in Santiago and in the Regions to increase understanding of the objectives
pursued by the reform and to increase overall support.

73. The design of the resuts framework of single-tranche development policy operations should
pay special attention to the short term of the operation. This Project's M&E framework reflects
the linkages between the two loans and strikes a balance in terms of the outputs and outcomes
that result from each of them. Clearly defined short-term outputs were selected as natural
evolution of DPL prior actions, and were valuable in terms of measuring project advancement.
The set of medium term outcomes helped to narrow down and provided useful milestones for
each policy area objectives even though these are to occur outside the timeframe of the single-
tranche operation. The Program Document, in accordance with Bank guidance, indicated that the
outcomes, beyond the timeframe of the program would be monitored within the framework of the
TAL accompanying the DPL. Nonetheless, while the Policy Matrix provided key actions of the
medium-term program, as well as monitoring and evaluation indicators, the Policy Matrix did not
include end-of-program outcomes. This made the medium term outcome non monitorable at the
time of completion given the short timeframe comprised between the effectiveness of the loan
and the operation's completion. The short duration of the operation, which is a general
characteristic of all single-tranche DPL, suggests that the results framework should carefully link
the PDOs and the outcomes to be measured.


(operation-specific)

74. Bringing more stability through time to the project coordination unit is essential. More
stability of the PIU coordinator office will enhance the synergies between the project components
and leverage the policy dialogue with the Bank. This dialogue has been fruitful on climate change
issues and can further be extended to other issues such as PPPs, renewable energy concessions,
and energy efficiency. The stability of the PIU office will also improve the effectiveness of the
change management component that is anchored in the PIU. It will as well enhance the
procurement pipeline flow.




7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

75. The Borrower has provided comments to a draft version of the ICR that were discussed at
length during the supervision mission of the TAL conducted in April, 2009. Many of these
comments were incorporated to the text. The Borrower submitted to the Bank its own completion
report (included in Annex 3) on May 20, 2009.

Annex 2. Letter of Development Policy12

                                                                          Santiago de Chile, April 30th, 2007

Ms. Pamela Cox
Vice President
Latin America and the Caribbean Region
The World Bank
Washington, DC

Dear Ms. Cox:

Since the start of its mandate in March of 2006, the Administration of President Michelle
Bachelet has committed itself to achieving the goal of "Growth with Equality of Opportunity."
This goal has inspired an ambitious Government Program that reflects a consensus on the need to
move beyond the first generation of reforms and to confront the remaining challenges to
achieving higher levels of growth. In promoting economic growth, the explicit emphasis will be
placed on raising levels of income and improving the quality of life so as to converge with the
standards of the OECD. The Government Program thus proposes a new phase of development,
incorporating new approaches to supporting innovation and competitiveness and achieving
greater equality of opportunity for all of Chile's citizens.

The Institutional Strengthening Program of the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) is a central
feature of the overall Government Program, particularly as it pertains to the support of economic
growth, competitiveness and the "New Citizenry Treaty." That Treaty calls for reform of public
institutions through improvements in the quality of public services as well as greater transparency
and citizen participation. The following paragraphs provide a brief background to the MOPW's
Institutional Strengthening Program as well as its objectives and main components.

Public infrastructure is a keystone of the Chilean economy and MOPW is responsible for
planning, constructing, maintaining and operating this infrastructure in support of economic
growth and social development. Currently, the annual budget of MOPW approaches US$1.5
billion, making it an important financier of the country's construction industry. Moreover, it has
been under the control of the MOPW that, since the beginning of the 1990s, the successful system
of concessions was developed. This system has been essential in the alleviation of Chile's
infrastructure deficit. Investments under concessions administered by MOPW have valued, in
recent years, around US$1.0 billion annually, making the Ministry Chile's principal administrator
of these forms of public-private partnerships.

In order to continue to raise the levels of growth and to achieve higher standards of living for all
Chileans, it is necessary to remove barriers to competition and implement measures to strengthen
innovation, make Chile more competitive and offer greater opportunities for all of its citizens. In
this sense, MOPW has acquired a new relevance and its role needs to be redefined.




12The letter presented in this Annex is the English translation of the official Development Letter signed by
Ministers Velasco and Bitran. A copy of the Spanish version is available in Project files.




                                                       26

Despite the tremendous successes of the last 15 years, there is wide consensus about the need to
improve efficiency in public spending in infrastructure by perfecting the design of the concession
system; attaining a higher level of accountability--for both public works and concessions; and
establishing explicit quality of service standards for users. In order to provide MOPW with the
tools for achieving this new function, the current Administration has proposed to undertake a
major institutional reform program for which it has solicited the support of the World Bank in
specific core areas.

The objectives and actions of the Institutional Strengthening Program are the result of more than
a year of work at MOPW and from consultations with relevant external stakeholders. The effort
has been coordinated by a multidisciplinary team composed of MOPW staff with specific
responsibilities for each technical area of reform. That team has worked to identify the main
shortcomings of the Ministry and has developed proposals for their improvement which are
described below.

The World Bank has supported the work of these teams with technical and regulatory advice
since the early stages of the initiative's inception. At the same time, the Ministry has engaged in
public discussions with key actors in the areas of MOPW's activities such as the Chamber of
Construction, the Association of Concessionaires of Public Works, Regional Governments and
several civil society organizations. These discussions have allowed for a more objective analysis
and a broader vision of the goals to be achieved.

Through the work described above, it has been found that the primary challenges confronted by
MOPW in its core business functions are as follows:

Planning

     Lack of medium and long-term planning with an integrated geographic perspective
        oriented to the competitiveness of Chile's productive sectors.

     Low level of interaction with other relevant stakeholders in infrastructure sector and a
        lack of societal or consumer voice in project planning.

     Investment programs which are contract-driven rather than integrated along a supply
        chain, leading to coordination difficulties and inefficient expenditures.

     Absence of risk analysis and ex-post evaluation in the process of planning.

Service Standards, Contracts and Competition

     Absence of explicit representation of the interests of citizens and users in contract design
        (as much in public works as in concessions) and in the regulation of services.

     Uneven levels of competition during bidding processes for either concessions or public
        works, reducing the effectiveness of those processes.

Project Management

     Low levels of accountability related to project outcomes due to a fragmented approach to
        project management with different individuals responsible for each stage of project
        development.

     Poor availability of information about project costs, contract management or design and
        construction of projects.



                                                  27

Regulation

     Insufficient institutional capacity to provide effective oversight of contracts and
        concessions according to agreed upon levels of service, let alone cost elements.

     Need for strengthening the capacity to capture the concerns of users and assure public
        access to information in the area of regulation.

As a result of this diagnostic, the structure of the Institutional Strengthening Program arose,
whose objectives are the more effective and efficient use of public resources and greater
transparency, competition and citizen participation in the contracting of public works.

The Program includes three types of activities:       First are those oriented at improving the
"business processes" of MOPW (that is, Planning; Contracting; Management of Projects; and
Oversight or "Fiscalización" of Infrastructure Services). Second are those activities whose
objective is to improve the "governance processes" of the Ministry (such as Management of
Norms and Regulations; Institutional Development; Strategic Planning; Control Management;
and Corporate Communications). The third area of activities is intended to improve "support
processes" of MOPW (such as Information Services; Human Resources and General and
Financial Services). A complete list of the 11 projects that comprise the Program and the
objectives of each one is presented in Annex 1 of this letter.

The following diagram illustrates the three types of processes and Programs areas of activity:

It is important to note that we have requested the support of the World Bank primarily in those
components of the Program where we feel the Bank can provide most value added given its
international experience in the area of infrastructure. This would be in Territorial Planning; the
Design of Standards and Public-Private Contracts; Integrated Project Management; Regulation of
Infrastructure Services--including the design and establishment of regulatory structures that
protect both users and investors; and Organizational Development including the Management and
Modernization of Sector Norms.

The following paragraphs summarize the principal reforms for each area in which we are
requesting Bank support.

In this respect, the design of a new Planning Process for infrastructure investments and the
permanent concern for its correct application is of central strategic relevance for MOPW. It will
determine the likelihood of providing infrastructure that responds to real demand levels and the
urgent needs of the development process of Chile. The exact characteristics of the planning
process that are expected to come out of the Institutional Strengthening Program are: that it
represents an integrated vision for all types of infrastructure, by region and by form of
management, according to a long-term perspective and participatory manner with all sectors of
the national workforce. It should allow for development, improvement in competitiveness, better
accessibility and guaranteed equality in levels of access for goods and services. Fundamental to
the achievement of this objective is the implementation of a solid planning methodology under
the responsibility of a single Directorate of Planning.               The fragmented planning approach,
dependent on various operational directorates within MOP, has not proven to be the most
adequate approach.

Another fundamental aspect within Planning is environmental assessment. In order to achieve
standards in our public works projects which are appropriate to countries of the OECD and which
contribute to sustainable development, we consider the integration of environmental aspects into



                                                     29

our planning process to be essential. This should be done through instruments such as Strategic
Environmental Assessments.

MOPW has already made concrete advances in this new approach to the planning function. The
first has been the initiation of the Infrastructure Plan for Competitiveness in September 2006.
Under this initiative, during 2006, the Government began an intensive planning process for the
country, region by region, based on integrated territorial management giving a strong push to
regional projects and opening new arenas for participation by the private sector and by local
communities.

As a result of this process regional and inter-regional investment plans have been produced which
seek to provide a pipeline of projects that is coherent, incorporating economic, regional and
human concerns. To date, preliminary versions of the following Plans have been prepared under
this methodology:

      Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Mining Sector
      Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Agricultural Sector
      Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Forestry Sector
      Competitiveness Plan 2007-2012, Tourism Sector

The second advance in Integrated Planning involves 27 Programming Agreements that are being
signed with Regional Governments and other Ministries, according to the Framework for Quality
of Life in Cities Plans. These Agreements are instruments that allow for the execution of specific
public works investment programs in cities in which there are shared financing responsibilities
and within a fixed timeframe, as much for Regional Governments as for MOPW itself. The
agreements are publicly available and approved by Decree by the Ministry of Finance.

In establishing Service Standards, MOPW intends to provide a response to a social need:
increasingly, both users of public works and Chile's citizenry in general, are demanding an
adequate quality of service which makes it necessary to rely on an institution which facilitates
that level of service and, as a consequence, assures its availability. The incorporation of explicit
service standards en the works administered by MOPW implies a cross-cutting change en the way
in which projects are conceived, planned, constructed and maintained. In this sense, it represents
a fundamental change in the way MOPW undertakes its daily management.

In the past, MOPW was directly responsible for the construction of public works. With time and
the growth of an efficient private industry to provide construction services, MOPW has changed
into an organization which principally manages works construction contracts undertaken by third
parties. However, the skills required for this task have not been completely developed, a fact
which is reflected in the continued use of unit prices in the majority of contracts. This, together
with insufficient investment in engineering studies, has resulted in deficient contracts that are
sometimes poorly designed, contributing to projects that are executed with cost and time overruns.
The modernization of MOPW requires a transformation into an organization that is expert in the
management of contracts, above all in long-term contracts, minimizing the losses that are
produced through inefficiency in design and management. In order to achieve this objective,
MOPW will have to develop expertise in new types of contracts and improve the capacity of
those managing contracts that are already under execution, as well as concessions.

In the area of Project Management, the primary objective of the reform is the modernization of
the process of design and construction of works, under an approach to project management that



                                                 30

integrates the lifecycle of the projects. Integrated management means that a profession--Project
Chief or Manager--is responsible for putting into service a work, based on a defined timeframe
and budget. Since project responsibility will be concentrated and so it will be necessary to assure
that Project Managers possess the necessary skills, information, teams and tools to undertake their
new commitments. This implies multi-dimensional reform. First is the area of Human Resource
policy which will require the Ministry to define the Project Manager and to establish appropriate
incentives for this new role, based on expected results. At the same time, it will be necessary to
establish teams that can work with the Project Manager. Second, it will be crucial to establish
information systems that provide the Project Manager with sufficiently detailed data on the
design and execution of work, not only to improve project management but also to create a
reliable database that can be used to improve planning and oversight.

The first steps in this direction have already been taken through a Ministerial Resolution that
authorizes 17 quotas for critical functions. This will allow for the provision of additional
incentives to be assigned to MOPW staff named as Project Managers.

With respect to Regulation, the Program has as a central element the creation of the
Superintendency of Public Works, whose structure, functions and objectives can be found in a
Draft Law which is under review by the Executive Branch in advance of its submission to
Congress. The new entity will constitute a mechanism structured along the new operating logic
of MOPW. It will develop the oversight systems and the incentives necessary for the various
directorates of MOPW to focus on the quality of service promised to the people of Chile--
through both traditional public works contracts and concessions. The coordination between those
activities related to the establishment of the new Superintendency and the improvement in the
management of contracts is fundamental to the success of the reform. The Superintendency
would have a key role in the area of concessions, overseeing the compliance with quality of
service standards.

The establishment of a Unit of Oversight ("Fiscalización"), within the structure of MOPW, in
June 2006, represents the first step in the creation of the Superintendency of Public Works. This
Unit has its own budget and a staff of 40 that report to the Unit's Director. Its functions include
the preparatory tasks for the establishment of the Superintendency as well as other tasks that
would be appropriate to the Superintendency once it has been established. These include the
oversight of commitments according to quality of service variables defined for the public works,
as well as the oversight of environmental and community agreements.

An essential pillar of the Program, that covers the entire Ministry and crosses the components
already described, is the Organizational Reform of MOPW. This includes the definition of an
improved institutional structure and the establishment of the corresponding regulatory framework.
The objective of this component is to separate the areas of planning, contracting, execution and
regulation from the provision of infrastructure in order to establish a institutional system based on
an assignment of transparent and rational roles according to the principle of checks and balances.

Progress has already been made in the preparation of a draft law package for the achievement of
the proposed objectives. The draft laws under review by the Executive Power include the Draft
Law of the Superintendent of Public Works and amendments to the Concessions Law. This
component also includes drafting of amendments to the Stormwater Law, the Rural Drinking
Water Law, and the Reservoir Regulation Law, which are all in similar phases. Perhaps the
biggest challenge of the component is the MOPW integrated reform project, which will propose a
new general structure and proceedings for all of the activities carried out by the Ministry,
furthering separating of the already described roles.


                                                 31

The complete implementation of the proposed changes in the first four components will result in
new working relations, changes in the functions and structures of the units, a matrix
administration design for project management and the definition of new professional profiles, all
of which would be reflected in the organizational structure. This implies the need to develop a set
of norms that help to implement the resolutions that are approved.

These changes will not be possible without the participation of the staff of the Ministry of Public
Works as well as the Ministry's outside stakeholders. For this reason, an extensive process of
Change Management has been included in the Program. The changes will be possible only if the
MOPW stakeholders see opportunities and share the benefits of the reform. For this reason, the
diagnostic carried out on the challenges faced by the MOPW has been extensively disseminated,
both internally and externally.

The goals that we have proposed for the Reform Program are:
      Reduce logistics costs for the productive sectors of Chile, as a percentage of the GDP
      Increase the efficiency of the investment in public infrastructure
      Reduce the execution time of works
      Increase competition among firms competing for design and construction of works
      Support the reduction and improved management of the contingent liabilities associated
         with the investments in public works
      Quantify the asset value in inter-urban road infrastructure and maximize the value with a
         policies of investment in conservation
      Obtain a high level of public confidence in the work of MOPW, measured by public
         surveys
      Obtain a high level of business sector confidence in the work of MOPW
      Obtain a high level of internal confidence in the work of MOPW, in climate measured by
         internal surveys of MOPW
      Attract professionals and technicians that join MOPW from the best firms in their
         profession

Given the depth of the MOPW Institutional Strengthening Program, we have solicited the support
of the World Bank, not only for technical reasons, but also for the institutional aspects. We
consider the presence of the World Bank as fundamental for the continuity of this process of
structural change the implementation of which will take several years, even beyond that of the
present Administration. For this reason we would like to ask the World Bank to fulfill a
supervisory role through missions and regular consultations related to the core areas of the reform.

The specific request of a Development Policy Loan is for two reasons: First, to involve the
Government through the Ministry of Finance to carry out the objectives of the MOPW
Institutional Strengthening Program; and second, to give strong support to the likelihood of
technical success of the Program.

It is worth noting that the Program described in the present Development Policy Letter, counts on
the specific support of the President of the Republic, who described the Program on March 13 of
the current year, in the official announcement of the Package of Measurements to promote the
economic growth of the country. Therefore, the Government is committed to the Program which
has been presented in this Letter and views favorably the support and collaboration of the World
Bank. The Government appreciates the consideration by the Board of a Development Policy
Loan for the amount of US$ 30 million.

Annex 3. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR13


                                                                                            Santiago, May 20, 2009

Mr. Tomas Serebrisky
Project Manager

Re: Chile- Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works
Dear Mr. Serebrisky:
In accordance with the procedure for closing the IBD Loan 7459, referred to as the Institutional
Strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works DPL, I am pleased to deliver to the World Bank,
through you, the following completion report.

1.- Background.

As a key factor in the Government's efforts to reform the public sector and support the
competitiveness of the productive sectors the Presidency, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of Public Works introduced in 2006 a key process for strengthening the Ministry of
Public Works [Ministerio de Obras Públicas MOP]. This process has the explicit support of
President Michelle Bachelet, who made reference to it on March 13, 2007 in the context of the
official announcement of a series of measures to promote the economic growth of the country.

The Program for the Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works is a
comprehensive reform that seeks to strengthen the strategic areas of the Ministry. This reform, in
which the participation and leadership of civil servants are key factors, will allow us in the near
future to plan projects in a comprehensive manner, perform contracts that comply with service
standards, make project management more efficient, and improve our capacity to regulate, and
have oversight of, public works that will improve the quality of life of all Chileans..

Given the depth and scope of the Program, the support of the World Bank was requested not only
for technical aspects but also for institutional reasons. The presence of the World Bank is
fundamental to give continuity to the process of structural change, the implementation of which
will take several yearseven beyond the current administration. Besides, the Bank plays a high
level supervisory role, through missions and regular consultation, to support all the program
initiatives.

There was a manifestation of this in the signing of two loans, one for 11.7 million dollars for
Technical Assistance (TAL) with a span of five years, and the other a single disbursement of 30
million dollars for Policy Development [Desarrollo de Políticas DPL]. There were two reasons
for the specific request for a Policy Loan (DPL): first, it commits the Government, through the
Ministry of Finance, to achieving the objectives of the MOP reform program; and second, it gives
greater support and viability to the Program.




13The letter presented in this Annex is the English translation of the official Borrower's ICR report signed by Sonia
Tschorne Berestesky, Director, General Directorate of Public Works. A copy of the Spanish version is available in
Project files.




                                                          34

2.- Key Factors affecting Implementation

2.1.- We agree with the Bank's analysis that, while the change of Minister in January 2008 did
not mean a change in the objectives and scope of the Program, the tempo of implementation and
emphasis was affected. It is acknowledged that leadership changes work against the pace of
implementation of this type of programs, especially when the goals are ambitious and when the
execution time of the task is short.

2.2.- Revision of, and alterations in some of the specific technical plans already defined also were
a key factor that affected the implementation of the Program because revisions led to delays not
taken into account in the original planning and this meant that some activities had to be restarted,
given the new emphasis. For example, there was a new approach to drafting the amendment to the
MOP's Framework Law (Ley Orgánica) to provide for greater participation of the Ministry's
personnel, which definitively is a positive change, modified the Program's original schedule of
achievements, thus affecting the assessment of the short-term outcomes expected at termination
of the Development Policy Loan (DPL).

2.3.- The change of Government also involved the transfer of operating and administrative
responsibility for the Program from the Accounting and Financing Directorate to the General
Public Works Directorate [Dirección General de Obras Públicas DGOP]. This change helped the
coordination operations of the MOP Directorates, given the hierarchical authority exerted over
them by the DGOP but, nevertheless, meant there had to be some relearning of the administrative
aspects. It is our assessment that, given the progress of the Program, it should have been decided
from the very beginning that the DGOP would be responsible for its coordination.

2.4.- When designing a communication plan that addresses doubts and fears on the subject of
labor stability caused by the process of change an accurate reading of the Government's readiness
for change as well as the readiness for change of civil servants, represented by their trade unions,
is a very relevant factor. Also relevant is a correct time-scaling of the Program to allow for the
critical involvement of the entire organization.


3.- Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.- While acknowledging and agreeing for the most part with the Bank's assessment on
corroborating the performance of the indicators, it is noteworthy, from a methodological
perspective, that the indicators used do not fully reflect many aspects of the process which are
impossible to measure exclusively from a numerical standpoint. Although aspects of a qualitative
nature are indicated in the report through the commentaries, a final merely quantitative
assessment does not account for the complexities of a reform process such as the one being
undertaken by the MOP. One example of this is the Organizational Reform component which, by
measuring its outcomes simply by whether or not a draft amendment to the MOP Framework
Law has been delivered, does not account for the lessons learned about the need to achieve
greater participation and involvement of the organization in the discussion of the new law.


4.- Risk Assessment to Generate the Outcomes

4.1.- We agree with the Bank that the original identification of risks associated with the Program
was correct, as well as its assessment.

4.2.- We also agree with the identification of two new risks indicated by the Bank, to the extent
that they were recognized both by the executives of the Bank and MOP civil servants.




                                                 35

4.3.- Moreover we can add another risk to those already identified, which relates to the difficulty
of objectively assessing the real progress of the Program, given that, as the executing agency, we
are subjects and objects of the change process. It is recognized that daily involvement in the
processes may limit analysis and proper assessment of the changes and the way in which this
filters through the organizationgenerating complacency, when in reality there is not much
progress or, on the contrary, discouragement when in reality much progress has been made.


5.- Lessons Learned

5.1.- We concur with the lessons learned as indicated by the Bank. In addition, the following
points appear relevant:

5.2.- Identify and maintain an ongoing relationship with the agents involved directly or indirectly
with the Program, in its different spheres of development. It is of vital importance to clarify the
roles that each agent or organization performs in the different stages of the process, and involve
them on a timely basis in the joint task of program implementation.

Recent experience has shown that proper identification of the relevant agents for a change process
becomes very important when communicating with, and rallying, hearts and minds in order to
reduce to the fullest extent possible the number of disputes, whether caused by misunderstandings
or distrust, which can cast doubt on any genuine interest in making significant improvements in
the Ministry's way of doing things. Certainly, this does not mean that we aspire to complete
consensus on matters to be tackled, but to engender moments of understanding and shared
dialogue, which should always be maintained for the duration of the reform process, and not just
through its design phase.

5.3.- Highlight the importance of having the organization and agents properly informed, and in a
timely manner. It is important, therefore, to design a communications plan that will assume
control of the various areas to which the fundamental aspects of the Program will be
communicated. First and foremost, to the heart of the organization; highlighting the objectives,
applicability, and impact of the changes, as well as the estimated timeline for the desired
occurrence of intermediate milestones and goals.

Information activities must be organized based on a good reading of the existing reality, and the
history of the organization, especially in those long-lived organizations with no significant
changes in structure, where there is no culture of change. In short, it is not enough to apply theory
when developing "communication plans," since a matter as fundamental as a relationship of trust,
which is built upon true and timely information and communications, may be considered as
already established.

5.4.- Develop a tiered participation strategy, with gradual empowerment of permanent employees
of the organization.

Along the same lines, the gradual but bold incorporation of public sector workers and
organizations of civil servants and workers into participation forums with the aim of sharing and
familiarizing them with "shared design," as well as the importance of this participation, is
recognized as necessary. There are decision meetings that are inseparable from the Government,
but having the support of Ministry employees allows one to gain legitimacy, despite possible
differences, as well as benefit from the involvement of the permanent employees of the
organization.

5.5.- In any future engagement in, or development of, this type of program involving cultural
transformation it is necessary to revise the formulation of the indicators accounting for the




                                                 36

process and its interim achievements. In some aspects, the process by which a goal is attained is
as important as, or even more important than, the outcome itself.


6.- Comments to the Bank

6.1.- It is recognized that that Bank has made valuable contribution to the general design
framework and monitoring of the initiative.

From the start of the initiative, the Bank's technical managers have played an important
monitoring role for this Program by participating actively, in its formulation stage, in formulating
the general design of the Program, helping to shape it in the document that finally became the
agreement between the Government of Chile and the World Bank for the institutional
strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works. In this Loan Agreement, the objectives and scope
thereof are mentioned as well as the main aspects on which work will be done. The
methodological and technical assistance has been of great help in the progress made up to now.
Similarly, the Bank's support in giving continuity to the Program, beyond changes of authorities
or the center of operations of this Program, has been outstanding.

From a managerial point of view, the financial assistance and monitoring to ensure proper use of
available funds are also valued.

6.2.- Help in the formulation of laws.

At the suggestion of Bank representatives, the participation in, and review of different
international experiences assisted in an understanding of conceptual aspects that focused on the
public policies aimed at being accountable to the community and having regulatory agencies that
separate the role of project execution and supervision was of great help in formulating proposals
for improving the Concessions Law and creating the Superintendency of Public Works. Both
pieces of legislation are currently in different stages of approval in the Parliament. These laws are
important steps from the perspective of creating a better business environment, developing public
infrastructure, as well as establishing the institutional structure that will assist in improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of investment.

6.3.- Despite the above, it is important to expand the Bank's technical assistance since it is
agreed that the experiment now being conducted is novel even for the Bank and, consequently, an
external viewpoint that improves the synchronization of the Program's components in terms of
their work rhythms and varying progress, is of value. In this sense, having an external observer
perform follow-up activities and close monitoring and become involved in the value contributed
to the entire Program by the expected outputs of each of the initiatives will lessen the risk
highlighted in point 4.3 of this letter.
