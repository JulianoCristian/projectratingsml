Institutional Strengthening of the\n            Ministry of Public Works Development Policy Loan in Chile\n            aims to support the Government's reform of the Ministry\n            of Public Works by strengthening its planning functions;\n            developing performance standards for contracts and\n            concessions; improving project management; strengthening\n            regulatory oversight of public works and private contracts;\n            and embedding the organizational changes in appropriate\n            legal and normative structure. This, in turn, is meant to\n            contribute to the Government's objectives of greater\n            efficiency in the use of public resources; and increased\n            transparency, competition and citizen participation in the\n            contracting and concessioning of public works. The specific\n            development objectives of each of the strengthening measures\n            are: integrated planning - to achieve a rational use of\n            resources and highest potential value for money in\n            investment; standards, contracts, and competitiveness - to\n            develop service standards, model contracts and bidding\n            procedures that promote competition and assign risks\n            rationally; integrated project management - to design and\n            implement an Integrated Project Management procedure and to\n            carry out the transition between the existing and\n            traditional project management procedures to the new one."}, "docdt": "2007-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
