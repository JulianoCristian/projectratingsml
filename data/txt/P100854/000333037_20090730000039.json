"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Institutional\n            Strengthening of the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW)\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Chile were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the reform objectives were defined by the\n            MOPW in close and extensive consultations with stakeholders\n            internal and external to the MOPW. The World Bank has\n            supported this participative approach and has encouraged the\n            continuous monitoring and evaluation of the reform's\n            analytical underpinnings. At the implementation stage, the\n            MOPW leadership has strengthened the initiatives aimed at\n            guaranteeing the continuous support of stakeholders. To this\n            end, the change management component turned out to be\n            critical to expand support for the reform. MOPW leadership\n            also decided to increase training, capacity building, and\n            technical support activities to facilitate the\n            implementation of the reform. In addition, the project\n            components, supported by the MOPW human resources\n            department, have established ad-hoc committees, which serve\n            as platforms for consulting with the MOPW unions. The Bank\n            team highlighted during supervision missions the need to\n            involve non-managerial personnel within the MOPW in Santiago\n            and in the regions to increase understanding of the\n            objectives pursued by the reform and to increase overall\n            support. More stability of the Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) coordinator office will enhance the synergies between\n            the project components and leverage the policy dialogue with\n            the Bank. This dialogue has been fruitful on climate change\n            issues and can further be extended to other issues such as\n            Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), renewable energy\n            concessions, and energy efficiency. The stability of the PIU\n            office will also improve the effectiveness of the change\n            management component that is anchored in the PIU. It will as\n            well enhance the procurement pipeline flow."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
