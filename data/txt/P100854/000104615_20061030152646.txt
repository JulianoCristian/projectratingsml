Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Filling the Infrastructure Investment Gap
:
In the early 1990’s, the Government of Chile took stock of its infrastructure needs and estimated its infrastructure 
deficit at US$11 billion with additional losses due to lack of competitiveness of US$1.7 billion annually.
1
In 
determining how to respond to this need for massive investments and significant improvements in service 
delivery, the Government also recognized that the public sector did not have the resources to carry out the major 
works required, nor could it commit its budgetary resources exclusively to infrastructure investments given the 
country’s social investment needs.  
 
To face this challenge, the Government first called on the private sector to take part in the building, maintenance 
and operation of major road works.  Thus, the Chilean Concessions System was born, allowing the private sector 
to finance economically profitable projects and recover their investment primarily through direct charges to users.  
In the years since its inception, the concession program has expanded both in terms of sectors and design.  
Sectorally, Chile now has what may be the world’s most extensive concession program encompassing roads, 
ports, railroads, bridges, tunnels, reservoirs and canals.  In addition, the current list of projects to be concessioned 
includes hospitals, jails and even public plazas and sports stadiums.  Structurally, Chile’s concession designs now 
includes bidding under least cost variables, least net present values and lowest cost subsidy requirements. 
 
As the diagram below illustrates, Chile’s overall investment portfolio has risen from about 450 million pesos in 
1995 to over 1 billion pesos in 2005 in real terms.  More strikingly, the share of private sector participation in 
those yearly investment levels has risen from 9 percent to 65 percent over the course of the last decade.

The net result of these efforts--in tandem with electricity sector unbundling, telecommunications liberalization 
and municipal water and sanitation privatizations--has been a level of investment in infrastructure far beyond that 
of any other country in Latin America.  At between 5 and 7 percent of GDP per year, Chile’s infrastructure 
investment levels are similar to the expenditure levels of East Asia’s higher performing economies such as China 
and Thailand.  Partially as a result of the infrastructure investment commitment, Chile’s growth levels over the 
last 15 years have also paralleled those of East Asia.   
 
Given that most of that expenditure has come from the private sector, the overall assessment of Chile’s 
concession program is generally positive.  There is widespread agreement that a substantial part of the 
infrastructure deficit would not have been reduced over the past decade, concomitantly with the strengthening of 
public finances, without these public-private partnerships.   
 
Improving a Strong Performer
:
Even though public-private partnerships (PPPs) generally, and concessions in particular, have contributed to 
closing Chile’s infrastructure deficit, many economic analysts as well as the current Government believe that 
Chile’s leveraging of the private sector can be further improved as can the use of public resources for works 
projects.  Concerns about bias and inefficiency in concession design and oversight have recently risen to the 
surface despite the outside world’s positive assessment of Chile’s concession program.  In particular, the growing 
frequency and size of concession renegotiations through “complementary agreements” is attracting increasing 
coverage in the Chilean news media.  These renegotiations are typically triggered by Government but result in 
unregulated or under-regulated works contracts, unknown profits captured by concessionaires and additional 
contingent liabilities for the Government generated by traffic or revenue guarantees. 
 
From the new administration’s perspective, the focus of intervention should be in the areas of transparency and 
accountability in the concession process, more balanced risk-sharing arrangements and greater regulatory 
oversight of the private sector in terms of both quality of service and financial returns.
2
On public works, the 
administration’s primary concerns revolve around the lack of planning, ineffectual project management and the 
subsequent inefficient use of public resources.  
 
2
See, for example: “Strengthening Regulation in Chile: The Case of Network Industries,” Alexander Galetovic and Luz de 
Mello, OECD, October 27, 2005  
Page  3
These interventions naturally fall to the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) as it is the primary agency responsible 
for planning, developing and constructing public infrastructure in support of the economic and social development 
of the country.  At the same time, the MOP is in charge of the maintenance, operation and administration of these 
public works as well as the regulation of all concessions. 
 
Specific Shortcomings at the Ministry of Public Works: 
 
The MOP has identified specific constraints to its operating procedures and institutional structure that it believes 
will need to be addressed in order for Chile to reach a new level of efficiency and accountability in infrastructure 
investment and operations.  According to the senior staff of the Ministry, those challenges include:  
·
Confusion in the roles and mechanisms of decision in the planning, management, oversight and regulation 
of roads, ports, airports and water resources. 
·
Lack of long-term planning with an integrated geographic perspective oriented to the competitiveness of 
Chi
le’s productive sectors. 
·
Low level of interaction with other relevant stakeholders in infrastructure sector.    
·
Works that are contract-driven rather than integrated along a supply chain, leading to coordination 
problems and inefficient expenditures. 
·
Lack of explicit commitments to service levels for either concessions or public works. 
·
Absence of ex-post evaluation and of integrated risk management. 
·
Insufficient management and financial information systems to support any of the needed reforms in 
planning, management or regulation. 
·
Lack of societal or consumer voice in the design of contracts or regulation of services. 
·
Incomplete projects and contracts that provoke claims and increase costs.   
 
Role of the World Bank: 
In order to address these shortcomings, improve the use of public resources, increase efficiency of private sector 
participation, and strengthen regulation, the MOP has initiated an institutional strengthening program.  The 
Government of Chile wishes this initiative to be supported by a Technical Assistant Loan (TAL) and 
Development Policy Loan (DPL) with the World Bank.  As described in Sections 2 and 3, the linked loans focus 
on strategic interventions that are common to the Bank’s infrastructure and private sector lending and technical 
assistance throughout the developing world.  Integrated planning, rational project management, appropriate 
public-private contract design, and regulatory structures that protect both consumers and investors are areas of 
core competence for the Bank. 
 
By supporting the implementation of the plan, the TAL and DPL are in line with the goals and strategic approach 
set out in the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that focuses on sustaining economic growth and social 
progress, fostering inclusion, and modernizing the state through capacity building.  The current CAS aims to 
support programs and activities which deepen and sustain Chile’s efforts at poverty reduction with a mix of 
technical and financial support.  The proposed program epitomizes such a mixture.  This project will be developed 
in parallel with the new CAS so as to maintain consistency of priorities and approach in the context of the new 
program for Bank support to Chile 
 
Although it does not require the financial resources of the World Bank per se, the Government of Chile has 
requested the Bank’s involvement in this initiative in order to leverage the Bank’s experience in the design of 
public-private contracts, regulatory frameworks, transport and logistics planning and institutional reform, 
including information systems and communications strategies.  In addition, the Bank offers a comparative 
advantage in its ability to draw upon global knowledge, sustain a policy dialogue, and exploit synergies with other 
operations and past experiences including, but not limited to the Rural Territorial Development Project and Trans-
Santiago Urban Transport Project.

The estimated project cost will be about US$5.5 million for the TAL and US$30 million for the related DPL, all 
of which would be funded by IBRD.  A Project Preparation Facility of US$1.0 million has been requested by the 
Ministers of Finance and Public Works.

2. Proposed objective(s) 
 
The purpose of the Technical Assistance Loan and the related Development Policy Loan is to support the process 
of institutional strengthening taking place at the MOP.  The objectives will include improving planning, 
implementation, management and regulation of concessioned infrastructure projects as well as road maintenance 
and public works contracts.  
 
The long-term expected project outcomes will be:  
·
More efficient use of public resources in the area of infrastructure investment; 
·
Higher level of efficiency returned to consumers and society at large in infrastructure services that are 
concessioned; 
·
Strengthening of regulation and of oversight arrangements to increase transparency and citizen 
participation; and 
·
More regionally equitable commitment of resources for development as a result of the inclusion of 
regional perspective in project planning. 
 
During the course of supervision of the project, the task team will work with MOP to establish a methodology for 
the long-term measurement of improvements in the above outcomes.  That impact analysis will be responsibility 
of the MOP and will form a basis of the new levels of accountability being sought by the current administration. 
 
3. Preliminary 
description 
 
After extensive discussions among the Bank team, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Works, it 
has been agreed that the Bank’s assistance should come through a dual program of a Technical Assistance Loan 
and a Development Policy Loan.  While the TAL will provide funding and Bank supervisory for the necessary 
consultancy, capacity building and training, the major expected outputs of that technical assistance will define the 
DPL.  In order for the triggers of the DPL to provide real incentives for the delivery of the TAL, the Ministry of 
Finance is now in discussions with the MOP to identify linkages between the two loans.  The two Ministries are 
preparing intra-ministerial agreements about the linkages and are exploring the possibility of Hacienda 
withholding MOP budget in line with the value of the expected DPL.  Resources would in this way be transferred 
to MOP upon successful completion of the TAL tasks identified as DPL triggers. 
 
Development Policy Loan (DPL) 
 
The DPL under discussion with the Government of Chile would derive its triggers from the Task Objectives listed 
above under:  Planning, Contract Design, Regulation, Project Management and, interconnectedly, Institutional 
Strengthening.  The primary expected outcomes from each of the pillars of reform will translate into the triggers 
of a proposed 
Development Policy Loan
 (DPL).  Realization of the triggers would result in the release of the 
resources assigned to each tranche which would, in turn, affect the resources made available from Hacienda to the 
Ministry of Public Works. 
 
Triggers that are in discussion with the Ministries of Finance and Public Works are presented below in 
chronological order of when they are likely to be achieved.  Phase 1 achievements are likely to occur over the 
next one to 2 years.  Phase 2 achievements will require 2 to 4 years.

4. Environment Aspects 
DPL funds will not support the design or implementation of infrastructure investments. However, 
and given the types of infrastructure under MOP’s mandate, project preparation activities will 
include the analysis of potential environmental and social effects of the proposed reforms as well as 
the mechanisms in place to handle them or the measures to strengthen institutional capacities to deal 
with them.
