Rapid\n            urbanization in Rwanda, had resulted in unplanned and\n            squalid settlements, urban sprawl, and increased urban\n            poverty. The Rwanda Urban Infrastructure and City Management\n            Project was designed to improve the provision of priority\n            infrastructure and services in the urban areas. The\n            construction of 22.6 kilometers of asphalt and stone paved\n            roads, reduced the transport costs for the urban population\n            by 60 percent. The construction of three primary schools,\n            health care center and youth center improved the social\n            infrastructure benefitting the people in urban areas. The\n            bus terminals built under the project, facilitated\n            inter-district movement within the city and improved\n            linkages with the neighboring areas resulting in improved\n            economic infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2010-09-22T08:11:04Z"}
