It is thus foreseen that land acquisition,\n            and resettlement will occur due to infrastructure\n            development, therefore, this resettlement plan sets the\n            standards for compensation due to resettlement issues, i.e.,\n            land, income, and assets losses. Land replacement for land\n            losses, shall take into consideration equal size and\n            productive value, to improve or at least restore living\n            conditions, while construction materials shall be provided\n            for housing, and any structure losses; additionally,\n            equipment losses shall also be replaced. Project affected\n            persons (PAPs) will have the choice of cash compensations\n            for assets lost, estimated in the local currency, at market\n            values, provided replacement costs are not acceptable to\n            PAPs. Employment opportunities and training assistance will\n            be provided to ensure income restoration.
