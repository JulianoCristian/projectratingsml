outcome with unlikely\n            sustainability, and a moderate institutional development\n            impact.  While the Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory, the Bank's performance was\n            unsatisfactory. The overall project design was considered\n            weak as the project contained too many diffuse objectives.\n            The Bank should have restructured and simplified the project\n            design during its Mid Term Review.  In the area of community\n            involvement and participation it was found that communities\n            can be a catalyst for change and growth.  It is necessary to\n            match project design to institutional capacity as a more\n            focused project would have eased implementation and the\n            achievement of development objectives.  Central programs vs.\n            local initiatives to enhance educational quality, showed\n            three needs: a) to strengthen the role of education\n            authorities in tending to the specific needs of schools and\n            addressing local educational challenges; b) distance\n            learning or localized implementation of in-service teacher\n            education; c) suitable and reliable distribution networks\n            for textbooks and educational materials.  Behavioral change\n            is a long-term process requiring sustained capacity building\n            to accomplish lasting change in schooling practices.\n            Greater integration with ministries could have reduced the\n            work overload as well as fostered ownership and capacity\n            building opportunities.  The relevance of sectoral\n            monitoring was shown as, in its absence, critical issues\n            were not immediately apparent, and, a greater focus on\n            sector-wide monitoring and evaluation during the life of the\n            project would have enabled greater prioritization and proactivity."}, "docdt": "2003-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
