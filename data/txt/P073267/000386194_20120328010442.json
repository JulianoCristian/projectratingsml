       Associated Livelihood Project for Organization of Eastern\n            Caribbean States (OECS) were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to global environment outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a five-year\n            project lifespan may not be adequate for regional\n            biodiversity projects. Regional projects should have a\n            realistic implementation time frame that takes into account\n            the inherent challenges of coordination/ logistics across\n            countries/jurisdictions. In biodiversity/ conservation\n            projects, adequate time is needed to ensure there is a clear\n            understanding among all stakeholders of the functions of\n            protected areas, how livelihoods and surrounding communities\n            can benefit, and implications for Protected Area (PA)\n            management and reporting. Using a coordinating implementing\n            agency helps in the harmonization of policies on\n            biodiversity conservation and protected area management.\n            Equally, there is need for mandate and budget resources for\n            national staff to internalize the regional priorities. The\n            OECS Secretariat played a critical role in the overall\n            management of this regional biodiversity project providing\n            key functions relating to harmonization, coordination,\n            technical assistance (such as procurement and financial\n            management), training, awareness raising/communication, and\n            monitoring and evaluation. Biodiversity conservation and\n            protected areas management requires intersectoral\n            cooperation. Institutionalization of activities contributes\n            to sustainability of biodiversity conservation programs and\n            benefits to surrounding communities. Flexibility is\n            important in a dynamic context. Flexibility in project\n            design can make implementation more robust by allowing\n            projects to take advantage of opportunities as they arise\n            and to modify the structure and nature of project elements\n            if needed. Technical skills mix is crucial for the quality\n            of project design and implementation. The technical inputs\n            throughout a project's life are often the critical\n            elements to ensuring the intended outcomes. Address capacity\n            issues early in project life. Regional projects inherently\n            have logistical complexities, especially in countries with\n            low technical and administrative capacities. Investments in\n            training and capacity building should be made early to\n            strengthen counterpart implementation capacity relating to\n            technical and fiduciary specialties."}, "docdt": "2012-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
