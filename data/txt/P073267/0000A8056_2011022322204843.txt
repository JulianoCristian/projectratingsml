                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Development/Global Objective. To contribute to the conservation of biodiversity of global importance in the participating countries of the Organization of
                         Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) by removing barriers to the effective management of protected areas (PAs), and increasing the involvement of civil society
                         and the private sector in the planning, management and sustainable use of these areas. This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening national and regional
                         capacities in the sound management of PAs; (ii) establishing or strengthening a number of demonstration PAs; (iii) providing economic sustainable
                         opportunities for environmentally compatible livelihoods in buffer zones of project-supported PAs; and (iv) involving communities, civil society and private
                         sector in the participatory management of the PAs. (The six OECS participating countries are: Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St.
                         Lucia and St. Vincent & the Grenadines.)

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The OECS secretariat continues to make good progress towards the implementation of the OPAAL project since the previous supervision mission in November 2009. Infrastructure
                         works are being carried out. Some pending issues relating to approvals for infrastructure works were resolved. Good progress is also being made on sustainable livelihoods
                         component, with sub-projects now launched in all participating member states. Extensive training and capacity building has been carried out, and preliminary feedback from
                         participants has been very positive. There has been very good progress in awareness building activities, with radio and TV public service announcements, video documentary on
                         protected areas, etc.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite initial delays, the project activities have now accelerated over the last year. Contracts have now been signed for almost all remaining works, and all works are expected to be
                         completed before the closing date of July 31, 2011. Project performance ratings have been revised based on progress achieved since the last supervision mission.
