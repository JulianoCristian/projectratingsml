F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
To contribute to the conservation of biodiversity of global importance in the participating
countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) by removing barriers
to the effective management of protected areas (PAs), and increasing the involvement of
civil society and the private sector in the planning, management and sustainable use of
these areas. This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening national and regional capacities in
the sound management of PAs; (ii) establishing or strengthening a number of
demonstration PAs; (iii) providing economic sustainable opportunities for
environmentally compatible livelihoods in buffer zones of project-supported PAs; and
(iv) involving communities, civil society and private sector in the participatory
management of the PAs. (The six OECS participating countries are: Antigua & Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent & the Grenadines.)

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. At appraisal, there was growing evidence of degradation of the Caribbean‘s biodiversity-
rich ecosystems, particularly associated with poorly-planned coastal development, population
growth, tourism, pollution, over-exploitation of living resources, accelerated sedimentation
associated with changes in upstream land use, rapid expansion of coastal developments, and the
introduction of exotic species. As a result, important biological systems, particularly beaches,
coral reefs, wetlands, tropical forests and seagrass beds, were under intense pressure, threatening
the region‘s biological diversity.

1.1.2. Recognizing the importance of the sustainable management of its natural resources and
rich biodiversity, the Governments of the OECS Participating Member States (PMS) had made
significant commitments to protecting their countries‘ resources as signatories to international
conventions and through policy statements, legal and institutional instruments, recent
environmental programs, and financial support of conservation activities through budget
allocations. At the international level, the PMS were some of the first countries to ratify the
Conventions on Biological Diversity (CBD). In the wider Caribbean, five of the six countries had
ratified the Cartagena Convention, an environmental treaty that serves as a vehicle for the
implementation of global initiatives and legal instruments, such as the CBD. Finally, at the sub-
regional level, the OECS Member States in 2000 issued and subsequently endorsed the St.
George‘s Declaration, which includes a commitment to the conservation of biological diversity
and the protection of areas of outstanding scientific, cultural, spiritual, ecological, scenic and
aesthetic significance.

1.1.3. The PMS had also begun the difficult task of translating these international and regional
commitments into real efforts at the national level. In addition to completing national
environmental management plans and comprehensive national environmental profiles, five of the
six PMS had also completed national biodiversity strategy action plans. The shared objectives of
these strategies included inter alia: (i) conservation of the country‘s diversity of ecosystems,
species and genetic resources; (ii) establishment of protected areas; (iii) promotion of sustainable
uses of these resources in support of human development with an emphasis on tourism; (iv)
encouragement of the equitable distribution of the benefits derived from the use of biodiversity;
(v) need to establish baseline data; (vi) improvement of institutional and management capacity;
and (vii) facilitation of the participation of people and institutions in the management of
biodiversity. The participating countries had also recognized the importance of establishing
protected areas as the primary method of preserving biodiversity and conserving valuable natural
resources assets. In the region, there were 98 gazetted protected areas (PAs) and an additional 9
PAs that were in the process of being created. Three of the PMS (Dominica, Grenada and St.
Lucia) had already prepared national protected areas system plans.

1.1.4. Despite these significant efforts, there remained significant impediments to the full
realization of a framework for managing protected areas that could protect the region‘s
biodiversity from further degradation. These impediments included: (i) inadequate legislation
and weak implementation and enforcement of existing laws; (ii) policy gaps, institutional
overlaps and lack of coordination in natural resources management; (iii) limited human, financial


                                                 1
and material resources; (iv) limited sustainable economic opportunities; and (v) limited public
support for conservation efforts.

1.1.5. The OECS PMS had inherited or enacted many laws related to biodiversity conservation
and the protection of natural areas. Many of these laws and the areas protected under them had
been in existence for a considerable time, and were obsolete at the time of appraisal, failing to
reflect contemporary approaches to environmental management. Even at the national level, much
less the regional level, these measures were not systematically related and did not provide a
comprehensive framework for biodiversity conservation and protected areas. Perhaps more
importantly, many of these laws had never been implemented by the promulgation of rules and
regulations, which was one of the main reasons that they were not effectively enforced. Given
these deficiencies, the relevant agencies did not have the institutional capacity to enforce the
existing laws effectively. This problem was compounded by the fact that the legal framework
allocated the responsibility for the management of protected areas between multiple agencies
with their own separate mandates. The laws however did not guarantee effective collaboration.

1.1.6. In addition, there were several problems that were common to a number of OECS
countries. Foremost among these was uncertainty about the extent and boundaries of protected
areas, stemming from the vague manner in which these were defined in the governing laws.
Another common problem was that the protection afforded to areas designated under older laws
in the region was limited; for example reserves for forests often do not preclude the extraction of
timber or fuel wood, or sanctuaries created under wildlife laws protect the game species but not
the habitat. Further problems had emerged where new legislation had been enacted without the
amendment or rationalization of the existing laws, leading to redundancy and jurisdictional
conflict. The legislation adopted around the time of appraisal for the creation of National Parks
and other types of protected areas had also demonstrated deficiencies that emerged in their
implementation. Despite these shortcomings, there were a number of enactments that contained
innovative provisions that were worthy of wider adoption and which could form the basis of a
regional model to facilitate the consolidation of protected areas legislation for the PMS.

1.1.7. Participating Member States‘ (PMS‘) institutional arrangements were weakened by gaps in
existing policies (e.g., the failure to incorporate environmental and social costs into economic
decision-making) and overlaps and/or unclear institutional responsibilities for the conservation
and management of biodiversity in many of the Member States (particularly with respect to the
management of coastal resources). Institutional overlaps stem largely from the lack of a
consolidated legal framework. The situation is further exacerbated by an absence of effective
mechanisms for information sharing, integrated planning and collaboration among agencies in
the implementation of programs and projects is a major constraint to PA management. As a
result of these gaps, tourism and coastal development, upstream construction leading to erosion
and sedimentation, and over-exploitation of resources continues without proper planning and
coordination that would take into account the need to protect biodiversity.

1.1.8. While there existed a large number of protected areas in the region, many of them were
not supported with the necessary financial and human resources to ensure the achievement of
basic biodiversity conservation objectives, less their long-term sustainability. There was a need
for a regional strategy and rationalization process to use scarce resources more efficiently to



                                                 2
conserve biodiversity of global importance. Like other small island developing states (SIDS), the
OECS countries had a limited pool of persons with relevant professional and technical training
and experience in biodiversity conservation and protected areas management. Funding, facilities
and equipment for the responsible agencies, when available, were often inadequate. This was
further compounded when various agencies under law had responsibility for managing protected
areas, scattering limited resources. Where PA-generated revenue existed (e.g. through royalties
and licensing fees), it typically went to the PMS‘ treasury department and could not be retained
by the responsible governmental agency.

1.1.9. Limited financial and human resources had also prevented the collection of adequate data
required for sound resource management and long-term sustainable planning efforts. The lack of
coordination between agencies responsible for protected areas management had led to a
piecemeal approach to data collection. Data, where they existed, were not accessible and
available to policy makers, community members, regional stakeholders and managers.

1.1.10. In the OECS countries a significant proportion of the community was engaged in natural
resource based activities, including agriculture and fisheries. In some areas, these traditional
activities as presently practiced were not environmentally sustainable and adversely impacted the
underlying natural systems. In many cases, the achievement of conservation objectives would
depend upon the identification of viable alternative sustainable livelihoods and/or support to
more environmentally sustainable practices.

1.1.11. In the OECS countries, mainstream socio-economic issues remained the primary national
priority. Despite an increase in general environmental awareness, particularly amongst the young
and some communities already involved in conservation efforts, direct support for conservation
was still largely confined to members of environmental NGOs.

1.2    Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1. The GEO was to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity of global importance in
the participating countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) by removing
barriers to the effective management of protected areas (PAs), and increasing the involvement of
civil society and the private sector in the planning, management and sustainable use of these
areas. The project intended to achieve this by: (i) strengthening national and regional capacities
in the sound management of PAs; (ii) establishing or strengthening a number of demonstration
PAs; (iii) providing economic sustainable opportunities for environmentally compatible
livelihoods in buffer zones of project-supported PAs; and (iv) involving communities, civil
society and private sector in the participatory management of the PAs. The six OECS
participating countries were: Antigua & Barbuda (ANB), Dominica (DOM), Grenada (GND), St.
Kitts & Nevis (SKN), St. Lucia (SLU) and St. Vincent & the Grenadines (SVG).

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1. The GEO has not been revised. In June 2005, the key project indicators in a Logframe
format were updated and migrated into the Results Framework and Monitoring Plan. There were
several changes made in the outcome and output indicators throughout the Project, with some
changes reflected in the Operations Manual, and others within ISRs. After the mid-term review,
original indicators from the PAD were reverted to, and some revised indicators used. Reasons
and justification for the many changes in the indicators were not clearly articulated in ISRs.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1   The Project‘s main beneficiaries include:
       globally significant species as well as the habitats in which they occur; and
       local populations who would benefit from these global benefits in the form of improved
        environmental integrity and natural amenity values (such as watershed protection), the
        protection of the resource base, and the development of sustainable tourism.

1.4.2 The target groups were those associated with protected areas, particularly where that
association implied a dependency on the resources for livelihood support. Most of these groups
resided near the protected areas and used the resources to support tourism, tourism-related
activities, local recreational activities, and fisheries.

1.4.3. Also, the participating country‘s public sectors were to benefit from increased capacity for
conservation management and co-management of natural resources. Local NGOs with field
experience in the management of protected areas, and the local citizens and international visitors
who visited the protected areas were also to benefit from the services supported by the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1. Protected Areas Policy, Legal, and Institutional Arrangements (Institutional
Framework) (Total US$1.02 million, GEF US$0.84 million).

1.5.1. This component‘s objective was to achieve policy, legislative and institutional
arrangement reforms (collectively termed PA institutional framework) in Participating Member
States (PMS) leading to the evolution of a harmonized approach to protected areas creation and
management in the OECS region. There were three sub-components: (i) policy, legal, and
institutional arrangements reform; (ii) updating/preparing new national protected areas system
plans; and (iii) supporting studies.

1.5.2. The component was aimed at supporting the following activities: (i) national reviews of
existing policy, legal and institutional frameworks in PMS; (ii) a comparative analysis of
national frameworks to include recommendations on a common approach to the development of
policy, legislation and institutional arrangements for PAs establishment and management in the
region; (iii) a regional symposium and endorsement of one or more common approaches; (iv)
development of harmonized policy, legislation and institutional arrangement models supporting
PA establishment and management for the region; (v) support for national actions leading to a
more harmonized institutional framework; (vi) an assessment of the critical constraints affecting
the conservation of biodiversity in the OECS region; (vii) evaluation of existing and potential
mechanisms for the sustainable financing of PAs; and (viii) other demand-driven studies in
support of component objectives to be defined in the first year of implementation.




                                                 5
Component 2. Protected Areas Management and Associated Alternative and New
Livelihoods (Total US$3.55 million, GEF US$1.21 million).

1.5.3. The component‘s objective was to promote biodiversity management and conservation
through the establishment of new and strengthening of existing protected areas, complemented
by support for alternative and/or new livelihoods in areas in proximity to the aforementioned
PAs. This component had three sub-components: (i) the creation of new and/or strengthening of
existing PAs; (ii) supporting alternative and/or new sustainable livelihood opportunities in and
around PAs; and (iii) Small Project Facility (SPF) capacity building and support.

1.5.4. This component was expected to support the following activities: (i) site inventories,
demarcation and mapping of the PAs, establishment of biodiversity baseline; (ii) the
development (or updating of existing) management plans and constituent sector plans; (iii)
investments such as basic park infrastructure and equipment; (iv) an M & E program; (v) training
and technical support that would be based on site-specific needs assessment; (vi) field studies
and workshops to identify potential economic opportunities; (vii) review, evaluation, and
selection of livelihood opportunities based upon their compatibility with conservation objectives,
feasibility and cost-benefit; (viii) development of participation criteria and alternative livelihood
subproject preparation; (ix) technical assistance and training for sustainable livelihood
beneficiaries; and (x) implementation of alternative sustainable livelihood sub-projects.

Component 3. Building Capacity for Biodiversity Conservation and PA Management and
Increasing Environmental Awareness (Total US$0.74 million, GEF US$0.43 million).

1.5.5. This component‘s objective was to enhance national capacities and increase public
support for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of PAs through education,
training and awareness. The component included two sub-components: (i) training in support of
establishment and management of PAs and sustainable alternative livelihoods; and (ii) increasing
public awareness on the ecological, social and economic significance of PAs.

1.5.6. This component was expected to support the following: (i) completion of a national and
regional training needs assessment; (ii) the design and implementation of regional and national
training program(s) in PA management and sustainable livelihoods; (iii) the design of national
public awareness strategies and country-specific action plans; (iv) the implementation of these
action plans; and (v) equipment purchased to support public awareness strategies.

Component 4. Project Management, M&E and Information Dissemination (Total US$2.26
million, GEF US$l.22m).

1.5.7. This component includes three sub-components: (i) project management, (ii) monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) of overall project implementation, and (iii) design and implementation of
an information dissemination strategy. This component was aimed at implementing the project in
a timely and efficient manner, providing for the: (i) employment of additional staff for the ESDU
(project coordinator, protected area‘s specialist, communications officer, and administrative
assistant); (ii) purchasing of equipment; (iii) updating of ESDU‘s existing M&E program to meet

GEF and WB requirements; (iv) implementation of the M&E system; and (v) dissemination of
project results.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1. The components have not been revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1. There have been three minor restructurings. In the first, an adjustment has been made to a
particular financing percentage for the remuneration of the Project Coordinator position
(effective August 26, 2008). In the second, the closing date was extended for 15 months till July
31, 2011. In the third, a reallocation of less than 10% of the grant proceeds was requested and
approved by the Bank. Other major aspects including the project objective, design, and
implementation arrangements have not been changed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   A. Lessons learned and applied to project design

2.1.1. Some lessons learned from previous OECS projects (e.g. OECS Ship-Generated Waste
Management Project: P006970) were incorporated into the design of OPAAL. These include the
following:

      Regional approaches can provide for greater aid effectiveness in small island
       developing states through economies of scale, increasing synergies where human and
       financial resources are limited, and effective coordination of dissemination and
       replication of lessons learned. The original project proposal developed by the St. Lucia
       National Trust (May 2002) focused only on St. Lucia. With the promise of greater aid
       effectiveness, the Project concept was reformulated to be a 6-country project, after
       considerable consultation with key stakeholders. Also, designating an existing regional
       entity with a clear mission aligned to the project objectives provides an opportunity for an
       effective policy coordination and cross-fertilization at regional level.

      To be effective, conservation needs must be combined with activities aimed at
       meeting socio-economic needs. The OPAAL Project design articulated this lesson so
       that all PAs would benefit economically from the associated livelihood activities that the
       project would finance. The Project also emphasized the use of participatory monitoring
       and evaluation techniques, and involved local communities in consultations.

      Stakeholders must be engaged in co-managing resources, especially where there is a
       need to ameliorate weaknesses in institutional capacity in public sector agencies.
       During Project preparation, local stakeholders in all PMS provided critical input into
       project design and expressed a strong desire to participate in project implementation. The


                                                7
       Project design also included the role of Site Coordinators to serve as liaison with the local
       communities surrounding the selected protected areas. Components relating to awareness
       raising and training were built in to specifically show local communities the benefits of
       participation in the Project.

      The need for mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that project activities are
       sustainable and fully integrated into national and regional on-going initiatives. The
       Project design sought to establish partnership arrangements with national and regional
       initiatives to maximize local and national benefits, and to fully incorporate PA
       management approaches into existing initiatives. As part of this, existing agencies
       (typically Departments of Forestry or Fisheries) were selected to serve as the national
       implementing agencies for each PMS.

   B. Design Issues

2.1.2. Project design was complex for the time-frame allocated for implementation. Given
the limited institutional and technical capacities in the Member States, the Project design appears
to have placed significant demands on partner agencies at the national and local levels.
Compounding this was the time required for stakeholder mobilization, setting up implementation
arrangements, and policy-level engagements in each PMS–which resulted in longer lead time
before actual implementation could begin.

2.1.3. Requiring the official endorsement of management plans impacted project
implementation. The Project design did not allow any physical works on-site or livelihoods
subproject investments until the PMS legislatures approved the respective PA management plans.
This design element was intended to ensure a seamless integration between infrastructure works
and the official management plans. However, the time-consuming process for the official
endorsement of these management plans in several countries led to delays in investments such as
infrastructure works and livelihoods subprojects–
                                                which, in turn, had impacts on project
credibility with, and ownership by, local communities.

2.1.4. Need for customization of interventions to country context. While the design of the
Project sought to apply a full range of interventions and instruments for effective protected areas
planning and management, it also applied the same template to countries with different needs,
arrangements and capacities. Greater attention to customization to the realities of each PMS in
terms of institutional arrangements (e.g. selection of National Implementation Coordinating
Entities [NICEs]), and existing capacities would have made for smoother implementation.

   C. Risk Assessment

2.1.5. The Project risk assessment clearly identified the country and sector risks. It correctly
rated as substantial the potential risk of delays in implementation from the multi-country
coordination efforts required in a regional project. Considerable effort was made to keep the
implementation on track by the OECS Secretariat and NICEs. However, the circumstances were
often more complex and varied than anticipated.




                                                 8
2.1.6. Also, the Project recognized the risk that PMS might not be committed to establishing the
necessary and appropriate institutional framework for biodiversity management. However, the
awareness raising mitigation measure was not sufficient to address this risk during Project
implementation. Additionally, despite a budget of $1.22m for Project Management, significant
capacity weaknesses affected the institutional arrangements in the PMS (at the national as well as
site level), and impacted the overall management of the Project.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1. The Project was restructured three times (level 2 restructuring). The first
restructuring (in August 2008) enabled an adjustment of the particular financing percentage for
the remuneration of the Project Coordinator position. The second restructuring (in December
2009) extended the project by 15 months. The third restructuring (in February 2011) was a
reallocation to correct inadvertent misclassification of expenditures. A mid-term review (in
April 2008) was very timely and reflected a key turning point in the Project. The review was
instrumental in taking stock of Project achievements, identifying issues contributing to
implementation delays, and making concrete recommendations to improve proactivity.

Key factors that affected implementation included:

2.2.2. Delays in official endorsement of PA management plans affected project
implementation. The MTR recognized that the official endorsement of management plans
(required prior to on-site investments in infrastructure and livelihoods) was becoming a barrier to
initial investments to establish physical presence, to increase protection of the areas and to garner
public support in the surrounding communities. Revisions in the Operations Manual (in 2009)
then allowed for infrastructure and other investments on evidence that the management plan had
entered the process of formal endorsement by the respective countries. Since the Project was
already significantly delayed, an extension of 15 months was required, which then allowed for
the completion of all activities.

2.2.3. Institutional issues at the national and local levels led to slower implementation
progress. While several NICEs worked effectively in ensuring timely progress on project
activities, there was limited integration of OPAAL activities into their agency work plans.
Similarly, some Site Implementing Entities (SIEs) were not always representative of
communities and often lacked local―              ‖;
                                       champions while others (like Tobago Cays Marine Park
(TCMP)) owed its success to the quality of local leadership. Recognizing the importance of
providing oversight to site-specific activities and liaising with local communities, the MTR
strongly recommended that site managers be appointed fulltime.

2.2.4. Changes in staffing in implementing entities as well as in the Bank impeded
continuity. There were some changes in the staffing at the implementing agency (e.g., the
Protected Areas Specialist position) as well as delays in the replacement of staff, resulting in the
stretching of ESDU core staff time. In the PMS, there were also changes at the site level (site
coordinator positions were often lying vacant) which impacted the ground-level implementation
of activities. Also, over the Project life, there were as many as four Bank TTLs (under 3 different
Sector Managers) which somewhat impacted proactivity and consistency in client dialog.



                                                 9
2.2.5. Limited availability of regional expertise. The limited availability of consultants with
suitable regional experience often led to delays (re-advertisements were sometimes needed) in
the contracting of studies for this Project. Furthermore, procurement procedures used in
advertizing and hiring consultants were reported to be time-consuming and having a relatively
high administrative burden.

2.2.6. Close supervision of infrastructure works led to successful completion. There were a
number of problems relating to the performance of contractors responsible for infrastructure
works (see section 2.4). With delays in the completion of these works, the implementing agency
made an astute decision (approved by the World Bank) to hire an engineering firm (replacing a
vacant Protected Areas Specialist position) to provide design inputs, and manage these works in
the participating Member States. The supervision oversight (including attention to quality and
efficiency of construction) provided by the engineering firm (Engineering Construction and
Management Consulting Ltd. (ECMC)) led to the timely and satisfactory completion of all
Project infrastructure works.

2.2.7. Innovative approaches helped to stretch training and communications budgets: With
a limited budget for training, the OECS-ESDU team was innovative in organizing opportunistic
training activities (beyond the regular training) as part of other OPAAL-sponsored events such as
subproject launches, stakeholder consultations or planning meetings. Similarly, the implementing
agency employed innovative ways of communication to raise awareness including the production
of documentaries, conducting media seminars, and memorabilia to promote the OPAAL ―brand     ‖.

2.2.8. Support from the external co-financiers was critical to implement project activities:
Funds provided by external co-financiers helped to finance critical elements within the overall
program of activities under the OPAAL Project, supplementing GEF resources. Fonds Français
pour 1’Environnement Mondial (FFEM) co-financed (US$1.64 million grant) several Project
activities with an emphasis on Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) provided technical assistance with an ecological
gap assessment, and rapid assessment and prioritization of PA management for Grenadines, St.
Lucia, and St. Kitts and Nevis; as well as completed the gap analysis for Antigua and Barbuda (a
total in-kind contribution of US$0.85 million). The OAS supported activities in St. Lucia
including the communication plan, and financial support for the St. Lucia National Trust
(US$0.17 million).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. Reporting, monitoring and evaluation for the OPAAL Project included World Bank
supervision; quarterly FMRs including financial reports and with procurement plans; annual
work plans and reports; a mid-term review (MTR) commissioned by the World Bank;
compliance with internal reporting within the OECS Secretariat; and the conduct of annual audits.
In addition, the main instruments used to track progress were (i) the Results Monitoring Analysis
Matrix, based on the project‘s logical framework; (ii) the Process Framework Monitoring and
Evaluation Tool; and (iii) the management effectiveness scorecard prepared for all six
demonstrations on three occasions (2006, 2008 and 2011).



                                               10
2.3.2. M&E design: The design of the M&E for this Project, as reflected in the results
framework, did not always establish clear links between objectives, outputs and indicators. There
were seven outcome indicators in the original Logical Framework in the PAD and 12 output
indicators; some of these indicators were insufficiently specific, lacked baselines and target
values and did not clearly identify data collection methods.

2.3.3. Recommendations made at the Project Launch Workshop on the indicators suggested
reducing to one outcome indicator viz. the measurement of PA management. Without any formal
project restructuring, this change in the outcome indicators was reflected in a revised Operations
Manual, and used in the first 3-4 project ISRs. However, after the MTR‘s recommendations,
subsequent ISRs and Aide-Memoires reported on the original set of indicators in the PAD (see
M&E implementation below). Accordingly, given the absence of any formal restructuring, the
original indicators have been reported on in this ICR.

2.3.4. Implementation and utilization: As discussed above, there were some changes made to
the outcome and output indicators throughout the life of the project (and not well articulated in
related ISRs). The MTR made several recommendations to clarify indicators. For example, the
livelihoods indicator was revised from the original target value of 13 subprojects (due to lack of
definition of what these subprojects constituted) to a target of 6 subprojects (comprising one
subproject per PMS; and each subproject then consisting of several livelihoods activities).
Recommendations made at the MTR to adjust indicators were included in subsequent tracking,
and the original set of PAD indicators was also reinstated.

2.3.5. More detailed information on the indicators available from aide-memoires was not
always brought into the ISRs. Additionally, budgets for measuring indicators were sometimes
inadequate. For example, a Knowledge Attitudes Practices (KAP) survey was required to be
undertaken to establish a baseline for awareness of protected areas; this was carried out only
several years into the project (in 2007) and there was no budget for a second survey to record
actual improvements that might have been attributable to the Project.

2.3.6. In parallel to the results framework, a PA management effectiveness Scorecard was
developed (adapted from a tool developed by the World Bank– WWF Alliance) and applied in
the 6 PMS across three years viz. 2006, 2008 and 20111, to record improvements. While the
scorecard ratings demonstrated improvements in management effectiveness at the PA sites, there
is less information about how this used to inform decision-making or resource allocation.

2.3.7. Given the delays in the livelihoods subprojects, it was not possible to assess the impacts
of this component by the time of the ICR. It would be beneficial to evaluate a sample of these
subprojects is recommended to be undertaken in a year‘s time, to help provide key lessons on
community-level impacts in terms of income generation, jobs creation and financial security.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

A. Safeguards

2.4.1. The Project complied with World Bank safeguard policies identified in the PAD, viz. (i)
Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), (ii) Physical Cultural Resources (OP 11.03), and (iii)
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). Although the Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) policy was not
triggered at the time of approval, the project applied the principles of this safeguard policy.

2.4.2. Environmental Assessment. The Project was rated as an Environmental Assessment
Category ―B‖ based on the anticipated benefits to the environment from improved PA
management, with only some of the investments were expected to have environmental impacts
that were small-scale and narrow in scope (e.g., site-specific impacts associated with small-scale
PA infrastructure; impacts associated with changing livelihood practices). An environmental
management plan (EMP) was developed to ensure that potential future adverse impacts would be
identified and addressed through the (i) inclusion of environmental mitigation measures in PA
Management and Operational Plans; (ii) environmental screening of alternative and new
sustainable livelihood activities; and (iii) list of activities/ sub-projects excluded from financing.
2.4.3. Physical Cultural Resources. This policy was triggered to take into account potential
―chance findings‖ of culturally important or historical or archeological sites, during project
activities. The Operations Manual required that management plans to be developed for all
protected areas under the Project would include regulations and procedures for the appropriate
protection and preservation of these cultural properties consistent with the World Bank‘s policy.

2.4.4. Involuntary Resettlement. During project implementation, there was no expectation of
involuntary physical displacement or resettlement of persons from the selected protected areas
being supported under the project. However, as some livelihood activities could potentially be
impacted, a Process Framework was developed that outlines the criteria and procedures to restore
or improve livelihoods of affected peoples. The project has applied and appears to have complied
with its Process Framework (OP 4.12) (contained in Annex 6 of the Operational Manual) for
potential nonphysical displacement. The participatory social assessments, livelihood and needs
assessments, and trainings carried out in all six OPAAL PA sites seem to have contributed to an
evaluation of the potential adverse impacts on the human population in and around the PAs. This
information in turn has fed into the draft management plans, and has been used for the design of
multiple alternative livelihood activities ("action plans") for each PA. However, limited reporting
on the Process Framework makes a proper evaluation of this safeguard somewhat difficult.

2.4.5. Natural Habitats. Under the Project, protected area sites clearly provide natural habitats
for several national/regional endemic species and nesting sites for non-endemic migratory
marine mammals, turtles and avian species. Therefore, OP4.04 should have been triggered.
However, the spirit of the policy was applied in the Project, with all six sites having conducted
detailed site preparation studies to identify potential environmental and socioeconomic adverse
impacts of Project interventions, and related mitigation measures; and baseline environmental
and socio-economic studies to determine the status of the resource base, the uses and the nature
of communities associated with the site.




                                                 12
B. Financial management

2.4.6. Through the Project life, quarterly Financial Management Reports were submitted in a
timely manner to the Bank with relevant information and the figures, and reconciled with Bank
records. Similarly, Audit Reports were also submitted in a timely manner and performed in
accordance with International Auditing Standards. A few issues relating to financial management
design and implementation (and how they were addressed) are highlighted below.

2.4.7. Short reconciliation period: Financial management arrangement included the opening of
separate bank accounts in each PMS, managed by the NICE, with the provision of a 30 day
period for reconciliation of accounts. This requirement was considered by the PMS to be
impractical for a regional project covering 6 islands with different capacities.

2.4.8.  Co-mingling of funds in Grenada: The Audit Report for the Period 2009/2010 for the
Project included a qualified with exception opinion on the internal control as the Bank Account
for the revolving fund handled by the Grenada NICE had been unilaterally closed by the
government to conform to a new law relating to the setting up of a Single Treasury Account.
Subsequent follow-up by the OECS-ESDU as well as a Bank supervision mission resulted in the
reinstatement of the Account, transfer of funds, and reconciliation of expenditures.

2.4.9.  Co-financing funding delays: On a few occasions, the implementing agency experienced
delays in processing payment from Fonds Français pour 1’Environnement Mondial (FFEM).
Issues ranged from excess documentation (with detailed invoices) to delays in direct payments.
With some delays, the vendors were ultimately paid with the corresponding donor‘s funds).

2.4.10. Approval for Overdraw of Category: During the Project grace period, the TTL authorized
(with approval from disbursement) an overdraw of category 5 (subprojects livelihoods), for
livelihoods activities financed in St. Kitts and Nevis. This required reallocation of funds to
category 5, granted on an exceptional basis, was justified as the activities financed through the
overdrawn amount were for sustainable livelihood activities consistent with the objectives of the
project, and the project was close to the end of the grace period for disbursements.

C. Procurement

2.4.11. Ex-post procurement reviews were conducted by the Bank‘s procurement specialist once
every year since 2006. Most reviews found that the Recipient followed the Bank procurement
guidelines; in some instances, these reviews made recommendations, which were followed by
the implementing agency in a timely manner. Apart from supervision and reporting, procurement
issues were often flagged during the implementation of the project, mostly due to the weak
capacity in the PMS (both at the national level, and also among potential suppliers/ contractors).
The main issues (and how they were addressed) are highlighted below.

2.4.12. National capacity to handle procurement processes: Many Project participants found the
Bank‘s and OECS‘s procurement procedures too demanding and complex. In the countries, most
project partners complained, for example, about the requirement for pro-forma invoices from
small local suppliers (mostly unfamiliar with such practices). Repeated procurement training and
provision of templates, as well as support from the implementing agency helped to build capacity.


                                               13
2.4.13. Sourcing of suitable consultants: Given capacity weaknesses, the procurement
procedures for advertising and hiring consultants often proved to be time-consuming and with a
relatively high administrative burden. Also, with procedures designed for larger works, local
suppliers would often exclude themselves citing the perceived complexity of the procurement
processes. The limited availability of suitable regional expertise contributed to delays in some
cases, but the hurdle was somewhat overcome by contracting from a broad range of sources.

2.4.14. Performance of contractors: The performance of contractors hired for the infrastructure
works was mixed, with problems relating to inadequate contracting arrangements (poor
specifications and drawings); price discrepancies between contractors and design engineers;
weak capacity to supervise contracted works; and inaccurate budget estimates. The implementing
agency‘s decision to recruit an engineering firm (ECMC) to oversee the infrastructure works in
the last year of the project, led to the successful completion of all infrastructure works.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. Follow-on project requested: The OPAAL project was conceived and initiated as the first
phase of a 15 year protected areas program for the OECS subregion. Its gains and achievements
will be more fully realized and sustained with continuing activities building over the
achievements of the past 6-7 years. At the final Project Steering Committee meeting in June
2011, the representatives from the PMS called for a follow-up (OPAAL-2) project–with the
critical areas of environmental mainstreaming, land management, policy influencing and
advocacy, partnerships, sustainable financing) as the focus of a next phase in the 15-year process.

2.5.2. OECS Sustainable Financing Project: The World Bank has just approved an $8.75
million GEF project which will contribute to enhancing the long-term sustainability of PA
networks in the OECS region by: (i) establishing sustainable financing mechanisms; (ii)
strengthening Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks; and (iii) deploying a regional monitoring
and information system for PA networks. The project concept was derived from the sustainable
finance study carried out as part of the OPAAL project, and recognizes the importance of
establishing sustainable financing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. This new project is
built upon and designed to complement the OPAAL project‘s achievement in policy, legal, and
institutional reforms for PA management, building capacities, and raising awareness at the
national level.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. Relevance of objectives. Project development and global objectives remain highly
relevant. The Project focused on contributing to the conservation of biodiversity of global
importance in the OECS participating countries by removing barriers to the effective and
participatory management of PAs for local, national, and global benefits. In terms of country
priorities, the project objectives remain strongly aligned with existing policies on biodiversity
conservation, the national environmental management strategies of individual countries, as well
as the 2006 ratification of St. Georges Declaration of Principles for Environmental Sustainability



                                                14
in the OECS which identifies principles and guidelines for the use, conservation and
management of the region‘s natural resources.

3.1.2. In terms of global priorities, the Project is well aligned with global commitments and
agreements. By improving the national framework, and helping remove some of the barriers to
effective management of protected areas, the OPAAL Project supports the goals and targets of
the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Programmes of Work on Protected Areas, and on
Island Biodiversity; as well as the International Convention on Wetlands (two sites in the Pointe
Sable Environmental Protection Area (PSEPA) in St. Lucia are included on the List of Wetlands
of International Importance). Additionally, part of the North East Marine Management Area in
Antigua and Barbuda is listed as a priority Key Biodiversity Area by the Ecosystem Profile of
the Caribbean Islands Biodiversity Hotspot done by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund.

3.1.3. In terms of the Bank’s assistance strategy, the Project‘s objective remains strategically
aligned with the Bank‘s 2010-2014 Regional Partnership Strategy for the OECS (Report No.:
53762-LAC) which includes a key objective building resilience–noting the importance of
strengthening of environmental management (particularly in critical ecosystems) and related
institutional strengthening and public awareness measures. The Project‘s investments in measures
that protect and improve the ecological health of the natural ecosystems (e.g. in OPAAL targeted
sites like Tobago Cays Marine Park in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) is an immediate, practical
and viable approach to adapting to climate change while enhancing resilience to its impacts.

3.1.4. Relevance of design. The relevance of project design was high in several respects. First,
with key potential economies of scale and shared ecosystem resources and challenges among the
island states of the OECS, the appropriateness of a regional design has been evident.2 Second, the
Project helped to identify policy, legislative and institutional arrangement reforms to create a
harmonized approach to protected areas creation and management in the OECS region. This
included the update and preparation of new national protected areas system plans as well as
supporting studies and the strengthening of the OECS Secretariat as a key actor in conservation
and sustainable development in the sub-region. Third, the project design was premised on the
approach of overcoming the barriers to effective protected area management by giving specific
attention to building institutional capacity and encouraging gainful community participation
through the financing of associated livelihoods activities. The relevance of design was lower
with respect to the sequencing of activities, the resource requirements, and the overall timeframe
anticipated for implementation. Also, the relevance of the selected demonstration projects to the
global, regional and national biodiversity conservation agendas was found to be uneven.

3.1.5. Relevance of project implementation. The relevance of project implementation was
very high in terms of the development of harmonized policy, legislation and institutional



2
  An IEG evaluation (in 2007) of Bank support for multi-country programs concluded that (a) the Bank should
continue and expand its regional efforts, and (b) high development impact could be achieved if greater support for
regional projects were coupled with the application of the lessons from past experience. More recent interventions in
the OECS by the Bank (e.g., Sustainable Financing of Marine Protected Areas Project; the Pilot Program for
Climate Resilience) and other donors (e.g., USAID climate change project) have also adopted the regional approach
to designing related interventions that address biodiversity conservation.


                                                         15
arrangement models supporting PA establishment and management; the training conducted in
support of establishment and management of PAs and sustainable alternative livelihoods; and the
innovative communications and awareness raising activities carried out under budget constraints.
The choice of the OECS Secretariat as the regional implementing agency continues to be
validated in subsequent World Bank (e.g. the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority
[ECERA] Project: P101414) and other donor (e.g. a USAID Climate Change project) projects.
The relevance of implementation was lower with respect to the delays in endorsement of
management plans, which led to postponement of other components such as the livelihood
subprojects. In addition, proactivity and responsiveness to implementation issues was slow.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

3.2.1. Project objectives were achieved to a large extent. Considerable progress has been
made in achieving the Global Environmental Objective of contributing to the conservation of
biodiversity of global importance in the participating countries of the OECS by removing
barriers to the effective management of protected areas (PAs), and increasing the involvement of
civil society and private sector in the planning, management and sustainable use of these areas.

3.2.2. The achievements of this Project are evidenced by the successful attainment of the
majority of the outcome indicators. Of the seven outcome indicators for the Project, five were
either exceeded or achieved satisfactorily (see Annex 2). This multi-country project helped to
strengthen national capacities in the management of PAs; established/ strengthened a number of
demonstration PAs; provided opportunities for environmentally compatible livelihoods in PA
buffer zones; and involved communities, civil society and private sector in the participatory
management of the PAs. More specifically, the project made significant contributions towards
achievement of the project objectives in the following areas:

   Development/ strengthening of systems plans for protected area management in all the six
    PMS, and harmonization of institutional frameworks and policies. The review of policy,
    legislative and institutional frameworks led to drafting of legislation and regulations
    governing protected areas and fisheries management in 3 countries (Antigua and Barbuda, St.
    Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). In Antigua and Barbuda and St. Vincent and the
    Grenadines, inter-sectoral institutional coordination and collaboration have been
    demonstrably enhanced through Project facilitated activities. National protected area system
    plans were also formally approved by the cabinets of Grenada and St. Vincent and the
    Grenadines (draft Systems Plans are pending approval in the remaining 3 PMS).

   Formal establishment of new protected areas, and improved management in pre-existing
    protected areas. Four new marine and terrestrial PAs were established and management
    strengthened in two of them. Through Project resources, a total of almost 25,000 hectares of
    marine and terrestrial areas were under conservation and protection in the six protected areas
    –far exceeding the original target of at least 6,500 hectares. Some of these PAs have local,
    national, regional and global significance in terms conservation and sustainable development
    goals (e.g. the PA site in Grenada is the largest forest area in the country, and contains
    several endemic species). In addition, 6 PA management plans for the targeted sites were
    prepared. The declaration and improved management of the six sites supported by OPAAL
    also contributed to the improved protection of habitat of the 11 regionally endemic species.

    management effectiveness in 5 sites (while
    the Grenada site recorded as stable).

   Increased awareness at local, national and regional levels of the importance of biodiversity,
    the need for protected areas, and the linkages between environmental management and
    livelihood opportunities. An innovative awareness and communication campaign included
    media seminars to encourage journalists to report on biodiversity conservation (an estimated
    25 stories were catalyzed in print, radio, and TV), and the development of a Tool Kit for the
    Media on Biodiversity Conservation. These activities effectively established an OPAAL
    ―brand‖. Additionally, there is evidence of increased visitation to PMS national park systems
    (as reported in Cabrits National Park and TCMP –which have controlled access to visitors).

   Enhanced capacity for biodiversity conservation through targeted training on PA
    management. Through the Project, about 14 training modules (exceeding the targeted 6
    modules) related to PA management were developed, and almost 700 people (almost double
    the target 450) were trained in systems planning, management and communications relating
    to PAs, as well as in ecological gap analyses, site M&E, financial management, sustainable
    financing etc.

   Increased participation of stakeholders in biodiversity conservation and PA management
    through the financing of livelihoods subprojects, and support to livelihood activities at the six
    targeted sites. The Project supported sustainable livelihood training (such as kayak handling,
    costing and pricing, arts and crafts, tour guiding, beekeeping, agro-processing, customer
    service, agro-tourism, entrepreneurship and marketing) for over 500 participants in the PMS
    and provided seed funding to about 200 beneficiaries for investments in various livelihood
    activities. With the livelihood subprojects financed very late in the project, it was premature
    to assess by Project closing their consequent impacts on incomes and livelihoods. Progress in
    engaging the private sector in PA management and biodiversity conservation was limited.

   Enhanced capacities within the OECS Secretariat and national agencies, especially in
    project management, procurement, and communications. OPAAL activities have directly

    contributed to, produced, or at least substantially strengthened, a community of professionals
    from the sub-region who are now equipped with a number of planning and management tools
    for protected areas, livelihoods development and protected area management. Through this
    Project, the OECS Secretariat was strengthened as a key actor in conservation and
    sustainable development in the sub-region, with a significant program on biodiversity and
    protected areas.

   Leveraging of additional funds for biodiversity conservation and protected areas
    management in the OECS: The OPAAL project included support from several external co-
    financiers (FFEM, TNC and the OAS) for several critical activities, and complementing the
    GEF resources. In addition, the Project also leveraged funds from UNEP/OECS, EU-SFA
    2003, and CIDA for the customization of the PA Systems Policy and Model Act at national
    level. Also, USAID in partnership with the OECS-ESDU, provided about US$ 2 million for
    the OECS Protecting the Eastern Caribbean Region’s Biodiversity (PERB) Project to protect
    the region‘s rich biodiversity, while creating sustainable livelihoods through interventions at
    other sites in Antigua, Barbuda, Grenada, Carriacou, Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1. As required for a full-sized GEF project, an incremental cost analysis was done during
the project preparation. No formal economic analysis was completed for project
implementation. However, the cost-effectiveness of park management under the project was
comparable with that the average regional mean protected area budget for the Caribbean (see
Annex 3 for details).

3.3.2. The livelihoods component involved providing grants for supporting livelihood activities
to beneficiaries from communities around the targeted protected areas– and potentially
represented increases in income levels among the grant recipients. However, due to the
significant delays in the launch of livelihood activities in the PMS, it was very premature to try
and measure by the end of the Project, the economic and financial impacts of these activities for
the beneficiaries at the targeted sites.

3.3.3. In addition to lack of a quantitative measure, the efficiency of Project implementation (in
practical terms) was affected by delays in the endorsement of management plans, limited
capacity to deal with the World Bank‘s and OECS Secretariat‘s procurement procedures, and
administrative complexities at national as well as site levels in the PMS. Other inefficiencies in
the system were attributable to region-specific issues such as the limited pool of available
consultants/ contractors.

3.4.1. The overall outcomes are rated as moderately satisfactory. The PDO/GEO remains
highly relevant, and has been achieved through the Project activities. The design was largely
relevant, building on potential regional synergies, and focused on overcoming barriers to PA
management and encouraging gainful participation by local communities. On the strengths, the
Project made significant contributions in terms of developing a systematic planning framework
and approach to PA management; creating greater awareness at all levels of the importance of
biodiversity and need for protected areas; improving the management effectiveness of the
protected areas (measured by the Scorecard); and promoting capacity building and awareness
raising for a wide range of actors. Innovative ways were developed to enhance communication
and provide training opportunities. The livelihoods component–which included training and the
provision of seed funds for livelihoods activities– expected to generate employment and income
                                                    is
for beneficiaries from local communities; however, the late launch of these activities makes it
difficult to evaluate these impacts at this stage. The shortcomings include the requirement of
endorsed management plans which delayed other activities, weak implementation support, and
the mixed success of the institutional arrangements at the national and site levels. The limited
institutionalization of Project activities may have potential impacts on sustainability.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. The project did not have an explicit poverty focus and therefore did not measure variables
allowing for the quantitative assessment of its poverty impact. However, it is important to note
that the issue of equity was given some weight by targeting local communities (through the SIEs)
and especially those earning lower incomes, for training for livelihoods activities (and potentially
availing of the grants). Measuring livelihood impacts would have been desirable given the
potential employment/ income benefits; however with the delays in the launch of the livelihoods
component, such an evaluation of impacts is premature. The implementing agency estimates by
the end of the Project, about 100 jobs have been created through the livelihoods activities–with
the majority of the beneficiaries being poor, women and the youth.

3.5.2. The gender dimension, which is highly relevant to natural resource based livelihoods,
was neither explicitly included in the Process Framework Monitoring Tool, nor in a detailed
document on social assessment, participation and process framework. However, a recent review
of the OPAAL-sponsored training activities shows a good balance of participation on the basis of
gender, and the livelihood sub-projects all included activities and business opportunities that are
particularly relevant to women, with a high proportion of women taking advantage of training
and seed funding in arts and craft and agro-processing.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3. The Project directly contributed to OECS-ESDU‘s enhanced national and regional profile
as well the capacity of ESDU to deliver large projects. This is validated by the fact that other



                                                19
donors are currently financing and implementing even larger projects through ESDU (e.g.
USAID Climate Change Project). The Project also enhanced the PMS-ESDU relationship and
increased awareness of ESDU‘s capabilities in the countries through the working relationship and
related interactions during the OPAAL Project. Additionally, with the promotion of a
participatory approach, the Project has contributed to changing rules of engagement and
mindsets in some of the departmental agencies among themselves and with public as it relates to
PAs management and biodiversity conservation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

                                              ‖
3.5.4. Through the Project, the OPAAL ―brand has been very effectively established and
promoted, including through the development of a logo, accompanying materials and
memorabilia. The final review of the project (Borrower Completion Report) reports that OPAAL
was seen as more than the project, as a programme that pursues long-term objective, and “as a
                                                         ‖.
brand that can and should be used to the region’s benefits

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1. There was no formal beneficiary surveys held during the Project– however there were
some informal surveys of beneficiaries carried out in the context of livelihoods training (see
Annex 5). No specific stakeholder workshops were convened in conjunction with preparation of
this Core ICR. However, during the course of the project, a few stakeholder workshops were
supported during the Project launch (at the regional level as well as at the national level), to share
experiences and lessons learned relating to the OPAAL Project, and during the preparation of
several studies (see Annex 6). Overall, the project benefited a wide range of stakeholders from
national and local government staff, to NGOs and local communities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.    Economic downturn may affect livelihoods in the OECS countries since most of them are
heavily dependent on tourism which in turn relies on sound economic conditions in source
countries in North America and Europe. This is a systemic risk that is beyond the control of a
project. Overall, the Project‘s objectives remain highly relevant. However, there is still a
moderate level of risk and this section examines the potential factors that might hinder the
Project‘s PDO outcomes from being maintained.

4.2.    Sustainability of institutional arrangements within the PMS: The NICEs for this Project
were selected from existing agencies with the mandate for managing protected areas; however,
the limited integration of OPAAL activities into the work plans of some NICEs has implications
for the longer-term sustainability of activities and processes in the PMS that were initiated and
strengthened through this Project. Furthermore, it is unclear how many of the site-level
coordinator positions will continue to be financed, which may affect the day-to-day management
of the protected area sites, and the corresponding liaising with local communities.




                                                 20
4.3.     Future mission, role of the OECS Secretariat: The OECS Secretariat played a critical role
(e.g., advocacy, cross-fertilization, and policy coordination are functions that are frequently
mentioned by OECS partners) in OPAAL activities relating to strengthening biodiversity
conservation, removing the barriers to effective protected area management, and encouraging
community participation. Central to any debate regarding sustainability is the question of the
future mission, role and program of the OECS Secretariat in this field of biodiversity and
protected areas.

4.4.    Sustainability of livelihoods activities: The Project provided sustainable livelihood
training and provided grants for materials related to livelihoods activities, but insufficient
attention seems to have been paid to organizational issues and marketing, which are keys to the
success of micro-business enterprises. The livelihood-related seed funding itself was undertaken
very late in the project, and is too recent to assess sustainability. But there are reasons for
concern, since the success of these efforts will inevitably require continued support, and it is not
clear which agency (at the regional or national levels) will be in the position to provide such
support beyond OPAAL.

4.5.    Availability of sustainable financing: Few PAs in the world are self-financing, and park
funding generally relies on a mix of sources. Budgetary support by the PMS to PA management
is insufficient and usually relies heavily on external sources. Recognizing the lack of adequate
finance for PA management and development, the lack of predictable future income streams or
appropriate mechanisms for creating future, sustainable revenue streams, a study on Sustainable
Financing of Protected Areas in the OECS was commissioned. Part of the financing gaps
identified will be addressed in the newly approved World Bank/GEF OECS: Sustainable
Financing & Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project (P103470).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1. The project was designed according to lessons learned from previous operations and best
practice at the time, but the Bank effort to ensure quality at entry was mixed and had significant
shortcomings. Strengths included undertaking several stakeholder consultations on proposed
project design; promoting the harmonization of the legal and policy frameworks relating to
biodiversity conservation /PA management in the PMS; and emphasizing the importance of
developing sustainable livelihood activities around the protected areas.

5.1.2. Significant shortcomings related to the poor design of indicators within the M&E
framework, complex institutional arrangements and failure to properly assess (and address) the
low capacity at the national/ local levels. Risks related to project design were partially identified,
and proposed mitigation measures were inadequate in some cases. A major design issue relating
to the sequencing of project components was not recognized, and resulted in significant
implementation delays.



                                                  21
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.3. Responsiveness to implementation problems was slow, especially in the first 4 years of
the project (i.e. two-thirds of the project life). Early supervision missions identified problems
such as weak national capacities, implementing agency staff often stretched thin due to vacancies,
that there was no communication strategy etc.; but there were delays in responding to the
problems (responsiveness picked up after the MTR). The Bank mostly proposed measures (such
as procurement training) to address problems. Importantly, recognizing the delays in Project
implementation, the MTR recommended replacing a condition for site-level activities from
official endorsement of management plans to evidence of submission for endorsement to the
respective national authority. This led to the acceleration in site-level activities, as most PMS
had completed or almost completed the management plan around the time of the MTR

5.1.4. Supervision inputs were inadequate: Biodiversity/protected areas expertise within the
Bank team should have been strengthened. Team continuity and regularity of mission was
somewhat affected by the change in staffing (including 4 TTLs over the project life). There were
several comments in ISRs from the Sector Management Unit relating to the implementation
delays; and from the CMU after the MTR. Concerns from management about disbursement lags
could have been identified. The supervision budget was quite good and permitted regular
missions with site visits.

5.1.5. Lack of candor and realism in supervision reporting: The ISRs were overly optimistic in
their reporting of implementation progress. The IP was briefly rated as marginally unsatisfactory
and then upgraded. The DO upgraded from MS to S after MTR on basis that DO "remains
relevant." The ISRs included a reasonably good description of issues and progress, although
there was little use of action items, although detailed in the Aide Memoires.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.6. The Bank effort applied to this project has been somewhat inconsistent, specifically
during supervision. Considerable effort was dedicated to the initial preparation process, which
yielded a participatory regional protected areas project with emphasis on encouraging sustainable
livelihoods. The Project objectives and design were highly relevant in the OECS region in terms
of addressing biodiversity conservation and protected area management. However, at supervision,
slow responsiveness to addressing implementation delays, inadequate inputs in terms of technical
expertise, and inadequate candor in reporting led to the delays in several activities. The MTR
was very constructive in identifying issues, and providing recommendations for improving
implementation progress; and the 15 month Project extension was instrumental in helping to
complete all project activities. However, with the consequent Project delays leading to the late
completion of the livelihoods activities (a key indicator for the Project success), impacts from
these could not be measured by Project end. For these reasons, the Bank‘s overall performance is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1. At the project preparation and design stage, the PMS expressed their strong commitment
and interest in the overall objectives and activities within the OPAAL project. This was also
demonstrated in the considerable in-kind counterpart contributions towards the Project as
reflected in staff time dedicated to project-related actions. At the national level, the effectiveness
of project implementation was partly determined by the capacities of and relationships between
the various agencies involved. Existing agencies (usually departments of Forestry or Fisheries)
selected to serve as the NICEs usually had the mandate for managing protected areas–and were
often able to effectively monitor the site implementing entities (SIEs). In some cases, the quality
of local leadership was critical to the overall success of the Project activities at the PA sites. For
example, the success of the TCMP owed much to the leadership provided by the then-Chairman
of the TCMP Board. Furthermore, in several NICEs, the assigned National Project Coordinators
(NPCs) were very committed in coordinating OPAAL activities, despite being overstretched.

5.2.2. Capacity weaknesses and institutional issues sometimes impacted the government
performance. In some cases, rivalries between different government departments in some PMS
affected the quality and efficiency of activities. Furthermore, the integration of OPAAL activities
into the work plans of NICEs was often limited   –thus weakening their ability to drive project
                                                                          –
activities. Site-level coordinator positions were sometimes lying vacant restricting their role in
day-to-day implementation and community liaising. The Project Steering Committee (PSC) met
only once a year–thus somewhat limiting their guidance and input to Project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3. The implementing agency for this project was the OECS-ESDU. Overall, they played a
critical role acting as the key agent steering the Project in terms of achieving deliverables,
overseeing implementation and coordination of project activities in all PMS, handling
procurement and financial management procedures, and leading the campaigns for
communications and awareness raising. The Project also benefitted from the detailed and timely
reporting on project activities by the implementing agency. Due to weak capacities within the
NICEs and SIEs, the implementing agency also provided considerable technical assistance
(especially on procurement and financial management issues) to these entities. Key and timely
decisions by OECS-ESDU (such as the hiring of an engineering firm to supervise works),
especially in the final years of the Project helped bring about the successful completion of
Project activities. However, the performance of OECS-ESDU was somewhat limited by the
competing demands on core staff who had other substantive duties, often leading them to be
overextended. In addition, the unit was also affected by some turnover of project-related staff
including two changes in the Project Coordinator, and the departure of the Protected Areas
Specialist–which placed additional burden on the core staff while replacements were sought.




                                                  23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.4. The overall borrower performance was rated as moderately satisfactory. The commitment
of the participating Member States was evidenced in the higher than anticipated counterpart
contributions. However, the institutional arrangements for project implementation at the national
and local levels were sometimes not appropriate to the realities in each PMS. In terms of the
implementing agency, overall management of project activities was satisfactory, with adherence
to procedures; close supervision of national/ local level activities; considerable technical
assistance to national/ local entities; and timely reporting. However, project coordination with
NICEs and SIEs did not always function optimally, partly due to the staff changes and
overstretched work programs of core OECS-ESDU staff, as well as limited capacity to respond
at the NICE and SIE level.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1    A five-year project lifespan may not be adequate for regional biodiversity projects.
Regional projects should have a realistic implementation time frame that takes into account the
inherent challenges of coordination/ logistics across countries/jurisdictions. In biodiversity/
conservation projects, adequate time is needed to ensure there is a clear understanding among all
stakeholders of the functions of protected areas, how livelihoods and surrounding communities
can benefit, and implications for PA management and reporting. The average duration of single-
country biodiversity/PA projects is typically 5 years; this six-country regional project would
have benefitted from having 2 additional years to provide an appropriate ―incubation period‖ for
ample national and regional consultations, awareness raising, and other preparatory activities to
ensure readiness for implementation.

6.2    Using a coordinating implementing agency helps in the harmonization of policies on
biodiversity conservation and protected area management. Equally, there is need for
mandate and budget resources for national staff to internalize the regional priorities. The
OECS Secretariat (and specifically the OECS-ESDU Unit) played a critical role in the overall
management of this regional biodiversity project providing key functions relating to
harmonization, coordination, technical assistance (such as procurement and financial
management), training, awareness raising/communication, and monitoring and evaluation. The
commitment of national institutions (including the NICEs and SIEs) is critical in implementation
of country-level interventions; however, a clearer delineation of roles for the different entities
and positions (such as the Site Coordinators) would have helped smoother implementation.

6.3     Biodiversity conservation and protected areas management requires intersectoral
cooperation. Both terrestrial and marine protected areas were selected as demonstration sites in
the OPAAL project; thus requiring intersectoral cooperation between departments of forestry,
fisheries, and environment. When designing institutional and implementation arrangements, the
project should consider potential turf issues among sectoral agencies in each country especially
where project activities cut across sectoral (e.g., forestry department vs. fisheries department)
boundaries and mandates –as these could contribute to stalling of activities.




                                                24
6.4     Institutionalization of activities contributes to sustainability of biodiversity
conservation programs and benefits to surrounding communities. The specific integration of
the OPAAL activities within the work plans of the respective National Implementation
Coordinating Entities (NICEs) within the PMS would have contributed to the longer-term
sustainability of activities and processes in the PMS that were initiated and strengthened through
this Project. Subsequent clarity on the role of NICEs and SIEs after Project closure would help
provide guidance on the continuation of the larger program on biodiversity conservation in the
OECS countries, as well as the day-to-day management of PA sites, and support to the
livelihoods activities.

6.5      Flexibility is important in a dynamic context. Flexibility in project design can make
implementation more robust by allowing projects to take advantage of opportunities as they arise
and to modify the structure and nature of project elements if needed. This is important in the case
of biodiversity/ conservation projects which require the gazetting of protected areas, and other
activities (infrastructure, seed grants etc.) sequenced to follow the official approval of such areas.
Flexibility during implementation to make changes (in this project, allowing for some ―no regrets‖
investments and not conditioning other activities on the official endorsement of management
plans) would have helped prevent delays in project activities.

6.6    Technical skills mix is crucial for the quality of project design and implementation.
The technical inputs throughout a project‘s life are often the critical elements to ensuring the
intended outcomes. In this project, key biodiversity expertise (on Bank team and within the
implementing agency) and communications expertise (on Bank team) were not consistently
available, and may have contributed to low responsiveness in addressing Project challenges such
as poorly-defined indicators, unexecuted baseline studies, late start of livelihood activities, and
under-budgeting of awareness activities.

6.7     Local champions are critical for ownership and success. Regional projects such as
OPAAL need to be ‗nationalized and localized‘ through the engagement of highly motivated
national/local ‗champions‘ in order to ensure a high degree of ownership and success. This is
especially true in situations where institutional/capacity systems are small or weak (as is the case
in many Small Island States). In the OPAAL project, the role of the Site Coordinators was
particularly important to successful site-level activities and liaising with communities.

6.8     Address capacity issues early in project life. Regional projects inherently have
logistical complexities, especially in countries with low technical and administrative capacities.
Investments in training and capacity building should be made early to strengthen counterpart
implementation capacity relating to technical and fiduciary specialties. In addition, regional
projects place a heavy demand on existing regional institutions (such as the OECS Secretariat),
which are often thinly-staffed and pulled in many directions by Member States and donor
agencies. For regional projects involving countries with capacity constraints, having a dedicated
PIU –with full-time staff for essential functions such as procurement, FM, safeguards, and M&E
financed by the project –might help to ensure smooth functioning.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The following comments were provided on January 22, 2012 by Mr. Keith Nichols, Head of Unit,
Environment and Sustainable Development Unit, OECS Secretariat.

In the opinion of the OECS Secretariat, the findings of the Bank and other stakeholders in this
report represent a fair and accurate assessment of the performance and success of the OPAAL
project. The Secretariat is firm in its belief that notwithstanding the areas in which
improvements could have been made, OPAAL did more for the management of PAs in this
region than any other previous activity. The relevance of this support is reflected in the
expressed wish by participating member states for the retention of the OPAAL brand for
advancing PA and related objectives beyond the closure of the project.

It is important that the momentum of the OPAAL project be sustained, morphing into a long-
term programme that will reflect not only the gaps and areas identified in the Borrower‘s
Completion Report by steering committee members, but also to give attention to the impacts of
climate change and climate variability on PAs. The mainstreaming of PAs into a comprehensive,
forward-looking sustainable land management programme that considers the implications of
climate change and climate variability will become even more essential as Member States plan
on building economic and environmental resilience into a vision for the future.

The Secretariat believes that OPAAL was well placed, timely, relevant and important to
conserving biodiversity of global importance. The enhancement of the awareness and importance
of PAs is predicated not only on the positive outcomes of the project, but by all the discussions,
thoughts, opinions and feedback, both negative and positive, throughout the life of the project. It
is for this reason that it is felt that the impact of OPAAL is much greater than assessed. The
reformulation from a single country project into a six country project was a strategically
important and sound decision from which there are no regrets, but only important lessons.

(b) Cofinanciers

The following comments were provided on January 26, 2012 by Mr. Julien Calas, Secrétariat du
Fonds Français pour l'Environnement Mondial, Agence Française de Développement

The FFEM was invited to join this project by World Bank / GEF to share experiences of Marine
Protected Areas Projects financed with FFEM (SMMA in St Lucia and other part of the world).
The FFEM was interested also to support OECS in, eventually, fostering regional cooperation
with French Caribbean territories, but FFEM expertise or regional cooperation opportunities
weren‘t finally considered or used during implementation. For these two reason, the FFEM
consider the value added of its contribution to this project as poor. As stated in the report, the
numerous changes at World Bank and OECS/ESDU in the project team could perhaps have
something to do with the abandon of some intentions which were at the beginning of the project.




                                                26
The FFEM applied Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness and decided to align to the World Bank
procedures to implement this project. These procedures are less flexible than the usual FFEM
ones. It is strange to read (2.4.9) that disbursement delays occurred only with FFEM as we
remember very well during supervision mission the long discussions amongst WB TTL and
OECS/ESDU about the disbursement difficulties and application of procurement and
disbursement procedures. We will surely take this remark into consideration for future project
cofinancing. We will care to keep our procedures the more flexible possible. We could perhaps
invite, if possible, the World Bank to align this time with our procedures.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Protected Areas Policy, Legal, and Institutional Arrangements

A regional protected areas policy and a model Act were developed based on a policy, legal and
institutional review for all six Participating Member States (PMS), a comparative regional
analysis, and through a review process that allowed for a participatory analysis of results and the
formulation of a broader range of recommendations. The original intent of the project was to use
this analysis, the regional policy and the model Act as the basis for a customized policy,
institutional and legal reform process at the national level in all six countries, but the project did
not get directly involved in such customization activities because they were being undertaken, in
several PMS, with other sources of support such as the European Commission (EC) Special
Framework for Assistance (SFA) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
Resulting savings were reallocated to other project activities.

Component 2: Protected Area Management and Associated Livelihoods

This component was aimed at establishing new and strengthening existing PAs, complemented
by support for alternative or new livelihoods in areas in proximity to six OPAAL demonstration
sites. The three sub-components were (i) the creation of new and strengthening of existing PAs;
(ii) supporting alternative and new sustainable livelihoods in and around demonstration PAs; and
(iii) Small Project Facility capacity building and support.

(i) Creation of New and Strengthening of Existing PAs
As targeted, all six PAs have been gazetted, four of which are new PAs and two have improved
its management. Management plans have been developed or updated for all six sites, four of
which have been officially endorsed by the Cabinet of respective countries. Two remaining
management plans (Dominica and Saint Lucia) have not been endorsed yet. Each county has
carried out training need assessment. Despite the delay in endorsing the management plans, all
the infrastructure works in the demonstration sites have commenced and made significant
progress. The environmental and socio-economic studies have been conducted for all six sites.
Management effectiveness scorecards have been completed for all six sites. Site coordinators
have been placed in all sites.

(ii) Supporting alternative and new sustainable livelihoods in and around demonstration
PAs;

For all the sites, a feasibility study of livelihoods activities has been completed and training in
livelihood skills has been provided to more than 500 people. The project financed more than the
target number of sub-project (13 sub-projects), benefitting over 200 people in total. Sub-projects
supported by the Project included seamoss faming, arts and crafts, tour guiding, fishing, agro-
processing, farming, horseback riding, boat operations, and charcoal production. However, due
to the very late start of these activities (as a result of sequencing activities), none have been
completed and the impact of livelihoods activities could not be assessed. A breakdown of project
expenditure on livelihood-related activities is provided below.

 (iii) Small Project Facility capacity building and support
In all six PMS, training was delivered in proposal writing including SPF procedures. A total of
75 people have been trained.

Component 3: Building Capacity for Biodiversity conservation and PA Management and
Increasing Environmental Awareness

This component was aimed at enhancing national capacities and increase public support for
biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of PAs through education, training and
awareness. The sub-components were: (i) training in support of establishment and management
of PAs and sustainable alternative livelihoods, and (ii) increasing public awareness on the
ecological, social and economic significance of PAs.

(i) Training in support of establishment and management of PAs and sustainable
alternative livelihoods

The Project carried out country-specific protected areas training needs assessments, as well as a
comparative analysis. On this basis, the project team identified a number of priorities and
opportunities under two main categories; protected areas management and skills related to
livelihoods. Regarding the first category, training modules were developed on a number of
themes related to protected area management and offered in the PMS, namely:
     Boat handling, developed and delivered by Nova Scotia Community College (with the
        added benefit of offering accreditation from an established tertiary institution) in
        Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (total 16 people);
     Small business management, developed and delivered by Gns Services in Antigua and
        Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (total 48
        people);
     Project planning and proposal writing, developed by Trevor Hamilton & Associates and
        delivered in Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
        (project proposal writing training was also facilitated earlier in the project by ESDU staff,
        prior to the activation of this specific aspect of the project) (total 102 people);
     Literacy and numeracy to enhance small business management, developed by Philip J.
        Pierre Business Services Ltd. and delivered in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis
        and Saint Lucia (total 48 people); and
     Tour guiding and interpretation, developed by Tudor Enterprises Ltd. and delivered in
        Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (total 35
        people).

Other training delivered was in PA systems planning (32 people), ecological gap analysis (36
people), PA management (7 people), PA awareness and communications (85 people), PA
monitoring and evaluation (42 people), site M&E (87 people), financial management (46 people),
sustainable financing (62 people), and finance and fundraising (48 people). A total of 694 people
have been trained. Also training was provided in a range of livelihoods skills and fields in
support of the livelihoods sub-project. More than 500 people have been trained and many of
them received seed funding.

(ii) Increasing public awareness on the ecological, social and economic significance of PAs

Awareness raising
A regional awareness strategy was designed and the national environmental awareness action
plans were formulated for all PMS. Some priority activities in the regional awareness strategy
was implemented, which included the production of public service announcements (PSA) for
radio and television; the production and dissemination of a documentary on protected areas in the
sub-region; the production and presentation of exhibitions at several events in various countries;
the conduct of a media awareness initiative (including national media workshops in all six PMS
and a tour to the Grenadines for media workers from three countries); and the production and
distribution of a media toolkit. Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) baseline survey was
conducted to provide input data for facilitating behavior change among local populations living
in, and adjacent to PAs in relation to the environment. The survey focused on the wider
population, as well as representatives of governmental-, nongovernmental, parastatal
departments and agencies, and private entities having environment communication functions. A
total of 1,479 interviews were conducted (1,334 household and 145 departmental) and
demonstrated that 58.1% of regional population is somewhat aware and 18.1% very familiar of
the importance of PAs. A follow-up KAP has not been carried out due to lack of funds.

Communications
Communications plans were formulated for all sites. A regional communications training
workshop was held in St. Kitts and Nevis and national communications training activities in all
PMS. For the branding of the project and the promotion of that brand at all levels, the project
produced the following:
    the design and use of a logo;
    the production of various materials (folder, fact sheet, flyer);
    the preparation and issuance of press releases;
    TV spots, jingles and documentaries;


                                                  32
      the production of a quarterly newsletter; and
      the production of memorabilia promoting the OPAAL brand.

OPAAL collaborated with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the University of the West Indies
(UWI) Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES) and the Wider
Caribbean Sea Turtle Network (WIDECAST) in the case of TCMP, to produce documentation,
learning and dissemination.

Component 4: Project Management, M&E and Information Dissemination

This component was composed of three sub-components: (i) project management, (ii) monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) of overall project implementation, and (iii) design and implementation of
an information dissemination strategy.

(i) Project Management
The essential project personnel were on board during the project life, while there were a few
turnover occurrences of key staff such as the Project Coordinator, the Accounting Assistant, and
the Protected Area Specialist. The Operational Manual was finalized in the first quarter of 2005.
The Project Steering Committee (PSC) was convened five times during the life of project. The
National Implementation Coordinating Entities (NICEs) and the Site Implementing Entities
(SIEs) have been appointed in each PMS. The former was responsible for preparing national
annual work plans and budgets, day-to-day implementation of project activities at the national
level, supervising the local site activities in collaboration with the SIEs, liaise with the Project
Management Unit of the OECS on matters related to project implementation. The latter was set
up with a PA Manager to carry out day-to-day management of the PA and related site-specific
activities.

(ii) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of overall project implementation
A fully-fledged M&E system that includes biodiversity monitoring at the site level was designed.
Results Monitoring Framework has been updated at least biannually. The Process Framework
Monitoring and Evaluation Tool was developed. FMR reports, PMS quarterly reports, and
annual implementation reports have been prepared adequately.

(iii) Design and implementation of an information dissemination strategy.
The Project website has been created on the OECS site. Usage of the Project site averaged 434
persons visit per month (data from project initiation not available). A regional seminar was
convened in July 2010 to extract and disseminate experiences and lessons learned and to
strengthen processes associated with the establishment and management of protected areas in the
region. The participants took stock of regional progress and issues in protected area management.
The workshop covered a range of relevant topics, and allowed for the identification of lessons
and recommendations that are adequately documented in a report. Project personnel at ESDU
participated in a number of regional and international events that allowed for the sharing of
experiences and the promotion of the project. Also, the Project Coordinator presented a paper at
a major global protected areas congress.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A formal ex-post economic analysis has not been prepared.

Incremental Cost Analysis: As required for a GEF project, an Incremental Cost Analysis was
used for the project‘s economic and financial analysis at appraisal. Benefits under the Baseline
Scenario in biodiversity conservation were assumed to be increased environmental awareness
and management in PMS; limited benefits from harmonization and economies of scale at
regional level; limited participation of communities in the management of local resources, with
limited support and funding available for the creation and co-management of both new and
existing PAs. The total Baseline costs were estimated at US$5.1 million.

The Project was estimated to provide multiple benefits at both national level and regional level –
contributing to establishment, gazetting of protected areas; contributing to improved
management of the six demonstration sites (thus enhancing protection of the habitat of more than
11 regionally endemic species); strengthening the policy and planning frameworks for
biodiversity conservation and protected area management; renovating infrastructures necessary
for improving the protected areas management; and supporting awareness of these protected
areas through effective communication strategies and tools. The total incremental cost calculated
at appraisal was US$7.6 million, of which US$3.7 million was to be financed by the GEF.

Cost-effectiveness estimate: Another way to assess cost-effectiveness could be on the basis of
comparing PA management cost per unit area with other countries. The project provided a
degree of protection and management of PAs for 6.5 years at regional and national levels. The
total project expenditures were US$3.58 million and the total area managed under the project
was 24,693ha (= 247km2), which translates to about US$2,230/km2/year. The cost directly
associated with PA management (Component 1-3) was US$2.48 million, which translates to the
annual cost of PA management of about $1,545/km2/year. This is broadly consistent with the
regional mean protected area budget for the Caribbean estimated at US$1,043/km2/year in the
1996$5 (translates to about $1500/ km2/year today).

Economic impacts from Livelihood Activities: Although alternative livelihood activities have
been commenced in all six protected areas, there has not been enough time elapsed to measure
the benefits of the interventions. Therefore, the results of these activities are not considered in
this analysis. It is strongly recommended to carry out such an analysis about a year after Project
closing.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

There was no formal beneficiary surveys held during the Project. However there were some
informal surveys of beneficiaries carried out in the context of the livelihoods training.

Survey related Livelihoods Training and Seed Funds
Beneficiary surveys regarding livelihoods training were conducted in all sites except Dominica.

Methodologies: The methodologies were not consistent among the countries as different
consultants were hired to develop the survey. In Grenada, the respondents were randomly chosen
from the trainees and a focus group meeting was held where the respondents were able to discuss
the OPAAL Project in a structured forum by providing answers to the questions posed by the
Consultant. The number of respondents present at the focus group meeting was 25 and there
were an adequate number of males and females represented. In St. Kitts and Nevis, face-to-face
in-home interviews with beneficiaries and self-administered questionnaires were used. A total of
thirty-eight (38) questionnaires were administered, of which 61% were male. In Saint Lucia, 7
livelihood operators were interviewed as part of the survey. In St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
evaluation was conducted at end of each training workshop.

General Results:
The information obtained from the survey is compiled in a report for each country. In general,
more people felt that various training delivered was relevant and useful, while minority
percentage of the respondents expressed their dissatisfaction or expressed that their expectations
were not met. The following summarizes the feedback received:

Positive responses: Topics presented were relevant and very timely given the present state of the
economy in the PMS. The facilitators were very knowledgeable and the trainings were well
delivered. Some of the short-term benefits of the project identified by the respondents are that the
project was able to provide them with the technical knowledge and the tools and equipment
required in starting our business. There is a general sense of confidence amongst the various
trainees that the profitability and sustainability of their enterprises has been greatly enhanced
from the resources provided by the OPAAL seed funding. The respondents expressed their
intention to expand their activities once they established themselves. Some even saw their
expansion being able to facilitate the creation of employment for others.

Negative responses: The time allocated for the training was too short to process a lot of
information. Some felt that further information and training are required to be able to continue
making the products without supervision of the trainers and turn the production into a sustainable
livelihood. Some training (e.g., bee keeping) did not meet the expectations of the trainees. For
example, bee keeping training was not truly hands-on and not conducive to turning it into a
sustainable livelihood. Small business management did not provide information on how to start a
business, develop business plan and how to cost production, etc.

General comments on the Project: The responses are split regarding the Project‘s contribution to
sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity and to increasing awareness of the
linkages that can be forged between natural resources and livelihoods activities. Some countries



                                                40
show positive perceptions regarding these aspects and some others do not. In case of SVG, it was
reported that most noticeable change amongst all the user groups is in the area of environmental
stewardship and general buy-in to the goals and objectives on the TCMP. Following the trainings
on environmental stewardship, resources users were able to directly link the sustainability of the
natural resources of the TCMP and the sustainability of their livelihood. The heightened
understanding of the links between the sustainability of their livelihoods and the sustainability of
the marine environment has lead to an increase in reporting of activities that run counter to the
goal and objectives of the MPA (incl. illegal fishing and waste disposal).

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

No specific workshops were convened in conjunction with preparation of this Core ICR. There
were several consultations held during project preparation, which contributed to the current
design of the project as well as the selection of the first three target PAs as well as raising
awareness among stakeholders of the multiplicity of issues surrounding areas of critical
biodiversity on the islands. In addition, a social assessment undertaken during project preparation
included a stakeholder analysis and consultations with stakeholders to contribute to site-specific
action plans to be developed under the project

Moreover, during the course of the project, a few stakeholder workshops were supported during
the Project launch (at the regional level as well as at the national level); and to share experiences
and lessons learned relating to the OPAAL Project. In addition, various studies undertaken for
the Project held workshops with stakeholders to obtain inputs. Overall, the project benefited a
wide range of stakeholders from national and local government staff, to NGOs and local
communities. A summary of the major stakeholder workshops described below:

Project Launch Workshop: The workshop to launch the Project was held in Castries, St. Lucia,
on December 14-16, 2004. Represented at the workshop were the following agencies: (i) the
OECS Secretariat and its Environment and Sustainable Development Unit (ESDU), (ii) Ministry
of Agriculture, Lands, Environment, Marine Resources, Agro Industry of Antigua and Barbuda,
(iii) the Ministry of Health, Social Security, the Environment & Ecclesiastical Relation of
Grenada, (iv) the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Planning Unit of St. Kitts and Nevis, (v)
the St. Lucia National Trust, (vi) the Office of the Prime Minister and the Tobago Keys Marine
Park of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, (vii) Caribbean Environmental Health Institute (CEHI),
(viii) the French Embassy to the OECS Member States, and (ix) the World Bank. At the
workshop, the project‘s objectives, components, and planned activities were presented as well as
institutional and implementation arrangements. The next steps in initiating project
implementation were also discussed, including a series of National Project Launch Workshops,
annual work program and first-year planned activities, financial management and flow of funds,
procurement plan, establishment of a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation System, and update of
the Project Operational Manual.

National Launch Workshops: As a follow up to the regional launch workshop, national project
launch workshops were conducted in all PMS with participation of a broad range of stakeholders
and high level political leaders. While the completion of national launch workshops took longer
than anticipated (June-July 2005 instead of end of February 2005) due to country-specific
situations, these events provided the opportunity to raise OPAAL‘s profile and to present and
discuss the project‘s objectives, activities, implementation arrangements, etc. with a broad range
of stakeholders at the national levels. The national launch workshops also resulted in the
finalization of the six detailed national annual work plans that provided the basis for the
preparation of the consolidated regional annual work plan.

Workshops related to Studies Supported by the Project:

Environmental and Socio-economic Studies as part of the establishment of PAs:
    Workshop held with key stakeholders including governmental agencies, area residents,
       fishermen, tourists, tour boat operators and divers.
    Included baseline environmental and socio-economic studies resulting in the status of the
       resource base, its use and the nature of communities associated with the site; and detailed
       site preparation studies resulting in identification of adverse environmental or socio-
       economic impacts.
Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods Study:
    A series of workshops was held near each of the six OPAAL sites between January and
      March, 2006 with stakeholders of each Project site;
    Subproject ideas for funding under the livelihoods component were scoped out; and
    Preliminary findings were presented and feedback obtained.
Feasibility Studies of Livelihoods Subprojects to determine their economic viability:
    Workshops with stakeholders living adjacent to the Project sites; and
    Inputs to agreements signed between the Site Implementing Entities (SIE) and the
       National Implementation Coordinating Entities (NICE) to govern the implementation of
       these livelihood-related activities.
Financial Sustainability Study:
    All six OPAAL sites were visited by the consultants in February 2009 to gather
       background information. At subsequent participatory workshop held in June 2009 in
       Saint Lucia, a preliminary draft report based on the findings of the country visits was
       discussed.
    Stakeholders from all six participating states contributed to refining the analysis and
       influence the study‘s recommendations.

Workshop on Sharing of Experiences of the Tobago Cays Marine Park (TCMP): The
workshop was held in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in February 2010 to highlight the
successes of, and lessons learnt from, the TCMP especially as these relate to institutional
mechanisms. The outcomes of the workshops included (i) a network built and sharing between
counterparts (specifically, site coordinators); (ii) a forum for site coordinators and other persons
to examine common issues and learn from the experience of counterparts; and (iii) reiteration of
processes and best practices as these relate to planning, procurement, reporting, communications
and conflict resolution.

Lessons Learned and Dissemination Workshop: A regional stakeholder workshop was
convened in July 2010 to extract and disseminate experiences and lessons learned and to
strengthen processes associated with the establishment and management of protected areas in the
region. The workshop brought together a large number of participants and made
recommendations on various themes such as conserving biodiversity through protected areas;
lessons from survey on Knowledge Attitudes and Practices; achieving effective M&E of PA with
limited resources; innovative financial solutions to managing PAs; management planning for
PAs, etc. The participants in general expressed usefulness and relevance of this workshop.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Recipient‘s final review was carried out between 1 May and 15 July 2011 by Gillian Cooper
and Yves Renard, under the terms of a contractual agreement with the OECS Secretariat.

Methodology. This evaluation is based on six criteria which provided the overall framework for
the gathering and analysis of information and opinions: (i) relevance, (ii) impacts, (iii)
effectiveness, (iv) efficiency, (v) equity, and (vi) sustainability. The main activities and sources
of information have been the following:
 an orientation meeting with ESDU staff (5 May);
 a desk top review of all relevant documents;
 country and site visits to Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada and Saint Lucia, with meetings with
    national and local stakeholders, and with the observation of and participation in two
    community meetings (Grenada and Saint Lucia) and one technical meeting to prepare a site
    monitoring scorecard (Saint Lucia);
 individual interviews (both in person and by phone) with a range of project stakeholders at
    local, national, regional and international levels;
 a preliminary analysis of the data and information collected, and the preparation of a short
    paper presenting preliminary findings;
 participation in and presentation to a meeting of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) held
    in Saint Lucia on 6 June, with feedback provided by the PSC on the preliminary findings;
 conduct of additional interviews to complete the analysis and validate or modify findings;
 drafting and submission of a draft final report for review by project stakeholders;
 revision of the report and preparation of this final version.
This evaluation does not encompass financial and project management audit, which is assessed
separately.

Main findings
Relevance. The OPAAL project was, and still is, relevant to existing policies, agreements and
commitments at all levels including (i) the CBD and its Programmes of Work on Protected Areas

(UNFCCC) and to its adaptation agenda, (iii) the International Convention on Wetlands
(Ramsar), (iv) the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of
the Wider Caribbean, known as the Cartagena Convention, especially its Protocol on Specially
Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW), (v) the Revised Treaty of Basseterre, (vi) the St. George‘s
Declaration of Principles for Environmental Sustainability in the OECS, and notably its Principle
13 (incorporated into Goal 3 of the revised version of the SGD), and (vii) many national policies
and policy instruments, including the national environmental management strategies of
individual countries.

Impacts. In spite of significant constraints and issues, and of the difficulty to assess impacts at
this stage, it is clear that the OPAAL project was able to achieve tremendous outcomes, and that
it has made a very positive contribution to conservation and sustainable development in the
Participating Member States (PMS) and in the region as a whole. For example, policy change
and a far more coherent and systematic planning framework and approach to protected areas and
biodiversity were developed in the six PMS. New protected areas were formally established and


                                                 44
management of existing protected areas has improved. Various training sessions were provided
to a wide range of actors in conservation and protected area management, including staff of
management agencies, local resource users and media personnel. The OECS Secretariat has been
strengthened as a key actor in conservation and sustainable development in the sub-region.
Exchanges of experiences and skills between countries and institutions were promoted.

There are however areas where the project did not produce expected impacts, particularly with
respect to the capacity of national organizations, including the six National Implementation
Coordinating Entities (NICEs). In all but one of the demonstration sites, the impacts from
livelihood activities have not yet been visible due to the late start of these activities. In the case
of the TCMP that started earlier than others, tangible economic impacts have been observed,
especially on the fishers who have been helped with equipment and are now able to engage in a
more diverse range of economic activities.

Effectiveness. The main approach used by the project was to ―                     ‖
                                                                remove the barriers to effective and
efficient management, and this was entirely appropriate. The project was based on a thorough
analysis of the issues and constraints to effective management of protected areas at the time of
design, and identified activities aimed at addressing the issues and removing the barriers. This is
an approach that can certainly be recommended for similar initiatives and interventions.

Regional approaches provide for greater aid effectiveness in managing projects for small island
developing states (SIDS). However, a reduction in transaction costs does not always translate
into aid effectiveness. A distinction must be made between activities that are best supported at
regional level (e.g. policy analysis and reform, capacity-building, provision of technical
assistance and expertise, documentation) and those that are best implemented by national and
local organizations (e.g. management planning, enforcement, support to sustainable use and
facilitation of socio-economic development processes).

The institutional arrangements for project coordination and implementation at national level
(National Technical Advisory Committees (NTACs)) and site levels (Site Implementing Entities
(SIEs)) were not all put in place and did not function optimally. This is because some of the
expectations to national entities may have been too high, and the project may not have taken into
account the serious economic and fiscal challenges faced by the countries. Also for the National
Project Coordinators (NPCs), OPAAL activities were additional to their regular responsibilities.
An exceptional case was St. Vincent and the Grenadines where all responsibilities were, for all
                                                          —
practical purposes, delegated to a multi-stakeholder board the Tobago Cays Marine Park (TCMP)
     —
Board appointed by the Government.

At the level of the demonstration sites, many of the challenges and weaknesses of the OPAAL
project are attributed to a lack of local ‗ownership‘ to project activities. Several reasons were
identified, including the complexity of project design, the time spent between design and
implementation, and high turn-over of personnel and capacity issues in some of the national
agencies. However, the main reason was that most of the PAs have not been successful in
establishing participatory management frameworks. In the case of TCMP there is a multi-
stakeholder board appointed by the Government. In all other instances, there is no formal
involvement of non-state actors in the management of the PAs.


                                                  45
While the OPAAL project has supported useful local studies and provided the expertise available
within ESDU, it was not designed and structured so as to provide cutting-edge scientific and
technical guidance and support, such as services and training in mapping and management of
geographic information systems, technical publications, local seminars, or more active
collaborations with scientific institutions.

Efficiency. There is a view among many of the project partners that the design of the project was
overly ambitious in terms of budget for the planned activities, time frame to implement, the
range of activities involved, and the multiples levels of responsibility. Among these, the main
issue that has impacted negatively on project implementation has been the scheduling and
sequencing of activities, for three main reasons: (a) the fact that projects of this kind always take
                           ‖,
time to―get up and running (b) the requirement, by GEF and the World Bank, that PA
management plans be prepared and approved before field interventions could be implemented,
and (c) the delays in delivering studies and preparing management plans in some countries.

The Project has been well-managed with competent staffing at the OECS secretariat, detailed and
timely reporting to the World Bank and the FFEM, good monitoring instruments, good
compliance with legal requirements, and some flexibility in systems and procedures. Most of the
instruments and processes of reporting and monitoring, including the mid-term review, the
periodic reports, and monitoring missions have been effective and efficient. There were however
some weaknesses, for example the reliability and soundness of the results of the scorecard has
not been demonstrated, because it is simplistic by design and its preparation is based largely on
availability of information and subjective information of the person who fills it in. Financial
management systems and procedures for disbursements functioned well. The main issue came
from the procurement procedures of the World Bank, and to a lesser extent those of the OECS
Secretariat, which were too demanding and complex for small and local contracts.

Equity. It does not appear that equity issues have received much explicit consideration in the
design and implementation of the OPAAL project. For example, the gender dimension which is
highly relevant to natural resources-based livelihoods was not included in the Process
Framework Monitoring Tool, and was not covered in a detailed document on social assessment,
participation and process framework.

Sustainability. While the OPAAL project has made significant advances in protected area
management, it has only partially addressed some of the fundamental issues and challenges that
are still affecting the effectiveness of management and preventing the full integration of
protected areas in the national development processes and frameworks of OECS countries. To
address this issue, the processes that the project initiated must be continued, and the initial
commitment to a 15-year program must be respected by all involved.

The livelihood activities have started very late in the project life that the countries need to
continue support them to see its impacts. Also the promotion of natural resource based
livelihoods and businesses require different set of skills, including community development,
participation and business. Accordingly, there is a need for ESDU and national PA management
agencies to forge alliances with the institutions with relevant skills and experience in the region.
