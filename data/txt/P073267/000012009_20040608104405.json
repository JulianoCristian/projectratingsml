contribute to the\n            conservation of biodiversity of global importance in the\n            OECS region, by removing barriers to effective management of\n            protected areas, and increased involvement of civil society,\n            and private sector in the planning, management and\n            sustainable use of these areas. During project\n            implementation there will be no involuntary physical\n            displacement, or resettlement of persons from project\n            selected protected areas. However, some livelihood\n            activities could potentially be impacted due, for example,\n            to the limiting of fishing areas through zoning, limiting\n            fish catches, or restricting certain fishing, and\n            agricultural practices in sensitive areas. This Process\n            Framework outlines the criteria, and procedures that the\n            project will follow to ensure that eligible, affected\n            persons are assisted in their efforts to restore or improve\n            their livelihoods in an integral, environmental process,\n            fair, just, and in accordance with local laws, and\n            consistent with the Bank's Policies on Involuntary\n            Resettlement (OP 4.12) and Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). The\n            project activities for mitigating potential, nonphysical\n            displacement would target local low-income communities that\n            neighbor and use natural resources. Following the objectives\n            of the social assessment, activities should: carry out a\n            stakeholder analysis, and, consultations with stakeholders;\n            abide by the baseline socio-economic conditions, emphasizing\n            natural resource use issues; evaluate social criteria for\n            site pre-selection, and identify key issues for the human\n            communities (both opportunities and potential conflicts or\n            problems) to contribute to site specific action plans, to be\n            developed under the project.  The project's Component 2\n            - Protected Areas and Associated Alternative Livelihood\n            Opportunities - includes facilitating and financing\n            sustainable livelihood subprojects with communities living\n            in and around the targeted PAs. In addition, Component 3 -\n            Capacity Building for Conservation Planning and Management -\n            will include technical assistance, and training\n            opportunities supporting, and developing future, sustainable\n            livelihood activities."}, "docdt": "2004-05-24T10:40:03Z"}
