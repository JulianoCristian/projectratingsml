2.      The Bank supervision mission in December 2010 noted good progress made
towards the implementation of the OPAAL project since the previous mission in
November 2009. Infrastructure works are being carried out and sustainable livelihood
sub-projects have been launched in all countries, most recently in Grenada, Saint Lucia,
and St. Kitts and Nevis. Extensive training and capacity building has been carried out,
and preliminary feedback from participants has been very positive. There has been very
good progress in awareness building activities. All pending issues relating to approvals
for infrastructure works have been resolved. There are no outstanding financial audits.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to correct inadvertent misclassification of
expenditures under "training and workshops", and "other operational costs" that were
identified during the Bank's recent supervision mission. Some training activities were
incorrectly categorized under consultants' services; while some goods (such as printing
of reports in the form of hard copies and DVDs) were incorrectly categorized under
"other operational costs." Therefore, while it may appear as "cost savings" from these
two categories, the proposed reallocation simply represents a reposting of expenditures to
correct the misclassification. There will be no new or additional activities financed
through this reallocation. The total reallocation amounts to $334,487, which represents 9
% of the total grant amount ($3.7 million).
