                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Development/Global Objective. To contribute to the conservation of biodiversity of global importance in the participating countries of the Organization of
                         Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) by removing barriers to the effective management of protected areas (PAs), and increasing the involvement of civil society
                         and the private sector in the planning, management and sustainable use of these areas. This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening national and regional
                         capacities in the sound management of PAs;(ii) establishing or strengthening a number of demonstration PAs; (iii) providing economic sustainable
                         opportunities for environmentally compatible livelihoods in buffer zones of project-supported PAs; and (iv) involving communities, civil society and private
                         sector in the participatory management of the PAs. (The six OECS participating countries are: Antigua &Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts &Nevis, Saint
                         Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines).

                         The OECS secretariat made significant progress towards the completion of activities relating to the OPAAL project since the previous supervision mission in March 2011. At the time
                         of project closing in end July 2011, all infrastructure works had been completed, and good progress was made on the sustainable livelihoods component, with livelihoods sub-projects
                         financed in all participating member states. Extensive training and capacity building has been carried out; and excellent progress made in awareness building activities, with radio and
                         TV public service announcements, video documentary on protected areas, media awareness seminars etc.
