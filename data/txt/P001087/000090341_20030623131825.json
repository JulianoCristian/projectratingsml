DEV.-POP.,TF023039-PHRD-SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR\n            INV. CRE.,TF036855-GUINEA - EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Guinea - Equity and\n            School Improvement Project were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that despite low institutional capacity and\n            scare resources, the project demonstrated that rapid and\n            large gains in access and improvement in the internal\n            efficiency of the education system are possible when the\n            Education Ministry sustains its political and technical\n            leadership over the long haul (more than ten year in this\n            case). As demonstrated by the project, a drastic reduction\n            in the gender gap is better achieved when gender-gap\n            interventions are integrated in each activity of the project\n            rather than as a stand-alone activity. It is also extremely\n            useful to monitor progress in reducing the gender gap\n            through each activity as recommended by the Equity and\n            School Improvement Project (PEAE). Because the Education\n            Ministry's institutional setting evolves during project\n            implementation, it is important to revise and regularly\n            adjust the objectives and outputs of the capacity-building\n            program supported by the project. Building capacity requires\n            more than resources and technical assistance. It is crucial\n            that the Education Ministry discusses and shares its program\n            with the staff. Good and effective communication plays a key\n            role in facilitating implementation and ensuring better\n            compliance with new rules, procedures and behaviors. The\n            Education Ministry needs a strong mechanism with\n            decision-making power to ensure an effective and efficient\n            coordination between donors' interventions. This is\n            particularly critical when several donors intervene in the\n            same field. By the same token, donors must recognize the\n            authority of the Education Ministry over donors\n            coordination. An institutional mechanism and adequate\n            processes must be set up to ensure that the leadership\n            authority of the Education Ministry will use information\n            produced by its statistic and planning division and student\n            evaluation unit to guide its policy in the sector."}, "docdt": "2003-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
