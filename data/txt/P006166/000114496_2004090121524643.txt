Amendment
Dear Sir:
I refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the abovereferenced Project 
between the Republic of Bolivia (the Borrower), and the International Development 
Association (IDA), dated February 22, 1990.
I would like to inform you that the Association agrees to amend the 
Development Credit Agreement for purposes of replacing the condition of 
effectiveness under Section 7.01 (b) thereof by a condition of disbursement for 
Category 1 (works for Part A.1 and A.2 of the Project) of the table in paragraph 1 
of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement. Therefore, the Association 
hereby proposes the following am ndment to the Development Credit Agreement:
1.
Paragraph (b) of Section 7.01 is deleted.
2.
A sub-paragraph (d) is added to paragraph 3 of Schedule I to read as follows:
"(d) in respect of payments made for expenditures under Category I of 
the table in para. 1 of this Schedule, unless the Borrower shall have 
furnished to the Association evidence satisfactory to the Association that 
the 
SIF has adopted the SIF Manuals in form and substance satisfactory to 
the 
Association".
This amendment letter will become effective on the date the Development 
Credit Agreement becomes effective.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the 
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to me.
