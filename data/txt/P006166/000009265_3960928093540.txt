MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDASION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR AN INTEGRATED HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following merorandum and recommuendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 15.7 million (US$20.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance an
Integrated Health Development Project. The project would be cofinanced by
the Government of the Netherlands for US$6.2 million equivalent. The
national counterpart would include funds from UNICEF for US$1.3 million
equivalent, and WHO/PAHO for US$0.8 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Poverty has deep roots in Bolivia, and economic and
social development in that country faces major challenges. Bolivia remains
one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with GNP per capita of
US$570 in 1987, and large segments of the urban and rural population
surviving on subsistence income. These conditions are not only a
consequence of historical factors, but also of poor economic performance
since the early 1970s. which culminated in the collapse of 1985. Faced
with an acute economic crisis, the Government which took office in August
1985 launched a comprehensive series of adjustment measures. These actions
have stabilized the economy and arrested several years of decline in
national income. A major public initiative, the Bolivian Emergency Social
Fund (FSE), implemented with participation of community and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), and supported by IDA and other external
agencies, has helped cushion the population from the worst aspects of
poverty. But continuing social dislocation coupled with the backlog of
investment requirements for human resources development have now placed
measures to alleviate poverty, based on sound principles of management and
finance, at the center of the Government's development plans.
3.       The demographic and social conditions of Bolivia remain grave.
The current population of 7.1 million, growing at 2.71 annually, has the
worst health indicators in South America. Life expectancy averages only 51
years for men and 55 for women. Infant mortality is twice the average for
the region, at 110 per 1,000 live births, and reaches 277 per 1,000 live
births in some poor communities. Maternal mortality, at 48 per 10,000 live
births, is almost twice the average for the region. It is associated with
high fertility, poor health conditions of mothers and an alarming incidence
of induced abortion. Malnutrition is widespread, particularly in marginal
urban zones and in low-income rural areas. Recent surveys show daily
caloric intake averaging only 60 to 65Z of requirements in peripheral urban
districts and 59? in depressed rural areas.
4.       Responsibility for public health is carried by the Ministry of
Social Welfare and Public Health (MPSSP) which allocates 32 of the national
budget or about US$3 per capita (1988). Public capital expenditure on
health, however limited in recent years, has relied almost exclusively on
international aid. In addition to MPSSP services, the social security
system, encompassing numerous funds for both public and private employees,
with considerable differentiation in benefits, covers about 20? of the
population. The fee-charging private sector provides attention mostly to
urban households with sufficient income to finance their health care,
representing no more than 5? of the population. More than 300 local and
foreign-based NGOs play a substantial role in the Bolivian health sector,



serving about 202 of the population. The majority of them have programs
for the poor. Community-based groups in Bolivia are also instrumental in
fostering participation in health education campaigns and in channelling
food aid. MPSSP programs, notably vertical vaccination and disease control
campaigns, have had some success in reducing prevalence rates of infectious
diseases. In general, however, the effectiveness of public health
expenditure is low. This is due, in part, to the over-centralization of
MPSSP, which retains operational functions at the central level, while
neglecting its normative and coordinating responsibility. But other
factors also play a role. Inadequate organization and management have
allowed the MPSSP to dissipate its resources, both financial and technical,
in a variety of poorly planned and monitored programs. Coordination with
NGOs and other private health care providers is weak. MPSSP lacks
sufficient qualified technical and management personnel. Physical
infrastructure is in poor condition. Pharmaceutical stocks and medical
supplies are underfinanced and are inefficiently procured, stored and
distributed.
S.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA country assistance strategy
has focused on: (a) continued support for the ongoing program of economic
adjustment; (b) selected investments in key economic and social sectors,
combined with policies to ensure the efficient use of resources and combat
the worst effects of poverty; and (c) assistance to the Government in
securing the external financing needed for its development program. IDA
has embarked on a substantial lending program, a portion of which is aimed
at rehabilitating essential parts of the public sector (Economic Management
Strengthening Operation, Credit 1977-30; and Public Financial Management
Operation, Credit 1809-BO). Within the adjustment process, it has also
supported emergency social and income generating programs through the FSE
(Credits 1829 and 1882-BO). A third operation is being prepared to support
broadening the FSE from an emergency fund to a development institution, the
Social Investment Fund (FIS). In extending financing to the health sector,
IDA seeks to promote the policy actions and institutional changes necessary
to improve the coverage, quality and efficiency of health services in
Bolivia. As chair of the Consultative Group for Bolivia, IDA is also in a
strong position to assist fund-raising efforts for the sector. In this
first IDA project for the health sector in Bolivia, we would address only
the major constraints of the sector while laying the ground for further
improvement through future projects.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The principal objective is to improve
maternal and child health in Bolivia, through the implementation of the
Integrated Health Care Model (IHCM), encompassing both public and NGO
activities in the sector. MPSSP would delegate the administration of
health districts and the operation of health facilities to municipalities,
NGOs or other providers of health care. Specifically, the project would:
(i) support the extension of the basic health services, with priority for
the most vulnerable groups of pregnant and lactating women and of children
under five years of age, in the four most populated urban and peri-urban
areas of the country; (ii) improve the effectiveness of these services
through the development of appropriately trained personnel in health
institutions; and (iii) strengthen central policy making and coordination
within a more coherent institutional framework and a national health sector
development program.
7.       Project Description.  The project would include: (i) a service
delivery component (US$29.6 million) consisting of implementing the IHCM in
the marginal and low-income areas of La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba and Santa
Cruz. The credit would finance the extension of basic health care
services, including pre- and post-natal care, reproductive health care,



- 3 -
child development and nutritional control, prevention and control of
diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The credit would finanee construction,
rehabilitation and equipping of 166 ambulatory centers, and supply and
management of stocks of essential drugs, equipment, vehicles, logistic and
maintenance systems, and on a declining basis, selected incremental
salaries. The construction of one maternal and child health facility of up
to 50 beds would also be financed. MPSSP would contract the operation and
maintenance of this facility, according to the cost recovery policy to be
defined during the project. The FIS would be used for review of unit COMb
and administration of the civil works contracts, thereby providing
assurance of efficient disbursements; (ii) a human resources development
component (US$1.0 million) consisting of the training and supervision of
selected staff from MPSSP, municipalities and NGOs. The project would also
support the training of midwives and health education campaigns,
particularly for community leaders; (iii) an institutional development
component (US$6.5 million) covering the phased reorganization of MPSSP. It
would include strengthening the Planning, Human Resources, Administration
and General directorates, and the regional units involved in the project.
It would establish a system for planning, budgeting and control for MPSSP,
and participating municipalities and NGOs. It would also support the
development of a management information system including monitoring and
evaluation of project impact based on the National Institute of Statistics'
(INE) annual household survey (the survey is partially financed by Credit
1977-BO). A Plan of Action, laid out in a schedule of the Credit
Agreement, would reinforce the policy actions and institutional changes of
the project, and specify agreed targets and service delivery indicators. A
Project Unit (PU) has been formed, financed by a Project Preparation
Facility advance approved in April 1988 (US$1.5 million), and a Project
Manager has been appointed. Department Health Councils (CDSs), with MPSSP,
local government and private sector representatives, would be set up in the
project areas to coordinate regional investment and financing for the
sector.
8.       The total project cost is estimated at US$38.6 million over eight
and a half years. The Government's contribution would amount to US$9.5
million. Except for the US$2.1 million from UNICEF and WHO/PAHO, this
contribution would consist mostly of salaries and is in line with the
Country Economic Memorandum budget projections (Report No. 7645-BO); local
and regional entities would contribute US$2.9 million; and cofinancing
would amount to US$6.2 million. Retroactive financing for an amount not to
exceed 1OZ of the credit would be permitted for selected expenditures made
after February 1, 1989. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key project events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Bolivia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps of the project
area are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report. No. 8001-BO dated December
20, 1989, is also attached.
9.       Actions to be Agreed.  Agreements were reached at negotiations
that: (i) an annual review of the Plan of Action would be conducted jointly
by IDA and the Government, the project investment program for the following
year would be approved by IDA, and the Ministry's program of expenditures,
including the expansion of the basic health care services nationwide, would
be reviewed by IDA. The Plan of Action would include a schedule for
increasing the share and improving the distribution of resources for basic
health care, and for organizational change and management development.
Under this Plan, the percentage of national budget allocated to health
grows from 32 to about 42, and the share of MPSSP expenditures on basic
health in the project areas grows from between 20 to 30% to at least its



- 4 -
highest historical level of 351I the percentage of budget administered at
departmental lavel grows from about 201 to no less than 90?; the financial
reporting by local management units is to be in place by 1991 and the
management information system by 19921 and the status of basic health
doctors is to be improved by March 1991: and (it) any replacement of the
project manager and technical director would be approved by IDA, and IDA
would be informed of any proposed replacement of the PU staff and would be
given the opportunity to exchange views on the appropriateness of the
qualifications of proposed new staff. Substantial coordination has already
been achieved during project preparation with IDB, WHO/PAKO, UNICEF and
bilateral donors and would be sustained during implementation via a joint
government-donor coutittee. Cofinancing arrangements are being finalized
with the Government of the Netherlands. WHO/PAHO and UNICEF would assist
in the execution of the institutional and human resources development
components, and would partially finance them. Additional support for the
sector would be obtained through the activities of the FIS.  An event of
default would be that the Government fails to finalize the cofinancing
arrangements or make alternative arrangements, by June 30, 1990 (all
cofinancing essential to the project has been substantially secured).  As
conditions of effectiveness, ?IS would be established with a mandate
satisfactory to IDA, the FIS procedure manuals satisfactory to IDA would be
finalized, and an agreement satisfactory to IDA would be signed between
MPSSP and PIS. A condition of disbursement for expenditures in each
department would be the establishment of the CDS. Prior to IDA
disbursements for incremental salary expenditures, the Government would
provide IDA with its plan for assuming the cost of these salaries after
June 1991.
10.      Proiect Benefits.  The project would benefit about 790,000 women
and children, currently without access to basic health services in the low-
income neighborhoods of the four largest cities. It would reorient public
health expenditure in favor of basic health care and improve the efficiency
of resource use through improved coordination -ith NGOs and among donors.
About 80Z of the total project expenditures would benefit the poor, and 60?
the extreme poor. The project would address directly the precarious health
condition of women in Bolivia. About 831 of the basic care services
provided through the project would be targeted to women and children. The
project seeks to reduce infant mortality to 70 per 1,000 live births and
maternal mortality to 33 per 10,000 live births in the project area. The
project would also have a positive social impact on women through the
social services provided in the integrated centers where outreach health
activities are performed. The project would include training on
environment issues and protection, and the preparation and promotion of a
sanitation project for which financing would be available through the FIS.
11.      Project Risks.  The risks include lack of full commitment and
follow through of the Government and/or the municipalities to carrying out
administrative reforms and introducing effective management systems.
Annual reviews of the Plan of Action, carefully planned technical
assistance and donor coordination would help minimize these risks.
12.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
