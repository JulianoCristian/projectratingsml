(The flexibility of\n            project design and credit agreements allowed quick,\n            extensive changes to be made, which drastically improved\n            project performance). 3) Creating an organizational culture\n            based on participation, open dialogue, team work, client\n            orientation, and the use of total quality management\n            techniques leads to increased productivity. 4) Strong\n            commitment among high government levels has to exist in\n            order for there to be enforceable sub-contracts between\n            government agencies. 5) If the administrative and financial\n            department has weaknesses, it is useful to enlist an\n            internal auditor with experience in Bank procurement\n            procedures. 6) It is crucial to ensure that the terms of\n            reference are well-written, that only qualified consultants\n            are hired, that construction guides and procedural manuals\n            are developed and applied."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
