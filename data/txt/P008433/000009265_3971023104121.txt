PREFACE
This is a completion report of the Fourth Education Project in Greece
(Loan 1539-GR) for which a loan of US$60.0 million was extended to the
Hellenic State in April 1978. No disbursements were made and the Loan was
cancelled as of the original Closing Date of December 31, 1982.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the project
and sent the Project Completion Report to the Borrower and its agencies for
comment in September 1983.  No comments have been received from the Borrower.

THE HELLENIC STATE (GCEECE)
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1539-GR)
PROJECT OOIPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Fourth Education Project (Loan 1539-GR) was intended as the
culmination of the Bank's efforts to assist in modernizing and expanding the
Greek education system, to make it a more effective instrument for economic
development. It was intended to respond to specific manpower needs of the
economy in priority sub-sectors not completely covered by previous projects,
with a heavy emphasis upon the industrial sector which was expected to
become particularly important on the eve of Greece's entry into the European
Economic Community (EEC) (para. 2.05). During project identification,
preparation and appraisal, a basic defect in the formal education system in
Greece was seen as the over-emphasis upon traditional academic studies in
the secondary schools. The major aim of the education development strategy
was to reform the system through strengthening the teaching in science and
vocational subjects and, in general, improving the quality of technical and
vocational education (para. 2.03). The enactment of Law 576 of 1977
covering these reforms was speeded up as project appraisal was made
conditional upon its passage (para. 2.02). The project assisted withz
(a) extension of a new upper secondary level program of vocational and
technical education (KETE);
(b) expansion of the network of post-secondary technical and vocational
institutes (KATE) initiated under the first project and further
extended under the third;
(c) expansion of science and vocational subjects in the lower secondary
school (gymnasium); and
(d) advanced training of secondary education teachers and officials via
a new, specialized institute (SELME).
2.       The loan of US$60.0 million (Loan 1539-GR) was approved in March
1978, to assist with (a) the design, construction, furnishing and equipping
for ten KETEs, four KATEs, and one SELME, (b) provision of instructional
equipment for 40 existing gymnasia and 21 gymnasia under construction.
3.       The Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs' (MOE)
Directorate General for Programing (DGP), assisted by the Directorate of
Implementation of Educational Projects (DIEP), was given the overall
responsibility for implementing all components of the project, which was
complex and geographically scattered, involving some 76 different
institutions throughout the country (para. 3.03). The project was to be
completed by June 1982. However, due to the two year delay in ratification
of the Loan Agreement by Parliament (which required five postponements of



- vi -
the Loan effectiveness date), frequent government changes and institutional
weaknesses, no construction had begun by the Closing Date (paras. 3.04-05).
However, the MOE proceeded with initiating KATE and KETE programs at the
project locations in temporary premises. In 1980/81 the enrollments in the
KATEs were 2,050 and KETEs 29,600 (para. 3.12).
4.       By the original Closing Date (December 31, 1982), none of the Loan
proceeds (US$60.0 million) had been disbursed and the Bank cancelled,
effective December 31, 1982, the entire Loan amount (para. 4.06). Despite
this poor physical implementation record, certain aspects of the project
were successful, notably: (a) the general acceptance of the KATEs and KETEs
into the formal education system in Greece with their valuable contribution,
through improving the quality of technical and vocational education, to
industrial development (para. 1.03); (b) the development of SELME, thus
contributing to modernizing and improving teaching and administration in
secondary education (para. 1.03); (c) the development of functional and
economic architectural designs for the 15 new educational institutions,
including sets of contract documents for each (paras. 3.08-11); (d) the
preparation of furniture and equipment lists, specifications and contract
documents for all 76 project institutions (para. 3.14); and (e) the
institution development of the MOE's implementation agencies; i.e. the
Organization for School Buildings (OSK) and DIEP were reorganized and
strengthened in the last year of the project implementation cycle (para.
3.11). The designs and the contract documents prepared with Bank technical
assistance should help the Government implement the project which it is
committed to do with its own funds.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A Bank Loan (Loan 1539-CR) for US$60.0 million was extended to the
Hellenic State (Greece) in 1978 to assist the Government in completing all
of its educational reforms, in particular improving the quality of
vocational and technical education across a broad spectrum of levels and
types of institutions in order to meet the demand for vocational and
technical manpower that became approved with the proposed entry of Greece
into the European Economic Community.
ii.      The Loan provided financing for the construction and equipping of;
(a) ten vocational and technical education centers (KETEs); (b) four higher
technical and vocational education centers (KATEs); and (c) one school for
advanced training of secondary education teachers and officials (SELME).
Equipment only was also to be provided for 40 existing gymnasia and 21
gymnasia under construction. A total of 76 different institutions were thus
involved in the project. No financing of technical assistance for project
implementation was provided. Technical assistance for curriculum
development and for preparation of equipment lists was financed under the
Third Education Project (Loan 1134-GR). Training abroad of technical and
vocational teachers was financed by UNDP.
iii.     The Government recognized as priority the need to reorganize and
reform the education training system, not only to meet the new
socio-economic situation, but also to promote greater equity in regional
access to educational opportunities. The appraisal of the project was made
conditional to the enactment of the technical and vocational education
system reforms. The Education Law 576, that was passed in early 1977, was a
major piece of legislation. It concerned the basic policies of the
technical lyceum and vocational schools (KETEs), the KATEs and the
Vocational Teacher Training Institute and their organization (para 2.02).
iv.      Despite five postponements of the Loan effectiveness date, no
construction has begun on any of the 15 new institutions nor was equipment
procured under the Loan for the 61 gymnasia. Only one of the project's
physical objectives, design of the educational institutions, has been
realized. KATEs and KETEs have been operating at the project locations in
temporary premises. In 1980/81 their enrollments stood at 2,500 and 29,600
respectively. Some 138 KATE teachers attended 13-week specialized training
courses abroad and 10 directors completed one--moth study visits abroad
(para 3.12).
v.       The Loan in its entirety (US$60.0 million) was cancelled on
February 15, 1983, effective as of the original Closing Date, December 31,
1982. No disbursements of the Loan proceeds have been made. The Government
is, however, proceeding with the project and is committed to completing it
with its own funds and considers it of utmost importance in the culmination
of its efforts in the reform and modernization of the school education
system.



- viii -
vi.      The main causes for the lack of success in implementing the
physical components of the project were;
(a) The two year delay in passage of the law in Greece's Parliament
ratifying the Loan Agreement. The difficulties which the
Government in 1978 encountered in ratifying the Loan stem mostly
from the considerable criticism of the Bank's involvement in the
policies of the education sector, originally caused by the
coincident presentation to Parliament of the Amending Agreement for
the Second Education Project (deleting the controversial
Univerisity of Patras), at the time this fourth project was being
negotiated in Washington (February, 1978). Though the law
permitted openings for additional staff positions in the
Organization for School Buildings (OSK), these positions became
available only in mid-1980 (para 3.04).
(b) Although OSK was responsible for almost a decade for constructing
and equipping of all primary and secondary schools in Greece (para.
3.03), the tasks of designing project schools under the first three
Bank education projects were contracted to private architectural
firms. As these firms had performed poorly during the
implementation of these projects, an explicit objective of the
Government and of the fourth project was institution building in
the MOE by reorganizing and strengthening OSK and DIEP (para.
3.03). The institution building was set back by the delayed
approvaL of staff positions in OSK and the slow recruitment of
experienced architects (para 3.06).
(c) The development of designs was slow initially due to the lack of
cooperation between OSK and DIEP and the tardiness is obtaining
approval from the directorates of the MOE responsible for the
educational aspects of the project institutions (para. 3.03). As
much as 302 of the delay in finalizing construction designs is
attributable to design changes due to changes in space allocation
at the request of the MOE and to energy saving measures decreed
government-wide (para 3.05).
vii.     Bank supervision missions were aware of these problems and took all
possible steps to bring their concern to the knowledge of the Greek
authorities concerned (para 3.06). Bank senior staff raised this point at
every Country Implementation Review (CIR): in December 1978, August 1979,
and again in August 1980, as well as during the Annual Meetings. The
representatives of the monitoring unit in the Ministry of National Economy
attended the Country Review Meeting in Washington in February 1981 and were
fully alerted to the steps required to improve implementation performance.
At this time and again in December, 1981, the Government was informed that
unless agreed implementation targets were agreed, the Bank would not
consider favorably any request to extend the Closing Date. Even this effort
failed to bring needed results as there was inadequate follow-up by the



lx -
monitoring unit with the MOE's Directorate of Implementation of Education
Projects (para 3.19). In December 1982, senior Bank staff mission informed
the Government that because of the lack of implementation progress their
view was that the Bank should reaffirm its intention not to postpone the
December 31, 1982 Closing Date.
viii.    The physical aspects of the project as a whole were poorly
implemented, although MDE began scheduled operations of the project schools
at project locations in temporary premises, procuring essential equipment
from its own budget. It was intended by the Bank to have sites selected and
acquired and preliminary designs and lists of equipment completed by Loan
signing date in order to avoid the delays suffered by the previous Bank
education projects in Greece. In fact, these activities did not start until
after the Loan was signed. None of the project's civil works or equipment
contracts were tendered before the Closing Date. Should the project be
completed in 1987 as presently envisioned, the project implementation period
will have been 9.75 years compared with the 4.75 years expected at
appraisal. The resultant cost overrun of the project would likely be about
US$67.3 million over the appraisal estimate of US$123.5 million, or a 54Z
cost overrun due to successive drachma devaluations (para 4.02).
Conclusions
ix.      Although the initiation of the project gave impetus to the
Government to enact speedily a principal piece of legislation concerning
policies and organization of vocational and technical education system, it
was overly optimistic to expect rapid ratification of the Loan Agreement in
the face of criticism of the Bazk's involvement in Greece.
X.       The ministerial objective of institution-building of OSX, in tandem
with project implementation, has been slow to achieve. Although the OSK was
reorganized and strengthened through the project, difficulties in hiring
experienced architects and other constraints resulted in significant
delays. The project, which was complex in its content, was not implemented
satisfactorily.
xi.      None of the 15 new institutions in the project was constructed
and/or equipped. However, the preparation of functional and economic
architectural designs for these new institutions and equipment contract
documents will greatly aid the Government in implementing the project.
Also, the project's belated success in institution-building at OSK and DIEP,
should significantly contribute to implementation capacity for future
government projects in the sector (para 3.11).
xii.     The technical institutions which will now be built with the
Government's own funds will reinforce this movement of change and provide
the economy with much-needed manpower at the technician and skilled-worker
levels.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report, prepared by Mr. J.E. Kulski (consultant architect/
planner) and division staff, is a completion review of the Fourth Education
Project in Greece financed through Loan 1539-CR in April 1978. The First
Bank Education Project (Loan 711-GR), introduced into Greece the concept of
a diploma level, multi-disciplinary technical institution (KATE) offering
specialized instruction in agriculture, business, engineering, food
processing and health. This project was innovative and the concept of the
KATE has caught on so strongly that there still is an overwhelming student
demand for entry into these institutions. Extension of the KATE program was
further assisted by the Third and Fourth Projects.
1.02     The Second Education Project (Loan 859-GR), provided for an
upgrading in the quality of instruction in primary schools through the
consolidation of the existing primary teacher training system with a
reformed curriculum. In addition, the Bank widened its activities beyond
the Ministry of Education (MOE) in this project and provided assistance in
meeting manpower requirements in agriculture, industry, the merchant marine,
and tourism at skilled worker and technician levels. A further
break-through in the reform of the Greek education system were realized in
the Third Education Project (Loan 1134-GR). This project included, on an
experimental basis, 10 multilateral upper secondary schools (POSME) which
provided for the juxtaposition of academic and technical "streams" on the
same campus with common facilities notably administrative, scientific and
technical.
1.03     With the inclusion of the advanced secondary school admini-
strator/teacher training center (SELME) and of the integrated technical
lyceum and vocational school (KETE) in the Fourth Education Project, all of.
the major educational reform measures identified at the beginning of the
Bank's operations in the education sector in Greece were realized, with the
exception of those referencing the university system. The main result of
the reform is that, the technical education system has been greatly expanded
and modernized--with regard to vocational training centers, new secondary
technical.vocational (KETE) schools, and in post-secondary diploma technical
institutes (KATE). The transformation of the Greek education system is due
to the emergence on the Greek education scene of progressive educators and
administrators who were willing to break with tradition and to experiment
with modern educational concepts, and in part to the Bank-initiated dialogue
on the need for such actions.
1.04     The completion study was carried out through a review of records
and reports available in the Bank, through discussions with Bank staff
involved with the project and through discussions with officials in the MOE
responsible for project implementation. Expected outcomes of project
implementation were reviewed against achievements planned at the time of
appraisal, taking into consideration that (the entire Loan was cancelled or
"no disbursements were made") and before construction or equipment
procurement had begun. Completion will be with government funds. The
review thus concentrates on issues and conditions that led to the serious
implementation problems and delays.

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Formulation and Objectives of the Project
2.01     In May and October 1976 Bank missions identified a project designed
to continue and complement the educational reforms implemented under the
first three education projects (Loans 711, 859 and 1134-GR), notably by
improving the country's education and training capabilities in vocational
and technical education at all levels. The project was prepared in
February, and appraised in May-June 1977. Its cost was estimated at
US*123.5 million, with a proposed Bank loan of US$60.0 million. During
appraisal, the project was expanded to include the construction and
equipping of an advanced training school for secondary education teachers
and administrators, on the basis of a satisfactory, feasibility study. The
Educational Materials Production Center and the training vessels for the
Merchant Marine Training Directorate were not included in the project.
Furthermore, the equipping of a further two merchant marine officers'
schools was deleted because of the reported, five-year delay in construction
of similar schools to be equipped under the second project (Loan 859-GR)
which had led to the transfer of the equipment to other institutions.
2.02     At the time of appraisal, the Greek education system, compared with
that of other developing countries in the region, was considered
quantitatively well developed, but suffering from qualitative weaknesses, in
particular some serious deficiencies in vocational and technical education.
For example, in the lower-level secondary schools (gymnasia), there was
still an over-emphasis upon traditional academic studies. On the other
hand, lower vocational schools were in the process of being phased-out
because they prepared students at too early an age for semi-skilled
employment, without giving them a general education sufficient for their
later re-training. Consequently, the major aim of the Government's
education development strategy at the time of project formulation was to
adapt the whole education system to Greece's manpower requirements by
providing more appropriate opportunities for technical and vocational
education. Appraisal of the project was made conditional to the enactment
of technical and vocational education system reforms. The Education Law 576,
passed in early 1977, was a major piece of legislation. It concerned the
basic policies of the technical lyceum, vocational schools, the KATEs and
the Vocational Teacher Training Institute, and their organization.
2.03     The Fourth Project addressed these reforms in part by supporting a
new concept for Greece, that of a combined technical lyceum and vocational
school (KETE), and in part by extending the Bank's support for additional
post-secondary technician training institutes (KATES). Thus, the project
provided assistance for a qualitative improvement of instruction in
technical and vocational education through support of a major reform.

Socio-Economic Background
2.04     The labor force in 1975 was estimated to be about 3.2 million
people, 37% of whom were employed in agriculture and related activities,
27.8% in industry (19% in manufacturing) and 35.2% in service-related
activities.  The growth of emplv'aent in the various economic sectors
reflected the changes in the str cture of the economic activities of the
country; for example, during 1971-75 employment in agriculture declined
annually on an average by 1.5%, while in the secondary and tertiary sectors
employment increased by 0.7% and 2.0%, respectively.
2.05     At the time of appraisal Greece's industry had been a dynamic
sector of the economy with an annual 10% growth in real terms since 1960.
Its share of GDP increased from 26% in 1965 to 31% in 1971. The economic
trends, combined with ongoing negotiations for Greece's admission into full
membership in the European Economic Community, called for several structural
changes and created certain economic problems not unlike those found in
lower-income developing countries. The combination of rapid economic
expansion and slow population growth resulted in a GNP per capita in 1978 of
about US$2,590 or about twice as large as in 1968. In general, with low
population increases (0.7Z annually), Greece was able to direct its
expanding resources for social services towards qualitative rather than
quantative needs.
2.06     Structural changes were apparent in the labor force.
Non-agricultural employment grew while agricultural jobs fell. Greece's
rapid economic growth and low rate of population increase, assisted by
significant external migration, had combined to reduce non-agricultural
unemployment to the low level of 2.5%. Although there was, and still is, a
large rural manpower reserve, these rural workers lacked the skills
necessary for work in the rapidly-growing, technologically-oriented sectors
of the economy. Consequently, labor supply in the most rapidly growing
sectors--industry and services--was tight and would remain so unless
appropriate training or retraining facilities were developed in the spirit
of the Education reform.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
3.01     At appraisal, preliminary designs, equipment lists and site
acquisition were scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1978; project
implementation was scheduled to be completed by March 31, 1982; and the
Loan disbursed by December 31, 1982. Delays in ratification of the Loan
Agreement by Parliament had a serious effect upon project implementation
by delaying timely provision of additional design staff for the
Organization for School Buildings (OSK) and adequate local funds. The
difficulties which the Borrower met in ratifying the Loan stem mostly from
the considerable political criticism of the Bank's involvement in the
policies of the education sector, originally caused by the presentation to
Parliament of the Amending Agreement for the Second Education Project
(deleting the University of Patras), at the time this fourth project was
being negotiated. In addition, it took much longer to obtain the support
for the Government's education reform program than originally envisaged.
Cabinet level approval for the Loan Agreement was obtained only in late
1979 and the draft law of ratification was not introduced and passed by
Parliament until mid-1980. It was only then that additional staff for OSK
and the project implementation unit were appointed.
3.02     Added to the delays brought about by the slow passage of the
ratification law, was the impact of a major earthquake and repairs to
existing educational institutions. The terminal date of Loan
effectiveness was postponed five times (initially to December 1978, then
to May 1979, November 1979, May 1980 and finally to October 1980).
Construction of buildings and installation of equipment is now expected to
begin in 1984 (Chart 1). Consequently, actual implementation is now
expected to take 9-3/4 years, as compared with 4-3/4 years estimated at
appraisal; the regional average for the education sector is nine years and
the average for Bank-financed education projects in Greece is ten years.
3.03     At appraisal, it was decided to entrust all physical design work
(up to and including final construction drawings) to OSK an autonomous
body reporting directly to the Minister of Education (Chart 2) which for
almost a decade had been responsible for constructing and equipping of all
primary and secondary schools. By 1976, OSK had 209 full time employees
and it was agreed that further reinforcement (11 architects, 2 mechanical
and electrical engineers, and 12 other design support staff) would take
place to accommodate the fourth project. The DIEP--the project
implementation unit of the MOE under the general directorate responsible
for planning and programming, would be responsible for actual procurement
of civil works and for site-level supervision. It would also be
appropriately reinforced to ensure appropriate inputs to educational
specifications of buildings and of equipment as well as to provide advice
on software aspects. The general directorates responsible for training,
for general education (special secondary schools) and for
technical/vocational education would each appoint liaison officers to work
with OSK and DIEP. Thus, arrangements for project implementation were
based on existing organizational responsibilities with appropriate
reinforcement.



-6-
Project Management Performance
3.04     Parliamentary approval (para 3.02) required to increase OSK's
payroll took considerable time and once obtained it proved difficult to
recruit experienced staff because of OSK terms and conditions of
employment. Collaboration by the general directorates of the MOE in
regard to educational specification of facilities and preparation of
equipment lists was weak and intermittent. Although the Loan Agreement
and a supplemental letter had adequately addressed the staffing and
organizational arrangements for project implementation, they proved
difficult to implement (Annex 4).
3.05     Delay in appointing experienced staff to OSK tended itself to
delay the finalization construction plans and preparation of tender
documents. Construction procurement was the critical path of the project,
and incurred the major delay. As much as 30X of this delay is
attributable to design modifications due to changes in space allocation
(at the request of the MOE) and to energy saving measures decreed
government-wide.
3.06     Bank supervision missions were aware of these problems and took
all possible steps to bring their concern to the knowledge of the Greek
authorities involved. The missions continuously urged the Borrower to
(a) ratify the Loan Agreement;
(b) strengthen OSK and DIEP in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement; and
(c) expedite design of buildings and preparation of equipment lists.
Sites
3.07     All sites had been selected at appraisal and site surveys and
acquisition were expected to be completed by Loan signing. However, there
remained risks involved in obtaining the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
rulings and Presidential decrees required before selected sites could in
fact be assigned to project institutions. Acquiring all 15 sites proved
to be time consuming (Chart 1). One site, at Mytilini, was selected
without adequate technical survey. Another site at Lamia, was
requisitioned by the Air Force and a new site had to be selected. These
two sites still present problems and the Government is considering
deletion of these institutions from the project.
Design
3.08     An explicit objective of the project was to increase the school
design and construction implementation capacity of MOE by reorganizing and
strengthening OSK and DIEP. This approach was all the more reasonable in
that private architectural firms had performed poorly during implementa-
tion of three previous education projects (Loans 711, 859 and 1134-GR).



-7-
3.09     The designs of the KATEs, the KETEs and the SELME were all
prepared by OSK staff architects. Each institution was given to a
different architect, consequently each project design is different and the
quality of design is uneven. There was initially no attempt to develop a
standardized approach and specification for each type of institution.
3.10     OSK architects were also handicapped initially in their design
work by the fact that the architect's briefs were generally insufficient,
additional inputs in the design process were to be made by the general
directorates of the MOE (para 3.03) but their participation was seldom
timely and approval of designs frequently delayed.
3.11     However, after continued insistence from the Bank, OSK and DIEP
were reorganized and strengthened in the last year of the project
implementation cycle and there has been a considerable improvement in
design work thereafter. These designs and tender documents should help
the Government carry the project forward. Thus, although the
institution-building objective was achieved late in the Bank's involvement
with the project, the project's contribution to school building and
construction in Greece may turn out to be positive.
Interim Measures
3.12     MOE has not let the delays in construction prevent opening KATEs
and KETEs in temporary premises at the locations in the fourth project.
In 1980/81, the enrollments were respectively 2,050 and 29,6000.
Furthermore, some 138 KATE teachers attended 13-week training courses
abroad, and 10 school directors completed one month study visits abroad.
Furniture and Equipment
3.13     According to Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement, representatives of
KEME, the General Directorate of Vocational and Technical Education and
the General Directorate of General Education were responsible for
supervising the preparation of furniture and equipment lists and for
setting up expert teams as necessary for that purpose.
3.14     The total cost of furniture and equipment, inclusive of
contingencies, was estimated at appraisal at about US$48.0 million. It
was envisioned at appraisal that equipment lists would be prepared by
consultants. The British Council prepared equipment lists in the new
course offerings in the KATEs and KETEs. The Government proposed that the
lists for existing course offerings be prepared by MOE teachers based on
their experience with existing equipment. After some delay arising out of
payments to teachers under civil service regulations, some 32 working
groups were appointed by the MOE. Technical assistance was also provided
by Bank supervision missions. Lists of equipment and specifications both
for the institution under the third and fourth Education Projects have
been completed. However, with the delay in construction, no urgency was
felt in completing the lists. Consequently, the lists, specifications and
tender documents, which were to take 1-3/4 years to complete, thus took
5-112 years (Chart 1).



-8-
Covenants
3.15     Key covenants were only partly implemented.  In particular
sections 3.01(b) and 3.04(b) and paras. 4 and 5 of Schedule 5, to the Loan
Agreement specified that: (a) the functions set forth in Schedule 5 be
performed in accordance with a time-table satisfactory to both parties;
(b) sites be acquired as needed; (c) adequate numbers of qualified staff
be provided within OSK; and (d) liaison officers be appointed by the
operating departments to DIEP and OSK to provide educational
specifications.
Bank Performance
3.16     Prior to Loan signing, the project was identified, prepared and
appraised by six Bank missions (Basic Data Sheet). The preparation effort
was intensive and totaled some 135 man-days. During negotiations the
Secretary General of the Ministry of Coordination expressed appreciation
of this and proposed to senior Bank staff that Greece continue to have
such access to Bank technical assistance.
3.17     Subsequent to Loan signing, the project was supervised by 12 Bank
missions (Basic Data Sheet) and there was reasonable staff continuity.
The supervision effort was extensive, totalling some 162.5 man-days, or an
average of 36 man-days per year. Bank supervision missions, fully aware
of implementation problems encountered by DIEP and OSK, took all possible
steps to bring their concern to the knowledge of the Greek authorities
concerned. Bank senior staff brought this concern up at every Joint
Problem Project Review; in December 1978, August 1979 and again in August
1980, as well as during the Annual Meetings. The representatives of the
monitoring unit in the Ministry of National Economy attended the Country
Review Meeting in Washington in February 1981 and were made fully aware by
senior Bank staff of the steps required to improve implementation
performance. Even this effort failed to bring needed results as there was
inadequate follow-up by the monitoring unit with the MOE's Directorate of
Implementation of Education Projects. The Government, while disappointed
with the Bank's decision to cancel the Loan, expressed satisfaction with
the Bank's implementation assistance in general and with the technical
assistance and institution-building efforts in particular.
3.18     Overall, the Bank and the Government seem to have developed good
relations. The difficulties which arose with design, sites and equipment
lists were beyond the control of the Bank.

IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Capital Cost
4.01     The project cost was estimated at appraisal to be US$123.5
million. However, the project will now not be completed until 1987
(Chart 1) and it is estimated that the final cost may be as high as
US$190.0 million, an overrun in USS equivalent of about 54% (Annex 4).
4.02     This increase in the total project cost is mainly due to (a) the
doubling of the period of implementation estimated at appraisal; and
(b) the unanticipated inflation rate in Greece during 1978-82, the effects
of which until very recently exceeded the benefits of successive drachma
devaluations. During the period between appraisal and completion, the
cost of construction in drachmas has increased at the rate of about 20%
annually. Appraisal and completion estimates are summarized in the
following table;

There is general conformity of unit area per student place between appraisal
estimates and designs due, chiefly to Government's wish to avoid the cost
overruns suffered by previous Bank education projects, and to the Bank's close
monitoring of the design process.
Unit Cost Per Student Place
4.04     The estimated unit cost per student place covers all expenditures
including contingencies and professional fees and is based on the present
implementation schedule (Chart 1). Given the quality and quantity of the
educational spaces and the furniture and equipment which will be provided,
they are reasonable. Unit costs per place are estimated approximately as
follows:
