The main objectives will be to support: a)\n            required changes in financial sector legislation, and\n            regulations, to facilitate strengthening of bank\n            supervision, and deposit insurance, and, to promote\n            efficient resolution of banks facing financial solvency\n            problems; b) the institutional capacity strengthening of the\n            Superintendency of Banks, and the Bank Deposit Insurance and\n            Resolution Agency for Financial Institutions, entity\n            responsible for deposit insurance, and bank resolution; c)\n            restructuring, re-capitalization, privatization, and, if\n            necessary, liquidation of state-owned, and\n            \"officialized\" banks, currently under public\n            sector management; and, d) effective implementation of\n            special measures to address the immediate impact on the\n            financial system, stemming from economic, or other\n            emergencies. Co-financing is expected from the\n            Inter-American Development Bank, and, the Corporacion Andina\n            de Fomento, to support the financial sector reform program.\n            There are risks affecting the transition of the financial\n            system, though the proposed program emphasizes that,\n            financial structural reforms, and efficient resolution of\n            credit institutions, will help minimize the risks of a\n            systemic crisis."}, "docdt": "1999-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
