of the Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Operation Project for Colombia was highly\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was high, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. The lessons learned indicated that\n            ample preparatory work is needed, in particular analysis of\n            the sector is critical to the success of the loan. In the\n            case of the financial sector adjustment loan, the Government\n            had already started to prepare analysis of the financial\n            sector problems with assistance from the Bank technical\n            assistance loan. Strong Government commitment to the program\n            along with high quality officials involved in the\n            implementation was instrumental in the positive outcome.\n            Some reforms of the financial system do not involve the\n            passage of legislation. Greater attention to market needs\n            and familiarity with new financial instruments is important\n            to the success of any new initiative. The Policy Based\n            Guarantee, having benefited from the Government's\n            compliance with the first tranche of the loan, was\n            implemented under an already sound policy platform."}, "docdt": "2002-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
