The following lessons of broader relevance\n            emerge from the experience of this project: 1) The Bank\n            should be very cautious in pursuing experimental or\n            innovative solutions to institutional problems in small\n            countries with little potential for attracting foreign\n            investors and with limited capacity to design, negotiate and\n            supervise complex contractual arrangements with private\n            investors. 2) The Bank should have been more proactive in\n            the gas sector, given the close interdependency between gas\n            and power. The macroeconomic loss to Yemen from almost a\n            decade's delay in developing its gas resources for\n            power generation (independent of any other losses from\n            non-utilization of gas in other sectors and/or exports) runs\n            into hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bank could have\n            done a better job in advising and assisting the Government\n            to expedite gas development for power independently of the\n            export schemes for liquefied natural gas that the Government\n            was primarily interested in. 3) Energy loss reduction and\n            capacity building programs should always be included in\n            Bank's power projects seeking to improve the\n            performance of power utilities. They are often slow to yield\n            results but there is no substitute for institutional\n            strengthening in order to achieve better utility\n            performance. In the case of this project, a diagnosis of the\n            Public Electricity Corporation's weakness with no\n            provision for addressing them was clearly inadequate. 4)\n            State support to oil refining should not impose unreasonable\n            burdens on the electric power sector and should be dealt\n            with separately from power sector finances."}, "docdt": "2005-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
