Annex D
Minutes from Meeting
Concerning Public Consultation






SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
Public Consultations - Proposal for Approach
According to the World Banks procedures for Environmental Assessment (EA), views of
affected groups and local NGO's (nongovernmental organisations) have to be taking fully into
account in the project design and implementation and in particular in the preparation of the EA.
The purpose of taking the views of the affected people into account is to improve project
viability.
With respect to the said project, it is proposed to perform public consultations on two levels: on
local community level and on NGO level. The local community level and contact persons have
to be defined in coorporation with PEC. CBI has further developed a list of relevant local
NGO's, which should be included in the consultations
It is further proposed to present the following issues and questions on public consultation
meetings:
1.    Presentation of the project concept: rehabilitation of existing plant and expansion with
an additional plant of 30 MW. Advantages will be improved power supply including
improved supply stability and potential possibilities for local employment. Potential
disadvantages could be increased impact from air pollution (exhaust gasses) and
problems with increased noise levels in case environmental mitigation measures are
not considered.
2.    Clarifying questions for the project, if any.
3.    Questions for public consultations: Which impact has been experienced during the
previous periods of plant operations. Positive and negative.
4.    Which potential impact are expected caused by the present project?

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
ASSESSMENT
Impacts on water quality at Dhahban Power Plant
The following sections provides an assessment of environmental impact related to downwards
infiltration of reject water from the demineralisation process and oil polluted waste water from
the identified non-lined underground reservoir.
The rejected water from the demineralisation process contains the following chemical products
Na2S205
NaOH
H2SO4
Calciumhypoclorite 68%
NaOH and H2SO4 are very strong basic and acidic chemicals and should not be discharged
before the pH value has been neutralised. The practise of discharging without neutralising will
kill vegetation and potential bacteria existing in the subsurface.
Only sparse detailed and contradicting information has been available, especially regarding the
geology/hydrogeology very close to the discharge area, the amount of waste oil discharged and
the period of discharging polluted water. These parameters have therefore been estimated to
obtain a conservative evaluation of the groundwater contamination risk.
The relevant borehole profiles describing the geology in the area are listed in table 2 (section
4.3 of this report). From the 1:5,000 maps obtained, the ground level of the underground
reservoir is approximately 2,225 m.a.s.l. A conservative estimate of the geological sequence
below the seepage hole is believed to be basalt tuff from 2,160-2,225 m.a.s.l., and Tawilah
sandstone from <1,960-2,160 m.a.s.l..
As shown in table 2, the static water level in the area is situated in approximately 2,100 m.a.s.l.,
which means that the groundwater level below the reservoir is situated approx. 125 m below
the ground surface.
Transport in the unsaturated zone
The following example is based on a number of preconditions which had to be made in order to
be able to prepare rough calculations on the identified problem.
The contaminated water is expected to enter the unsaturated zone at a depth of 25 m below the
surface, believed to be the bottom of the reservoir hole. Quantities of oil and water discharged
have been estimated to Qwater _ 1,500 m3/year, Qlubicating oil = 10 m3/year and Qdiesel fuel
= 1,2 m3/year, for the last two years. As the oil discharge period is not known exactly, a four
and seven year period of discharging oil has also been taken into account.
The transport of contaminated water from the reservoir to the saturated Tawilah sandstone
aquifer is conservatively estimated, i.e. oil degradation, retardation and dispersion processes are
Impacts on water quality at Dhahban Power Plant                       Page: I



SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
not included. Furthermore, impermeable and semi-impermeable geological layers are not taken
into account, allowing the oil contaminated water to seep directly and only vertically
downwards. This approximation is very conservative, but is used due to the lack of detailed
information, and to assess if a conservative approximation will exceed the WHO standard
guidelines.
Although oil compounds are virtually insoluble in water, they contain constituents that are
sufficiently soluble to impact flavour, odour and healthiness of water. The solubility depend on
the compound and Danish research has determined that fuel oil has a solubility of 5-12 mg/l
and gasoline 180-320 mg/L. The maximum depth of penetration of the heavier oil compounds
can be estimated from the following equation (ref. 14):
D= IOOOV/(AxRxk)
where D is the maximum depth of penetration of the less soluble oil, m
V is volume of infiltration oil, m3
A is the area of infiltration, m2
R is the retention capacity of the soil, l/m3
k is an approximate correction factor for various oil viscosities.
Yemeni authorities are not certain how long waste oil has been discharged into the reservoir
and do not have the information on the amounts of lubricating/diesel oil which have been
discharged into the spillway system. The area of infiltration was stated to be 2 m x 2 m = 4 m2
by the company who constructed the reservoir. From the site visit, it was not possible to
observe the surface area of the pit, as it was covered by gravel/garbage. In table 6, the
maximum depth of penetration has been calculated using equations for a period of 2, 4 and 7
years of discharging oil and the parameters R = 25 1/ m3, k = 1 and A =4 i2.
2 Years    4 Years    7 Years
Estimated oil discharged (mIn)          22     X   60          100
Max. depth of penetration (m)          220         600        1000
Oil reaching the groundwater (mi)       12         50          90
Table 1.  Maximum penetration, amount and spread after 2, 4 and 7 years of waste oil
discharged to the reservoir.
The results in table 6 show that with only 2 years of discharging oil the penetration depth
exceeds the depth to the groundwater (as oil is lighter than water the real max. depth of
penetration will be approximately above the watertable). The amount of oil to reach the
saturated water table has been calculated as the estimated oil discharge subtracted the amount
retained in the unsaturated zone. The applied equation does not take into consideration that the
upper volcanic tuff layer may very well be stratified with layers of high and low permeabilities
(as it is observed to be in the surface, see photograph no.: 36). This will reduce the maximum
penetration depth, as the oil will tend to spread more horizontally in the high permeable zones.
The penetration depth and amounts of heavy oil compounds reaching the water table may
therefore be very conservatively estimated but can not be rejected with the present data
Impacts on water quality at Dhahban Power Plant                      Page: 2



SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
available. In case vertical fractures exist, the transport is faster and the retention lower than
otherwise assumed.
The most mobile and health hazardous compounds are the lightest components contained in the
lubricate/diesel oil, such as benzene, toluene and m/p/o-xylene. The highest concentrations of
these light components are contained in the diesel fuel. Typical concentrations in diesel oil are
(in weight percent); benzene 0,02-0,1%, toluene 0,07% and m/p-xylene 0,07%. Concentrations
of these compounds in lubricating oils are normally much lower and may be ignored.
Estimating 100 I/month discharged diesel fuel (from cleaning filters, loading/unloading fuel-
tanks etc.), this amount will contain approx. 1200 1/year x 0,925 kg/l x 0,1 % = 1,11 kg
benzene pr. year.
The potential amount of dissolved benzene in the discharged water would then be
1,1 1kg benzen/1500 m3 water = 740 jg benzene/l, which is below the potential solubility of
820-1,780 mg/l.
Transport in the saturated zone
The results presented in table 6 show that the less volatile compounds of the present oil spill
may penetrate the unsaturated zone and reach the surface of the groundwater. If the oil reaches
the surface of the saturated zone, and if its volume is large enough, it will migrate laterally in
the same direction as the groundwater and may eventually reach and pollute the abstraction
wells. Table 6 shows the potential amounts of oil available to migrate on top of the water table.
Some of the oil will be retained in the sandstone, but with the expected fractured nature of the
sandstone and the normally high water saturation of the sandstone matrix above the water table,
this amount may be rather low.
A very conservative estimate is to assume that all the oil penetrating to the saturated aquifer is
transported to the nearest domestic well. Assuming the yearly discharged amount of oil to be 15
m3/year (averaged over 4 years) and the yearly abstracted water of one well to be 438,000
m3/year, the maximum oil contamination of the abstracted water may be calculated as
15 m3/year (oil)/ 438,000 m3/year (water) = 34 ppm
This value is extremely conservative as especially the oil retention capacity of the sandstone
and the biodegradation is not taken into account and the real value may be much lower. It has
not been possible to obtain WHO guideline values on oil products in drinking water, but
Danish guidelines are maximum 10 ppb, i.e. the potential concentrations in the abstraction well
downstream would be up to 3,400 times higher than max. recommended concentrations.
The total amount of benzene to enter the saturated zone dissolved in water is conservatively
estimated to be 1.lkg/year. Estimating the porosity of the aquifer at 20%, the groundwater
gradient at 0,18 mn/m, and the permeability at 1,85 m/d, the benzene may reach the wells ST6
and ST 12 within one year. Assuming that all the benzene will reach one well and averaging the
annual abstraction of one well to 1,200 m3/day - 4.4E+05 m3/year, the benzene concentration
in the abstracted water would be l.lE+09 jig / 4.4E+05 m3/year = 2.5 jg/l benzene. This
Impacts on water quality at Dhahban Power Plant                     Page: 3



SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
estimation is extremely conservative and does not take biodegradation, retardation and
dispersion into account, but it still does not exceed the WHO guideline values of max. 10 jg/l
benzene in drinking water.
The cooling water well however is situated only 60m from the underground reservoir and is
only abstracting a limited amount of water, which makes the potential benzene concentration
much higher. Considering the amount of abstracted water to be of the magnitude 5,000 m3/year
including water for cooling water, domestic purposes, irrigation etc., the water may, as a very
conservative approximation, contain benzene concentrations of up to 220j±g/l which exceeds
the WHO guidelines. A less conservative estimation has in this case been made taking into
account the known content of sulphate in the groundwater, using the BIOSCREEN program
(ref. 15) to simulate chemical reaction. Assuming that 2% of the S04 content (initial SO4: 225
mg/l SO4 in water sample in ST12 (ref. 16)) is contributing to reduce the benzene,
BIOSCREEN shows that no benzene will reach the cooling water well. This approach may be
applied as it is still very conservative, not taking into account retardation, and microbiological
decay in the saturated zone, and no retention, microbiological decay and chemical reactions in
the unsaturated aquifer.

TOR - Study for final disposal of
waste oil and other oily waste






SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
TOR - Project Proposal
Country:           Yemen
Proposed Title:    Waste oil handling on power plants in Yemen, present
amountlroutines and existing/future options for final disposal
1. Background
The Public Electricity Corporation of Yemen (PEC) is a state owned enterprise with an overall
responsibility for all issues related electrical power production in Yemen.
An integrated part of the electricity power production is the production of various waste products,
including used lubricating oil and oily waste from various sources i.e. oily waste water. In the past
and at present, various options have been used for handling waste oil products, including
temporary storage, local combustion in saunas and small-scale industry or direct disposal or
storage in the ground. A large part of the waste oil products are also disposed into the
environment by the uncontrolled outlet of oil polluted waste water.
This lack of environmentally sound options for proper final disposal of waste oil has proved to
constitute a significant risk of causing environmental impacts on natural resources in Yemen. One
of the consequences is that toxic chemical compounds in the waste oil seriously threaten the
quality of the vulnerable and limited drinking water resources.
These serious environmental problems are by no means restricted to the power production sector,
but constitute a general problem on a national level. Due to the overall lack of options for proper
final waste oil disposal, all industries and other enterprises producing these types of waste
products have to identify their own ways and means to solve the problems for final disposal.
Many of these local "solutions" have later tumed out to entail serious environmental risks and
damages.
The present project aims to identify proper solutions for handling waste oil problems within the
electricity sector of Yemen. By using one sector as a pilot project, the main problems can be
identified and solved, thereby serving as a national example and guideline for establishment of
sustainable national solutions for this problem. As a second phase of the project, implementation
of proposed measures will be considered.
2. Project Objectives
The overall development objective of the project is to protect vulnerable environmental resources
including ground water resources, by improving methods and means for handling and final
disposal of waste oil in Yemen.

SANA 'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
The immediate project objective is to identify sustainable methods for handling and treatment of
waste oil products within the power production sector of Yemen based on evaluation and
assessment of present produced amount of waste oil, present handling routines and existing
options/alternative options for final disposal and treatment.
3. Project Approach
The project is proposed to be carried out as a basic fact-finding and feasibility study. Based on a
field visit for identification of baseline data and discussions with involved authorities and other
institutions, draft proposals will be given for implementation of new strategies for handling and
disposal of waste oil within the operational section of PEC. The data and information obtained
during the project for environmental assessment of the Sana'a Emergency Power Project will be
utilised in widest possible extent.
The ultimate target group will be the general management of PEC. National environmental
authorities within Yemen will be kept informed about findings and conclusions of the study.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
TOR - Project Proposal
Country:           Yemen
Proposed Title:    Sana'a Emergency Power Project - Remediation of Oil
Contamination
1     Project Justification
The proposed project addresses a serious risk of oil contamination in the groundwater resource
supplying Sana'a City - the capital of Yemen - with drinking water.
The risk to the groundwater resource was identified during the environmental assessment of the
Sana'a Emergency Power Project funded by the World Bank.
The Dhahban Power Plant is located in the Sana'a Basin approximately 10 km north-west of
Sana'a city centre. The Tawilah sandstone aquifer underlying the Dhahban area is an important
groundwater resource and the main source of drinking water to Sana' a city. According to the
Environmental Assessment Report waste oil has been discharged into an underground reservoir
at the site of the Dhahban Power Plant. This malpractice has been conducted for minimum two
years, and this has led to a serious threat of oil contamination migrating to the underlying
groundwater resource.
At present there is no knowledge about the actual extent of the oil contamination including
whether the oil has already reached the groundwater table.
It is the aim of the proposed project first of all to investigate and delineate the possible
contamination at the underground reservoir for oil waste, and to assess the risk to the
groundwater resource. If according to the risk assessment the contamination poses a risk to the
groundwater resource the necessary remedial measures will be undertaken.
Thus the proposed project will serve to clarify the situation and ensure that the risk of oil
contamination is eliminated. This will primarily benefit the population of Sana'a. As a
secondary benefit it should be mentioned that the project includes a certain degree of transfer of
know how with respect to soil investigations, soil remediation and groundwater monitoring.
2     Development Objective
The development objective of the proposed project is to ensure good water quality in the
domestic water supply of Sana'a - the capital of Yemen

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
3     Immediate Objectives
The proposed project is divided into four phases. Phase I consists of initial site investigations
and a detailed risk assessment of the oil contamination with respect to the groundwater
resource. Phase II encompasses additional investigations, pilot tests and identification and
evaluation of potential clean-up methods. Phase m contains selection of clean-up method, and
design and implementation of the clean-up. Phase IV is a monitoring period. The initiation of
Phase II and III depend on the results of the risk assessment in Phase I. In case the risk to the
groundwater resource is minimal the project will continue directly with Phase IV, monitoring.
The immediate objectives are:
Phase I
To delineate the oil contamination and to assess the risk to the groundwater resource.
Phase II
To determine and select the most appropriate clean-up method.
Phase III
To eliminate that oil contaminated percolate generated at the site of the Dhahban Power Plant
will reach the deep groundwater aquifer and contaminate the groundwater above the target
levels.
Phase IV
To ensure that proper actions can be taken in due time in case of incomplete clean-up or
unforeseen migration of oil contamination at the Dhahban Power Plant leading to oil
concentrations in the groundwater above the target levels.
4     Outputs

5     Activities
Phase I
The activities in Phase I include design and execution of investigations of the oil contamination
at the Dhahban Power Plant. The investigations will consist of 3 drillings to a depth of
minimum 35 metres. During drilling soil samples will be taken and analysed for content of oil
components using a portable GC-PID and a PID. These measurements will be supplemented by
the use of test kits. All soil samples will be described geologically and selected samples will be
tested with respect to permeability, content of organic matter and water.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
In selected drillings screens will be installed and through these screens soil vapours will be
exhaled and tested for content of oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane and volatile oil components.
From the existing well located between the main road and the Dhahban Power plant, and from
the municipal abstraction well located in the near proximity of the power plant, series of water
samples will be taken and analysed for content of oil components. The samples will be taken
before and during a low yield pumping period.
The results of the investigations will be evaluated and a risk assessment will be prepared.
Phase I is expected to have a duration of 3-4 months.
The activities in Phase I is proposed under the assumption that the necessary equipment can be
imported to Yemen and re-exported without problems or delay.
Phase II
Phase II consists of-further investigations in order to delineate the contamination more
precisely. These investigations will only be carried out in case the investigations in Phase I did
not provide a sufficient picture of the contamination for designing the clean-up.
Providing that the soil conditions favour in situ remediation an in situ remediation test will be
executed.
Finally the potential remediation methods will be evaluated and ranked.
Phase II is expected to have a duration of 3-4 months.
Phase III
The remediation project proposed in Phase II will be designed and implemented.
The exact activities cannot be detailed at this point, but the alternative remediation methods to
be evaluated include the following:
In Situ Soil Vapour Extraction
Extraction of oil contaminated soil vapours from the contaminated soil in the unsaturated zone.
In Situ Steam Ventilation
Injection of steam in the contaminated zone combined with extraction of oil contaminated soil
vapours.
Application of Organic Release Compound®
Injection or in well installation of ORC. ORC is a product which when in contact with moisture
releases oxygen.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
The design and clean-up activities in Phase III may last from less than one year to three years.
Phase IV
Phase IV will commence by preparation of a monitoring programme.
The exact activities in the monitoring programme cannot be detailed at present as they will
depend on the outcome of the risk assessment in Phase I and the optional remediation project in
Phase Ill.
It is anticipated that the activities will include regular collection and analyses of water samples
from the existing well at the site over a period of minimum 2 years.
6     Strategy
For this project a phased approach is proposed. Thus the entire project is divided into four
phases:
Phase I Soil investigations and risk assessment.
Phase II     Supplementary Investigations and in situ remediation tests.
Phase m      Design and implementation of remedial measures.
Phase IV     Monitoring.
Phase I
Phase I will be commenced by a pre-visit to the power plant, in order to prepare the
investigations and to make the necessary arrangements with local contractors and local
consultants.
The points to be addressed by the investigations in phase I include (1) the types and quantities
of oil products released; (2) the extent of the contamination and pathways for further
movement; (3) is the oil sorbed to the soil, present as NAPL (Non Aquarius Phase Liquid), in
vapour phase or dissolved in perched groundwater.
The proposed design of the investigations in Phase I includes execution of 3 drillings. The
investigations will commence with a drilling in the close proximity of the underground
reservoir used for discharging waste oil. It is expected that the maximum penetration depth of
the oil can be determined through this drilling. Thus the drilling will be extended until
uncontaminated soil layers are reached, and the results will show the vertical extent of the
contamination. The subsequent drillings will be located in the circumference of the
underground waste oil reservoir. The precise location of each of these drillings will be
determined on the basis of the progressive investigation results in order to delineate the lateral
extent of the contamination.
TOR - Remediation of Oil Contamination                                       Page: 5



SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
The drillings will be screened. The well design will depend on e.g. presence of perched
groundwater, presence of NAPL and the geological layers encountered in the bore hole.
During the drilling work selected soil samples will be analysed or screened for oil components
by the use of a portable Gas Chromatograph (GC-PID) and/or a Photo Ionisation Detector
(PID). To supplement these measurements some 20 samples will be analysed for total content
of oil by the use of enzyme based test kits. This will provide the necessary information for the
determination of the further steps in the investigations.
All soil samples will be kept for further measurements or analyses important for the risk
assessment and for the evaluation of alternative remediation methods. This could include
measurement of permeability, water saturation, organic matter, nutrients or oil degrading
bacteria.
From the screened drillings soil vapours will be extracted and analysed for volatile oil
components (by GC-PID), oxygen, carbon dioxide and methane (by the Bio surveyor).
Parallel with the drilling work water samples will be collected from the existing well at the site.
The samples will be taken before and during a prolonged low yield pumping period designed so
as to determine the water quality in the groundwater underlying the Dhahban Power Plant. The
water samples will be analysed by the portable GC-PID.
Phase I is completed by a risk assessment. The outcome of the risk assessment will determine
whether to proceed with Phase II and HI or to go directly to Phase IV.
Phase II
In phase II uncertainties about the extent of the contamination will be investigated further, and
if the soil conditions favour it, an in situ remediation test will be conducted. Additional
measurements on previously or newly collected soil samples may also prove necessary for the
evaluation of potential remediation techniques.
Phase II is concluded by an evaluation of different options for cleaning up the contamination. A
clean-up method will be proposed for design and implementation in Phase I-R.
Phase III
Phase mI1 will follow normal procedures for design and implementation of smaller works.
Phase IV
Phase IV consists of a monitoring period.

8     Organisation and Administration
At present, funding for the project remains to be identified. It is proposed that the entire project
will be managed and implemented by an expatriate consultant. Drilling work, construction
work and other contractor works will be carried out by local sub-contractors engaged by the
consultant.
Supervision of the contractor work, contact with the authorities and practical arrangements will
be carried out with the assistance of a local sub-consultant in close co-operation with the
consultant.
All activities at the site e.g. drilling work will be co-ordinated with the Dhahban Power Plant
Manager. During execution of drilling work or other construction works the consultant will
arrange regular site meetings to be attended by the sub-consultant, the subcontractors and
representatives of the Power Plant.
Prior to the initiation of the project PEC and involved authorities (EPC, NWSA- Sana'a
Branch, NWRA, Governorate of Sana' a) will be contacted and informed about the project. The
competent authority will be kept informed about the progress of the work through copies of
minutes of site meetings and copies of progress reports.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
TOR - Project Proposal
Country:          Yemen
Proposed Title:    Sana'a Emergency Power Project - Environmental consultancy
assistance for PEC.
1. Background
The Public Electricity Corporation of Yemen (PEC), a state owned enterprise, is presently
planning to undertake preparation and implementation of the proposed Sana'a Emergency
Power Project with financial support of the International Development Association (IDA), an
affiliate of the World Bank Group.
The objective of the proposed project would be to improve the availability and reliability of
electricity in greater Sana'a, which is currently subject to serious power shortages. These
shortages of electricity have various adverse social and economic impacts on the Sana'a region.
Temporary measures to correct the problems have included development of an interconnection
with Ta'iz and Aden; however, transfer of electricity from these cities is resulting in further
disruption of energy availability at increasing number of locations. The proposed project will
include the following physical investment components: (a) selected rehabilitation and
upgrading activities for the existing 20 MW diesel-fuelled power plant at the Dhahban Power
Plant site; (b) installation of an additional 30 MW of generating capacity at the existing site; (c)
expansion and upgrading of Asser 132/33 kV substation also including debottlenecking
elements of the transmission network in Sana'a.
An environrnental assessment of the proposed project has concluded that the institutional capacity
for environmental management at PEC at present must be considered as very limited. In order to
support PEC with the implementation of environmental components and proposed mitigation
measures for the said project, it has been agreed to provide consultancy assistance for support in
relation to these issues.
2. Project Objectives
The overall development objective of the project is to protect vulnerable environmental resources
including ground water resources in Yemen, by increasing the capacity for environmental
management at management level of Public Electricity Corporation, the Arab Republic of
Yemen.
The immediate project objective is to qualify and ensure implementation of proposed
environmental mitigation measures as an integrated part of Sana'a Emergency Power Project.

should include:
A project manager and senior environmental advisor with extensive project experience within
overall project and environmental management, emergency planning, environmental impact
arising from oil pollution and potential mitigation measures related to those issues.
The PEC should appoint a counterpart for the consultant.
7. Proposed Project Budget
Project financing remains to be identified. The following draft budget has been established:
It is estimated that an input of approximately 4 man-months from an environmental consultant
should be sufficient to cover the listed activities. The estimated costs for a 4 man-month input
by an international consultant is 73,000 USD exc. VAT. In addition travel, accommodation, per
diem and other reimbursable have to be included.
The budget should be revised, when the project document for the Sana'a Emergency Power
Project has been finalised.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
TOR - Project Proposal
Country:           Yemen
Proposed Title:    Air Quality Monitoring Programme
1.    Background
In the Sana'a region shortage of energy supply is faced eg due to the rapid growth of Sana'a the
capital of Yemen. This has resulted in an increased utility of small scale generators used in the
urban area. In order to hamper the shortage of energy supply the Public Electricity Corporation
of Yemen (PEC) has been granted a World Bank loan in order to increase the power supply
capacity in Yemen.
Rehabilitation of the 20 MW Dhahban power plant as well as extension with additionally 30
MW power plant form part of the above project. During the Environmental Impact Assessment
carried out obvious lacks of background data of the air quality in the Dhahban area was
identified.
In order to assess the adverse environmental impacts from the operation of the 50 MW
Dhahban power plant there is a need for establish satisfactory background data about the air
quality.
At present the Environmental Protection Council (EPC) ha drafted an air quality standard.
However information on background air quality is very poor.
The area
The Dhahban power plant is situated outside the city of Sana'a. The area is characterised by
spatial housing areas and no service institutions (hospitals, schools etc.) within a distance of
some 3 to 4 km from the power plant.
Only small scale industries are situated in the area. The industrial activities are mainly within
handling and storage of construction materials and some small garages.
Future plans
Furthermore the overall programme for increasing the power supply capacity in the Sana'a
region might very well comprise construction of new power supply units. This will bring forth
the need for data of the background air quality.

SANA'A EMERGENCY POWER PROJECT - EA
2.    Project Objectives
The overall development objective of the project is to establish air quality data for the Dhahban
area in order to evaluate the air quality impacts caused by the operation of the rehabilitated 20
MW Dhahban power plant as well as the new 30 MW power plant.
The intermediate objective is to provide data of the background air quality in the Dhahban area
which can serve as baseline information in connection with future extension of the energy
production in the area.
3.    Project approach
The project approach is partly to observe the air quality in the vicinity of the Dhahban power
plant, partly to observe the air quality in strategic points in the Dhahban area. The purpose of
the latter is to establish background air quality data which can serve as baseline situation in
areas potential for location of new power plants.
Furthermore the project approach shall focus on the following methodologies of monitoring:
A.   Ozone, 03:
B.   Nitrogen Oxides, NO, NO, and NO2:
- Measured by monitors. The time mean values shall be registered in the database.
C.   Sulphur dioxide, SO2:
- Measured by monitors. The time mean values shall be registered in the database.
D.   Carbon monoxide, CO:
- Measured by monitors. The time mean values shall be registered in the database
E.    Particulate matter (< 10 A), PMIo:
- PMIo is collected in a high volume sampler (HVS). The time mean values shall be
registered in the database. The collected volume of PM is sub-sequently measured in
a laboratory under controlled conditions

1.0   INTRODUCTION
Golder Associates Inc. has prepared this Supplemental Environmental Study in order to
assist the Public Electricity Corporation (PEC) of Yemen and the International Development
Association (IDA) of the World Bank to develop a final design and implementation of the
Sana'a Emergency Power Project. This Study complements the Environmental Assessment
prepared by Carl Bro International a/s and includes three elements: (1) air quality analysis;
(2) recommendations for air quality monitoring; and (3) findings of a field-based review of
proposed right-of-ways for the additional Project-supported transmission lines. The
Supplemental Environmental Study has been prepared consistent with provisions of World
Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and the "World Bank
Environmental Guidelines".
The members of the Golder Associates' team which prepared the Study include:
*  Mr. David A. Bare, Associate, who managed the project and performed a site visit to
identify and collect air quality inforrnation needed for the evaluation, reviewed rights-of-
way for the transmission lines, and evaluated air quality monitoring equipment and
locations.
* Mr. Robert C. McCann, Jr., Associate, who was responsible for performing the air quality
impact analysis.
The members of the Golder Associates' team would like to thank the representatives of the
PEC and Environmental Protection Council (EPC) for their assistance in the preparation of
this study.

2.0   AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS
2.1   ANALYTICAL APPROACH
An air quality impact analysis was performed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), and particulate matter (PM10) emissions due to baseline and future operations of
existing and proposed air emission sources at the Dhahban Power Plant. The existing
Dhahban Power Plant has an electrical generating capacity of 20 megawatts (MW) from four
5-MW diesel -fueled engines. Currently, only one unit was in operation when the site visit
was performed by Golder Associates' personnel. The proposed project consists of selected
rehabilitation and upgrading activities for the existing units and installation of an additional
30 MW of generating capacity at the existing site. The map in Figure 2-1 defines the project
area.
For the baseline operations, the air emission sources considered were:
* the existing plant with one unrehabilitated 5-MW unit in operation;
* vehicular emissions due to traffic near the power plant; and
* background sources due to activities at greater distances from the plant (i.e., greater than
5km).
For future operations, the air emission sources considered were:
* the existing four 5-MW diesel units which will be rehabilitated;
*  the proposed five 6-MW diesel units.
*  vehicular emissions due to traffic near the power plant; and
*  background sources due to activities at greater distances from the plant (i.e., greater than
5km).
The air quality impacts for the modeled pollutants were compared to the World Bank air
quality guideline values (1988). The air quality impacts were estimated using air modeling
methods and approaches acceptable to the World Bank and used on previous projects. In
general, these methods and approaches followed those developed and recommended by the
USEPA. The air modeling impacts were developed for air emission sources assumed to be
located in rural and less industrialized areas. In general, except for the power plant, there is
no industrial development within the immediate vicinity of the plant (i.e., within 5 km).

Since the EPC does not have air quality standards or air quality modeling guidelines, the air
quality modeling approach followed those developed by the USEPA for determining
compliance with AAQS. The USEPA air modeling guidelines have been used by Golder
Associates' personnel and have been accepted by national governmental agencies and
international financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank, Interamerican
Development Bank, and World Bank, in numerous countries throughout the world,
including those in South America (e.g., Argentina); Africa (e.g., Madagascar, Egypt); Asia
(e.g., Pakistan, Thailand); and Europe (e.g., Poland).
For this analysis, the maximum pollutant concentrations for the operation of the existing and
proposed diesel units at the power plant were calculated following the USEPA guidelines to
determine compliance with the ambient air quality guidelines. The Industrial Source
Complex Short-Term'(ISCST3) dispersion model, Version 97360, was used to evaluate the
potential impacts due to pollutant emissions from the existing and proposed diesel units.
This model is recommended for use by the USEPA for applications addressing the types of
emission sources that are located at the site, such as stack or vent releases. The ISCST model
was used since it is an EPA-approved model, which was a criteria for model selection by
Golder Associates.
The USEPA has defined specific values for certain technical features within the ISCST3
model referred to as regulatory options. The regulatory options set technical values for
numerous model features, including those for wind speed profiles and temperature
gradients for different atmospheric stability classes. These regulatory options were selected
for use to address maximum impacts. The ISCST3 model can predict pollutant impacts in
both rural and urbanized areas. Because the area around the Dhahban Power Plant can be
classified as rural, with minimal residential, industrial, and commercial development within
3 kilometers (km), the rural mode of the model was used for predicting pollutant
concentrations.
In general, air modeling is performed using at least one year of hourly meteorological data
collected onsite or a nearby weather station, such as at an airport. Air impacts are predicted
for each hour and then summed for longer-term averaging periods (e.g., 24-hours) and can
then be compared to ambient air quality standards.



09/26/98                           - 2-4 -                       9837549B/Rl
Meteorological data for 1996 were available from the Sana'a International Airport, located
about 4 km from the plant. These data were provided in summary format and reported as
daily averages for wind direction, wind speed, temperature, cloud cover, and relative
humidity. These data are valuable in assessing general weather characteristics for the area
(such as prevailing wind direction) and the plant site since the airport is located near the
plant and surrounded by similar land use and terrain features. However, because these
data were not available on a hourly basis, the air modeling was based on using "worst-case"
meteorological conditions in a screening analysis. Air quality impacts are predicted for the 1-
hour averaging time for a range of meteorological conditions that could occur at the power
plant site. These results were then extrapolated to longer averaging periods (e.g., 24-hours)
based on multiplying impacts by a time-scale factor. These time-scale factors are based on
those developed by the USEPA.
Air quality impacts produced using this screening technique are generally higher than those
produced using actual hourly meteorological data for one year or more. As a result, air
quality impacts from this screening analysis are over-estimated than those that would be
produced in a refined analysis and also expected to be higher than concentrations obtained
from a monitoring station if one were located near the plant.
2.2   DEVELOPMENT OF SCENARIOS
Emission inventory
Pollutant emission and operating data for the power plant were determined or developed
for input to the ISCST3 model using data presented in the Environmental Assessment for the
Sana'a Emergency Power Project (Carl Bro Intemational, April 1998) and updated by PEC
(1998). A site plan was provided by PEC which showed locations of stacks as well as
property lines that show the perimeter of the site. A site inspection of the plant was
performed by Golder Associates to determine the existing operations of the plant.
The pollutant emission data used in the modeling for the existing and proposed diesel units
are provided in Table 2-1. For future operations, the stack heights for the existing
rehabilitated and proposed sources were assumed to be 27 m in order for the plant's impacts
to reduce the effects due to building downwash and to comply with World Bank ambient air
guideline concentrations (see Section 2.4). In general, according to USEPA procedures,
building downwash effects should be included in the analysis if the ratio of stack height to

building height is less than 2.5. Building downwash effects can significantly increase
maximum ground-level concentrations when the stack height is low relative to adjoining
buildings than when there are no adjoining buildings or the stack is high relative to
adjoining buildings. In this analysis, the building dimensions assumed in the modeling
included a building height and width of 12 and 20 m, respectively. As a result, building
downwash effects were included in the modeling since the ratio of stack height to building
height is less than 2.5 and the stacks were assumed to be influenced by building downwash
effects in all directions. Based on the results of air dispersion modeling, the proposed stack
heights of 27 m for the existing rehabilitated and proposed sources are the minimum heights
by which compliance with World Bank ambient air guidelines would be achieved.
The pollutant emissions for the existing and proposed sources at the plant are presented in
Table 2-2 and are compared to World Bank guidelines.
As shown, the pollutant emissions for the existing and future operations of the power plant
comply with the requirements of the World Bank.
Total air quality impacts were estimated by adding the maximum concentration predicted
for the power plant to a background concentration. It should be noted that, for air quality
evaluations, 50 percent of the NO, emissions from the power plant and modeled
background sources was assumed to be converted to NO2 emissions.  The background
concentration consists of two components. The first component includes impacts for other
sources that are explicitly modeled. The second component accounts for impacts from
sources that are not explicitly modeled. This component is generally derived from ambient
air quality data.
To determine the background concentration from those sources that would be explicitly
modeled in the analysis, general information was obtained from PEC for industry within 15
to 20 km of the power plant; vehicular fuel consumption in the region; and traffic data near
the plant. A review was conducted by PEC and Golder Associates during the site visit to
determine the general characteristics of the area and potential sensitive receptors that could
be influenced by the plumes from the sources at the plant. Based on this information and
site visit, there is minimal industry and residential areas within 5 km of the power plant site.

Beyond 5 km from the plant, the types of industry include a textile factory and five rock
quarries. Since these sources have low-level releases of air emissions (e.g., short stacks or
fugitive PM emissions from ground-level material handling processes), impacts of pollutant
emissions from these sources are not anticipated to have a significant interaction with the
power plant's maximum concentrations.
Based on recent traffic count data obtained near the power plant, there are a nominal
number of vehicles that travel near the site. These data indicate that peak hourly traffic may
average between 250 to 350 light-duty gas vehicles and 30 to 60 heavy-duty diesel vehicles.
The NO, and PM emissions for the vehicular traffic were estimated based on emission
factors from the USEPA document, "Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume
II: Mobile Sources". The SO2 emissions were based on general emission factors used to
develop the regional vehicular emissions. Air quality impacts for vehicular emissions were
based on the vehicles traveling along the road located to the east of the plant. It was
assumed that 350 light-duty gas vehicles and 60 heavy-duty diesel vehicles made two trips
on this road on a hourly basis and traveled about 6 km each way. A summary of the
emission factors and emissions used in the modeling is presented in Table 2-3.
The background concentration due to non-modeled sources were obtained from air quality
data collected at a monitoring station considered to be representative of the conditions near
the Dhahban Power Plant. The monitoring data used are discussed in the following
sections.
2.2.1 Meteorological Data
The meteorological data used in the ISCST3 model consisted of "worst-case" meteorological
conditions designed to maximize impacts from the power plant sources. "Worst-case"
meteorology refers to an array of meteorological events that are assumed to occur for one
wind direction that could persist towards specified receptors.  These meteorological
conditions are recommended by the USEPA in performing "worst-case" impact evaluations.
Wind directions were assumed to occur for 36 directions at 10 degree intervals (e.g., 10, 20,
30, etc.). The following meteorological conditions were modeled for each wind direction for
the following range of atmospheric stabilities and wind speed:



09/26/98                             - 2-10 -                        9837549B/R1
*  very unstable stability: wind speeds of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 mns;
* moderately unstable stability: wind speeds of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 m/s;
*  slightly unstable stability: wind speeds of 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 7 nms;
*  neutral stability: wind speeds of 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10,12, 15, 17, 20 n/s;
* slightly stable stability: wind speeds of 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 m/s; and
* moderately stable stability: wind speeds of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 m/s.
As a result, at each receptor, concentrations were predicted using a total of 1,548
combinations of wind direction, wind speed, and atmospheric stability. Although wind
speeds greater than 5 mnts were not reported from the 1996 data available from the Sana'a
International Airport, wind speeds greater than 5 m/s were used in the analysis because the
USEPA includes these values in estimating "worst-case" impacts to provide a range of
potential wind speeds that could occur at a plant site.
To estimate impacts for longer-term averages, the hourly concentrations are multiplied by
time scale factors developed by the USEPA. The factors are as follows:
* 24-hour: average value of 0.4 with range of 0.2 to 0.6;
* annual: average value of 0.08 with range of 0.06 to 0.10.
In this analysis, the maximum values were used to obtain the longer-averaging period
concentration from the maximum 1-hour concentration predicted by the model (i.e., to
estimate 24-hour and annual average impacts, the maximum 1-hour average impact was
multiplied by factors of 0.6 and 0.1, respectively).
2.2.2 Receptor Locations
Concentrations were calculated by the ISCST model at receptors located in a radial grid,
which had lines or radials extending from the 100 meters (m) out to 5,000 m from the power
plant. A total of 396 receptors were used in the analysis. Receptors were located along 36
radials spaced at 10-degree intervals with the grid centered at the existing diesel units. Since
the sources were separated, the wind direction was assumed to rotate and blow towards
each of the radials for all of the meteorological conditions described in the previous section.

2.3   AIR OUALITY EVALUATION
Based on discussions with PEC personnel and a site visit to the region, ambient air quality
data have not been collected in the region or at the power plant site. However, in order to
provide a very preliminary estimate of air quality near the site, ambient air monitoring data
were reviewed by Golder for other monitoring stations located in similar climates (desert)
and with similar levels of industrial activities and vehicular operations. This review revealed
that a three station, continuous monitoring network located near Alexandria, Egypt would
be appropriate for use to determine an estimated "synthetic" baseline for the proposed
project. The network is located in an area similar to that of the northern portion of Sana'a.
The similarities are: (1) the monitoring station is located in an area which has no heavy
industrial facilities or emissions; (2) most of the buildings in the project area are two to three
stories and are either multi-family residential or small commercial shops; (3) the roadway
adjacent to the monitoring station is approximately the same type (two lane asphalt), similar
traffic flow (approximately 450 vehicles per hour), and a similar distance (less than 100
meters) as the existing roadway adjacent to the Dhahban Power Plant. Additionally, the
monitoring network is located in a region dominated by semi-arid conditions with high
natural levels of particulate.
The data from the Egypt monitoring network consists of 12 months of continuous SO2, NO2
and PM10 starting in September 1996. The network was operated and maintained in
accordance with existing USEPA guidelines for ambient air quality monitoring. Based on
this review, the maximum ambient concentrations measured in the network were used to
represent background concentrations (see Table 24).
2.4   PREDICTION OF THE MAXIMUM  EXPOSED INDIVIDUAL SITE/ WORST
CASE SCENARIO
A summary of the maximum ambient air quality SO,, NO2, and PM1O impacts predicted
from the existing and proposed power plant operations is presented in Table 2-5. The
maximum impacts are compared to the World Bank guidelines (1988).
For SO2, the maximum concentrations for the existing and proposed plant operations are
predicted to be below the 1988 World Bank guidelines. These concentrations are predicted at
receptors located at the power plant site boundary.

milar to SO2, the maximum NO2 concentrations for the existing and proposed plant
,erations are predicted to be below the 1988 World Bank guidelines. Again, these
ncentrations are predicted at receptors located at the power plant site boundary.
lr PMIO, the maximum concentrations for the existing and proposed power plant
erations are also predicted to be below the 1988 World Bank guidelines. A majority of the
edicted impacts are due to the assumed background levels.
,hould be noted that, at greater distances away from the power plant, particularly where
re are inhabited areas, the maximum pollutant concentrations are predicted to be much
ver than the maximum concentration shown in Table 2-5. In fact, at about 300 m from the
4ver plant, the maximum concentrations predicted for the power plant alone are about 50
-cent of the maximum concentrations shown in Table 2-5; at about 1,000 m from the
ver plant, the maximum concentrations predicted for the power plant alone are about 20
-cent of the maximum concentrations shown in Table 2-5.
2se results are considered conservative (i.e., higher than expected) because the
centrations are based on using "worst-case" meteorology designed to produce high
)acts. If actual meteorological conditions representative of on-site conditions were used
ie analysis, it is expected that lower impacts would be produced.
?d on these results, the recommended locations for primary and secondary ambient
-itoring stations are presented in Figure 2-2. The primary location is recommended in an
in which the maximum concentrations are expected to occur due to the future
rations of the plant. The secondary location is recommended in an area that is expected
xperience more frequent exposures to plant concentrations due to prevailing wind
ctions; however, these concentrations are expected to be lower on a short-term
aging period (i.e., 24-hours) than those expected at the primary location.  No
mmendations are made at this time for monitoring at other locations around the plant,
cularly at further downwind distances, since these areas are likely to experience lower
ient levels and have fewer periods when the plant's plume would produce an impact.

3.0 AMBIENT AIR QUALITY MONITORING
From the modeling results presented in Section 2, two potential locations for the monitoring
station have been determined. The primary location corresponds to the maximum predicted
pollutant impact area for the proposed modifications of the facility. The maximum impact
area is determined by using a short-term (24-hour) averaging period. The maximum impact
area would typically have higher pollutant concentration, yet shorter time periods of such
occurrences. The secondary location is the area for which the long-term (annual) pollutant
impact has been estimated. The secondary (long-term) impact location is the area that
normally will have lower pollutant concentrations that are spread out over longer periods of
time.
The air quality monitoring station located at the desired location near the Dhahban Power
Station should consist of a semi-portable (transportable), environmentally-controlled shelter
with transporter, a continuous SO2 analyzer, a continuous NO, analyzer, a dynamic gas
calibrator with a zero air supply, two particulate matter samplers with calibration orifice, a
meteorological monitoring system consisting of sensors for wind speed, wind direction,
temperature (at two elevations), barometric pressure and solar radiation, a data acquisition
system with mass data storage and auto-calibration sequence capabilities. The monitoring
station should include the analytical support equipment and spare parts required for proper
operations and maintenance for a minimum of three years. The spare parts list will be
developed bv the equipment manufacturers. Equipment warranties will be for a minimum
of two years.
Included in this section are the individual technical specifications, as shown in Table 3-1, for
the equipment required to collect, analyze, and record accurate, precise, and valid ambient
air quality data in the vicinity of the power station. Table 3-2 provides the estimated capital
costs for the procurement and shipment of one completely integrated ambient air
monitoring shelter with 3 years of operational spare parts.

of the monitoring equipment as well as the associated support equipment. A transporter
and lifting jacks should be included with the design of the monitoring shelter. The ability of
moving the monitoring shelter allows maximum flexibility in relocating the monitoring
shelter to other areas of potential concern. Relocating the shelter after collecting one to two
years of site-specific air quality and meteorological monitoring data could be accomplished
after performing an air dispersion modeling analysis to determine other areas of impacts.
The monitoring shelter should be constructed of superior materials and with attention to
details that will provide durability and long life. The understructure should be made with
structural steel, with its cross members gusseted to the longitudinal supports for strength.
After construction, the understructure should be washed with thinner and heavily coated
with DuPont red oxide primer, which is an industry-standard high-quality coating. A heavy
coating of black enamel should be applied to prevent rust and corrosion in Yemen's hot and
dusty environment.
Vertical wall posts and roof cross beams should be sufficiently sturdy to support the roof-
mounted high-volume PM,, samplers and the weight of service technicians. A portion of the
roof should be covered with 1/8-inch aluminum diamond deck to support the roof-mounted
instrumentation and provide safe footing for the site technicians. Corner posts and roof
safety rails of extruded aluminum should be detachable during transport. The walls and
roof should be filled with a non-toxic, non-residue-forming type of polyurethane foam for
high insulation capacity.
Its interior temperature should be controlled to 25° ± 2.50 Centigrade, using an 18,000 British
thermal unit (Btu) commercial-grade, window-type air conditioner and a 3-kilowatt (kW)
radiant baseboard heater, each controlled by a single, independent thermostat. The shelter
should be equipped with line voltage surge and lightning protection at the junction box.
Site preparations for the monitoring shelter consists of grading an area that is 2 meters
greater than the external dimensions of the shelter. A level concrete pad may be constructed
to support and secure the shelter in case of severe weather. The meteorological tower base
should be anchored to the concrete pad and connected to the shelter for stability. The
shelter and tower should be enclosed with a 2 meter high chain link fence topped with 3

strands of barbed wire. The entrance gate should be wide enough to permit the entry of the
equipment in their shipping boxes (not less than 1.5 meters) and positioned to allow the
10 meter meteorological tower to be lowered to perform routine maintenance of the sensors,
when necessary.
3.1.2 SO, Analyzer
The analyzer provided should have existing USEPA approval as a reference equivalent
method. The instrument skould be an U.V. Fluorescent S02 analyzer. In this analyzer the
U.V. light, which is either pulsed or chopped, is filtered to a specific wavelength known to
excite SO  molecules.  As these molecules return to the ground state, they emit a
characteristic fluorescence with intensity linearly proportional to the concentration of SO2
molecules in the sample. This fluorescence of the SO, molecules passes through a second
filter to illuminate the sensitive surface of a photomultiplier tube. The resulting output of
the photomultiplier tube is electronically amplified and produces an analog signal respective
to the concentration of SO2 present in the cell. The concentration is displayed digitally and
as an analog signal for recorder and data acquisition.
A system is recommended that includes automatic compensation for natural degradation of
the UV lamp. This minimizes span drift by observing the UV light intensity which is
maintained constant using a closed loop feed back control of the lamp power supply.
This technique requires no support gases other than zero air and SO2 gas for calibration.
Expendibles include a UV lamp (maximum of one per year).
3.1.3 NO, NO2, NO,, Analyzer
The analyzer provided should have existing USEPA approval as a reference equivalent
method. The instrument should be a chemiluminescent-type analyzer. In this analyzer, the
filtered sample enters a reaction chamber where a high concentration of intemally-generated
ozone exists. Any nitric oxide contained in the reaction chamber reacts with the ozone to
form NO2. A light emission results as the NO2 molecules revert to their ground state. This
light emission is filtered and illuminates the sensitive surface of a photomultiplier tube. The
photomultiplier tube output is amplified electronically and the signal generated is
proportional to the concentration of nitric oxide molecules present in the reaction chamber.

A portion of the ambient air sample stream is intermittently diverted to a high temperature
catalytic converter that converts NO, and other oxides of nitrogen to NO. The portion of the
sample stream that passes through the converter is the NO, channel. The portion of the
sample that does not pass through the converter prior to entering the reaction chamber is
the NO channel, which is subtracted from the NO, channel electronically. The difference is
equivalent to the NO2 and other oxides of nitrogen present in the sample stream. The
concentration of all three channels (i.e., NO, NO2, and NO.) are displayed on the front panel
and three analog outputs simultaneously provide a signal for recorders and data acquisition.
The recommended system is one that consists of a single reaction chamber and a single
photomultiplier tube. This type of system shares the single chamber to measure the NO,
and NO and has signal processing electronics which compares measurements in proper
time.
This technique requires no support gas other than zero air and NO gas for calibration.
Expendibles include a catalytic converter (maximum of one per year) and silica gel drying
agent, which may be regenerated.
3.1.4  PM,, Sampler
The sampler provided should have existing USEPA approval as a reference equivalent
method. The PM-10 sampler should operate by separating 10um and smaller particles from
ambient air and depositing them on a tare weighed micro-quartz filter. In this instrument,
the particles are separated in a single stage size selective inlet which is designed to operate at
a constant rate of 68 cmh. The flow, required for proper inlet operation, is maintained by a
critical orifice-type volumetric flow controller. The system should include an elapsed time
indicator and a circular chart flow recorder that will facilitate calculation of the total volume
sampled. A 24-hour digital timer should be included to program sampler operation. Two
filter cassettes, for each sampler, should also be included.
A calibration kit with complete manometers, calibration orifice and top loading adapter
should be supplied.

3.1.5 Multi-gas Calibrator
The calibrator provided should meet USEPA methodology specifications for calibration and
performance audits of ambient air analyzers. This instrument should be capable of blending
high concentration NO and SO2 cylinder gases with zero air to calibrate ambient air
analyzers. In this calibrator, introduction of each of the three gas inputs and one dilution air
input shall be controlled from the front panel and remotely through contact closures. The
calibrator uses two mass flow controllers (MFC): a 0 to 100 cm3/min for dilution air and 0 to
10,000 cm3/min for dilution air. Each MFC is controlled infinitely throughout it's range by
potentiometer settings and to at least two levels remotely through contact closure. Each
MFC flow level should be displayed digitally and have an analog output for recording the
flow level. The system should also include a gas phase titration system, that meets the U.S.
EPA dynamic parameter specifications, for producing various NO2 concentrations by mixing
NO gas with internally generated ozone. The ozone generator should meet USEPA criteria
as a generating transfer standard for ozone. The ozone generator should also controlled
infinitely throughout it's range by potentiometer settings and to two levels remotely by
contact closure.  The ozone generator should be stable and capable of repeating
concentrations from known potentiometer settings.
One instrument should be used in each ambient air monitoring station as the resident
calibration device. This type of instrument should also be used as an audit calibrator(s).
Gas cvlinders of NO and SO (size "A" for resident station calibrations, and size "B" for
auditing) should be supplied that meet U.S. EPA Protocol II specifications. The quantity
should be sufficient for 18 months operation. Appropriate regulators and fittings should be
supplied for each station and the audit system(s).
An external zero air system for SO2 and NO/NO2 should be supplied that will deliver up to
10,000 cm3/min at 30 psig to the multi-gas calibrator(s) for each station and the audit
system(s).

3.1.6 Zero Air Supply
The zero air supply will generate pollutant free ("scrubbed") air to the multigas calibrator for
dilution of calibration gases. The unit should include an external compressor, pressure
regulators, chemical scrubbers, thermal reactors, and temperature controllers in one case.
3.1.7 Data Acquisition System
The data acquisition system (DAS) should be a microprocessor-based specially designed to
acquire and process air quality and meteorological monitoring data. The unit should be
configured to accept up to 16 double-ended analog sensors (32 single-ended analog inputs),
process the data into averages, store data in CMOS memory and transmit over dial-up
telephone lines, where available, to a terminal or central computer center.
The unit consists of a microprocessor, real-time clock, analog input multiplexer, and analog-
to-digital converter, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an internal
212A type modem, and power supply.
Calibration of the ambient air monitoring equipment is an essential and integral part of an
overall monitoring program. It ensures that the data collected by each instrument is precise
and accurate. The DAS system should be designed to automatically perform zero/span
checks of the gas monitoring analyzers. These systems have been utilized in similar
automated systems around the world with excellent results. Automatic zero/span checks
dramatically increase valid data capture percentage as well as reducing "downtime" of the
analyzers by alerting field personnel of failing parts and/or components on a more timely
fashion.
Sigma-theta calculations should be performed by the DAS. For example, four 15-minute
averages comprising 10-second averages could be stored in the buffer and then the square
root of the sum of the variances of the 15-minute averages would be used to calculate the
sigma-theta value, which is stored in memory and reported as the hourly average. The
report generating software should be specifically designed for use with the DAS.

3.1.8 Sample Manifold
The sample manifold system should be made of borosilicate glass, allowing easy cleaning of
the system. The manifold system should include a large water trap, which permits removal
of water vapor without affecting the sampling process. Due to the possibility of high dust
levels in areas of Yemen each analyzer should be fitted with a filter capable of removing
particulate matter prior to entering the analyzer.
3.1.9 Meteorological Parameters
The modular meteorological system gathers meteorological data [wind speed, wind
direction, temperature (at two elevations), barometric pressure, and solar radiation] at the
mobile air quality monitoring station. The meteorological sensors should be mounted on a
10-meter tilt-down instrumentation tower. The tower should be guyed to the ground for
stability as well as safety reasons.
Wind speed is measured by a 3-cup anemometer coupled to a wind speed sensor that
converts the cups' rotation speed to a frequency proportional to wind speed. The frequency
is converted to direct current (DC) voltage by circuits located in the translator and is
recorded by the data acquisition system and on the strip chart recorder. Wind direction is
measured by a wind vane coupled to a precision low-torque potentiometer.  The
potentiometer's wiper voltage is a measure of wind direction and is coupled with the wind
direction translator. Circuits in the translator convert the 0-to-360 signal generated by the
potentiometer into a 0-to-540  signal for recording.  Signal conversion prevents the
ambiguous reading and chart smearing that can occur in 0-to-360 systems when the wind is
from 360.
The ambient temperature sensor is a precision, extended-range thermistor that accurately
measures ambient temperatures. A 10-second response time, coupled with a large resistance
change for degree of temperature, would ensure fast and accurate ambient temperature
measurements.
The barometric pressure sensor coverts absolute atmospheric pressure into linear,
proportional output voltage using a precision pressure transducer. The transducer should
be housed in a heavy-duty enclosure suitable for harsh and severe environments.

The solar radiation (pyranometer) utilizes a differential thermopile detector that produces a
linear voltage proportional to the solar radiation exposure at the sensor.
3.2   TRAINING
A comprehensive, multilevel training component will be provided to a minimum of four
PEC personnel and four EPC personnel by factory trained instructors, using the latest
educational techniques, including detailed operations manuals and visual aids. The training
will focus on both the operations and maintenance portion, and the report and management
phases, of a properly conducted air qualit, monitoring program. The training program will
target the field engineers and technicians to receive operational information. It also will be
specifically tailored in content to the supervisors and managers who will be responsible for
the success of the monitoring program.
The training program will include an overview of the fundamentals of operating and
maintaining an air quality monitoring network.  The training will also include detailed
instructions for instituting a Quality Assurance (QA) program and an auditing process
within the monitoring network framework. The training program will target both the field
operations (data collection) aspect and the management (QA and reports) portion of the
monitoring network. While the bulk of the training will be conducted in English, an
English-to-Arabic interpreter to translate technical language should be on hand to assist in
translating technical phrases from English into Arabic during the training. Additionally, the
majority of the equipment operations manuals will be translated into Arabic and provided to
the trainees. Site specific logbooks and check sheets will be developed and printed in a dual
language (English and Arabic) format.
The training program should be initially conducted in a classroom at the PEC headquarters,
for a minimum of two weeks, and would begin with a detailed review on the theories and
principles of ambient air pollutant detection and analysis. Additionally, instruction should
be provided in the operations of support equipment, the sample handling systems, and the
data acquisition systems. The individuals being trained will be introduced to the principles
governing ground-level pollutant concentration calculations, quality assurance procedures,
and data reporting and interpretation protocols.

Following this theoretical orientation, trainees would be instructed in the hands-on use of
the monitoring instrumentation, simulating actual field operating conditions. Trainees will
be taught set-up, calibration, and operating procedure under practical, applied conditions.
Each trainee should have ample opportunity to individually use the equipment. Sampling
and analysis procedures detailed in the Standard Operating Procedures manual would be
emphasized. The training will be conducted both in the classroom and at the monitoring
shelter. Basic hand tools and a digital voltmeter will be provided to each trainee for their use
during the training.
The next phase of training would be devoted primarily to preventive maintenance,
troubleshooting, and part replacement procedures. Documentation procedures and forms
would be presented for operation, calibration, and preventive maintenance for all the
instrumentation. This phase of training will take place at the monitoring shelter so that the
trainees can continue their "hands on" training. Each trainee will be informally quizzed
periodically to determine whether the training aspects are being learned by the trainees..
During the final portion of the training, quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA)
concepts, as they apply to the instrumentation and their use, would be introduced. QA/QC
encompasses all actions taken by the PEC to ensure accurate and reliable data collection is
achieved. An established QA/QC program is essential for any organization that wants to
consistently produce valid, accurate and precise sampling data. The EPC trainees will be
thoroughly instructed in the areas of quality assurance programs and auditing procedures,
so that EPC could, if requested by PEC, conduct both systems and performance audits on the
monitoring equipment and network. All personnel who successfully complete this training
will be provided with certificates from the supplier of these services.

4.0 AIR EMISSIONS MONITORING EQUIPMENT
A properly configured portable flue gas analyzer to measure exhaust gases as well as other
combustion related parameters will provide both plant operators and regulatory personnel
with accurate stack emissions data as well as combustion performance information. The unit
should combine field-proven electrochemical sensor technology with the latest
microprocessor-based emission calculations and data storage.
4.1   EMISSIONS MONITORING EOUIPMENT
The unit should accurately measure SO, CO, NO, NO2, 02, hydrocarbons, as well as
calculate CO, and NO, concentrations, stack and ambient temperatures, flow rate,
combustion efficiency and excess air values. While this unit should not be intended to
operate as a continuous emissions monitor, requiring rugged construction and ease of use
will makes it ideal for repetitive use. Most units have durable aluminum cases with a
detachable hinged lid, which holds the sample probes, water knockout bottles and
accessories. The body of the case should be designed to permit the removal of an entire gas
sampling assembly and replaced with another pre-calibrated module as required. Other
items and accessories should include peristaltic pumps, heated sample lines, condensation
cooler, on-board impact printer, menu driven user-selectable operations mode and RS232
interface.
The power for the unit should be provided by either rechargeable gel batteries or 220
VAC/50 Hz line voltage. The unit should be able to perform automatic calibration sequences,
self-checks for all systems and automatic air purging of the sensors every time the unit is
turned off. This feature will ensure accurate and precise measurements while conserving
sensor life.
The flue gas analyzer should be easily transported, operated and maintained. Operational
procedures should be carried out by following "user friendly" menu prompts on the liquid
crystal display while using the integral keyboard located on the front panel. Simultaneous
display of all measured and calculated values should be provided so that the operator has a
complete overview of the combustion operations. The data generated for each measurement
cycle should have the option of either being printed out as a hard copy or can be stored on-
board for later output to a serial interface device (i.e., printer PC, etc.).

The technical specifications for a flue gas analyzer are included in Table 4-1. These
specifications are, at a minimum, the ones required by the PEC, in order to provide the
widest choice of pollutant analysis combined in a single instrument.
The estimated cost for a properly configured portable flue gas analyzer, including all
associated equipment, calibration gases, spare parts and consumables for 3 years, shipping,
and a comprehensive training program is included in Table 4-2.
4.2   TRAINING
A comprehensive, multilevel training component will be provided to a minimum of three
PEC personnel by factory trained instructors, using the latest educational techniques,
including detailed operations manuals and visual aids. The training will focus on both the
equipment operations and maintenance portion, and the emissions calculations report and
phases, of a properly conducted air emissions testing program. The training program will

specifically tailored in content to the supervisors and managers who will be responsible for
the success of the sampling program.
The training program will include an overview of the fundamentals of operating and
maintaining an air emissions monitoring program. The training will also include detailed
instructions for instituting a Quality Assurance (QA) program within the sampling protocols.
The training program will target both the field operations (data collection) aspect and the
management (QA and reports) portion of the sampling network. While the bulk of the
training will be conducted in English, an English-to-Arabic interpreter to translate technical
language should be on hand to assist in translating technical phrases from English into
Arabic during the training. Additionally, the majority of the equipment manuals will be

be provided in the operations of support equipment, the sample handling systems, and the
data acquisition systems. The individuals being trained will be introduced to the principles
governing combustion and emissions calculations, quality assurance procedures, and data
reporting and interpretation protocols.
Following this theoretical orientation, trainees would be instructed in the hands-on use of
the sampling instrumentation, simulating actual field operating conditions. Trainees will be
taught set-up, calibration, and operating procedure under practical, applied conditions.
Each trainee should have ample opportunity to individually use the equipment. Sampling
and analysis procedures detailed in the Standard Operating Procedures manual would be
emphasized. The training will be conducted both in the classroom and at the stack. Basic
hand tools and a digital voltmeter will be provided to each trainee for their use during the
training.
The next phase of training would be devoted primarily to preventive maintenance,
troubleshooting, and part replacement procedures. Documentation procedures and forms
would be presented for operation, calibration, and preventive maintenance for all the
instrumentation. This phase of training will take place with the equipment so that the
trainees can continue their "hands on" training. Each trainee will be informally quizzed
periodically to determine whether the training aspects are being learned by the trainees.
During the final portion of the training, quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA)
concepts, as they apply to the sampling instrumentation and their use, would be
introduced. QA/QC encompasses all actions taken by the PEC to ensure accurate and
reliable emissions data collection is achieved. An established QA/QC program is essential for
any organization that wants to consistently produce valid, accurate and precise sampling
data. The EPC trainees will be thoroughly instructed in the areas of quality assurance
programs and auditing procedures, so that EPC could, if requested by PEC, conduct both
systems and performance audits on the sampling   equipment. All personnel who
successfully complete this training will be provided with certificates from the supplier of
these services.

5.0 MONITORING PLAN/QUALITY ASSURANCE
The monitoring plan presented in this section outlines the general operations, objectives, and
responsibilities of properly operating and maintaining an ambient air monitoring station or
network. Each air quality monitoring network, whether consisting of one or more than one
monitoring stations, should develop and prepare a monitoring plan or standard operating
procedure (SOP) and a quality assurance (QA) program that is both project-specific and
equipment-specific for that network. The monitoring plan should include the appropriate QA
checks which helps to ensure valid and complete data collection. The procedures set forth in a
monitoring plan SOPs are applicable for all personnel working with the monitoring
instruments, individuals preparing the data reports and those managing or supervising the
overall monitoring program. The following identifies the items and actions to be taken during
the monitoring program to ensure that the data are collected and reported are accurate,
precise, and valid.
5.1    OBTECTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The primary responsibility for operating and maintaining the station is delegated to the Site
Technician from the Project Manager. The qualifications of the Site Technician should include
being reliable and detail oriented, being familiar with the operations and diagnostic checks
associated with solid-state electronics and test equipment similar to the equipment used in the
monitoring network, having attended the vendor-supplied equipment training sessions, and
having a good working knowledge of computers and associated software. Since the data
acquisition system typically includes equipment-specific collecting and reporting software,
computer programming expertise would not required.
The objectives of visiting the ambient air quality monitoring station by the Site Technician are
to:
1.   Assess the status of each monitoring system,
2.   Evaluate the quality and validity of data being gathered,
3.   Perform data collection and maintenance tasks as scheduled or indicated, and
4.   Document all significant information for historical analysis.
Site Technician should visit the station at least three times per week to check on the status of
the equipment as well as the data being collected. During these visits, the Site Technician will

check the time and date of the DAS to ensure synchronization, visually inspect the sample
manifold and sample lines for dirt or condensation, and maintain the general station
appearance. Weekly, the Site Technician will record the parameters in the various service logs
described in this document. The following general procedures should be used for each site
visit as a minimum:
1. Complete all service logs for the instruments and station (to be done once a week).
The individual service logs for each instrument are described in greater detail in the
general operating procedures section for each instrument located in this manual.
The service log for the station is described in greater detail below (Section 5.2). The
originals of the service logs will be kept onsite in a 3-ring binder or file folder in the
desk.
2. Ensure that the time and date on the DAS is correct and synchronized with the
station PC.
3. Complete the entry in the Station Logbook as to the reason for the site visit, the
condition of the station and monitoring systems, all internal and external activities
that could influence the data being collected, all actions performed at the station
during the visit, the names of all persons visiting the stations, and the entry and
departure times. Logbook entries are discussed further later in Section 5.3.
Data validity is another important assignment for the Site Technician, who has the most
knowledge regarding instrument status and performance, and is easily able to identify invalid
or suspect data.  Guidelines for making judgments and documentation for historical
verification are described in this manual. However, detailed corrective actions for abnormal
conditions are not included. Such instructions are provided in the specific instrument manuals
which are considered an integral part of this quality assurance plan.
The Site Technician is responsible for performing his or her duties in accordance with site
specific SOPs and for completing and submitting the indicated documents. The Project
Manager is responsible for auditing the Site Technician's performance, using the SOPs as
guidance.
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) schedules for the Site Technician are presented in
Tables 5-1 and 5-2. These tables list the O&M required, indicate their frequency, provide a

section reference for this manual (or references the instrument manual, if appropriate), and
indicate which form should be used to document the operation. Similarly, Table 5-3 cross-
references these operations by frequency, starting with the most frequent (i.e., daily activities).
The Site Technician should use these tables as tools to plan and guide site visit activities. Doing
so will help assure smooth network operation, aid in the documentation of site O&M activities,
and thereby assure that data produced by the network will meet regulatory requirements.
5.2   SITE SERVICE LOG
The Site Service Log, Site Form - 01, shown in Figure 5-1, lists the maintenance which is to be
performed on the monitoring site throughout each month, usually on a weekly basis. This log
is meant to provide a means for reminding the Site Technicians of all the different items that
need to be checked at the station. This list in not all inclusive and the Site Technician may find
other items that should be checked regularly that are not on this list. Any such items can be
documented in the Station Logbook. An example of a parameter that is on the log is
temperature. For this item, the wall-mounted thermometer records the minimum and
maximum temperature readings. Record both the minimum and maximum readings in the
space provided. For a more general heading, such as air conditioning filter, that system is to be
checked and maintenance performed as needed. In a case such as this where the system
requires replacement or cleaning, that action should be noted in the space provided. If the
item requires further service, place an "X" in the space, describe the service required in detail in
the Station Logbook, and inform the Project Manager. An "OK' in any space such as this
indicates that the item is in satisfactory shape and requires no action for that week.
Each item on the Site Service Log is described below.
1. Date--Calendar date that the service was filled out. Use the Date function on the
data logger to get this information. This will ensure that the data logger date is
correct.
2. Initials--Initials of the operator performing the service checks.
3. Manifold and Sample Lines
a. Manifold-Check the entire glass manifold and supporting polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) structure (outside). Ensure that the glass is dean, unbroken,

and leak free from the outside sample intake to the exhaust blower. Ensure that
all sample ports are leak free and that all unused ports are plugged.
b. Sample Lines-Check each sample line to see that it is leak free, dry, and clean.
Be sure that there no kinks or other flow obstructions. All of the sample lines
should be constructed of Teflon®. The fittings and filter holder should be
constructed out of Teflon(®, 316 stainless steel, or glass. Check the filter to be
sure that it is also leak free.
4. Temperature--Record the minimum (MIN) and maximum (MAX) temperature
readings from the MIN/MAX thermometer located on the wall. Reset the MIN/MAX
markers after obtaining the reading.

6. Blower-Make certain that the exhaust blower is running properly and is connected
to the manifold correctly. Report any excessive heat or noise coming from the motor.
7. Air conditioning filter-Inspect the air conditioner filter every other week and clean
as needed. At the same time, take note of the general condition of the air
conditioner and take any corrective action necessary.
8. Fire extinguisher- Confirm proper pressure in fire extinguisher.
9. Shelter tie downs-The shelter tie downs should be tight and secure. Lubricate these
as needed.
10. Appearance-The station must be kept neat and dean. Remove any refuse each visit
and sweep out any debris. All vegetation around the site should be trimmed
regularly.
11. Securit-See that the shelter and fenced enclosure doors and gates are securely
locked and all of the locking mechanisms work smoothly. Lubricate as needed.
12. Gas cvlinder inventorv-List each gas as indicated below:
a. Type of Gas--This is the chemical name of each gas, its intended use and the
concentration in parts per million (ppm) (example: S02 - cal, 50.00 ppm);
b. Vendor--List the manufacturer of the gas here;
c. Bottle serial number-Record the tank serial number; and
d. Weekly pounds per square inch (psi)--This is the psi reading taken off the
primary gauge of the cylinder regulator.

course of the month, write REPLACED in the next available column and start
a new row for the new tank with all the information described above. Any
cylinders that are installed or removed from the site should also be noted in
the Station Logbook. Personal calibration or audit standards are excluded
from this form.]
15. Drain Compressor Tank-Each week, drain the compressor tank. Be sure to clean
up any water that may spill out onto the floor.
5.3   STATION LOGBOOK
The Station Logbook is to be kept in the shelter at all times. The carbon copies for each page
should be removed at the end of each month and returned to the Project Manager. The
Station Logbook is intended to be used as a chronological history of everything that occurs in
and/or around the monitoring stations. All site visits, calibrations, instrument maintenance or
repairs, and audits also must be entered in the Station Logbook. Any activity that occurs in or
around the site that could possibly influence the data must be documented here. This could
include such activities as mining or agricultural work in the area, construction work, unusual
stack emissions, thunderstorms, or grass-cutting. The Station Logbook, along with the zero
and span checks, will be one of the primary sources of information the Project Manager will
use to validate or invalidate the data collected at the site. Therefore, nothing is considered
insignificant. As a rule of thumb, record enough information in the logbook so that upon
reading the entry several months later, you will be able to easily reconstruct what went on at
the monitoring station during that time period. Each month, start a new log page and mark
the last page of the month such that no more entries can be made on that page. Be sure to
change the carbon paper whenever the copies in the station logbook start to become faint.
5.3.1 Station Configuration
The continuous analyzers (SO2, NO., and Met. Systems), in-station calibrator, and DAS at each
station are bench top mounted to allow easier access should any repairs be required. The
station is designed to automatically collect and store data in the DAS from each of the
continuous analyzers (SO2, NO., and Met. Systems). The DAS, in addition to collecting data,
also controls the automatic calibration system to perform daily zero and span checks on the
SO2 and NO, analyzers. The DAS then records the resulting checks. A certified blended-gas
cylinder containing both SO, and NO calibration gasses will be used for all span checks and

calibrations. Since this calibration cylinder and the calibrator flows are certified, all zero and
span checks are "Level 1 Zero and Span Calibrations" as defined in the USEPA Quality
Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Svstems: Volume II. Ambient Air Specific
Methods. The SO, and NO, analyzers effectively receive a two-point calibration daily,
ensuring a high data validity analyzer percentage.
The meteorological system [horizontal wind speed and direction, temperature, differential
temperature (at 2-meters and 10-meters), barometric pressure, and solar radiation] is also
located in the station. The horizontal wind speed and direction sensors are mounted at the ten
(10) meter level on a 10-meter guyed tower. The two temperature sensors are mounted the at
2-meter and 10-meter levels on the same tower. The barometric pressure and solar radiation
sensors are also tower mounted. Monitoring data are collected continuously from these
sensors by the DAS.
Two inhalable particulate (PM1O) samplers are mounted on a platform beside the monitoring
station. The second sampler at the station is designated as the collocated sampler. PM,o
samplers are scheduled to run every six (6) days in accordance with the USEPA National 6-Day
Sampling Schedule for 24-hours (from mid-night to mid-night).
5.4    PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
The objective of any ambient air monitoring stations is to collect the maximum amount of data
possible that meets the guidelines established in the USEPA Quality Assurance Handbooks,
Volume I, II, and IV and the approved QAPP for the project. For this project, Golder will
follow the guidelines established in the USEPA Quality Assurance Handbooks for all criteria
under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD).  Under PSD  guidelines, various
parameters are used to determine the validity of ambient air data. Some of these parameters
are quantitative (i.e. zero and span checks, calibrations) and some are qualitative (i.e.
equipment selection and probe siting). Each of these topics will be discussed below.
5.4.1 Equipment Selection
All of the monitoring equipment selected for this project is approved by the USEPA and has
been designated as either a reference or an equivalent method. These methodologies are

described in 40 CFR 53. Meteorological equipment, data acquisition systems, calibrators, zero
air supplies, and back-up recorders are not issued an equivalent or reference number.
5.4.2  Instrument and Probe Siting
USEPA PSD monitoring guidelines recommend that air quality monitors should be placed at
the location(s) where maximum concentration increases caused by the new source alone and
by the new source and existing sources combined, are predicted to occur. The monitoring site
will be located in, or as close as reasonably possible to, these impact areas.
Within the station compound, the location of the sampling probe for each analyzer will
conformn to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 58 (Appendix E) - Probe Siting Criteria for
Ambient Air Quality Monitoring. The analyzers and related calibration and data acquisition
equipment will be installed in an environmentally controlled equipment shelter and operated
in accordance with the reference/equivalent method configuration and settings specific to each
monitor.
5.4.3 Control Limits
As part of the quality assurance program for this project, control limits will be established for
the Level 1 Zero and Span checks, calibration criteria, sample line integrity checks, precision
checks, and quality assurance performance audits. These control limits or action levels will
follow the suggested limits described in the USEPA Quality Assurance Handbooks, Volumes I
and II.

2. Calibration Criteria
Calibrations are performed on all the instruments in the network. However,
only the calibrations of the SO2 and NOQ analyzers will generate data points
that will be used to evaluate the response of the analyzer. These data points
can, if needed, be used to correct the data collected, at the discretion of the
Project Manager. Calibrations are run on these instruments on a quarterly
basis, whenever the analyzer exceeds the Level 1 Zero and Span limits or
quality assurance performance audit limits, or whenever there has been a
repair made to the analyzer. Data points generated by the calibrations are the
slope, intercept, correlation coefficient, and the average percent deviation.
a. Linear Reeression Analvses--A linear regression analyses will be
performed between the actual concentration being produced by the
calibrator (x) and the response of the analyzer as read through the DAS
(y). The linear regression will generate a slope (m), intercept (b), and
correlation coefficient (r). If any of the parameters are outside the limits
shown below (and in each subsequent adjusted calibration section), the
Project Manager must be notified and the calibration re-run.  The
definition and limits of these parameters are:
i. Slope-The slope of the line (m) produced in the linear regression
must meet the following criteria: 0.85 2 m < 1.15
ii. Intercept-The intercept (b) of the linear regression must meet the
following criteria: - 15.0  b < 15.0 (This criteria is for an instrument
with a range of 500 ppb)
iii. Correlation Coefficient-The correlation coefficient (r2) of the linear
regression must be greater than (>) 0.995.

b. Average Percent Deviation-For each of the calibration points, we will
need to calculate the percent error between the actual concentration and
the analyzer response via the DAS.
i. Calculate the percent deviation between each set of calibration points
using the following formula:
Percent Deviation =  (Y' X )] x 1000
where: X, = actual concentration from the calibrator in ppm or
ppb), and
Y= analvzer response ppm or ppb.
ii. Enter the appropriate values on the calibration form and in the
Station Logbook.
iii. Calculate the average percent deviation by adding all the percent
deviation numbers together and dividing by the number of
calibration points.. If the average of the average percent deviation of
the span points is within +15 percent, the analyzer is in calibration
and is responding linearly over the range of interest (O to 500 ppb). If
the average percent error exceeds 15 percent, perform an adjusted
calibration.
Calibrations information of the meteorological system will be accordance with
established guidelines.
The PM1O samplers are factory calibrated, but undergo a one-point flow
verification check when the samplers are installed. Subsequent calibrations on
the PM,, samplers will be carried out in accordance with the schedules
previously presented in Tables 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3.
The in-station gas blending calibrator will also be calibrated quarterly or after a
repair. The slope and intercept generated in these calibrations will be used to
accurately correct the displayed flow information.
3. Sample Line Integrity Check



09/26/98                            - 5-16 -                        9837549B/Rl
A sample line integrity check (SLIC) is a test that determines how much, if any,
sample is lost in the sample line and will be conducted and documented in
conjunction with multi-point calibrations on a quarterly basis. The check is
performed to ensure that there is minimal degradation of the sample caused
by the sample line and filter. No more than a 2 percent deviation is allowed.
A deviation of more than 2 percent indicates either contaminated sample lines
(  Instrument Response     Instrument Response)
SLIC % Deviation = (Through Sample Line/Filter)  1  Back of Instrument )l00
Instrument Response Back of Instrument
and inlet filter or leaks in the sampling system. Check these items and re-run
the test. Document results in the Station Logbook and inform the Project
Manager. Calculate the deviation as follows:
4. Precision Checks
Precision checks are low level span checks that are run on the analyzers to assess
how precise the analyzers operate at low concentrations. Precision values are used
by the Project Manager to predict how dependable the data is over a given period of
time. This dependability or confidence interval is a. function of the average
deviation from the precision checks. However, precision checks do not validate or
invalidate data, only "Level 1 Zero and Spans", calibrations, or instrument failure can
do that. Results from precision checks are reported to the Project Manager who will
in turn use them in the calculation of the data precision as described in Section 2.0.8
of Volume II of the USEPA Quality Assurance Handbooks. Any deviation greater
than ±15% should be reported immediately and the test re-run to verify no mistakes
were made.
D. Quality Assurance Performance Audits
Two types of audits, systems and performance, are typically performed on the
monitoring equipment to appraise, on a qualitative and quantitative basis,
respectively, the monitoring data collected by the network. The audits are
performed independently from the actual monitoring operations. Audits are a
way to determine how well an air quality monitoring network and program are
functioning. The audit is a detailed study that answers the question of how well is



09/26/98                           -5-17-                        9837549B/Rl
the monitoring system is operated and maintained. Audits are conducted on the
data collection portions of the monitoring network at regular intervals throughout
the year, usually quarterly. During the comprehensive air quality monitoring
training program, the PEC will identify the appropriate individuals who will be
responsible for the conducting the audits.
Systems audits are conducted to assess whether the network's quality assurance
plan is being properly implemented with regards to any regulations governing the
collection, analyses, validation, and reporting of ambient air data. A systems audit
identifies any discrepancies found in the monitoring and data collection programs
and provides those corrective actions required to achieve the minimum levels of
compliance for the monitoring program.
Performance audits are used to accurately assess measurement techniques under
normal operating conditions without any special preparation or adjustment of the
system. Routine zero, span, and precision checks are vital to quality assurance,
but are not a regular part of auditing procedures. Therefore, performance audits
are conducted by individuals not associated with the dailv routines of operating
and maintaining the air quality monitoring network and/or those not using the
equipment at the site.
Qualitv assurance performance audits should be performed quarterly on each
instrument in the network, except the meteorological parameters, using
designated audit equipment that is independent of the normal operation of the
network. Meteorological parameters should be audited every 6 months after
monitoring start-up. Audit results are used to assess the accuracy of the data
collected in the network and not to validate or invalidate data. However, if an
audit fails due to an obvious problem, such as a pump failure or the instrument
having no power, the auditor will report the failed piece of equipment to the Site
Technician, who will inform the Project Manager, in order to minimize loss of
data.

6.0   REVIEW OF PROPOSED 33 KV TRANSMISSION LINES
PEC recently performed a 33 kV transmission reinforcement study which outlined their plan
to increase the capacity of individual transmission lines required by the installation of the
proposed 30 MW power plant at the existing Dhahban Power Station. The four new 33 kV
transmission line routes are shown in Figure 6-1:
1. A new 33 kV line from the Dhahban Power Station to the northeast substation (8.6 km
overhead lines and 1.3 km underground cable).
2. A new 33 kV line frorn the Dhahban Power Station to the Airport Road and intercepting
the existing 33 kV line from Rawdan substation (3.6 km overhead lines and 1.3 km
underground cable).
3. A new 33 kV line from the Dhahban Power Stations to the northwest substation (7.5 km
overhead lines and 1.2 km underground cable).
4. A new 33 kV line from Asser BSP to the southwest substation (5.2 km overhead lines and
2.5 km underground cable).
Table 6-1 describes the physical conditions of the right-of-way (ROW) of each of the four
new transmission lines to the surrounding area.  Potential negative impacts on the
environment for each line are discussed.
As shown, the four proposed transmission lines utilize either existing distribution right-of-
ways (ROW) or follow existing roadways, thus minimizing potential environmental impacts.
The four proposed lines were visually inspected and their ROWs are located in sparsely
populated and undeveloped areas. There would be minimal vegetative damage due to the
proposed routing utilizes ROWs that are already existing.  The impacts due to the
construction (installation of the support structures and the stringing of cable) of the
transmission lines will be minimal as well, since the support structures will be standard 12
meter poles and will require no extraordinary construction techniques for installation.
Figure 6-2 is a photograph illustrating an existing 33 kV in the region, which is
representative of the ROW conditions along all four proposed 33 kV lines.
The review of the four proposed 33 kV transmission lines concludes that the new lines
would not cause any negative or adverse environmental impacts.
