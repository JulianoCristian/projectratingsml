I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
By the early 1990s, Argentina lacked a coherent public investment strategy to identify,
assess and prioritize public investments within the national government.            Although
individual agencies, such as the National Development Council (Consejo Nacional de
Desarrollo) in the 1960s, the former water and electricity state enterprises, the National
Highway Directorate (Dirección Nacional de Vialidad) and the Federal Investment
Council (Consejo Federal de Inversiones ­ CFI), had had at various times a project
evaluation culture, decades of inflation had drastically eroded the technical and
institutional capacity of Argentina's public institutions to ensure the economic and
financial soundness of public investments. As a result, public investment decisions were
ad hoc and fragmented, as reflected in the steady decline of the rate of return of public
investments, both in absolute terms and vis-à-vis private investments, from the 1970s
onward.

As part of its broad public sector modernization agenda, the Government addressed these
weaknesses in 1993 by creating the National Directorate for Public Investment and
Project Financing (Dirección Nacional de Inversión Pública - DNIP) within the
Secretariat of Economic Programming (Secretaría de Programación Económica - SEP)
in the Ministry of Economy. In August 1994, supporting legislation--the National
System for Public Investment Law (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública ­ SNIP; Law
No. 24.453)--was approved by Congress, which assigned the DNIP the responsibility of
formulating a tri-annual National Public Investment Plan. Other responsibilities assigned
to the DNIP included: ensuring the quality of capital investments with national financing
(even if implemented by provincial governments), determining norms and methodologies
for project analysis and evaluation, maintaining an up-to-date inventory of investment
projects, identifying projects of national interest, assisting in project preparation, and
helping identify external sources of financing. The responsibility for project identification,
preparation and evaluation remained with individual government agencies. Responsibility
for physical and financial monitoring of execution was assigned to the Secretariat of
Finance--also within the Ministry of Economy--through the recently implemented
Integrated Financial Information System (Sistema Integrado de Información Financiera ­
SIDIF).

The Government requested the Bank's support in its efforts to enhance efficiency and
effectiveness in public investment programming through a series of operations targeting
critical areas of public investments at all levels of government. In response, several IBRD
operations were designed to strengthen the technical and institutional capacity of key
institutional actors in project identification, analysis and preparation as well as the use of
M&E tools, including the First Social Protection Project (Loan No. 3957-AR) with a
focus on social investments, the Second Provincial Development Project (PDP-II; Loan
No. 3877-AR) with a focus on capital investment projects implemented at the provincial
level, the Second Municipal Development Project (MDP-II; Loan No. 3860-AR) with a
focus on capital investment projects implemented at the municipal level, and this



                                                1

operation--the Public Investment Strengthening Technical Assistance Loan (Programa
de Fortalecimiento del Sistema Nacional de Inversiones Públicas ­ FOSIP; Loan No.
3958-AR) with a focus on capital investments financed by the national government.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The original Program Development Objective (PDO) was to enhance the effectiveness
and efficiency of the government's public expenditure management by: i) improving its
investment process; ii) strengthening its project analysis capabilities; and iii) building up
project and program evaluation capacity.

Key Indicators:    Specific activities, a clear timetable for their implementation, and
expected outcomes were explicitly defined during appraisal. For example, under
Component 1 it was anticipated that between 20 and 30 high-ranking government
officials would be attending high-level seminars to be held between January 1996 and
August 1998. However, despite their detailed nature, emphasis was placed on activities
(i.e., high-level seminars) and intermediate outcomes (i.e., 20 to 30 high-ranking
government officials trained) rather than on measuring the overall impact of the
individual components and the operation as a whole. In this regard, it is important to note
that the project was prepared before the logical framework methodology was adopted
Bank-wide.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The objective of the project remained unchanged at restructuring. However, on 8 June
2000, the Executive Directors authorized an amendment to the loan to add two new
components in support of a broader state modernization reform. As a result, an additional
PDO was added to the original one: to support the establishment within the public
administration at the national level of: i) a results-oriented management approach; and ii)
monitoring tools for citizen review of agency performance.

Key indicators for the two new components were added as well. However, as the original
ones, they focused on intermediate outcomes (i.e., number of agreements signed with
public organisms) rather than on substantive impact.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
As originally conceived, the project would build awareness of the importance of
developing sound public investment practices among a wide constituency, including
senior government officials and civil servants from all levels of government,
parliamentarians, journalists, as well as individuals and firms from the private sector. The
DNIP and other government agencies responsible for the identification, preparation and
evaluation of capital investment projects were also to receive technical assistance under
the project. At restructuring, more emphasis was given to capacity building on project



                                               2

preparation and evaluation among public officials among the three levels of governments
than to increasing awareness among a wider constituency. In addition, as a result of the
2000 amendment, several agencies within the national government were included in the
project in the areas of result-oriented management and enhanced public service standards.
The DNIP, the SEP, the National Directorate for Projects with International Financing
(DIFIP) and the Budget Office also benefited from TA under this operation, either
directly (i.e., the SEP and the DNIP), or indirectly (i.e., the Budget Office and the DIFIP)
through the implementation of the financial management tools.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
As originally envisioned, the project had five components, as follows:

Component A - Sectoral Investment Decision Making (US$1.2 million, or 5percent of
total project cost). This component was aimed at fostering good practices in the
formulation and implementation of strategic investment decision-making as well as
building ownership and commitment among senior government officials. The component
supported: i) a series of high-level seminars aimed at familiarizing decision-makers with
best practices in the areas of public investment and public expenditure management; and
ii) high level workshops directed at senior officials and decision makers, journalists as
well as individuals and firms from the private sector.

Component B - Improvement of Agencies' Project Analysis and Evaluation Capacity
(US$7.6 million, or 30 percent of total project cost). This component was aimed at
building a sustainable decentralized capacity to identify, prepare, select and evaluate
investment by national government agencies through: i) courses in investment decision-
making, project management, procurement and project cycle implementation, aimed at
middle-management and personnel of the investment agencies, as well as individuals
from the private sector; ii) technical assistance to investment agencies in the application
of project analysis techniques; and iii) technical assistance to investment agencies in the
application of impact evaluation techniques through the analysis of selected existing
projects.

Component C - Basic Studies in Support of Sectoral Investment Strategies (US$8.6
million, or 35 percent of total project cost). This component consisted of basic studies
aimed at developing public investment strategies in priority sectors, leading to project
identification and the preparation of sectoral strategies for selected agencies.

Component D - Support to the Preparation of the National Public Investment Plan
(US$2.7 million, or 11 percent of total project cost). This component was aimed at
supporting the DNIP in the implementation of the National Investment Plan System -
SNIP, focusing not only on the DNIP itself but also on government agencies responsible
for public investments. In addition, this component was intended to help disseminate the
SNIP Law and its implementation.

Component E - Project Administration (US$2.5 million, or 10 percent of total project
cost). This component supported project administration, office equipment, yearly external



                                              3

audits and an agreement with a procurement agency for procurement and administration
services.

1.6 Revised Components
The original components were revised in February 1999 at restructuring. Two relatively
small additional components (i.e., amounting to US$0.7 million) were added (i.e.,
Components E and F) in June 2000 In addition, individual activities were repeatedly
modified and revised according to the priorities of successive administrations.

Component A ­ To Create Awareness and Strengthen the Policy and Legislative
Framework (US$0.7 million instead of the original US$1.4 million). The objective of
this component was to promote an evaluation-oriented culture and to set up the policy
and legal framework for further efforts. Expected products of this component were a draft
of a Government Results Act and improvements to the regulations of the 1994 National
Public Investment Law.

Key indicators: Number of national and provincial decision-makers and technical staff
acquainted with the framework laws, regulations and guidelines, and the concepts of ex-
ante, on-going and ex-post evaluation.

Component B - Improvement of Agencies' Strategic Investment Capacities (US$5.3
million instead of the original US$7.6 million). The objective of this component was to
provide training to national, provincial and municipal investment agencies in the
preparation, monitoring and evaluation (ex-ante, on-going and ex-post) of projects and
programs, and to help put into effect the National Public Investment System Law.
Expected products of this component included: a management information system for
project implementation in the Under-Secretariat of Strategic Control; ex-post evaluation
of selected projects; the creation of the Argentine Evaluation Society (Asociación
Argentina de Evaluación - ASAE) as a step toward the institutionalization of capacity
building efforts; the strengthening of the national projects databank; and assistance to the
provinces in the creation of their own databanks.

Key indicators: The number of projects presented according to SNIP standards.

Component C - Basic Studies in Public Expenditure (US$5.9 million instead of the
original US$ 8.6 million). The original studies leading to project identification and the
preparation of sectoral strategies for selected agencies were replaced by alternative, less
expensive studies, which included: i) a preliminary study for the definition of the
continental platform; ii) an input/output matrix; iii) the infrastructure and territorial
effects; iv) the effect of privatizations in Argentina; v) a public expenditure review; vi)
the studies leading to social expenditure strategies; and vii) the consolidation of the effect
of critical social programs and services.

Key indicators: No specific indicators and/or outcomes were indicated for this
component--presumably the completed studies were the expected outcomes.




                                             4

Component D - Institutional Strengthening of the Secretariat of Economic
Programming (US$1.5 million instead of the original US$2.7 million). This component
was aimed at strengthening the DNIP, the DIFIP, and the National Social Expenditure
Directorate to enable them to provide guidance and support to decision-makers and
expenditure agencies.

Key indicators: No specific indicators and/or outcomes were indicated for this component.

Component E ­ Results-Oriented Management System (US$0.7 million together with
Component F). This component, which was also added in June 2000, was aimed at
strengthening performance management within a group of public sector agencies. Main
products of this component were diagnostic studies analyzing the situation in individual
agencies, to, in turn, serve as inputs in the implementation of a results-oriented system.

Key indicators: The number of agreements subscribed by government agencies.

Component F- Public Service Standards (US$0.7 million together with Component E).
This component, which was added in June 2000, was aimed at strengthening performance
management within a group of public sector agencies. Main products of this component
were diagnostic studies analyzing the situation in individual agencies, to, in turn, improve
the delivery of public service standards.

Key indicators: The number of agreements subscribed by government agencies.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
Loan amendments: The loan agreement was amended twice, in 1999 and 2000, as
follows:

    1999 Amendment: After a painfully slow start, the loan was restructured in 1999 to
reflect the priorities of the new authorities at the Ministry of Economy and the increasing
budgetary restrictions. While the number of components remained the same, the 1999
restructuring considerably scaled down the project, reducing the overall number of
training activities and studies. Likewise, the nature of the activities to be financed under
the project also changed, shifting away from international consultants and more
expensive studies to local consultants and less expensive studies. The decision was also
made to expand focus beyond the national government to also target provincial and
municipal governments in a more aggressive way. Basic tools, such as the inventory of
public investment projects, were reformulated to better respond to users' needs. Likewise,
the overall capacity building strategy also changed, incorporating universities throughout
the country to carry out formal training in project evaluation. Overall, the restructured
project retained the original objectives and had an increased scope but sharper focus. As a
result, overall project costs (were reduced from US$25 million to US$ 16.5 million (Bank
financing was also reduced from US$16 million to US$10.5 million). These changes and
the cancellation of US$5.5 million of the loan amount were in line with the budgetary




                                               5

restrictions that were put in place in response to the increasingly difficult financial
situation caused by the ongoing economic recession.

    2000 Amendment: The loan was amended again in mid-2000 to respond to the
priorities of the administration of President de la Rúa administration, which took office in
December 1999. The new administration requested the Bank's assistance for its state
modernization agenda, a top priority in its government agenda. Given the urgency
attached to the launching of a public sector reform early during the new administration's
tenure, it was deemed appropriate to seek Board approval to add two new components to
the original project to support the preparation of a high priority effort. Moreover, the
government's efforts in the area of public sector reform would also support the
attainment of targets in the economic program agreed with the International Monetary
Fund. The amendment was approved on 8 June 2000 to support technical assistance,
training and carrying out seminars to implement a Results-Oriented Management System
and Public Service Standards. Perceived strong government support was an important
factor in the decision to seek this amendment. However, this support shortly evaporated
with the departure of vice-president Álvarez in October 2000, who had been the
champion behind the public sector modernization efforts motivating this amendment. In
retrospect, given the lack of interest on the part of the authorities in the original public
investment focus, the project should have been canceled. Later on, when it became
obvious that there was no political support for the implementation of the two added
components, the operation should have been formally reduced in scope, recovering its
pure public investment focus, or canceled. There was a de facto shift in the focus of these
two components in mid-2002, away from results-oriented management and citizen-
centered public sector evaluation toward the development of two financial management
tools. While the shift helped ensure the effective utilization of the loan proceeds and
responded to the post-crisis needs, it constituted one more incremental change to the
operation's scope.

Extensions to original closing date: The project's closing date was extended seven times
beyond its original closing date of 30 June 2001 to its final closing date in 31 December
2006, leading to an overall lifespan of 11 years from approval to closing.1

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
Overall, quality at entry is considered moderately satisfactory. The strengths and
weaknesses of the operation's design can be summarized as follows:




1   Successive closing dates: 6/30/2001; 6/30/2002; 6/30/2003; 12/31/2003; 12/31/2004;
6/30/2005; 7/31/2006; 12/31/2006.



                                              6

Correct identification of needs: By focusing on the modernization of public investment
mechanisms, the Bank's team correctly identified a serious institutional weakness within
Argentina's public sector. It also capitalized on the commitment of Argentina's
authorities to the adoption of a modern public investment system, which was
demonstrated with the approval of the National Public Investment System Law in August
1994 and of its regulation in May 1995.

Full consistency with the Bank's CAS: The operation was fully consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on May 4, 1995 (Report No.
14278-AR), which focused on: i) consolidating structural reforms; ii) reducing poverty
and developing human resources; and iii) rebuilding infrastructure. Specifically, the
project contributed towards the first objective--i.e., consolidation of structural reforms--
by improving fiscal management through a more efficient use of scarce budgetary
resources. Likewise, the project contributed toward the third objective--i.e., rebuilding
infrastructure--by improving the effectiveness of public investments that are
complementary to private sector development. As mentioned earlier, the operation
complemented the strengthening efforts carried out under other Bank projects, including
the Social Protection Project, the Second Provincial Development Project, the Second
Municipal Development Project, and the Public Sector Reform Technical Assistance
Loan.

Adequate incorporation of lessons learned: The Bank's team incorporated important
lessons learned in previous IBRD and IADB operations. Specifically, it correctly
identified factors that could hamper the success of the operations and effectively
addressed them in the operation's design, including: i) adequately gauging the TA efforts
required to attained the proposed PDOs by designing a stand-alone operation rather than
a secondary component within a larger operation; and ii) conceiving the SNIP as a
decentralized system with multiple users, focusing not only on the DNIP but also sectoral
government agencies within the national government.

Supportive legal and institutional framework: The operation benefited from the legal
and institutional framework established by Law No. 24.453, which was highly conducive
to the establishment of a modern public investment system. In particular, the 1994
legislation offered several advantages, including: i) it conceived the PNPI as fully
integrated into the annual budgetary cycle, thus, inserting public investment
programming into the broader scheme of public expenditure management; ii) the
conceptualization of the SNPI went beyond the national government to include also
provincial and municipal governments, thus fully capitalizing on the potential advantages
of such a system in terms of horizontal and vertical coordination among the three levels
of government; and iii) the DNIP was the natural conduit for strengthening efforts, as all
activities supported under the operation were in line with DNIP's basic functions.

Excessive emphasis on training rather than on institutional development: As originally
designed, the operation placed more emphasis on training and dissemination activities
rather than on providing a sound road map for the institutional development of the SNIP
and the strengthening of public investments processes in general. The definition of the



                                             7

institutional development process to be carried under the program was vague.             As
designed, the operation was to provide the means to define such process--through the
financing of basic studies and study tours to review best practices--rather than to support
the implementation of an already well defined process. This constituted a significant
weakness in project design, increasing the likelihood of a convoluted implementation
process and the inefficient use of the loan resources.

Partial risk assessment: At appraisal, the Bank's team partially identified some of the
main risks affecting the operation, including the potential erosion of the government's
commitment to reform and the excessive politicization of the selection of projects,
resulting in improper use of the investment system. Other significant risks, however,
were overlooked, including the difficulties of implementing a decentralized TA program,
unfavorable governance conditions, lack of ownership among the public bureaucracy, the
lack of a clear institutional development strategy, and weak management. The challenge
of achieving the cultural transformation of public agencies with respect to public
investments was also underestimated. Not surprisingly, implementation proved to be
more challenging than expected, resulting in significant delays and detours during the life
of the project.

Poor M&E framework: As mentioned earlier, the project lacked a sound Results
Framework, as key indicators focused on activities and intermediate outputs rather than
on measuring substantive outcomes and overall impact.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)
Despite its overall accomplishments, the project encountered significant obstacles during
its implementation. The project had a slow start, with actual cumulative disbursements
significantly lagging behind expected ones during 1997 and 1998.                 Although
implementation took renewed momentum in 1999 and 2000, it came once more to a
complete halt in 2001 as a result of the country's economic collapse in December of that
year. Several factors, both within and outside the government's control, affected project
implementation, including frequent changes in political leadership, delays and obstacles
in execution, and, most notably, the impact of the 2001-2002 economic crisis. The
various aspects affecting implementation can be summarized as follows:

Slow project start up: Initial progress was slower than planned, in large due to internal
struggles within the government after the project's approval. The Office of the Chief of
the Cabinet of Ministers (Jefatura) was created in July 1995 to coordinate the work of all
ministries. For about a year, ambiguities on the precise role of the Ministry of Economy
vs. Jefatura slowed down the project's progress. These ambiguities disappeared with the
departure of Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in July 1996. His departure not only
reduced role of the Ministry of Economy in general, but also resulted in a shift in the
direction of the country's overall reform program. Cavallo's departure was detrimental to
the development of the SNIP, as he and his team had been its architects. The lack of
strong interest on the part of the incoming authorities was reflected in the amount of time



                                              8

that elapsed between project approval and effectiveness--the project was approved by
the Board on November 1995 and became effective only in April 1997, 15 months after
its approval.

Political   and    macroeconomic       instability:  Argentina's  unstable    political   and
macroeconomic environment in the late 1990s was a negative factor in the
implementation of the operation. Political instability translated into frequent changes in
the project's administration, which had a detrimental effect on project implementation as
the result of the time required to become familiarized with the project, changing priorities,
or just lack of interest in the project. Reflecting the government's own muddling through,
the activities financed under the project were often revised and, having lost its original
footprint, the operation slowed down and even stalled, bringing it to the brink of closure
during 1998. Between 1999 and 2000, the operation received a new lease on life with
renewed political support from the SEP. During this period, the operation was
restructured and implementation took renewed momentum, with disbursements totaling
US$3.3 million during 1999 and 2000 compared to only US$68,000 between its
effectiveness in April 1997 and June 1999. The implementation pace slowed down again
as a result of the increasing political and economic instability leading up to the country's
economic collapse in December 2001. The economic collapse affected the FOSIP
operation even more that other Bank projects, since, being housed in the Ministry of
Economy, it was right at the epicenter of the crisis. The operation did not get back on
track until mid-2002, when new leadership within the SEP brought renewed momentum
to the operation, setting in motion a new wave of expansion and consolidation of the
SNIP, which, fortunately, has been sustained for over four years. The operation reached
full momentum during 2004 and 2005, when roughly 40 percent of the loan was
disbursed.

Changing government priorities: Project implementation was deeply affected--both
favorably and unfavorably--by the changing priorities of the various administrations.
Although the portfolio of public investments was dramatically reduced during the 1990s
as a result of the large scale privatization of state-owned enterprises, the development of
modern management tools such as the SNIP was an important component of the
government's reform program. The operation was conceived in this context, for which
the preparation process received full government support. Toward the late-1990s,
however, the interest on public sector reform began to wane, as the government became
increasingly focused on responding to the challenges posed by the country's economic
slowdown, a succession of international financial crises, and growing political instability.
Not surprisingly, this environment was not favorable for this operation, as it did not offer
a good match to the government's priorities or a particularly relevant tool, given that the
level of public investments was declining steadily to reach its lowest point during the
2000-2002 period. Although in the year 2000, the Bank sought to respond to the priorities
of the incoming de la Rua administration by adding two components that reflected
priorities of its government agenda, the initial political support given to the project
quickly eroded, together with the administration's overall ability to govern. The 2001
crisis and ensuing recession had severe consequences, not only from an economic
perspective but also political, institutional and social, and brought the operation to a total



                                                9

standstill. The situation changed in the aftermath of the 2001-2002 crisis, when the
Duhalde administration utilized the project to improve budget performance and
oversight--a high priority given the scarcity of financial resources at the time. As a result,
the implementation of two additional financial management tools (the Unified Local
SIDIF ­ SLU, and a management system for Project Executing Units administering
projects with external financing - UEPEX) was included in the project. Under the
Kirchner administration, the operation offered a perfect match to the administration's
priorities, which responded to a development model that emphasized economic
production in the context of territorial development and regional integration, with public
investments acting as a catalyst for private investments, economic growth and increased
equality. In this context, the FOSIP was used as a strategic tool by the SEP to rebuild
relationships between the national government and the provinces and to disseminate the
administration's economic model among provincial authorities. The SNIP, including its
capacity building in project evaluation and its overall potential for enhancing the
economic return of public investment, proved to be a strategic tool for the Kirchner
administration, which increased budgeted national public investments from Arg.$800
million to Arg.$4.9 billion between 2003 and 2006. Not surprisingly, the operation
reached its momentum during this period.

Inherent complexity of public investment programming: Although it is clear that effective
project appraisal procedures are fundamental for attaining value for public investments,
project evaluation methodologies and calculations are inherently complex. These
complexities pose additional challenges in strengthening programs to be implemented
across a broad spectrum of institutional actors with wide differences in technical capacity
as well as areas of focus. Moreover, the challenges go beyond the complexities of the
substance matter, as the insertion of a sound, government-wide public investment system
also requires a deep cultural transformation within government institutions. Thus, it is not
surprising that a high and sustained the level of effort--including time and financial
resources--is required for such a process.

Federal conceptualization and implementation of the SNIP: The SNIP was conceived as
an integrated tool that went beyond the sphere of the national government, to include also
autonomous provincial and municipal governments. This federal approach has been vital
to the successful development and relevance of the SNIP given the relative importance of
provincial governments in Argentina, which account for the bulk of public investments
(78 percent in 2005). While a large portion of provincial public investments are financed
by transfers from the national government (50.9 percent in 2005), including housing,
roads, electricity, for which the SNIP law mandates their inclusion into the national
BAPIN, the inclusion of public investments by sub-national governments is key to fully
capitalize on the potential benefits of a national public investment system. Moreover, the
expansion of the SNIP among sub-national governments has been successful as a result
of the incentive-based approach adopted by the national government, by which provinces
are given free access to the BAPIN software, equipment and training as an incentive to
join the SNIP. Provincial governments are not required to provide the national
government access to their databases, although they are given full access to the national
BAPIN. As a result of this approach, 23 out of 24 provincial jurisdictions have formally



                                             10

adhered to the SNIP. In contrast, only five provinces had formally joined the SNIP when
the national government tried to implement a more coercive approach earlier on in the
process.

Project add-ons: While the addition of the two public sector modernization components
in 2000 may have helped the Bank to respond to the request for assistance of the
incoming administration in an expedient manner, it detracted from the operation's
original focus and added more complexity to its already challenging implementation. The
new area of intervention did not fit within the original PDO and required expanding it.
Moreover, the Ministry of Economy, where the operation was located, was not the natural
executor for such endeavors, which would have been more appropriately implemented
within Jefatura--as they eventually were under the State Modernization Loan (Loan No.
4423-AR). The subsequent inclusion in mid-2002 of two additional financial
administration tools--i.e., the SLU and the UEPEX--were more compatible with the
operation, since all responsible parties were under the Ministry of Economy.

Lack of adequate counterpart funds: Insufficient budgetary allocations for the project as
a result of tight budgetary conditions represented a bottleneck from 1999 until 2003,
contributing to the slow down in project implementation. At the same time, the
devaluation of the Peso that took place in early 2002 generated additional resources, as
the hard-currency loan proceeds were multiply by almost a factor of 3 for the purchase of
domestic goods and services. Moreover, the strong support from the Director of the
Budget's Office was a key factor ensuring that the project had sufficient counterpart
funds during the last stage of implementation.

Too narrow focus on training and ex-ante project evaluation: During its implementation,
the project suffered from an excessive focus on capacity building (particularly training) at
the expense of a more result-oriented focus on structural changes in the public investment
and financial management systems, which reduced project impact and sustainability.
Within capacity building, efforts focused on training in the preparation of public
investment projects and ex-ante evaluation, without giving much attention to on-going
and ex-post evaluation.

Poor fiduciary reporting: In December 2004, the supervision mission identified poor
reporting by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), which led to thorough ex-post reviews
(see Section 7.4). While both the Bank and the government teams fully acknowledge the
necessity to conduct ex-post reviews and to take corrective financial, procurement or
administrative actions during a regular process of supervision to ensure operations/ full
compliance with all regulations, they also recognize that the due diligence process
severely disrupted implementation and supervision efforts, as these activities consumed
the attention and energy of all actors. The government cooperated in providing all the
requested information.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
(a)     M&E Design: As mentioned earlier, the design of the monitoring and evaluation
indicators was not fully developed at appraisal, particularly in terms of capturing the
operation's overall impact.

(b)     M&E Implementation:         The project was not retrofitted into the Results
Framework, so the original weakness in the M&E persisted during implementation. The
PDO indicators included in the ISRs (i.e. strengthening of the National Directorate of
Public Investment, Social Expenditures and Projects with International Organizations to
provide guidance and support to expenditure agencies) referred to objectives rather than
outcomes. Likewise, additional outcomes were added over the years to the already
original long list to reflect the successive amendments. As a result of this piecemeal
approach, the project's formal M&E framework was largely ineffective.            However,
information of key project outcomes was regularly recorded as part of the project's
implementation and supervision. This information has proved vital to assess the project's
overall impact and was included in the Results Framework developed in June 2006 by the
supervision team in preparation for the project's closing.

(c)     M&E Utilization: The frequent changes in administration had a detrimental effect
on project implementation, as each administration revised the activities being financed
under the project according to its own priorities. In an attempt to respond to the needs of
the various administrations, the project ended up financing an extremely diverse set of
activities over the life of the project, as opposed to the set of activities that were
envisioned--albeit vaguely--at appraisal. The Action Plans agreed with the Bank on an
annual basis as well as the Mid-term Review were useful in providing some structuring
for the revised project activities, helping compensate for the disruptions in the project's
conceptual and strategic continuity resulting from the frequent changes in management
that took place until mid-2002.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
As mentioned earlier, the Bank Fiduciary team raised concerns regarding the
arrangements--procurement, financial management, and potential conflict on interest--
between the PCU and a local non-government organization (Asociación Argentina de
Evaluación ­ ASAE) whose creation had been supported by the Bank as part of the 1999
restructuring to manage and provide training funded by the project. A thorough fiduciary
due diligence process took place, which included Legal/Procurement and Financial
Management reviews as well as extensive discussions with the authorities. The key
findings reported by the Regional Vice-Presidency of the due diligence process were: i)
there was no mis-procurement in the FOSIP-ASAE context; and ii) funds transferred
from FOSIP to ASAE were accounted for and the amounts transferred to ASAE had been
used for the purpose of the project and expenditures were eligible. Under the Bank
Consultant Guidelines (1981) prevailing at the time FOSIP was approved, the hiring of
government staff as done by ASAE (which is also legal in Argentina for training




                                             12

purposes) was acceptable to the Bank.2 As FOSIP was an ongoing project at the time,
ASAE subsequently provided the services for which project funds had been already
transferred and provided supporting documentation satisfactory to both FOSIP and the
Bank. Fiduciary risk mitigating measures are being put in place for all the follow-up
operations, including Governance 21, capitalizing on the lessons learned under FOSIP
and the preventive measures that were subsequently adopted.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
The framework provided by the SNIP Law (Law No. 24.354) guarantees the
institutionalization of the SNIP. By law, the SNIP constitutes an element of the formal
budget (Proyecto de Ley de Presupuesto). Only those public investments that are
included in the BAPIN can have a budgetary allocation, thus ensuring that all investments
in the PNIP meet the basic quality requirements established the DNIP. The DNIP is a
permanent entity within the Ministry of Economy's Secretariat of Economic
Programming, with its own budgetary allocation. The follow-up operation currently being
prepared--Governance 21--will continue to support the further development of the SNIP
and the SIDIF.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
At the government's request, a follow-up operation (Governance 21, FY 2008) is
currently being prepared, which will consolidate and expand upon the progress achieved
under FOSIP, including expanding the integrated financial management information
system (SIDIF) at the national level and the public investment management system
(BAPIN) at the sub-national level. More than a decade after it was prepared, the FOSIP
project is still consistent with the objectives established under the current CAS.
Specifically, by strengthening transparency, efficiency and accountability of public
expenditure management at different levels of government, the operation is fully
consistent with the current CAS objective of improved governance (p. 30, CY 2006-2008
CAS).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)
Overall, the operation is ranked as moderately satisfactory. Despite the obstacles and
challenges faced during its implementation, the operation has made a substantial

contribution toward improving Argentina's investment processes, strengthening project
analysis capabilities, and building up project and program evaluation capacity. While the
tools, processes and human capacity developed under FOSIP have contributed to enhance
the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's public expenditure management
under the SNIP, the government has yet to fully capitalize on the potential benefits of this
enhanced institutional and technical capacity by including all major public investments--
including those presently financed under fiduciary funds--under the SINP. Hence, the
project is ranked moderately satisfactory with respect to the original PDO of enhancing
the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's public expenditure management.
The additional PDO added in 2000 has been only partially met; while the FOSIP
operation succeeded in furthering a results-oriented management approach within the
national government though the implementation of financial management tools, it has not
significantly advanced the development of management tools focusing on the monitoring
of services to the public. The achievement of objectives can be summarized as follows:

PDO 1 - Enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's public
expenditure management: The operation has moderately satisfactorily met the
objective of enhancing public expenditure management. Having succeeded in: i)
improving the investment process; ii) strengthening project analysis capabilities; and iii)
building up project and program evaluation capacity, the operation has set the
foundations for enhancing public expenditure management not only within the SNIP but
also among sub-national governments. Although it is not yet possible to fully gauge the
impact of the operation in terms of improved project execution rates, increased internal
rates of return and other performance measures (in fact, an M&E system that includes
these and other performance measures will be developed under the follow-up operation),
the public investment management tools developed under FOSIP have been critical in
allowing the current administration to implement a massive increase in public investment
without overwhelming the national government's management capacity. Specifically, the
FOSIP operation provided needed support to the newly established DNIP, so it could
fulfill its responsibilities under the law, including: creating a public investment evaluation
system within the national government; developing an inventory of public investment
projects; providing training for public officials at all levels of government on project
evaluation; annually preparing the public investment plan; and expanding the SNIP
among provincial and municipal governments. However, the government has not yet
fully capitalized on the potential benefits of the institutional and technical capacity built
under FOSIP, as a significant proportion of public investments are not included under the
SNIP. For example, major public investments in the areas of energy and transport are
financed under fiduciary funds. These public investments are implemented outside the
SNIP and, therefore, are not subjected to the SNIP's legislative and technical controls.

The individual achievements can be summarized as follows:

National Public Investment System (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública ­ SNIP):
With support from the operation, the DNIP has successfully established a National Public
Investment System (SNIP), including developing a set of principles, norms, procedures,
as well as an information system to support the preparation and management of the




                                                14

national public investment plan. The main characteristics of the SNIP can be summarized
as follows:

    Dynamic outlook: It encompasses the entire life span of public investment projects,
    from identification to ex-post control and evaluation.
    Decentralized conceptual design: It was designed for multiple users, taking into
    account the different actors, their multiple roles, and the three levels of government.
    Supportive ICT platform: The web-environment utilized for the inventory of public
    investment projects permits users from locations across the country to access the
    system through Internet.
    Shared methodology: It establishes shared norms and procedures to be used by public
    sector users at all levels of government. As a result, the evaluation methodology and
    criteria such as shadow prices, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates, are now
    homogenous throughout Argentina's public sector, with the consequent gains in terms
    of transparency and internal consistency.
    Quality control: The DNIP is now working closely with public agencies within the
    national government during budget preparation in the ex-ante evaluation of projects
    that are greater than Arg.$5.6 million.

Although the SNIP has achieved a considerable institutional presence and identity within
the public sector as a whole, its insertion within individual agencies remains uneven. The
number of investment projects being incorporated to the BAPIN varies greatly among
agencies, as does the quality of the information. In some agencies, the impact of FOSIP's
training has been rather diluted. Some entities, however, such as the Armed Forces, have
wholeheartedly embraced the SNIP, its evaluation methodologies and the use of the
BAPIN as indispensable management tool. Out of BAPIN's 1160 users, 250 correspond
to the armed forces. The Aeronautical Higher Education Institute (Instituto Universitario
Aeronáutico - IAU) has incorporated the post-graduate course on project evaluation as
part of its regular curricula, opening enrollment to students outside the armed forces and
even international students. The IAU regularly conducts training on the use of BAPIN for
administrative units of the armed forces across the country, inviting also municipal and
provincial personnel to attend the courses.

Inventory of Public Investment Projects (Banco de Proyectos de Inversión Pública -
BAPIN): The operation has effectively supported the development and implementation of
an information system on all public investment projects identified by government
agencies. The BAPIN provides an updated inventory of all public investment projects,
which is organized in three basic modules: pre-investment, implementation and operation.
In its new version, the BAPIN operates in a decentralized manner, with each government
agency being responsible for uploading the information on its investment projects. Its
ICT platform operates on a relational database (SQL server) that permits the large
quantities of registries associated with such system and ensures the security and integrity
of the information. The BAPIN II has a use-friendly Window-based interface, which has
facilitated the expansion of the system among a wide array of institutional users.

The consolidation of the BAPIN system has been gradual and steady since it was first
implemented in 2003. As of October 2006, it had 1,160 institutional users and 6,455



                                             15

projects amounting to Arg.$212 billions. At the national level, the BAPIN is operational
in 392 administrative units within 120 administrative units (Servicios Administrativos
Financieros - SAFs) distributed among 233 public agencies, including, among others,
113 national government agencies, 34 decentralized state enterprises, 17 fiduciary funds,
and 39 national universities.

The BAPIN system has been universally accessible through its public web-site since
January 2006, permitting the consultation of basic data of public investment projects
using various data filters through a user-friendly interface.3 This constitutes a major step
toward enhanced transparency and accountability, as the projects presented by individual
government agencies as well as the quality of the information they upload to the system
is now available to the general public. The SEP has subscribed a cooperation agreement
with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) by which it will
share the BAPIN software among member countries interested in developing their own
public investment systems.

National Public Investment Plan (Plan Nacional de Inversiones Públicas - PNIP): Since
2003, the DNIP has regularly prepared a National Public Investment Plan, which includes

                                                 16

all public investment projects proposed for implementation within a three-year time
horizon that have full or partial financial support from the national government--even if
they are implemented by provincial or municipal governments. The National Public
Investment Plan is formulated taking into consideration public investments from two
main perspectives: i) as means to increase the productive capacity of Argentina's public
sector--in this regard, public investments are evaluated in terms of their economic, social
and environmental impacts; and ii) as generators of financial commitments, both in terms
of the actual investments and the operational costs. The 2007-2009 PNIP includes over
2,000 public investment projects for a total amount of roughly Arg.$4.9 billion.

The quality of the individual public investments has improved considerably, as to be
included in the PNIP and to have a budget allocation, public investments have to be
incorporated into the BAPIN. The required use of BAPIN, which is based on the logical
framework (i.e., it requires the definition of objectives linked to outcomes, to monitor
their implementation and impacts), has contributed toward establishing a system aimed at
enhancing project quality. Moreover, public investments greater than Arg.$5.6 million
are required by law to have the DNIP's approval in terms of their technical and economic
soundness. Projects with an EIRR estimated in excess of 12 percent are considered a
higher priority for realization. In this regard, the fact that the DNIP is within the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy helps ensure the independence and soundness of
quality-control mechanisms.

There is still substantial room for improvement regarding the PNIP selection process. The
DNIP takes into consideration the public investment projects proposed by individual
government agencies and, based on the specific budget allocation for each agency and
explicit technical criteria, it then recommends to each government agency the relative
priority it should assign to its various public investment projects. The final selection,
however, is the responsibility of each individual agency. Congress also has a say
regarding the composition of the PNIP, while Jefatura, with its newly acquired
`superpowers,' has a final veto power over the PNIP. Therefore, although the current
PNIP prioritization process is clearly superior to the previous selection practices, which
were more ad hoc and less transparent, there are still some loopholes to be closed.

Expansion of the SNIP among sub-national governments: Sub-national governments have
exhibited a strong interest in the development of the SNIP, both nationally and within
their own jurisdictions. DNIP's statistics show that provincial users are the most frequent
users of the national BAPIN system--i.e., provincial users show on average 3.1 visits per
month to the national BAPIN site compared to 1.7 visits per month for their national
counterparts. Provinces and municipalities have also been invited to adopt a public
investment system of characteristics similar to those of the SNIP within their own
jurisdiction. The development of these systems and local BAPINs is proving to be of
strong interest among provincial and municipal governments. Specifically, provincial
governments were invited to subscribe a formal agreement with the Minister of Economy
to join the SNIP. By this agreement, the province agreed to develop a public investment
system of similar characteristics at the provincial level and to establish a counterpart
office. In turn, the Ministry of Economy agreed to install the BAPIN system in the
province, provide technical training on both BAPIN and project evaluation


                                             17

methodologies, and supply the necessary equipment. Today, all provinces except La
Pampa have formally adhered to the SNIP. Thirteen provinces have uploaded 230
projects on the national BAPIN system (provinces can incorporate their own projects as
well as those under the jurisdiction of national agencies that are of provincial interest but
have not been incorporated to the BAPIN by the responsible agency). In addition, 18
provinces have their provincial BAPIN systems operational, containing information on
over 4,700 projects (it is important to note, however, that the quality and level of
development of provincial BAPIN varies greatly among provinces). Following the
example of the national government, two provinces--Santa Fe and Entre Ríos--also
publish their BAPINs online.

An overall respect for the autonomy of provincial governments has facilitated the
expansion of the SNIP at the sub-national level. While the SNIP provides full
accessibility from the bottom-up--i.e., provincial governments have full access to the
national BAPIN system--there is no top-down visibility (that is, the national government
does not have access to the provincial BAPINs), except for those projects that are
voluntarily included in the national BAPIN by provincial and municipal governments.
Some groups of provinces, such as those in the northwest region (i.e., Catamarca, Jujuy,
Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán) have formally agreed to share the information
on their provincial BAPINs to facilitate inter-provincial coordination. The SNIP has also
begun its expansion at the municipal level, as provincial governments have, in turn,
subscribed agreements with their municipal governments. By mid-2006, more than 200
municipalities in six provinces had established their own municipal BAPINs.

Equipment to support the establishment of the BAPIN at the provincial level has been
provided to 21 provinces. In addition, the DNIP has provided training to all but two
provinces on basic project evaluation methodology and the utilization of the BAPIN, as
well as to municipalities in four provinces.

Capacity Building in Project Evaluation: The operation supported an extensive and wide
ranging capacity building strategy, which proved vital to the establishment of the SNIP
within the national government as well as sub-national governments. With the operation's
support, the DNIP's evaluation methodologies were disseminated among public officials
throughout the national administration and sub-national governments, together with
training in the utilization of the BAPIN. In addition, over 565 professionals received
post-graduate training under the operation on project evaluation throughout a network of
12 national universities located throughout the country and ASAE, the majority of which
are public employees. Over 112 projects were formally evaluated as part of the post-
graduate courses. In addition, a large array of capacity building activities was carried out
under the operation, as detailed in Table 1. The results from two electronic surveys aimed
at measuring the impact of the post-graduate courses offered by the network of
universities are described in Annex 5. In brief, course coordinators stress the impact of
the capacity building activities implemented by the universities in terms of establishing a
common evaluation methodology, promoting an inter-disciplinary approach to project
evaluation, and setting the foundations for a national network of project evaluators.
Course participants--the majority of whom are public employees--report that the



                                             18

training on project evaluation has been relevant for their professional activities. In
general, both course coordinators and participants gave high marks to the quality of the
course and the bibliography. Alternatively, the low enrollment and graduation rates
corresponding to ASAE's e-learning course on project evaluation suggest that further
improvement is needed in terms of the course's content, delivery and marketing.4

The main characteristics of the capacity building strategy implemented under the FOSIP
operation can be summarized as follows:

    Capacity building was conceived as a vital tool to ensure the development, expansion
    and consolidation of the SNIP.
    It targeted not only the national government but provincial and municipal
    governments as well.
    Learning from the failure of the capacity building efforts due to the excessive
    academic focus early on in the project, after the 1999 restructuring, capacity building
    was conceived as a menu of alternatives that responded to the different audiences,
    purposes, and tools, including:
        Capacity building activities of a more general nature aimed at a wider audience.
        Training on basic project evaluation and utilization of the BAPIN among public
        officials at all levels of government.
        Post-graduate courses on project evaluation for professionals working within both
        the public and private sectors through a network of national universities.
        Post-graduate courses on project evaluation for public sector professionals within
        the national government, offered by the SEP in conjunction with ASAE.
        An electronic course on project evaluation has been developed to expand capacity
        building beyond traditional classroom setting.
    A total of 12 national universities--six in 2003 and an additional six in 2004--were
    recruited to offer post-graduate courses on project evaluation to professionals in their
    respective geographic areas. This constituted an important first step toward
    developing a permanent capacity building network covering the entire country that
    capitalizes on the universities' academic resources and infrastructure, as well as their
    knowledge of local conditions and needs, as well as their links with local actors, both
    public and private, that play key roles in the regional development process.
    All individual capacity activities sought to bring together a diverse audience with
    multi-disciplinary backgrounds.
    The adopted evaluation methodology and vocabulary was systematically used in all
    capacity building activities to ensure homogeneity of criteria and internal consistency.
    A through textbook authored by a renowned project evaluation specialist was printed
    under the operation and distributed among the course participants.
    A non-government organization (Asociación Argentina de Evaluadores ­ ASAE) was
    established to achieve the sustainability of capacity building efforts beyond the life of
    the project and the financial support of the SEP, although so far such experience has
    had limited success.
    The SEP has played a key role as the architect and engine of the capacity building
    strategy.

As part of the FOSIP's capacity building strategy, the DNIP has actively supported the
expansion of the SNIP at the sub-national level through an aggressive dissemination
strategy. Regional meetings were held to present the SNIP and the BAPIN to provincial
governments. Subsequent meetings with participation of provincial authorities have been
conducted regularly, both in Buenos Aires and at the regional level, to identify common
challenges confronting provincial governments and facilitate the exchange of information
among them. In addition, the DNIP has actively supported provincial governments in



                                              20

their efforts to develop their own public investment systems and those of their
municipalities through ongoing technical assistance.

PDO 2 ­ Establish within the public administration at the national level a: i) results-
oriented management approach; and ii) monitoring tools for citizen review of agency
performance. This objective, which was added as part of the loan amendment of June
2000, was only partially met. Although the PDO responded to the reform modernization
agenda of the incoming de la Rua administration, the implementation of the
corresponding loan components soon lost momentum, once the champion of the
modernization efforts--vice-president Alvarez--resigned in             October 2000. The
objective of contributing toward the establishment of a results-framework approach was
achieved, albeit indirectly, through the implementation of two financial administration
tools: i) a management and budget control system (UEPEX) for executing units funded
by external loans; ii) the further development of the financial administration system
(SIDIF) through the implementation of the Local Unified SIDIF (SLU); and iii) the
conceptual development of the web-SIDIF, the next generation of the SIDIF. Conversely,
no progress was made toward the development of public service standards, for which this
part of the PDO was not achieved. The individual achievements of the FOSIP operation
contributing toward the second PDO can be summarized as follows:

Management and budget control system for project executing units - UEPEX): This
system was aimed at supporting the financial administration of executing units funded by
loans from International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Specifically, the project supported
the upgrading of the UEPEX system--which was designed under a previous IADB
operation--transforming it into a multi-annual budget and multi-currencies system. The
system's redesign also included the production of reports requested by the DIFIP,
including conciliation of funds, financial and disbursement reports and details of
payments. In addition, the UEPEX's technology platform was also updated. The UEPEX
can accommodate the significant variation exhibited by the projects, including
decentralized executing units at the sub-national level, allowing up to 30 simultaneous
users per project. Provincial governments that receive direct international loans are also
provided free access to the UEPEX.

As of mid-2006, the UEPEX had been implemented in 65 projects, 48 of which are still
active. Presently, the UEPEX covers approximately 54 percent of the overall number of
projects (48 out of a total of 89 projects) and 27 percent in terms of IFI financing (US$2.3
billion out of a US$8.45 billion overall portfolio). Of the 48 projects under UEPEX, 21
have IADB financing (US$ 1.1billion); 13 projects have IBRD financing (US$953
million), and four projects have financing from other IFIs (roughly US$220 million).

The implementation of the UEPEX affects positively several actors. The executing units
are given access to the UEPEX software, as well as its adaptation to the specific
characteristics of the project and training at no cost, thus saving considerable resources
for the purchase of similar systems (over US$400,000 depending on the complexity of
the project, as illustrated by a recent private bid to develop the financial administration
system for an upcoming health loan). Likewise, the UEPEX results in significant savings



                                              21

for public control organisms, such as the Auditing Office (Auditoría General de la
Nación - AGN) as well as the international institutions financing the projects, as the
systems produce standardized reports in a timely manner and in the format required by
each institution.

Local Unified SIDIF (SIDIF Local Unificado ­ SLU): The project has supported the
implementation of the SLU, which was developed under a previous IADB operation, in
public agencies at the national level. Prior to the implementation of the SLU, there were
multiple local applications of the SIDIF, including the SIDIF OD, AC, COMPRE as well
as other systems developed by the agencies themselves. The SLU system has been
implemented in 83 SAFS out a total of 104 SAFs, representing 56 percent of the national
budget (excluding the social security administration - ANSES). The number of users has
also increased from 155 in 2002 to 5014 users in 2006.

The expansion of the SLU through the agencies at the national level is the result of the
inherent advantages for individual agencies, as its adoption was voluntary. Some of the
advantages include: substantial savings in maintenance costs (estimated at roughly US$2
million per year); simplified back-up processes, as these are now centralized within the
Ministry of Economy; optimization of the SIDIF's overall security and communications;
cost reductions in the updating of obsolete systems; and the possibility to migrate
databases to newer versions. A committee of SLU users meets regularly on a bi-weekly
basis to share their experiences and prioritize the applications and additional
functionalities to be developed. The strong support and close involvement from the
leadership in Hacienda, including the Treasurer and the Budget Director has been vital to
the successful implementation of the SLU.

Web-SIDIF: The project also supported the architecture and model design of a new
Internet-based financial management system (Web-SIDIF). In terms of technology, the
new version capitalizes on the last generation of open-source software, such as JAVA. In
terms of conceptual advances, the new version will introduce results-oriented budgeting
processes, thus monitoring both financial and physical execution. It will also introduce a
first attempt at implementing a system of incentives that rewards good performance--for
example, awarding stronger autonomy to those agencies that demonstrate strong
performance.      A pilot version has been developed to formulate the 2007 budget.
Expansion among individual agencies is expected to begin in 2008.

In order to understand the need of multiple clients--not only public sector actors but also
NGOs and universities--in the use of financial information, a participatory process was
implemented, which included workshops and seminars. Thus, the new prototype reflects
substantial input from multiple actors as well as the lessons learned during the
implementation of the SLU. This prototype is an excellent tool for policy makers, since
they can review budget allocations and programs, get detail information of regions, states
and municipalities expenditure levels and evaluate the impact of public resource
allocations. Now, the Ministry of Economy is interested in improving and expanding the
use of this tool to promote regional economic development. Finally, the project facilitated
the review and improvement of budget programmatic structure, budget indicators,



                                             22

preliminary budgeting practices and the pluri-annual budget methodology. These areas
are critical for a second stage of budget reform in Argentina.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Not applicable: Neither Net Present Value nor Economic Rate of Return was estimated
at appraisal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As some of the operation's PDOs were formally expanded in 2000, the operation's
overall outcome rating has been assessed against both the original and revised PDOs, in
accordance with the Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and
the new ICR guidelines issued in August 2006. Overall, the objectives pursued by the
operation are still highly relevant vis-à-vis the current priorities of both the Kirchner
administration and the Bank's current CAS. The operation is rated moderately
satisfactory based on its achievements with respect to the PDOs (see Table 2).

With regard to the original PDO, the operation has helped establish a set of robust
management tools aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the
government's public investment management within the scope of the SNIP. The
operation's impact on the SNIP is clearly reflected in the increasing pool of public
investment projects being submitted by government agencies for their inclusion in the
annual NPIP. Between 2005 and 2007, the number of projects proposed for inclusion in
the NPIP increased from 1,527 to 2,608--a 71 percent increase in just two years. Even
more impressive was the increase in terms of financing, from roughly Arg.$4.1 billion in
2005 to over Arg.$11 billion in 2007--equivalent to a 172 percent increase. As a result
of the enhanced technical capacity and management tools (i.e., BAPIN) supported under
FOSIP, Argentina's government agencies have been able to capitalize on the window of
opportunity that opened from 2003 onward, when the Kirchner administration gave
renewed emphasis to public investments. Had the SNIP not been established, it is
doubtful that the pipeline of public investment projects would have been sufficient to
meet the public investment targets, which increased from Arg.$2.8 to Arg.$4.9 billion in
just two years--between 2005 and 2007 (see Table 2). Unfortunately, there is still a
significant mass of public investment projects that are not part of the SNIP; thus, the
impact of the operation in terms of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the
government's overall public expenditure management at the national level has been only
partial.

At the sub-national level, the FOSIP operation has had a greater impact than originally
envisioned in terms of enhancing public investment mechanisms, as provincial and
municipal governments were not directly targeted as part of the original design.5

With respect to the additional PDO, the operation has helped further develop a results-
oriented management approach within the national government through the
implementation of financial management tools but has had little impact in establishing a
system to monitor public sector levels of service, Considering the two components
associated with the added PDO were assigned only US$0.7 million--less than 7 percent
of the total loan amount--its partial achievement is not considered to merit downgrading
the operation's rating of moderately satisfactory during the post-amendment period.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

By supporting the development of a public investment management system at all levels
of government--including project identification, preparation, evaluation as well as
selection--the operation is expected to have a positive impact--albeit difficult to
quantify--on the country's productivity and equity. It has long been recognized that an
adequate supply of infrastructure services is an essential ingredient for productivity and
widely shared growth. Argentina's history, however, suggests that underinvestment in
infrastructure has contributed to the opposite outcome, slowing down growth and
increasing poverty and marginalization. In the 1980s, public investment in infrastructure
(defined as water and sanitation, transport, energy and telecommunications) averaged
around 3 percent of GDP. During the 1990s, this fell to about one-half of one percent,
and by 2000 to one-quarter of one percent. This collapse in public investment was only
partially offset by private sector investment, which amounted to about 1.2 percent of
GDP during this period (of this, over half went to telecommunications), leaving total
investment in infrastructure at about 2 percent of GDP. While public investment has more
than doubled since 2002, reaching 1.5 percent of GDP in 2004, Argentina's infrastructure
deficit still remains substantial and a detriment to the country's competitiveness.
Logistics costs, for example, are estimated to be the second highest in Latin America and
nearly three times higher than the OECD average. Recent analysis suggests that
improving infrastructure stocks to the level of the regional leader--i.e., Costa Rica--
could result in an increase in the GDP growth rate of 1.3 percentage points.6 The same
study finds that it would have a similarly marked effect on poverty; the impact for
Argentina of improving its infrastructure performance to the level of Costa Rica would be
a reduction of its Gini coefficient by 0.04.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
longer-term capacity and institutional development):

The operation's impact on institutional strengthening has been high, helping develop
public investment programming and financial management tools aimed to enhance public
resource management within the SNIP. With the operation's support, the DNIP has built
a sound reputation and plays an increasingly prominent role in the programming of public
investments. Although there are some areas in which the DNIP still requires
strengthening, it largely fulfills the responsibilities assigned to it by the SNIP Law. The
operation's main institutional impacts can be summarized as follows:

National Public Investment Plan: Some of the specific advantages resulting from the
implementation of the PNIP include:



6   Calderon and Servin (2004), The effects of Infrastructure Development on Growth and Income
Distribution, The World Bank, Washington, D.C.


                                              26

   The PNIP is now an integral part of the annual budgetary cycle. The PINP is part of
   the formal budget (Proyecto de Ley de Presupuesto), while the multi-year plan (i.e.,
   years 2 and 3) is considered to be complementary information.
   The preparation of the PNIP responds to clearly defined set of procedures that involve
   several key actors, including the DNIP, the government agencies responsible for the
   individual public investment projects, Jefatura, the national Budget Office and
   Congress; thus enhancing transparency in the selection of public investments.
   Public investments included in the NPIP have been evaluated using the same
   evaluation methodologies, including pricing, indicators, and decision criteria, thus
   ensuring internal consistency and homogeneity of criteria across the public sector.
   Only those public investments that have been incorporated into the BAPIN can have a
   budget allocation, which effectively enhances the quality of the investments included
   in the SNIP, as they are then subjected to the ex-ante quality control of the DNIP.
   Provincial governments are formally consulted on their own priorities as part of the
   preparation of the PNIP.
   Better financial management, as the financial commitments associated with the NPIP,
   both in terms of the actual investments and the operation costs are properly accounted
   for in the corresponding budget.
   Increased technical capacity on project evaluation at all levels of government.

Implementation of the BAPIN: The implementation of an inventory of public investment
projects that includes all levels of government has had a significant impact in enhancing
public investments programming by:

   Providing relevant, timely and reliable information on public investments at different
   stage in the project cycle to allow for the monitoring of both individual projects and
   the national investment plan as a whole.
   Standardizing procedures, data and database formats to facilitate the exchange and
   dissemination of information, thus enhancing the capacity for implementation
   monitoring.
   Providing integrated information on public investments at the national, provincial and
   municipal levels.
   Applying explicit criteria to project evaluation.
   Fostering the vertical integration of public investments by facilitating consultation
   between the national, provincial and municipal levels of government.
   Fostering the horizontal integration of public investments by facilitating consultation
   among provincial governments and among municipal governments.
   Contributing to enhanced transparency and dissemination of the information among
   the general public, as two of the provincial BAPINs and the national one are available
   to the general public through the Internet.
   Enhanced public investment mechanisms at the provincial and municipal levels as a
   result of the implementation of the sub-national BAPINs.

UEPEX system: In addition to the advantages described above in terms of savings, the
implementation of the UEPEX has enhanced the transparency in the management of
proceeds from loans and donations from IFIs. Other advantages include:




                                            27

   It brings homogeneity and internal consistency in financial management throughout a
   diverse portfolio of operations.
   It helps produce executing units timely and reliable financial statements.

Implementation of the SLU: Some of the advantages of the expansion of the SLU
include:

   Considerable reduction in the maintenance costs of financial administration systems.
   Simplified back-up processes, which are now centralized within the Ministry of
   Economy.
   Optimization of the SIDIF's overall security and communications
   Cost reduction in the updating obsolete systems.
   Possibility to migrate databases to newer versions.

Pending challenges: While the SNIP has been successfully established within Argentina's
public sector and BAPIN has attained a critical mass in terms of users and projects,
significant challenges still remain, including:

   To continue to enhance project quality in terms of identification, evaluation, and
   prioritization.
   To link the SNIP and, within it, the BAPIN to the country's financial administration
   system (SIDIF).
   To go beyond project identification and ex-ante evaluation to focus more on project
   implementation and ex-post evaluation.
   To further institutionalize the DNIP, as almost half of the professionals are
   consultants rather than permanent employees. This generates a parallel structure
   within the public administration, with staff of similar background and experience
   having substantial differences in salary, benefits and even travel policies. This has
   resulted in a high turnover among consultant staff, potentially undermining the
   DNIP's technical capacity.
   To continue to increase the quality of BAPIN information, as the rapid expansion of
   the BAPIN since 2003 has been somewhat at the expense of quality, as more
   emphasis was placed on incorporating projects than on ensuring the quality of the
   information.
   To include public investments financed through fiduciary funds, which are currently
   not included in the SNIP since in the national budget they are shown as transfers to
   provincial and municipal governments. Thus, despite representing a significant share
   of public investments with national financing (there were Arg.$4.8 billions budgeted
   for fiduciary funds in 2007, a significant portion of which are expected to be allocated
   to public investments), they are excluded from the SNIP. Clearly, their inclusion is
   important, not only because of their relative weight but also because of the inter-
   jurisdictional nature.
   To continue the process of establishing the SNIP and BAPIN at the provincial and
   municipal level to capitalize on the potential for vertical (national government-
   provincial governments-municipal governments) and horizontal (among provinces
   and among municipalities) coordination among the three levels of governments.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

As mentioned earlier, the FOSIP has helped set the foundations for a more robust public
investment system, including capacity building in project preparation and evaluation at
various levels of government and in the implementation of a national public investment
system. These achievements are particularly important in view of the renewed emphasis
given to public investments as an engine of growth and redistribution in the Kirchner
administration. The project has not only provided tools for improving public investment
management and, thereby, increasing the economic return of public investments during a
period of heavy investment activity, but also provided a pool of public investment
projects that has made possible the implementation of such strategy.

This operation can also be expected to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of
the Bank's own portfolio in Argentina. Specifically, the benefits of having in place
improved mechanisms for public investment programming and project evaluation are
particularly significant when considering that the current CAS proposes a US$3.3 billion
lending program that, at the request of the authorities, is made up exclusively of
investment operations. Likewise, the linkage between the NPIP and the annual budget
ensures that the financial resources associated with each operation will be available,
ameliorating the risk of lack of counterpart funds which has been significant in the past.
Finally, the UEPEX can be expected to improve financial management and supervision
of fiduciary aspects of individual Bank operations--13 operations at this point.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
See Annex 5 for a detailed description of the results from two electronic surveys were
conducted as part of the ICR preparation to assess the impact of the capacity building
activities that were implemented under the FOSIP operation..

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating: Moderate

The achievements attained under the operation are likely to be sustained, both in public
investments programming and in financial management. Specifically, the framework
provided by the SNIP Law (Law No. 24.354) makes its sustainability likely. Likewise,
Argentina's financial administration system is already firmly inserted within the national
government. Argentina was one of LAC countries that pioneered integrated financial
management, beginning in 1992 with the approval of the financial administration Law
(Ley de Administración Financiera y los Sistemas de Control Público; Law No. 24.156;
30 September 1992).

Other factors contributing to the sustainability of the achievements of this operation can
be summarized as follows:




                                            29

   Multiple actors: The universal consultation of the project data bank and the multiple
actors that are formally involved in the preparation of the NPIP not only increases the
transparency of the overall process but makes any reversals more unlikely.
   Decentralized nature of the SNIP: The expansion of the SNIP and the BAPIN among
sub-national governments and the autonomy of the provincial BAPIN systems is a factor
contributing toward sustainability, since potential reversals at the national level would not
necessarily threaten the sustainability at the provincial level.
   DNIP's independence: The fact that the DNIP is housed under the Ministry of
Economy as opposed to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning helps ensure that the
independence and soundness of quality-control mechanisms of the SNIP.
   Agreements with other countries: The high visibility that is being given to the SNIP
and the BAPIN through international cooperation agreements such as the one with the
CABEI contributes toward the sustainability of the system.
   Follow-up operation: The Governance 21 operation currently under preparation will
support the further strengthening of Argentina's public investment and financial
administration systems, giving continuity to the strengthening efforts of the FOSIP
operation. Specifically:

   a) Public investment programming: With respect to the SNIP, the new operation will
   focus on: i) developing a simplified set of indicators and methodologies for project
   evaluation to facilitate the objective comparison of alternative investment projects
   according to key indicators (e.g. minimum cost or investment prices); ii) expanding
   capabilities for ex-post monitoring and evaluation needs; iii) further integrating the
   public investment system with the financial management system and other systems,
   such as procurement; and iv) promoting greater interaction among different levels of
   government, the private sector and civil society to help identify priorities, make
   public investment more responsive to sub-national needs and send appropriate signals
   to regional economic development, e.g. by strategic investment planning.

   b) Financial management: The new operation will provide continuity to the efforts of
   FOSIP and previous Bank operations by focusing on: extending coverage of the SLU
   and web-SIDIF instruments throughout the national administration; ii) strengthening
   budgeting, accounting and treasury systems to help achieve a greater focus on results-
   oriented budgeting; iii) further developing internal and external controls to ensure
   greater availability and quality of information will help to make this more accessible
   to the legislative, the civil society, and to sub-national governments to allow
   improved budget transparency, accountability, including external M&E; and iv) to
   promote greater integration with the public investment system and the national
   procurement information system needs to be further pursued and linkages with other
   systems require greater strengthening, e.g. procurement, tax administration and
   human resource management

The sustainability of capacity building efforts is more uncertain. The ASAE was
originally conceived as a mechanism to ensure the sustainability of the capacity building
efforts independently of the availability of project or public funds. Unfortunately, these
expectations have not materialized, since ASAE has not yet developed into an authority



                                              30

in the field of project evaluation. In terms of the network of national universities, all but
one managed to offer the post-graduate course in 2005 without funding from FOSIP.
Moreover, four universities are in the process of developing a formal post-graduate
degree on project evaluation, building upon the FOSIP experience. Although these are
encouraging signals, it is not clear whether these efforts will be sustainable in the longer
term.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

  Rating:        Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was
moderately satisfactory. The Bank correctly identified an important weakness within
Argentina's public sector and effectively capitalized on the presence of a reform-minded
administration and the recent approval of a legal framework conducive to the
development of a modern public investment system. In its original design, the operation
adequately incorporated key lessons learned during previous operations, focusing TA
beyond the DNIP to include also other public agencies within the national government.
However, the operation's design also exhibited substantial weaknesses, including a
narrow emphasis on training and dissemination activities, a lack of maturity regarding the
overall institutional development strategy, a partial assessment of risks, and a weak M&E
framework. Although these weaknesses did not fully account for the delays in
implementation, they were a contributing factor.

(b)      Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

 Rating:       Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the Bank's supervision for this operation is deemed moderately satisfactory.
Supervision at early stages of implementation was rated marginally unsatisfactory by an
independent Quality of Supervision Assessment (9 April 1997). Overall, the assessment
rated the supervision efforts as marginal in terms of the focus on development impact,
supervision of fiduciary aspects and the adequacy of supervision processes, and as
unsatisfactory in terms of the realism of the project performance rating. The specific
aspects flagged as unsatisfactory included: disbursements compliance (i.e., special
accounts reviews, SOE processes); performance and progress monitoring (i.e., use of key
indicators, progress reporting, and attention to results); the degree of involvement of the
Resident Mission and its contribution; the quality of Aid-Memoirs and follow-up letters;
the relationships with the Borrower, management input and supervision reporting.
Supervision seems to have improved subsequently, as denoted by the more substantial
supervision reports--Aide Memoirs, Back-to-Office reports and Project Status Reports--
that appear in the project's electronic file document thereafter. The quality of supervision



                                              31

increased substantially from 2000 onwards, when a new supervision team was assigned
to the project. From this point onward, the Bank's supervision team exhibited both strong
technical skills and commitment, developing a close working relationship with the
various SEP administrations and PCU management teams, which contributed to the
project's turn-around.

Factors beyond the influence of the Bank made supervision efforts more difficult. The
numerous changes in administration (for example, there had been five different National
Project Directors appointed by October 1997), the changing priorities of the SEP
authorities, or their plain indifference during extended periods of time presented serious
challenges to the supervision process. In addition, the deteriorating macroeconomic
conditions from 1998 onward, which led to the country's economic collapse in December
2001 made supervision efforts particularly difficult. The project's importance steadily
diminished as the macroeconomic conditions continued to worsen. The annual Actions
Plans detailing the specific tasks to be carried out during each year helped to bring some
structure to the implementation process. Overall, the supervision team's strong technical
skills and sustained commitment were key factors determining the project's eventual
turn-around from mid-2002 onward.

In 1996 and again 1998, the project was rated `Unsatisfactory' in terms of both the
achievement of project development objectives and its implementation progress as a
result of its lack of overall progress. The project's restructuring in 1999 had an overall
positive impact on the project, as it addressed some of the original weaknesses in design,
sharpened its focus, and adopted a more mature institutional development strategy that,
among other things, sought to expand the SNIP among sub-national governments,
develop a sustainable capacity building strategy by involving a network of universities
throughout the country, and redesign the BAPIN as a decentralized public investment
management tool. These changes proved critical to the achievement of the project's
original objectives during the last stage of its implementation.

With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that the 2000 loan amendment detracted
from the project's original focus, adding more complexity to the operation's already
challenging implementation process. The political support that motivated the addition of
two public sector modernization components focusing on results management and public
service standards evaporated just a few months after the amendment, leaving behind an
awkward add-on to the original project. The Bank's supervision team was able to
ameliorate the negative impact by bringing under the operation's umbrella the
implementation of two financial management tools--the SLU and the UEPEX--which
were successfully implemented.

The Bank's supervision team reacted swiftly when fiduciary concerns arose, addressing
them thoroughly and in close collaboration with the Bank's fiduciary teams.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

  Rating:    Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory for the
reasons outlined above. Despite its long and sometimes disheartening implementation
process, the operation succeeded in establishing the SNIP within the three levels of
government and setting the foundations for its further strengthening. The ultimate success
of the project was largely the result of the conceptual changes introduced during the 1999
restructuring. Alternatively, the 2000 amendment that added the public sector
modernization components proved to be detrimental to the project. Over the life of the
project, the Bank exhibited substantial flexibility to accommodate the needs of the
various administrations, at times overestimating the authorities' political will and the
PCU's implementation capacity in view of the numerous closing extensions. The Bank's
team and the CMU thoroughly addressed the fiduciary concerns. It is also important to
note that the unwavering commitment of the supervision team, which succeeded in
maintaining a close relationship with the PCU even throughout the most
difficult implementation periods, has been critical to the operation's success.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:

  Rating:    Moderately Satisfactory

The overall government's performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. Support for
the project was lacking during extended periods of time, which severely undermined its
implementation. The achievements of the operation have to be attributed primarily to
those responsible for the Secretariat of Economic Programming in 1999 and from mid-
2002 onward. The 1999 SEP leadership correctly identified the main weaknesses in the
original institutional development strategy and devised the conceptual blueprint for the
institutionalization of the SNIP among the three levels of government. The current
administration, which has been responsible for the project since mid-2002, has provided
strong leadership and momentum, making it possible to insert the DNIP within
Argentina's public sector, consolidate the SNIP within the national administration and
aggressively expand it to provincial and municipal levels of government. Likewise, the
strong support from the director of the Budget Office was indispensable for the
implementation of the SLU. Likewise, the DNIP has played a key role in actively
supporting the expansion of the SNIP at the sub-national level as well as the
establishment of similar public investment management systems in individual provinces.
While the 1999 and current SEP and Budget Office authorities gave their full,
unwavering support to the Project, other administrations were rather indifferent toward its
implementation.




                                              33

(b) Implementing Agency:

  Rating:    Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the performance of the PCU is rated as moderately satisfactory. As originally
conceived, the PCU was the DNIP, with the head of the DNIP also serving as the
National Project Director (NPD). The NPD was assisted by a Project Administration Unit
staffed with DNIP personnel and consultants, and responsible for project processing,
administration and accounting. During project implementation, the PCU was moved
outside the DNIP to depend directly on the SEP. In this regard, the impact of having the
operation under the responsibility of the SEP was mixed, as the attention of the
authorities was often consumed by short term, urgent issues, leaving little room for the
sustained, long-term institutional development efforts required for the successful
implementation of the process. However, during those periods when the SEP fully
focused on the operation, the impact of having full political support was very high.

During the period between 1996 and 1998, the Project Implementation (PI) was rated
unsatisfactory due to the overall lack of progress. Between 2002 and 2003, PI was also
unsatisfactory given due to delays in the project procurement plan. In 2005, the PI was
once again rated unsatisfactory when concerns were raised during regular supervision
regarding PCU's implementing arrangements in the areas of procurement and financial
management. Although no irregularities were identified, the ratings were downgraded in
the areas of project management, financial management and procurement management to
flag procedural oversights within the PCU, including weak internal controls, insufficient
information, timeless audit reports and lack of follow-up of recommendations. These
weaknesses were subsequently addressed to the Bank's satisfaction. Moreover, all actors
involved--i.e., ministerial authorities, PCU staff and ASAE--offered their full
collaboration during the legal procurement and financial management reviews.

Overall, the PCU succeeded in capitalizing from the political support that it received
from 2002 onward, to fully implement the project. It effectively and timely responded to
the needs of the authorities of the SEP, DNIP and the Budget Office. The PCU
coordinated the implementation efforts in the various areas, exhibiting a flexible and
cooperative attitude. It also implemented an ambitious capacity building strategy that
presented significant logistical challenges in terms of the diversity of the training
components, the ample territorial coverage, and the large number of participants.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory for the
reasons outlined above. The Borrower's performance from mid-2002 onward has been
critical to the operation's success, as the factors threatening the success of the project
were successfully addressed and project implementation took on renewed momentum.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
While the development of institutional and technical capacity as well as modern
management tools is an important step toward developing a sound public
investment management system, strong political will is needed to fully capitalize on
their potential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment
management. Over the life of FOSIP, there was uneven support on the part of national
authorities for the development of a sound public management system. With the SNIP
now in place, the authorities have the opportunity to fully capitalize on its potential
benefits by further strengthening it and expanding to encompass all public investments at
the national level.

Sound public investment decisions require effective institutions for investment
planning and project evaluation. Thus, technical assistance operations, such as a FOSIP,
that focus on strengthening public investment capacity of borrowing countries are
prerequisites for maximizing the impact of public investment programs.

The decentralized conceptualization of the SNIP was critical to its successful
insertion within Argentina's public sector and the operation itself. The SNIP was
conceived as a decentralized system with multiple users, going beyond the DNIP to also
include sectoral government agencies within the national government as well as
provincial and municipal governments. This decentralized approach was also reflected
into the operation's design, which targeted not only the DNIP for its capacity building
efforts, but also sectoral agencies and provincial and municipal governments. This
approach was particularly important in the case of Argentina, where investment decisions
are decentralized, not only among sectoral agencies within the national government but,
more importantly, among sub-national governments.

The development of the SNIP--and the operation itself--benefited from being
conceived as an intricate component of mainstream resource allocation activities
rather than as an isolated effort. Within Argentina's Public Investment and Financial
Administration Laws, public investment is part of the annual budget preparation process,
effectively integrating public investment into the broader scheme of public expenditure
management.

It is important to ensure the institutionalization of capacity building efforts. In the
case of FOSIP, all activities supported under the operation were line with DNIP's basic
functions, thus guaranteeing a basic level of institutionalization and contributing toward
sustainability over the medium and long terms.

Given their own expertise in project evaluation and implementation, the Bank and
other multilateral development banks have a strong comparative advantage in
public investment programming. Thus, they can provide valuable assistance to their
member countries in the areas of public investment planning, budgeting, and
implementation, as well as on fiscal issues relating to public investment programs
through technical assistance operations such as the FOSIP.



                                            35

A `bottom-up' sectoral approach to public investments needs to be complemented
with a strong central institution responsible for screening and further prioritizing
proposed sectoral public investment projects. In the case of Argentina, individual
ministries propose their own priority projects to be included in the PNIP. To ensure a
sound allocation of resources, the DNIP ought to play a critical role in the assessment and
prioritization of projects proposed by sectoral ministries, which requires not only high
technical expertise but also strong political and institutional leverage.

It is important to go beyond ex-ante project evaluation and to establish mechanisms
to closely monitor projects under execution and to evaluate them ex-post. Projects
that are initially projected to be profitable, often suffer implementation problems that
reduce their overall profitability. The DNIP needs to coordinate closely with both the
relevant sectoral ministries and other oversight agencies (e.g., Hacienda) in the process of
implementation and ex-post evaluation. This is a pending challenge in Argentina.

Losing focus becomes a challenge in institutional development projects with a longer
life span. Although the project was originally designed as a limited intervention, it later
lost some of its original focus. As priorities and needs evolved, the project often
supported an incremental model of modernization rather than the objectives that were
originally prioritized.

Project management requires an in-depth focus on the adequate implementation of
fiduciary measures, calling for a continued strengthening of procurement and FM
standards to ensure full compliance with Bank rules. Fiduciary measures and
enhanced supervision covering both procurement and financial management in line with
applicable Bank policies, portfolio-wide practices, and lessons learned of the on-going
project have been incorporated to the forthcoming Governance 21 project and other
operations in the region.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

   The Borrower provided a number of specific comments regarding sections in the ICR.
   The complete comments in Spanish can be found in Annex 7 of the ICR. The
   following summarizes the comments provided:

   The decision to focus the activities primarily on capacity building for public
   investment planning was based on the view that government capacity had declined
   significantly in the previous years, thus creating an immediate need for training.
   Training was provided in part through a cooperation agreement with ASAE
   (Association Argentina de Evaluación). In the course of the project, as discussed in the
   ICR, the fiduciary and contractual arrangements underwent exhaustive review. It is
   observed that the Bank never declared the fiduciary documentation provided by the
   PIU as deficient; furthermore any additional information requested by the Bank was



                                              36

   furnished in a timely and comprehensive manner. The Bank's ex-post evaluation
   confirmed a full disbursement of and complete accounting for all project proceeds.
   The extensive examination of project procurement, in particular the contracting with
   ASAE, confirmed the validity of such contracting under Bank and National
   procurement rules. Finally, the absence of adequate monitoring indicators was a result
   of change in the project objective and its components.

   Despite a missing baseline for the capacity building components, the Government,
   with Bank endorsement, has prepared a study indicating a significant impact of the
   capacity building activities on public investment quality. The project had long term
   implications, and has changed procedures and the culture in government agencies and
   entrenched ex-post evaluation investments in all decision making.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)

Two electronic surveys were conducted as part of the ICR preparation to assess the impact of the
capacity building activities that were implemented under the FOSIP operation. The main results
are summarized below (full results corresponding to both surveys have been archived in the
project's files).

Coordinators Survey: An electronic survey was distributed among those that were responsible
for coordinating FOSIP training courses offered by the network of national universities, ASAE,
and the SEP. Results can be summarized as follows:

    Response rate: The response rate was 50 percent, as 7 out of 14 course coordinators
    responded to the survey.
    Other responses: See Table 5.1 below.

Participants Survey: The course coordinators were asked to distribute an electronic survey
among course participants. Results can be summarized as follows:
    Response rate: 65 respondents representing six institutions out of a total of 14 institutions that
    were asked to participate. (The actual response rate cannot be determined, as the number of
    those that received the survey is not known.)
    Participants' areas of employment: Overall, 67 percent of the course participants work in the
    public sector at the national (21 percent), provincial (29 percent) and municipal levels (17
    percent). The remaining 33 percent work in the private sector. Forty-two percent of the
    course participants report having project evaluation as part of their professional
    responsibilities, and 52 percent report having project evaluation responsibilities to some
    extent.
    Other responses: See Table 5.2 below.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Factores clave que afectaron la ejecución y los resultados:

1. "enfoque demasiado limitado a la capacitación y la evaluación ex ante del proyecto"

   Se hizo hincapié fundamentalmente en las tareas de capacitación, habida cuenta de la
   profunda desinversión en este tema producida por el Estado en los años anteriores.
   Era absolutamente prioritario dotar a los recursos humanos de herramientas que hasta
   ahora carecían. Pero a pesar de esta orientación, estas actividades no se desarrollaron
   en detrimento de otras, sino que todas se desarrollaron, a partir de 2002, a un ritmo
   adecuado.


2. "presentación de informes fiduciarios deficientes"

   En ningún documento emitido por el BIRF fue utilizada la calificación de
   "deficiente" de los informes emitidos por la Unidad de Coordinación del Proyecto. Si
   es cierto que se solicitaron aclaraciones sobre los mismos, las cuales fueron
   suministradas oportunamente.
   Por otro lado, el hecho de haber llevado adelante revisiones y estudios ex post por
   parte del BIRF, no fueron impedimento para el normal desarrollo de las actividades
   del Proyecto, habida cuenta que el mismo culminó su ejecución con un porcentaje del
   100% sobre los fondos desembolsados.

3. "salvaguarda y observancia fiduciaria (centrada en problemas y en su resolución,
   según corresponda)"

  El análisis exhaustivo realizado por el BIRF en relación con el convenio firmado entre
  FOSIP y la Asociación Argentina de Evaluación (ASAE) dio como conclusión un
  resultado satisfactorio, ya que además de haberse analizado los aspectos
  procedimentales de la contratación, se analizó el costo y calidad de las actividades de
  capacitación realizadas por dicha ONG, las cuales se encontraban dentro de los
  parámetros generales del mercado.

  En el contexto del programa, objetivos de desarrollo y diseño.
  Se considera en varios párrafos problemas de diseño en la elección de los indicadores
  de monitoreo, indicadores que no fueron previstos en el diseño original y que como
  aprendizaje, tanto para este como para otros proyectos la definición de una "línea de
  base" con elementos a ser medidos en forma oportuna mejorarían, tanto para el Banco
  como para el Gobierno, evaluar el impacto buscado en el préstamo.

  En relación a los aspectos de las tareas de capacitación, se impulsó en este préstamo
  un gran esfuerzo donde pudimos medir lo cuantitativo, en base al número de cursos,
  participantes y expansión territorial, el aspecto de medición cualitativa si bien fue
  importante no pudimos evaluar el impacto en la sociedad, dado que en el proceso de
  recuperación de la economía con tasas de crecimiento superiores al 8% anual, y la

identificación, formulación y evaluación de los proyectos con inversión, como una
línea de acción importantísima en la implementación de la política económica
buscamos orientarnos a no dejar espacios territoriales o institucionales sin cubrir, con
el esfuerzo que ello implicaba.

Por evaluación propia y con el aval de las conversaciones con el Banco se diseño otro
préstamo que contemplaba profundizar, no solo la extensión territorial de los cursos
incorporando un componente, que daría el perfil sustantivo al proyecto orientado al
Desarrollo Económico Territorial, conservando y profundizando los aspectos exitosos
del FOSIP, entre ellos la capacitación.

Este nuevo préstamo denominado Gestión XXI, hasta el día de la fecha, no se ha
concretado, tema largamente discutido en las diversas reuniones y misiones con el
Banco.

En los informes enviados a lo largo del proyecto se pueden ver los logros obtenidos.

Como todo préstamo de larga duración, donde se han sucedido cambios en las
autoridades nacionales, en la dirección en la unidad de ejecución del proyecto, incluso
en los representantes del Banco, creemos en la consolidación de las experiencias
logradas y la instalación de un cambio de cultura en las metras centrales del este
préstamo que es incorporar la calidad de gestión y comprensión en el fenómeno de
identificar, formular y evaluar proyectos de inversión pública.

Como metodología de evaluación en un contexto de importantes cambios sufridos por
el país, el Banco no contempla las modificaciones y los momentos de crisis en las
evaluaciones, este comentario apunta a poder fijar criterios más flexibles, en función
de las circunstancias, a veces diferentes, dentro del contexto del país, y los cambios de
objetivos dentro del mismo proyecto.

Sería importante poder discutir en el clima de mejorar la evaluación del impacto que
factores externos, país, situación internacional e internos del proyecto, como cambios
en la gestión, producen sobre este u otros préstamos con tramos diferenciados de
evaluación, respectando los aspectos de fundamentales de continuidad jurídica.
