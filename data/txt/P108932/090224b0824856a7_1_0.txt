                         Implementation Status Overview
                         • Implementation of PCDP II since its effectiveness in October 2008 has been gathering encouraging momentum and has registered tangible results in all its components and sub-
                         components. Thus, despite the demanding decentralized implementation arrangement of the project involving multiple stakeholders dispersed in 55 pastoral woredas, implementation
                         progress of PCDP II over the last five years has been successful.
                         • The project has effectively fulfilled its development objectives and created enabling environment for the provision of important basic services and livelihoods improvement

                         interventions .
                         • The project was effective in using the community driven development (CDD) approach to facilitate the demand driven implementation processes. According, a total of 2.85 million
                         pastorals and agro-pastorals (of which 41 percent female and 19 percent youth) were mobilized, sensitized and consulted during community action plan (CAP) preparation processes.
                         Through this process, the project ensured ownership and sustainability of development interventions in pastoral areas.

                         • Over the life of PCDP II, a total of 2,636 community sub-projects were implemented. This is 98 percent of the plan. Of these, 2,447 sub-projects, including 583 water, 810
                         education, 342 health, 296 veterinary clinics, 158 rural access roads and 172 small scale irrigation project, are fully functional and providing basic services to more than 2.0 million
                         pastorals and agro-pastorals in the four beneficiary regions.
                         •          A total of 448 Pastoral Saving and Credit Coops (PaSACCOs) were established during the last five years with a total membership of 29,527 (of which 66.6% are female).
                         While 447 are legally registered, some 428 have opened bank accounts. The members mobilized Br 6.0 million as paid share capital and Br 20.4 million as saving. Most of the
                         PaSACCOs are actively involved in providing loans to the members for income generation and livelihood diversification activities. The project has also disbursed Br. 30.8 million as
                         seed capital to 362 PaSACCOs that fulfilled the required criteria. The mature loan repayment rate at 100 percent is a good indication that the Saving and Credit Cooperatives are well
                         facilitated and portfolio at risk of 30 days is zero for all lending RuSACCOs
                         •          Moreover, 70 percent the members in the PaSACCOs have active loan account, of which 72 percent are women members, and 100 percent of the members are with active
                         saving account.
                         • Net Enrollment Rate of girls in PCDP II supported elementary schools has reached 43 percent, 95.6 percent of the target.
                         • The project has enabled more that 1.2 million pastorals and agro-pastorals to have access to potable water, and more than 757,600 people to health services.
                         • The animal health facilities are providing services to more 400,000 household with more than 2.3 million animals.
                         • The small scale irrigation investments supported more than 42,000 households to cultivate 3,460 hectares.
                         • The 155 rural access roads financed under PCDP II linked several remote pastoral villages to markets and are providing service to more than 364,900 pastorals and agro-pastorals.
                         •          The Pastoral Early Warning System has been active in 122 woredas in collecting, analyzing and interpretation early warning data for informed decision making purposes.
                         The Federal and Regional Early Warning Response departments have fully collected, analyzed and interpreted 48 weekly and 12 monthly early warning information on annual basis
                         from the 122 pastoral and agro-pastoral woredas. The Early Warning and Response Directorate of MoA has been disseminating the monthly early warning reports to all concerned
                         stakeholders. Based on the information from the Early Warning System, concerned regions were able to respond on time and assist affected pastoral and agro pastoral communities.
                         Accordingly, over the last five years the project provided Br. 16.0 million for emergency response and assisted some half a million pastorals to mitigate the effects of natural
                         calamities in the four pastoral regions.
                         •          The Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program (DPSIP), with longer term and strategic disaster preparedness, reduction and mitigation objectives, has also been
                         active in supporting the beneficiary regions to design and implement strategic investments to complement the pastoral livelihoods resilience building efforts. Accordingly, over the life
                         of PCDP II a total of 162 strategic sub-projects or 89 percent of the plan were implemented in all the four pastoral regions at a total cost of Br. 164.4 million, only 68 percent of the
                         planned allocation. The functional 162 sub projects, including 32 rangeland management, 23 forage development, 58 water development, 7 irrigation and 16 livestock markets, are
                         benefiting more than 2.6 million pastorals and agro pastorals.
                         •          Performance of the Proje ct Management at Federal and Regional levels together with the Mobile Support Teams has been effective. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
                         system of the project, which is being complemented by a management information system (MIS), has been effective in collecting, analyzing and documenting data on implementation
                         processes of the project for informed decision making purposes.
                         •          The fiduciary management of the project has also shown steady improvement supported by the Internal Audit system. Despite issues associated with contract administration
                         and accountability reporting, PCDP II managed to disburse 100% of the funds obtained form IDA Credit and Grant.
