for the Second Pastoral\n            Community Development Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  the first\n            lesson learned is that communities gain confidence in their\n            ability to solve their own problems when they receive\n            appropriate training to support decision-making. The second\n            lesson learned is that community empowerment can be achieved\n            by consultation early in the process on their priorities for\n            use of scarce project funds. The third lesson learned is\n            that an Statement of Expenditure (SOE)-driven approach to\n            CIF replenishments is too unwieldy and creates\n            implementation delays. The fourth lesson learned is that\n            RUSACCOs work well in promoting IGAs that communities are\n            very familiar with, but less so on promoting new IGAs.\n            Finally, the fifth lesson learned is that, with small-scale\n            irrigation (SSI) interventions, crop yield improvements are\n            almost automatic, but crop diversification is not."}, "docdt": "2014-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
