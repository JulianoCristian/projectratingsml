                         has been exemplary. Almost all the agreed actions of the June 2011 MTR mission have been effectively fulfilled well before the due dates.
                         •         The project managed to mobilize and consult close to 700,000 beneficiary communities or 39 % of the target population over the last seven months as part of the awareness
                         creation and sensitization process during the 2004 EC (2011/12) Community Action Plan (CAP) preparation process. While 45% of participants are women, 23% are reported as
                         youth. This is an important activity that ensures ownership and sustainability of development interventions in pastoral areas.

                         •         Implementation of the 631community sub-projects approved during FY 2003 (2010/11) is encouraging and at the end of the second quarters beneficiary communities were
                         able to complete 234 sub-projects, of which 76% are education, 40% water development and 40 % animal health posts.
                         •         Beneficiary communities are effectively fulfilling their commitment to implement the FY 2004 EC (2011/12) new sub-projects. Accordingly, Br. 10.6 million or 82% of the plan
                         was collected from beneficiary communities as part of the 5% cash contribution to implement the 489 new sub-projects.
                         •         During the reporting period, a total of 509 (67% of the plan) sub-projects were made fully functional through the provisions of equipment, furniture and trained manpower;
                         including 144 schools, 133 water development, 77 health posts, 68 vet posts, and 29 small scale irrigation schemes.
                         •         A total of 28 Pastoral Saving and Credit Coops (PaSACCOs) were established over the last six months with a total membership of 1,287 (76% female members). The
                         members mobilized Br 67,219 as paid share capital and Br 158, 704 as saving. Most of these groups have already started the inter-loaning for income generation and livelihood
                         diversification activities. To date, the project has managed to establish 346 PaSACCOs in the project Regions, of which 329 have been registered as legal entities. The project has
                         also disbursed Br. 7.15 million as seed capital for 133 PaSACCOs that fulfilled the required criteria. This was made possible after the required training and capacity building efforts.
                         •         Under the Pastoral Risk Management component of the project, the Pastoral Early Warning System has been effective in collecting, analyzing and interpretation early
                         warning data for informed decision making purposes. Accordingly, during the reporting period, 24 weekly and 6 monthly early warning information were produced by the four major
                         pastoral regions of the country. The Early Warning and Response Directorate of MoA has been disseminating the monthly early warning reports to all concerned stakeholders.
                         •         The Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program (DPSIP), with longer term disaster preparedness, reduction and mitigation objectives, has also been active in
                         supporting the beneficiary regions to design and implement strategic investments to complement the pastoral livelihoods resilience building efforts. During the reporting period and
                         following the recommendations of the MTR mission in June 2011, a total of Birr 23 million has been transferred to Somali, Oromiya and SNNP regions to implement DPSIP sub-
                         projects that obtained the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment clearances. Accordingly, activities in areas of range management, water development, small scale irrigation
                         works, livestock market development, forage production and road construction are underway in various pastoral areas of the country.
                         •         Implementation progress of the Knowledge Management and Networking component of the project is also progressing very well. The mission noted with satisfaction that the
                         dynamic web site of the project www.pcdp.gov.et, which is being used as one of its communication strategies, has been visited by more than 10,410 users since its launch.
                         Experience sharing visits among communities were conducted in Berahle, Gulina, Awra, Dawe, Telalak, Chifera, Dalifagi, Argoba, Gewane, Dalol, and Kuneba woredas of Afar
                         Region. Under the knowledge management sub-component, encouraging activities are underway, including establishment of pastoral resource centers, production of newsletters,
                         brochures and posters, documentary film production and community radio programs.
                         •         Under the Policy Implementation Studies, all regions have established PLKM review committees. The mission is please to note that these committees are now functional in
                         assessing policy implementation issues. During the reporting period, policy implementation constraints were identified by Oromia, SNNP, Afar and Somali regions and submitted to
                         their respective Regional Steering Committees for comment and approval. Oromia region prioritized a study on implications of Pastoral Sedenteralization, while the Afar region
                         prioritized a study on Livestock Crop production Systems and Livestock Market Management issues.
                         •         The project management at Federal and Regional levels are functioning well and all the key vacancies are filled up. The revised salary and perdiem allowances are
                         encouraging and have addressed most of the issues associated with field visits and associated operational support trips to project sites.
