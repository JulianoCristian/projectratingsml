                         Implementation Status Overview
                         . PCDP II continues to register promising implementation progress in most of its intervention areas and is moving in the right direction to meet its development objectives. However,
                         some activities under Community Investment Fund, Participatory Learning and Kedge Management, and Pastoral Risk Management components need closer attention. Performance
                         of the project in some Woredas is belowthe expected level due to issues associated with accessibility and capacity limitations.
                         . Ownership of the project and commitment to its effective implementation is exemplary at all levels and is contributing positively to its successful achievements so far. Beneficiary

                         . As part of the awareness creation and sensitization efforts, close to one million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in all the 55 project woredas attended the Community Action Plan
                         preparation meetings and other events organized by the project. This represents about 36 percent of the total population in the target areas. Participation of women and youth at 34
                         and 18 percent respectively exceed the targets set for the reporting period.
                         . Beneficiary communities have effectively demonstrated their ownership and commitment to the project by fulfilling their contributions both in cash and in kind. Accordingly, out of the
                         planned ETB 32.72 million cash contribution, beneficiary communities in the four project regions managed to collect ETB 30.22 million or 92 percent of the plan.
                         . Out of the completed 699 community sub-projects during the reporting period, 652 or 93 percent are providing the required services. Accordingly, 213 schools, 130 health posts and
                         72 veterinary posts, 83 water supply points, 500 ha of irrigated farm and 475 KM of access road are fully functional.
                         . A total of 300 Pastoral Saving and Credit Cooperatives (PaSACCOs ) were established during the last two years, of which 265 have been legally registered. Currently, a total of 157
                         PaSACCOs with a total membership of 10,407 (of which 6,572 or 63 percent are women) that fulfilled the criteria for grant seed fund provision were able to receive a total of Birr 9.35
                         million of project seed capital.
                         . The Pastoral Early Warning System is functioning well. Accordingly, both the regional and federal level Early Warning and Response Departments have successfully collected,
                         analyzed and interpreted 48 weekly and 12 monthly early warning information cycles from 122 pastoral and agro-pastoral woredas. The information from these early warning reports
                         were used both by the Federal and Regional governments to provide timely relief assistances to drought affected areas of Oromia, Somali and Afar over the last two years. The
                         project also transferred more than Birr 7.4 million to assist the relief effort for water rationing and fodder provision.
                         . Under the Participatory Learning and Knowledge Management (PLKM) component of the project, the interactive project web site (www.pcdp.gov.et) is serving as a key information
                         gate way and medium of communication. More than 6,300 people have visited the site so far.
                         . The M&E arrangement put in place by the project effective. The quality and timeliness of project reports have improved substantially. The mid-term performance report of the project
                         includes specific information about implementation progress and results achieved under each component of the project.
                         . As of June 15, 2011 the disbursement rate of the project has reached 48.5% for IDA and 15.8% for IFAD. The FM arrangements of the project are sufficient to give assurance that
                         the funds are used for the intended purpose
