                         Implementation Status Overview
                         . Implementation progress of the project to meet its development objectives is commendable and continues to register encouraging results. However, implementation processes and
                         expected outputs of some components, such as the Participatory Learning and Knowledge Management (PLKM), Pastoral saving and Credit Scheme, and Disaster Preparedness
                         Strategic Investment Program, are much below expectation.
                         . Ownership of the project by target communities and commitment of the administrative structures at federal, regional, woreda and kebele levels to the project objectives and its

                         demanding implementation arrangements is exemplary. Almost all the agreed actions of the second review mission have been effectively fulfilled well before the due dates.
                         . Out of the 321 on-going community sub-projects from phase one of the project, 305 (95%) have been completed during the reporting period and 277 (92%) are fully functional

                         providing the required services. Under the FY 2009/10 and 2011 Community Action Plans (CAPs), a total of 1538 community subprojects (647 and 891 respectively) were approved
                         by the respective Woreda Development Committees for CIF financing. However, community sub-project plans in new woredas seem ambitious and will require closer oversight and
                         monitoring.
                         . In the preparation processes of the FY 2011CAPs, some 442,864 community members (60% men,40% women) in all the 55 project woredas participated in meetings and decision
                         making processes, and this represents more than 35% of the population in the beneficiary woredas. The project is advised to exert more effort to increase participation of women in
                         project management and decision making process.
                         . The project has facilitated the formation of 207 PA-SACCOs with 12,396 members (70%women) with a capital outlay (asset) of Br. 5.23 million, of which the savings amount is Br.
                         2.96 million. Some 169 saving and credit groups have already been officially registered/certified and 140 have opened bank accounts. The project has also recruited 48 PA-SACCO
                         accountants/promoters to support this initiative. However, no PA-SACCOS has yet qualified to receive the project seed money and the project is advised to pay more attention on
                         capacity strengthening, confidence building and group dynamics.
                         . All the four pastoral regions have been collecting, documenting and issuing Pastoral Early Warning and Response (PEWR) information. Based on the PEWR information Somali and
                         Oromiya regions were able to respond to the drought and flood emergencies during the reportingperiod using their emergency response plans. As a result, using the $2.45 million
                         allocated by the project, the two regions were able to provide emergency response to the affected pastorals in 16 woredas (four in Somali and 12 Oromiya).
                         . The M&E system continues to perform well and key project information are being collected, documented,analyzed and used for informed decision making purposes at all levels.
                         Target values for most of the key monitorable indicators of the project planned to be achieved during the second year have been fulfilled. Nevertheless, confirmation of a fully
                         satisfactory rating of the project during the upcoming Mid Term Review (MTR) will require that the monitoring and evaluation system produce reliable data on the full set of indicators.
                         Early preparation to provide the data needed for a successful mid-term review will be very importnant.
                         . Despite the low disbursement rate (35.7%), financial Management (FM) aspects of the project are progressing well. The FM arrangements are sufficient enough to give assurance
                         that the funds are used for the intended purpose. The budget for the project has been prepared for FY 2011 and has been disseminated to regions and Woredas.
