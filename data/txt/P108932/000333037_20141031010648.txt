1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

1.     Ethiopia is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa with a land area of 1.1 million
square kilometers, of which, nearly half (500,000 square km2.) are pastoralist lowlands. It has a
wide range of climates, soils and vegetation, but is also vulnerable to food and fuel terms of trade
shocks as well as weather related shocks.

2.      At the time of appraisal of the second phase of the Pastoral Community Development
Program (PCDP II), Ethiopia had a population of 73 million, growing at 2.0 percent, with a per
capita national income (GNI) of US$180 (Project Appraisal Document-PAD, May 5, 2008). Its
social indicators included life expectancy at birth of 43 years, a literacy rate of 36 percent, and an
infant mortality rate of 80 per thousand. PCDP II was prepared as Ethiopia was implementing its
second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), known as the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained
Development to End Poverty (PASDEP). One priority in the PASDEP was to address the
challenges facing pastoralists.

3.     Pastoralism in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, pastoralism is extensively practiced in the Afar
and Somali Regional States (Regions), and in some Zones of the Oromia Region and of the
Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples National Regional States (SNNPR) or the “Southern
Region.” At least twelve million people live in these lowlands, as well as tens of millions of
animals. People living in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Ethiopia include: (i) the
comparatively wealthy who hold substantial livestock assets; (ii) a larger number of poor people
who have small herds and flocks and those who, to a greater or lesser extent, depend upon
cropping or sale of their labor (“agro-pastoralists”); and (iii) a significant number who are
gradually abandoning pastoral livelihoods due to loss of animals and degradation of grazing
lands.

4.      The pastoral peoples of Ethiopia have been economically, socially and politically
marginalized for decades, receiving few or no benefits from the government. Key development
issues in these areas include: (i) land-tenure security for grazing land and encroachment by
sedentary populations as well as large-scale development schemes; (ii) poor access to public and
social services; (iii) a restrictive livestock marketing and export policy; (iv) vulnerability to
drought shocks; (v) environmental degradation, in particular of rangelands; and (vi) restrictions
on movement and conflicts related to natural resource management (NRM) as well as regional
competition. By 2000, the relative severity of pastoralists’ socio-economic status had prompted
the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) to intensify its search for sustainable development strategies
in these areas. The GoE’s strategy for pastoral areas was laid out in the PASDEP. The section on
“Pastoralist Livelihoods and Development” proposed a range of adapted livelihoods and service-
delivery interventions to address the pastoralists’ challenges.



                                                  1
5.      Rationale for Bank involvement. PCDP II was the main investment program in the
lowland areas to promote the Interim Country Assistance Strategy (ICAS) objective of
addressing vulnerability and growth in Ethiopia. The rationale for Bank involvement was also
based on the stronger than expected demand under PCDP I for capacity building and basic social
services. (Approximately 94 percent of the PCDP I resources were disbursed 12 months ahead
of the scheduled closing date.) Establishment of services in remote underserved areas is also a
long-term process that required sustained Bank support. The Bank’s involvement also leveraged
a large amount of resources from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
Finally, the GoE concluded that it needed an alternative to the top-down, supply-driven approach
that had been previously followed, for example, in the Bank-supported livestock project which
was not successful. The government decided to adopt a bottom-up, community driven
development (CDD) approach that would be more effective and sustainable in improving the
lives of pastoralists. The Bank had a comparative advantage in providing support because of its
experience with CDD in the region.

6.      The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was under preparation at the time reinforced
the effort to address pastoralist concerns by increasing the scale of investments and focusing on
the quality of service delivery.      Further financing was required to consolidate the gains in
existing target woredas (districts) as well as to expand access to financing to other pastoral
communities and woredas which expressed strong demand for access to PCDP II resources.
Because of the long-term nature of the PCDP objectives, the program was designed to provide
support over 15 years, divided into three phases of 5 years each. The GoE, the Bank, and IFAD
continued their engagement with the PCDP II to expand benefits and ensure their sustainability.

7.       There was also a need to improve pastoralists’ ability to cope with climatic shocks. The
PAD for PCDP II recognized that Ethiopia had benefited from a long spell of good weather, but
that it should also be prepared for a cyclical change in weather and climate change shocks that
could result in a growth slowdown. In the event of a rainfall shock, a 10 percent decline in crop
production following a drought could reduce the GDP growth rate by 3 percentage points (as
crop output accounts for 30 percent of GDP). Major bilateral donors had already announced
global cutbacks in food aid due to higher food prices, which could have worsened food insecurity
in a future drought.

8.       Program Phases and Overview. The three–phase, 15-year PCDP was approved by the
Bank’s Executive Board on May 20, 2003. The purpose of the overall program is to support the
development of pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in Ethiopia through community-based
development that includes a Community Investment Fund (CIF), a Rural Livelihood Program
(RLP), and support to participatory disaster risk management. The program also supports policy
dialogue and strategic thinking on pastoralist development issues. On September 30, 2003, the
first of the series of three projects under the program was declared effective and was completed
in February 2008. Under Phase I, the pilots were generally successful and the established
performance triggers for the completion of Phase 1 were met to move to the next phase (Annex


                                               2
11). The second project, PCDP II was approved on May 5, 2008 and declared effective on
October 9, 2008. PCDP II was closed on schedule, 31 December 2013. 1 The third project,
PCDP III builds on the success of the previous two projects and continues to integrate CDD
approaches into government processes.

9.     IDA funding totaling SDR 48.6 million (US$80.0 million equivalent) was planned for
PCDP II. In addition, US$33.6 million was to be provided by the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD). It was expected, given the scale of the Project, that the GoE
Regions and beneficiary communities would provide US$19.7 million in support, with the
beneficiary contribution provided both in cash and in kind.

1.2.     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.     The project development objective (PDO) was to increase the resilience of Ethiopian
pastoralists to external shocks and to improve the livelihoods of targeted communities.
“Resilience” referred to pastoralists’ ability to cope with natural disasters, such as drought.
“Livelihoods” referred to the pastoralists’ improvement in potential income as well as social
services such as education, health and water supply. Table 1 shows the original and revised PDO
indicators for the Project.

1.3.    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
        and reasons/justification

11.     The original PDO was not revised during restructuring, nor were any of the indicator
targets. However, as Table 1 shows, there were substantial revisions to the PDO indicators,
which included a number of intermediate indicators elevated to PDO level at the 2011
restructuring. Six new PDO indicators were added, and three indicators were raised from
intermediate to PDO level to improve measurement of project PDOs. Two of the original four
were dropped, one after being achieved. This was a major revision of the results framework
which is further reviewed in section 2.3 on monitoring and evaluation.

1.4.    Main Beneficiaries,

12.     The PAD identified the primary target population for Phase II as about 600,000 rural
households (several million people) in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in 55 woredas (45
percent of pastoral and agro-pastoral woredas in Ethiopia) of four region states: Afar, Somali,
Southern Nations and Oromia. At completion, Phase II covered the 55 woredas with community
investment Fund sub-projects, and all pastoral woredas with pastoral risk management (PRM)
interventions. The established beneficiary targets were exceeded in most cases. For example,
beneficiaries from potable water and health services were originally expected to be 150,000 and
450,000 people, respectively, whereas actuals were 1.2 million and 757,648 people. Project
reporting estimated 1.9 million beneficiaries, cumulatively, through the first two phases of PCDP.

1.5.   Original Components (as approved)

13.     PCDP II consisted of four components: (i) Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement, (ii)
Pastoral Risk Management, (iii) Participatory Learning and Knowledge Management; and (iv)
Project Management.

14.    Component 1: Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement (SLE) (US$93.4 million,
including US$51.9 million from the World Bank, US$21.7 million from IFAD, US$5.0 million
from the Regional States and US$14.7 million from the Beneficiaries).

15.    Sub-component A: Community Investment Fund (CIF): Women and men in pastoral
and agro-pastoral communities designed and implemented Community Action Plans (CAPs)
according to their own development priorities. They identified, budgeted, implemented and
evaluated subprojects. The proposed community subprojects were financed as grants through the
CIF sub-component. This sub-component financed subprojects including, but not limited to
water supply, small-scale irrigation, healthcare, education and rangeland management. Selected
communities would receive a series of three successive projects before “graduating” from PCDP.

16.     Sub-component B: Rural Livelihoods Program (RLP):                 This sub-component
supported the establishment of rural savings and credit cooperatives (RUSACCOs) in beneficiary
communities at woreda and regional levels, and the capacity-building of associated support
services. RUSACCOs’ objective is to facilitate income generating activities (IGAs) and to
increase involvement of women in economic activity. The subcomponent drew upon the
experience of the Ethiopian Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP), funded by IFAD,
and other micro-finance projects in rural Ethiopia, with appropriate modifications to respond to
pastoral social and economic environments and characteristics. RUSACCOs were eligible for
project financing, account books and promotional material. In addition, they could receive a
grant of up to 200 percent of their pre-registration compulsory and voluntary savings as seed
capital for income-generating activities for beneficiary communities. The limit was Birr 50,000
for each RUSACCO that saved Birr 25,000.

17.   Component 2: Pastoral Risk Management (PRM) (US$29.0 million, including
US$20.4 million from the World Bank, and US$8.6 million from IFAD.)

18.    Sub-component A: Pastoral Early Warning and Response Program (PEWRP): A
PEWRP was to build on and expand geographically an ongoing woreda and livelihoods zone-
based early warning process through the provision of capacity building investments, recruitment
and training of community data collectors and data analysis and response mechanisms. The
pastoral Early Warning System (EWS) was to provide information to assign each participating
woreda to one of five “disaster stages”, with appropriate responses corresponding to each stage.

19.     Sub-component B: Disaster Preparedness Investment Program (DPIP): Regional
Pastoral Development Office/Commission (PDO/C) integrated DPCPs into a long-term strategic
disaster preparedness strategy and prioritized DPIP for their respective regions. Each region was
                                                5
to receive funding from PCDP II to finance a number of strategic disaster preparedness
subprojects prioritized in the DPIP through Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program
Grants (DPSIP Grants). These investments included construction and rehabilitation of feeder
roads, improved water supply and catchment management, fodder banks and rangeland
improvement.

20.    Component 3: Participatory Learning & Knowledge Management (PLKM) (US$1.8
million, including US$1.3 million from the World Bank, and US$0.5 million from IFAD.)

21.    Sub-Component A: Participatory Action Learning: Participatory Action Learning
pilots were undertaken in selected beneficiary communities to apply and further develop
methodologies for demand-driven approaches to participatory knowledge generation and
innovation. Facilitators worked with pastoral communities to help them identify their research
and knowledge priorities with the objective of development best practices in pastoral
development.

22.     Sub-Component B: Knowledge Management and Networking:                     Knowledge
management was supported at regional and community levels; including through the
establishment of small resource units on pastoral research and development as well as pastoral
development networks at regional level. These networks were to provide a forum for interested
actors to share lessons and information on pastoral development issues.

23.    Sub-component C: Policy Studies: A modest budget was made available to the MoFA
and Regional Pastoral Development Commissions/ Bureaus to commission studies they regarded
as necessary to inform the implementation of social and economic pastoral development policies.

24.   Component 4: Project Management (US$8.9 million, including US$6.3 million from
the World Bank and US$2.6 million from IFAD).

25.    The Federal Project Coordination Unit (FPCU) located in the Ministry of Federal Affairs
(MoFA), as under PCDP I, was responsible for overall PCDP II management, annual planning,
and fiduciary management, liaison with stakeholder groups at federal level, communication,
M&E and reporting, staff capacity-building, and mobilization of technical backstopping. With
its decentralized structure, the Project was to be managed substantially at the regional and
woreda levels. At the regional level, the Pastoral Commissions and Pastoral Development
Bureaus housed the Regional Project Coordination Units (RPCUs), which had overall
responsibility for PCDP II implementation at regional level.

1.6.   Revised Components

No revisions.

1.7.       Other significant changes

26.    The PDO indicators were revised (Table 1) in a level 2 restructuring on December 9,
2011 after the midterm review (MTR), see sections 2.2 and 2.3. The MTR made a number of
other changes to reduce significant delays in implementation and improve development
outcomes.

     •     The maximum amount that could be allocated for a community subproject was increased
           from US$35,000 to US$50,000.
     •     The cash contribution from the communities was changed from a progressive 5-7-10
           percent, to a flat 5 percent. The in-kind remained at 10 percent.
       •   The first tranche payment of 30 percent could be raised to 50 percent if the kebele was
           more remote.
       •   The RUSACCO saving requirement was reduced to Birr 15,000 (from Birr 25,000, and a
           second infusion of seed capital of Birr 50,000 was approved for RUSACCOs that had
           repaid the original Birr 50,000 in seed capital.

27.    It should be noted that the IFAD portion has a later closing date of November 26, 2014.
One justification for this later closing date for the IFAD portion was to ensure smooth transition
from Phase II to Phase III of PCDP.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.     Given the implementation challenges of the CDD approach and the low implementation
capacity in pastoralist areas, the risk was substantial that sufficient community and local
government initiative might not materialize. The government was also not decentralized down to
the woreda level, where most of the project activities would be planned. Part of the solution was
to constitute mobile support teams (MSTs), which were comprised of persons with key technical
expertise fiduciary, safeguards, operations, etc., whose job it was to help local government staff
to sensitize communities about the project, facilitate prioritization of activities and
implementation of project investments. With the capacity challenges and ambitious goals of
improving livelihoods and resilience over many districts, the PCDP took a long-term approach
and was conceived as three five-year phases.

a.         Application of lessons learned

29.     A number of important lessons of experience were applied in preparing the project which
addressed a number of key risks including incompatibility with local customs, low capacity of
communities and local government, inadequate incentives for performing responsibilities (e.g.,
community contributions and maintenance, local government support), and unsustainability of
project activities:

                                                  7
     •   Establishing, in advance, annual budgets and work plans for beneficiary woredas and
         communities;
     •   Intensive and sustained capacity-building of beneficiary communities as well as MSTs
         and WDCs;
     •   Using CDD processes and information for empowering communities to lead local
         development processes and to hold WDCs accountable;
     •   Clear procedures and systems to support income generating activities (IGAs) to make
         them sustainable;
     •   Ensuring that IGAs take into account local customs and culture and considering that
         many IGAs are implemented by women;
     •   Establishing a mechanism to follow through on community contributions as a measure to
         ensure genuine community ownership; and
     •   Ensuring effective linkages with relevant sector counterparts at woreda and regional
         levels.

b.       Factors affecting quality of preparation

30.     The risk of missing the more needy population, was addressed through community
selection criteria for the 23 new woredas that were eligible for CIF sub-projects. These criteria
included: (i) adequate security conditions for implementation, supervision, monitoring and
evaluation (M&E); (ii) road and communications accessibility; (iii) population size; (iv) poverty
and vulnerability as measured by food security needs; (v) the need to minimize overlap with
woredas where similar activities are being supported by other projects; and (vi) proximity to
existing project woredas.

31.     As a CDD project participatory processes were strong. With community consultations
including local government and supported by technical teams, communities engaged in a
dialogue to ensure that the resources made available to them were applied to their development
priorities. Consulting communities from the beginning and allowing them to establish priorities
and choose sub-projects created a high degree of ownership that resulted in strong cash and in-
kind community contributions.

32.     Still, in some areas, the Project’s risk assessment could have been better, for example, in
taking into account that the knowledge component might not translate into specific actions to
benefit the pastoralist community. The activities under this component were relatively new and
would have benefited from planned measures to implement, for example, some of the best
practices that were to be developed. Another area was that women’s participation in the MSTs
was more challenging than anticipated, a risk that has earned greater attention in phase III of the
program (PCDP III).

2.2.   Implementation

33.     PCDP II implementation and success factors. Despite implementation challenges
which included low capacity, remote and difficult access areas and security issues, the project
met its triggers for completion of Phase II (Annex 11). From its phase I experience, the project
team was well aware of the implementation challenges of a project attempting to deliver services
and set up systems in the remote, long-neglected pastoralist areas of Ethiopia. The team was also
concerned about the fact that the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) had rated the PCDP I
outcome moderately unsatisfactory. However, PCDP II had several advantages over PCDP I in
beginning implementation. First, the FPCU team had more implementation experience with
CDD and the team remained intact. Second, a substantial amount of capacity had been built at
the woreda, kabele and community levels under PCDP-I. These factors facilitated the expansion
of coverage from 32 to 55 woredas and moved community and sub-project selection and
implementation at a more rapid pace.

34.     The CDD approach under PCDP II had improved the participation of Woreda
Development Committees (WDCs), which were necessary to ensure that, for whatever
investments the project supported (e.g., building classrooms, health clinics), the local
governments would provide the necessary complements (e.g., teachers, medical supplies,
management and maintenance plans). This requirement meant the CIF sub-projects could
achieve “functionality,” i.e., provide the actual service intended. The project also worked with
Kebele Development Committees (KDCs). The project design reduced the risk of lack of
ownership by ensuring WDC and the KDC (and participating communities) agreement on the
project interventions and then requiring that each community provide 5 percent cash contribution
and open a bank account. The project would only then release 30 percent (50 percent after the
mid-term review, for very remote communities) of the allocated funds and implementation
would begin.

35.     The project promoted the PDO of improved livelihoods through establishment of
RUSACCOs, mainly for women and youth. The provision of training and support helped ensure
a successful introduction of credit which has allowed pastoralists to save and take small loans to
diversify livelihood improvement options, for example, to buy animals, fatten them and sell them
at a profit, part of which is used to repay the loan. At the time of this ICR, 448 RUSACCOs had
been established and all were operating.

36.     Under PRM, PDCP II helped pastoralists manage risks through an EWS and through
drought mitigation and resilience investments, which included, but was not limited to, building
access roads, natural resource management, small scale irrigation facilities, livestock marketing
centers and increasing water supply points. The Disaster Early Response grants met their targets
and helped avoid losses during the 2011 drought. The Participatory Learning and Knowledge
Management (PLKM) component produced a number of good practices and studies to inform
policy-making, and helped create awareness about pastoralist livelihoods. To date, there is little
evidence of these outputs being put into practice, however the outputs could still prove valuable
to policies and practices in the pastoralist community in the future.
                                                 9
a.       Training and Technical Support Success Factors

37.     Training and technical support were key to successful community participation and
overall project success and included:

     •   Capacity building around community-based conflict management through training of
         local officials (kebele, woreda) as well as leaders of customary institutions, pastoral
         associations and community-based organizations.
     •   Beneficiary communities were supported by project-financed Mobile Support Teams
         (MSTs), who worked with woreda administrations and associated sector offices.
     •   Rural Savings and Credit Cooperatives (RUSACCOs) were established in part through
         awareness building programs and training.
     •   The project built sector capacity at the woreda level to prepare Disaster Preparedness
         Contingency Plans (DPCPs) that identify both disaster mitigation and early response
         activities.
     •   The DPIPs identified community, woreda and regional needs for long-term regional
         disaster preparedness and mitigation. To the extent possible, PSNP catchment-
         management proposals were integrated into the DPIPs.
     •   The project provided technical assistance and staff capacity-building to support the
         development of the regional disaster preparedness strategies, DPIPs, and DPSIP
         subprojects.
     •   The project financed studies, equipment and advisory support from other research and
         development partners as requested by communities.
     •   The project supported information exchanges and peace-building at community level,
         including through financing of studies of interest to communities in conflict.

b.       Main Implementation Issues and Responses at the Mid-Term Review and
         Restructuring

38.   There were a number of implementation issues that required responses from the project
team:

     •   Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) were prepared late and this held up replenishments,
         reflecting mainly capacity constraints. As a result, there were construction delays, often
         for several months, in the CIF projects.
     •   MSTs and WDCs experienced high turnover.
     •   Internal audit established to improve fiduciary control, but capacity was generally weak.
     •   Security issues limiting implementation in some woredas.
     •   The results framework needed significant adjustments to better measure the PDOs.

39.    The project addressed the construction delays related to replenishments at the mid-term
review from several angles. First, the initial tranche to communities was increased from 30
                                                10
percent to 50 percent. Second, the overall envelope for a sub-project was raised from $35,000 to
$50,000. Third, the community cash contribution was held at 5 percent, rather than the
progressively increasing scale (5-7-10 percent). These measures substantially reduced delays in
processing replenishments with advances averaging less than four months and full disbursement
of IDA funding.

40.     The MST and WDC turnover was a chronic problem. The project provided training for
these key personnel who would often leave the project. The turnover issue is a long-term
problem that will require the government to find ways to incentivize capacity retention. The
project attempted to improve issues related to SOEs and general fiduciary control by adding
internal auditing. However, capacity weaknesses undermined the effectiveness of this added
layer of control and the project ultimately relied on the external audit function for final fiduciary
control.

41.      Insecurity arose in a few woredas near the Somali border which restricted access and, in a
few cases, made it impossible to continue to operate for the remainder of the project. In these
cases, project resources were redirected to new woredas chosen through the woreda selection
criteria.

42.     The need to improve the measurement of achievement of PDOs was addressed by a
restructuring. An Africa Core Operations Services Department (AFTOS) M&E expert worked
with the project team to address the weaknesses in the results framework, which included
selection of indicators that could be better monitored and expanding coverage of both resilience
and livelihood objectives. The Restructuring Paper (December 9, 2011) provides a clear
explanation of the adjustments. While the restructuring significantly improved the results
framework, the ICR has added significantly to the evidence for outcome ratings.

43.   All these considered, the project’s achievements substantially outweighed these
drawbacks:

     •   Community contributions were readily provided and ownership was secured.
     •   Capacity at all levels to implement steadily improved throughout the project. For
         example, the Afar region which had been seen as lagging in implementation performance,
         caught up with the other three regions by the end of the project.
     •   The bottom line: the project’s record of meeting the beneficiary targets was good.
     •   Project monitoring with respect to PDOs improved after restructuring.

c.       Innovative approaches in the Pastoralist Areas

Community engagement: Feedback received during the ICR mission from beneficiaries
indicated that, beneficiaries felt that their views were valued, that the relevance of the CIF
investments was high, and that they had a greater stake in the success of the intervention.


                                                 11
Community contribution: These contributions had a number of benefits, ranging from
lowering the financing cost of CIF investments to the unleashing of community potential to
improve its own circumstances.

Adding internal audit at Regional level: Internal audit was instituted to compensate for weak
capacity in some woredas because of quality of SOEs and other financial reporting. Woreda
capacity and regional capacity need to be raised to ensure proper FM control prior to external
audit of community projects.

d.     Conclusion

44.     The PCDP is very popular with villagers who see its investments as a means to a better
life, particularly the building of classrooms that lead to a better learning environment. After
education, the communities’ priority has been water for humans and livestock, followed by
health posts. At the conclusion of PCDP II, 32 woredas had graduated from the program
meaning that these woredas have received at least three types of community investment from the
PCDP, health, education and water services, etc.         Interestingly, there was no significant
variation either in sub-project choice, implementation arrangement and/or community
commitment across the four Project regions, despite cultural and geographic diversity.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.     Design. M&E design had several strengths. First, the project set up a sound reporting
structure that allowed detailed tracking of physical progress of the project. Financial transactions
were also well documented even if the flow of data was slow because of the large number of
SOEs. Using community data gatherers for the EWS was a successful design element and
worked well in practice, because communities reported that they felt empowered to better track
the risk of drought and to address it in advance. The main weakness was that the original M&E
framework PDO outcome indicators were only partly adequate to measure the PDOs. The
project also needed to use a number of output indicators to measure PDO achievement, mainly
because outcome indicators were not available, could not be attributed to the Project activities or
because they lacked baselines.

46.     Implementation and Utilization. Despite the deficiencies of the original results
framework, monitoring was good with detailed, output-oriented reports provided on a regular
basis to permit tracking of physical progress of the project. An MIS was implemented and was
functional at the Regional level. Substantial training was provided together with equipment
which enabled MIS officers to use the system to report on all PCDP-financed subprojects of the
SLE component.

47.    At the mid-term review, the results framework was re-designed and adjustments were
made to the KPIs for more effective measurement of project achievements. The coverage of
PDO indicators was expanded by adding six new indicators and by ‘promoting’ three
intermediate indicators to PDO level. The new PDO indicators allowed better measurement of
                                             12
improved socio-economic and infrastructure facilities. For example, the measurement of active
savings accounts and loans through RUSACCOs was added as a proxy for improved incomes
with the rationale that the ability to save and use loans for IGAs was evidence of improve
livelihoods. 2 Though several measured outputs, they were relevant to measuring improved
livelihoods and resilience. In retrospect, it would probably have been better to retain the
community satisfaction survey results in the M&E framework. Fortunately, the satisfaction
surveys continued to be carried out and are used in the ICR evaluation (section 3.2). The MIS
collected data for the new PDO indicators on a periodic basis and was essential to monitor the
completion and functionality of project activities. The MIS data fed back into project
management and allowed project staff to focus on sub-projects whose completion or
functionality was lagging and to know where remedial measures were necessary.

48.      M&E data were critical to the PRM component. The project used community data
monitors to analyze trends in household, environmental, economic and social conditions in
selected areas. The data were sent to regional EWRBs and the federal EWRD of the MoARD on
a regular basis, providing information to trigger early non-food responses to declines in the
welfare of pastoral communities. The PLKM component used M&E data to chart progress of
activities, but did not adequately apply data to troubleshoot in participatory learning and
application of best practices.

2.4.    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

49.     Safeguards. As indicated in the PAD, three safeguards policies were triggered: OP/BP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management), and OP/BP 7.50 (Project on
International Water Ways). The project complied with all three policies. The project was a
Category B because of the larger scale of DPSIP projects, and because the Project financed
schools, health posts, veterinary posts, small- scale water supply and irrigation, small feeder
roads, etc. An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for community
subprojects was prepared that specified subproject screening procedures, the preparation of
environmental and pest management plans, as required, and implementation supervision to
ensure that adverse impacts were avoided or minimized. Environmental screening was carried
out for sub-projects and pest management. The ESMF also included training and capacity-
building requirements at federal, regional and woreda level to support effective implementation.

50.     Involuntary re-settlement was not triggered, however, there were land ownership issues
between communities and woredas. The planning of DPSIPs might have avoided such issues by
having better up front community involvement, which is somewhat ironic for a project otherwise
strong in community consultation.

 The ICR did find additional information on improved incomes, which is referenced in section 3.2 on project
outcomes.

                                                       13
51.      Projects on international water ways, BP7.50 was triggered because of the small-scale
irrigation investments along international waterways. Riparian notification was given to the
governments of Kenya and Somalia for PCDP II investments.

52.     Financial Management (FM). FM practices were new in remote areas and sub-district
levels. It proved time consuming to collect SOEs for all of the CIF sub-projects, aggregate them
at the woreda level, and send them up the chain through the regional governments and to the
FPCU. Without the SOEs, the Bank could not replenish the project account and the communities
would not have the funds to complete the community investment. This process caused some
delays, but did not ultimately negatively affect project development outcome. FM rating was
moderately unsatisfactory before the MTR, but improved thereafter with timely approval of
annual work plans and budgets, and the reduction in all advances to less than four months. The
final ISR upgraded FM performance to moderately satisfactory noting improvements in timely
submission of SOEs, full utilization of IDA funds and actions taken on most of the internal audit
findings related to FM.

53.     Procurement. Procurement capacity assessment was carried out as well as training on
contract administration and documentation. Still capacity inadequacies were evident in the poor
quality of the record keeping and procurement documentation. The ISR rated procurement
moderately unsatisfactory for these reasons, but raised the rating in the final ISR to moderately
satisfactory with improved performance at regional and federal levels. Procurement by
communities was a positive step in capacity building as they gained experience in procuring
skilled labor and building materials for CIF sub-projects. This new capacity created greater
community ownership (as reported in ICR field interviews) and contributed to cost effectiveness
and transparency in the procurement process.

2.5.   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

54.    The triggers for phase III were met (Annex 11), PCDP III was approved by both the
World Bank and IFAD Boards and became effective by April 30, 2014. It is clear that the GoE,
the Bank and IFAD believe that CDD is a successful approach and have scaled up resources,
through PCDP III, to expand coverage to an additional 85 woredas. With the 28 carryover
woredas from PCDP II total number of pastoral and agro-pastoral woredas covered under PCDP
III would be 113. .

55.     PCDP follows up in all respects the PCDP II activities with the exception of the PRM.
The PRM is followed up by another Bank-supported project, the Regional Pastoral Resilience
project which is under the final stage of preparation. PCDP III will continue the roll out of
community based investments across all of the 113 woredas in the four regions, as well as the
28 woredas covered under PCDP II (2.6 million pastoralists), which are scheduled to receive
additional round(s) of community investment. PCDP III will monitor, but not provide additional
investments to the 32 woredas that have graduated.


                                               14
56.     There are several other operations which support PCDP areas, including the IFAD-
financed RUFIP, which is expected to fortify RUSACCOs by strengthening the policy
environment. The Bank and the African Development Bank are supporting the Regional
Pastoralist Livelihoods Resilience Project (RPLRP), which will address issues of pastoralists’
vulnerability in the Horn of Africa (including Ethiopia). In addition, the Bank has ongoing
health and education projects and a roads project which includes access roads.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

57.     Although the project was formally restructured on December 9, 2011, and indicators were
revised, a split rating before and after restructuring is not required. Therefore, the ICR focuses
on the revised indicators to determine the degree of achievement of objectives. In general, the
project progress toward its objectives was reasonably good, but with delays, up to the point of
restructuring and improved after restructuring.

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

(a)    Rating: High

58.    Objectives. The objectives of improved livelihoods and improved resilience remain
highly relevant as the PCDP continues to cover an ever broader area of pastoral and agro-
pastoral areas. While the first two phases of the PCDP have had significant accomplishments in
improving livelihoods and resilience, pastoralists in areas not yet reached by PCDP continue to
have lower than average living standards and to be vulnerable to shocks from weather and
climate change. The Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-16 pillar two aims at
“Enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities” which includes the improved risk
management and delivery of social services, which is the core of the PCDP II. IFAD’s Country
Strategy and Opportunity Paper (COSOP) focuses on the pastoral community as one of its pillars
of engagement in Ethiopia.

59.      Design. The program design, which used the CDD approach and combined community
investments with pastoral risk management, was also highly relevant to the PDOs and current
priorities. Consultations related to the CAS (April 2008) and the ICR mission (March 2014)
revealed that community relationships with the Federal Government had been mainly ‘top down,’
despite the fact that many local governments and communities felt they knew the solutions to
their own local problems. They simply lacked the resources and authority to implement the
solutions. These concerns were particularly prominent in remoter regions. Program activities
following the CDD approach continue to help local governments implement their own solutions.
The high threshold requirements of female participation in microcredit also continue to be
relevant. Many in women’s groups already had some exposure to micro-credits and saw strong
potential in their expansion. The selection of the four regions of Afar, Oromia, Somalia and
Southern Nations was also relevant as these are the regions of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists.
The promotion of improved livestock management is also consistent with the current context of
increasing domestic and foreign (Djibouti, Sudan, Somalia) markets for livestock.
                                               15
60.    Implementation. The PDO, appropriately, remained unchanged during the project.
Rather, the project team revised the results framework which allowed for better measurement of
the achievement of the PDO and to bring the objective itself into clearer focus. The MTR also
made adjustments to make the project more relevant to implementation realities, mainly capacity
constraints, which accelerated progress toward the PDOs.

3.2.    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

61.     The overall PDO indicator achievement was moderately satisfactory before restructuring
and satisfactory after restructuring. These ratings are consistent with the ISR ratings before and
after restructuring. Ultimately, six PDO indicators were exceeded, two achieved, two almost
achieved, one achieved, then dropped, one dropped, one not achieved. The achievement of this
objective accelerated as the project was restructured in 2011. This section is organized
according to three types of evidence to support outcome ratings, PDO indicators, intermediate
indicators and additional evidence generated through ICR field work and research, for each of
the two PDOs.

(b)     Substantial

PDO 1: To increase the resilience of Ethiopian pastoralists to external shocks-achieved

62.      PDO 1 was achieved as shown by both the results framework indicators (Tables 2 and 3),
and additional evidence collected during the ICR mission. The MTR reported a functional EWS
at restructuring, though DPSIPs were lagging.

                                                            manner, albeit with wide range of regional
                                                            rates-Somali-94%, Afar-42%)

63.     With 100 percent of DER early response activities financed in a timely way, the project
effectively mitigated drought risks to, and therefore increased the resilience of, Ethiopian

                                                       16
pastoralists to external shocks. Necessary to this response upstream was the establishment of
early warning in almost all of the targeted woredas. The third indicator of community
satisfaction was also met, but with regional variations.

64.      Intermediate Indicators. Table 3 shows that four out of five indicators were achieved
with the sixth expected to be achieved. The intermediate indicators for preparation of DPSIP
sub-projects and Disaster Preparedness Contingency Plans were not achieved. The DPSIP
activities suffered from weak regional capacity to prioritize and implement the activities as well
as inadequate integration with other subcomponents and local communities.

65.     Additional evidence was collected in the field during the ICR mission. During the
drought of 2011/12, substantial resources were provided to drought-stricken woredas in Somali,
SNNP, Afar and Oromia regions. These resources included water trekking, mitigation of conflict
over scarce resources, fodder supply and livestock vaccination. Although many cattle could not
be saved, there were no reported human fatalities. This suggests that the EWS and the DER
increased pastoralist resilience by working to detect the oncoming drought and to respond
effectively. Pastoralists also had the additional knowledge needed to manage their herds, i.e., that
it was time to sell their livestock to avoid losing them to the drought. Annex 12 provides a
summary of resources provided during the drought as evidence of an effective emergency
response.

PDO 2: To improve the livelihoods of targeted communities-achieved

66.    The measurement of achievement of improved livelihoods rests mainly (and indirectly)
on indicators of increased access to social and economic services, which would then contribute
to improved livelihoods. The overall record of meeting PDO targets was “substantial to high.”
Prior to the restructuring, the livelihoods component was on schedule with respect to

                                                  17
RUSACCOs and moderately behind schedule with respect to CIF sub-projects, as reflected in the
supervision ratings

67.   In terms of PDO indicators relating to social services, two were exceeded, one achieved
and one nearly achieved (Table 4). Three economic service-related indicators were exceeded,
one was achieved and one almost achieved.

% of RUSACCO members with active savings                 Achieved both targets with 100%

Number of livestock benefiting from increased access     Achieved and exceeded (2,290,170 actual,

Households with improved access to small scale           Achieved and exceeded (43,574 actual,
irrigation subprojects                                   9,500 target)
People with improved access to rural roads subprojects   Achieved and exceeded (364,907 actual,
                                                         200,000 target)

68.     By establishing 448 RUSACCOs of which 70 percent had active loan accounts, the
project promoted improved livelihoods by facilitating access to IGAs by pastoralist and agro
pastoralist communities. Achieving 100 percent of members with active savings accounts
contributes to the sustainability of RUSACCOs. Pastoralist livelihoods are also improved
because more than two million livestock gained access to veterinary health services and because
more than 40,000 households benefited from SSI which promoted higher yields and the potential
for crop diversification. The rural roads promoted improved livelihoods by creating access for
economic activities. These latter three PDO indicators also greatly exceeded their targets.

Intermediate indicator achievement

69.     Table 5 shows that six intermediate indicators relating to livelihoods were achieved or
exceeded, one almost achieved and one not achieved. The other two indicators did not have
targets, however, the access to potable water achievement would likely have exceeded any
reasonable target.

Additional Evidence for achievement of improved livelihoods objective

70.     Communities demonstrated a high degree of ownership for CIF, SLE and EWS
investments, contributing an average of Birr 1,829 per household (Birr 483 in cash and Birr
1,346 in kind. For the CIF, communities most often opted for schools, which focus groups stated
offered a pathway to a better livelihood. When asked how education would produce better
livelihoods, communities responded not just that children would be able to get jobs in the towns
and cities, but also that education produced better decision-making. The more than 800 PCDP-
built schools were not only of better quality than traditional construction, but they also improved
access by reducing student traveling distance on average from 5.5 km in the control woredas to 3
km in the PCDP woredas. Teachers reported drop-out rates falling by 53 percent (ETE report,
March 2014). 97.3 percent of the sample respondents stated that they were satisfied with the
PCDP-built schools (PCDP II-End Term Evaluation-ETE). Communities also cited the training
that accompanied CIF subprojects as a source of confidence to make better plans and to build
better infrastructure.

71.     The second choice of communities was water points. These water points (562 completed
projects with over one million beneficiaries) produced enormous benefits in terms of saving time
                                                20
and labor of women who carry water and in terms of better health because the water is cleaner
than alternatives. Water points significantly improved livelihoods by reducing beneficiary
traveling time from 8 km to 4 km on average, which indicates improved access. The ETE also
reported that 87 percent of households stated that their animals were healthier because of better
water access. Community respondents had a 76.3 percent satisfaction rate with the water points
with the remainder shallow or dried out wells in their dissatisfaction. With respect to health
posts access was also improved with people traveling an average of 4 km in PCDP woredas, but
11 km in control woredas. For animal health posts the difference was 4 km and 8 km,
respectively. Access to rural roads was also improved with 52 percent of those surveyed in
project woredas reporting access, compared with only 7 percent in control woredas.

72.    Under the Rural Livelihoods sub-component supported through RUSACCOs, there were
also data for improved income. The ETE calculated that credit beneficiaries earned on average
an additional Br 2,477 of income (range of Br 1,562 to Br 2,858). Those who received more
than one loan generated more than Br 4,000, however repeat borrowing was only half as
prevalent as first time borrowing. No loan defaults were reported.

73.      Participatory Action learning targets were not met. However, knowledge management
activities recorded some significant results. The Project’s activities were promoted through
community radio, the development of a Project website and documentaries on project activities
in each of the four regions. Best practices in pastoralist activities were developed and several
policy studies were completed. However, as described earlier the follow through in
implementation has not yet occurred. This relatively small sub-component can best be viewed as
the project design taking a risk on a high upside of improved policies and practices, but with a
low downside of a small investment.

74.    Project management met its reporting targets for Project progress and financial reporting.
Project audits were also current and training plan targets were met. Annex 2 summarizes the
outputs documented in the Pastoral Community Development Project II End Term Evaluation,
Ministry of Federal Affairs, Addis Ababa, March, 2014.

3.3.   Efficiency

Substantial before and after restructuring

75.     The economic analysis in the main text of the PAD cited, but did not quantify the main
benefits expected from the project. Thus, it did not present an expected net present value (NPV)
or an internal rate of return (IRR). The PAD Annex 10 did provide a quick calculation for the
IGA (RUSACCO) activity of fattening cattle and in PRM of avoiding cattle losses during
drought. There was not sufficient, reliable data at the ICR stage to replicate these calculations on
a project-wide benefits calculation in these two areas. The only relevant IGA data for economic
efficiency was that additional income from RUSACCO loans averaged Br 2,477, as stated above.
However, efficiency of PCDP II for a given level of quality can be measured in a variety of ways
from available data. There were several reports from the field, and observed during the ICR field
                                                21
mission, regarding the superior quality of construction of PCDP schools, birkas (water
harvesting structures), and health centers compared to those built by either government, NGO or
other donor-financed structures. Though PCDP II followed government construction standards,
the project generally did a better job of meeting those standards than did the government itself or
NGOs. For PCDP II, efficiency is evidenced in four ways: utilization of budgeted funds,
percentage of output targets met, construction cost comparisons and the timely completion of the
project (i.e., no extensions of the closing date).

76.     Percentage of funds used. 100 percent of IDA credits and grants were used.
Disbursement of IFAD funds is expected to be 100 percent by the closing of the IFAD portion of
project financing (November 26, 2014).

77.     Percentage of output targets met.        In terms of percentage of output targets met,
efficiency was substantial:

   •    Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement (SLE)/CIF component: 3,123 of 3,401 planned
        sub-projects were completed (92 percent). 94 percent of the completed projects are
        functional
   •    SLE component: 448 of 548 RUSACCOs were established (82 percent). 100 percent of
        these RUSACCOs are functional.
    •   PRM component: 119 of 180 DPSIP projects were completed (66 percent). 94 percent
        of these projects are functional.

78.     Construction cost comparison. Government construction standards for primary schools
and health posts were observed in the PCDP. A standard school included four classrooms or
three classrooms and an office, furniture, as well as latrine for boys and girls. The PCDP II End-
term evaluation produced a cost comparison of construction and furnishing between PCDP and
Government/NGOs. The report found that the PCDP human health posts cost 42 percent less
than Government/NGO for comparable construction. For primary schools grade 1-4 it PCDP
was 57 percent less and for animal health posts PCDP was 43 percent less. (Note: The ICR field
mission could not obtain any other cost comparisons.)

79.    Despite the project’s complexity and implementation challenges, as stated, there were no
extensions of the closing date.

3.4.    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.    In general the project was successful in improving livelihoods and resilience of
pastoralists in the target communities. The record on achieving PDO and intermediate indicators
was good and all of the triggers for moving to phase 3 were met (Annex 11). Additional
evidence showed real benefits to pastoralists in access to basic social and economic services. In

                                                22
addition, the ability of remote and long neglected communities to prioritize and implement
appears to have been catalyzed by the PCDP program. In terms of the specific outcome rating
project outcomes were moderately satisfactory.


3.5.   Overarching Themes: Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

81.     There were strong positive gender aspects to PCDP II, including: i) substantial
enrollment of girls in PCDP II-built schools, ii) high female participation in the RUSACCOs (66
percent of members with active savings accounts are female) which allowed their increased
participation in IGAs; iii) improved women’s health through better pre- and post-natal care from
PCDP-built health posts; and iv) the construction of water points which freed large amounts of
women’s time (typically 1-2 hours per day) and energy from having to carry water from longer
distances, and helped avoid water borne diseases because of improved access to clean drinking
water. In the ICR field mission, women reported that having a water source several kilometers
closer to them gave them additional time with their children and for livestock duties.
Communities also embraced female primary education to a higher than expected degree, given
the male-dominated society. Community elders were aware that educating girls would have a
cascading effect to their children because mothers pass their education on to their children. It
was also reported that the Aksuma system, whereby young girls are married off to older men, was
being challenged in the Afar region, which was at least partly attributable to the PCDP’s focus
on female education. It is still a challenge to achieve higher female participation in project
coordination units and in MSTs. PDCP III is aware of the need to increase female participation
in these areas and is planning to improve this aspect with more aggressive recruiting of females
in project support roles.

82.    RUSACCOs were also particularly valuable to the poorest of the poor, peri-urban
pastoralists who had dropped out of pastoralism because of livestock loss (often because of
drought). Through credit, RUSACCO members had improved access to IGAs. The RUSACCOs
deepened social development by promoting voluntary saving, effective inter-loaning and the
repayment experience, as well as basic training and capacity building.

83.    Overall, the provision of basic social services through functional sub-projects in health,
education and water supply is expected to have poverty reducing impacts. Though data on final
poverty reduction outcomes are not available, the improved access will likely achieve
measurable poverty reduction.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

84.      Institutional change and strengthening through PCDP II comes from a number of sources.
First, training and equipment to the Regional and local governments helped achieve a palpable
improvement in implementation capacity from the beginning to the end of the PCDP II. Second,
                                                 23
a large number of communities now see themselves as capable of taking a greater role in shaping
their future. This capacity can be traced partly to the act of community contribution which was
exceedingly well adopted, to the point that, in some cases, communities increased their
contribution above what was required in order to expand facilities in their communities. Third,
the CDD process showed the beginnings of a transformative change with respect to interventions
outside of the project. For instance, it was reported that, by comparison with CDD, NGO
assistance was often too ‘top down’ and tended to have only a fleeting effect. Communities and
local governments have begun to insist that these other development partners follow practices
similar to CDD where needs are prioritized by the communities from the outset, and even require
community contribution, which had also been typically absent in activities of other development
partners.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

85.    One very positive impact that was not entirely anticipated was the degree to which
community participation would take on a momentum of its own. For instance, communities
would put pressure on woredas, if necessary, to ensure that the woreda would fulfill its
responsibilities toward the new community investment as called for under the MOU between the
woreda and the community.

3.6.   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

86.    Not applicable. There was no formal beneficiary survey as this is a core ICR, however
the ICR field visits are summarized in Annex 10.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

87.     Overall risk to development outcome is significant. There are three main risks: i) there
will not be adequate support to project investments, such as staff, supplies and maintenance to
keep the assets functional and sustain their lives; ii) the government will abandon the CDD
approach that has produced so many benefits and will resume the top down, supply-driven
approach; and iii) early response systems may be difficult to sustain without budget support.
Field interviews suggest that these risks are real, but not likely to fully materialize. On the
positive side, the CDD approach has awakened the power of communities, often to the surprise
of woreda staff. In Jijiga woreda for example, the WDC is asserting itself amongst other
development partners, particularly NGOs and insisting on a community initiative approach. So
there are indications that intensive consultations with communities and prioritization through
CAPs will become a standard feature of development interventions in the future. On the other
side there is a concern that a CDD approach will preserve project investments, unless there is
also continued technical support from woreda facilitators and MSTs. The functioning of user
fees will also be tested.

                                              24
88.     The GoE has more fully recognized pastoralism as an important production and
livelihood system. The PCDP experience has helped lead the Pastoral Standing Committee in
the Ethiopian Parliament to become a strong proponent of pastoral institutions in Ethiopia. In
addition, the Regional Governments with sizable pastoral populations are strong advocates of
pastoral causes. The PCDP development approach based on a CDD model has become part of
the development planning process in these regions. There is also evidence in some areas that the
PCDP has unleashed a self-sustaining process. With social and economic service provision such
as water supply education, health (humans and animals) and rural finance through RUSACCOs
have come gradually improving and diversifying livelihoods that generate more income. These
beneficiaries, in turn, generate more activities which, over time, will yield more tax revenue
which can be spent on expanding social investments. The rate of growth of these activities is,
nevertheless, limited by low purchasing power in the remote areas.

89.     With PRM, people in the project areas are aware of the increasing frequency and
intensity of droughts, so they are not likely to reverse the gains made both in signaling disasters
and in coping with them once they occur.

90.      The EWS was an innovation in the pastoralist areas in which early warning was for the
first time scientifically detected through measurements. Moreover, it was the kebeles themselves
using community members to take control over their risks by taking the measurements. This is
an important element of sustainability, particularly after the EWS was tested and found to work
during the 2011 drought. Still, continued budget support will be necessary to fund data
collection and budget support is not always reliable.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      The Bank effectively used experience from PCDP I to improve performance of PCDP II.
The strengths of quality at entry include a high degree of project relevance, application of lessons
learned from Phase I and other CDD projects and a good plan for substantial amounts of training
at all levels. One significant shortcoming was the quality of the results framework. The PDO
indicators could have been better in meeting “SMART” (Specific, Measurable Attributable,
Relevant, Time-bound) criteria from the start and had to be overhauled at the mid-term review.
This shortcoming was mitigated to some extent by an effective MIS for M&E at the regional
level. Minor shortcomings include an underestimation of gender participation in non-
RUSACCO parts of the project, including the RPCUs, WDCs and MSTs, and a cumbersome FM
structure based on SOEs.


                                                25
(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

92.     The quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory. The project was supervised by the
country office which provided prompt daily support to project implementation. The MTR was
well-done and appropriate adjustments were made that not only sped up implementation, but also
improved M&E (a team member from AFTOS was enlisted to lead and support M&E
improvements—a good practice). As a result, the implementation and the achievement of PDOs
accelerated and the PDO and IP ratings improved to “satisfactory” by the end of the Project,
which met the original closing date. The Bank team worked closely and cooperatively with
IFAD with no significant conflicts reported. This cooperative relationship allowed the project to
deal with implementation obstacles effectively and efficiently. Most importantly, the Bank team
had developed strong interpersonal relationships with both decision-makers and federal and
regional PCUs, which was essential to overcoming the extraordinary development challenges of
the remoteness and the initially low implementation capacity of the beneficiaries. Finally, the
project team was recognized by the region (a VP award) for excellent work on the PCDP II.

93.     The main shortcoming was that the restructuring could have been done earlier to better
measure project outcomes. In addition, the revised results framework could have retained/added
a number of relevant indicators of performance. Fortunately, project monitoring did continue to
track indicators that had been formally dropped from the results framework. The ICR found a
number of these indicators useful in supporting the outcome ratings.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     With quality at entry rated as moderately satisfactory and supervision as satisfactory, the
overall Bank performance rating is moderately satisfactory.

5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

95.    The MoFED satisfactorily supported the processing of PCDP II. The MoFA performance
was satisfactory including its contribution to Project management. This ministry helped ensure
counterpart contributions at the regional level. One area where performance could have been
smoother was in coordination with the MoARD EWRD, as there were occasional
communications lapses and resulting delays in implementation.


                                                26
(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

96.     The FCA satisfactorily implemented the Rural Livelihood Program (RLP) through the
Regional Cooperative Promotion Bureaus (RCPBs) and relevant Woreda Cooperative Promotion
Desks (WCPDs). MSTs provided basic training and support to pastoral RUSACCO’s at
community level in areas where WCPDs require support. There was difficulty with high
turnover on the MSTs and therefore problems with maintaining appropriate composition of
expertise.

97.     The Early Warning and Response Desks (EWRD) of MoARD managed this component
reasonably well under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the MoFA, and
implemented by the regional Early Warning and Response Bureaus (EWRB) and woreda EWRD.
Early responses were effectively financed through DER Grants, which were administered at the
regional level under a EWRD/EWRB management system supported by Regional Project
Coordination Units (RPCUs). This system worked reasonably well as indicated by meeting most
of the PDO and intermediate targets for PRM.

98.      A few aspects of IA performance deserve special recognition. First the quality of project
reporting was high. The reports were thorough and closely tracked a very large number of
Project activities. In addition, in each region, the RPCU has produced films to document and
advertise PCDP activities. The films feature stakeholder interviews, project personnel and
project investments. Most prominent are the stakeholders’ testimonies of how the Project has
positively affected their lives. These testimonials and success stories have greatly contributed to
visibility of PCDP II and as a result the Pastoral Standing committee in the Ethiopian Parliament
considers PCDP as a flagship program in pastoral areas. The PCDP also has a website,
www.pcdp.et.org which surpassed the targeted number of website “hits.”

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

99.   Both Government and IA performances are satisfactory and therefore the overall
Borrower performance is satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

100. A number of lessons were learned from implementation of the PCDP-II project which
cover three main areas: strategies for community development, approaches to disaster risk
management and project management.

Lessons for community development

                                                27
101. The first lesson learned is that communities gain confidence in their ability to solve
their own problems when they receive appropriate training to support decision-making.
The project design recognized this link and provided for awareness raising and training in
financial management and procurement for communities so that they were able to manage their
own CIF investments. Training for FPCU, RPCU and MST staff also needs to be continuous and
allocation of resources adequate to provide effective support to beneficiary communities and
woreda implementing agencies.

102. The second lesson learned is that community empowerment can be achieved by
consultation early in the process on their priorities for use of scarce project funds. The
project experience showed that with just one exposure to control over their own community
resources, communities quickly felt that all future community investments should follow the
bottom up approach. This meant that they planned on insisting that other development partners,
donors and NGOs, as well as government, would have to follow a CDD –style approach. The
PCDP II experience also showed that to ensure success of the consultations, it is important to
have: i) broad participation, including women; ii) effective facilitation of community
discussions; iii) clear accountability of community groups; and iv) strong linkages with related
development efforts.

103. The third lesson learned is that an SOE-driven approach to CIF replenishments is
too unwieldy and creates implementation delays. A fault of PCDP-II design was the
requirement that SOEs have to be assembled at community level and then be passed up the chain
to woreda, region and FPCU levels before communities could receive the remainder of their CIF
resources which were needed to finish construction.      This approach caused delays. A more
efficient approach is one where replenishments are based on Internal Financial Reports. This
practice has been incorporated into PCDP III to accelerate the replenishment process.

104. The fourth lesson learned is that RUSACCOs work well in promoting IGAs that
communities are very familiar with, but less so on promoting new IGAs. The experience of
PCDP is that communities readily used credits for activities they knew well such as animal
fattening and trading, grain trading and shops. There was little evidence of any new activities or
services. This might be attributed to the fact that the credit itself was an innovation and
RUSACCO members wanted to be cautious especially with borrowed money. Additional
engagement with communities may be needed to promote a wider range of IGAs, for example
with activities to promote nutrition.

105. The fifth lesson learned is that, with small-scale irrigation (SSI) interventions, crop
yield improvements are almost automatic, but crop diversification is not. The ICR mission
found that farmers require more time, along with agricultural extension and research inputs, in
order to diversify crops to such things as onions and tomatoes.




                                               28
Disaster Risk Management

106. The sixth lesson learned is that DRM is best addressed as a regional issue in regions
where drought effects, etc., cut across national borders. Although PCDP II had success in
developing DRM, it is also a fact that disasters drive pastoralists across borders such as in
Somalia. That is why the Bank is continuing its support through the Regional Pastoralist
Livelihoods Resilience Project (RPLRP), which includes Ethiopia.

Project management

107. The eighth lesson is that results frameworks need to be well considered at the outset
of project preparation in order to avoid major revisions during project implementation.
Preparation of the results framework would have benefited from additional efforts to identify
readily available PDO and intermediate indicators. For example, data on RUSACCO savings
and loans were monitored by the project and served as proxies for income increases. The results
frameworks also need to closely examine which indicators can serve as PDO rather than
intermediate indicators. For example, during restructuring several indicators (e.g., school
enrollment, % of DER early responses within in one month) were “promoted” from intermediate
to PDO indicator status.

108. The final lesson learned is that developing a close relationship of trust and respect
between the Bank and the Borrower is a key success factor in projects attempting to reach
remote and underserved beneficiaries. In PCDP II, the Bank team further developed strong
interpersonal relationships with both decision-makers and federal and regional PCUs. These
relationships were aided by Bank team knowledge of the local contexts and language (this
knowledge was also resident in regional and federal PCUs). Without this close working
relationship, the project would not likely have been able to produce so many outputs that reached
more than a million beneficiaries in remote areas of the country.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

109. The Borrow has written a high quality ICR that is in basic agreement with the Bank’s
ICR on ratings and impacts and there are no significant factual discrepancies. The only
difference is that the Borrower’s outcome ratings are somewhat more favorable. This may be
partly attributable to the popularity of the PCDP in Ethiopia and the fact that the GoE is taking
into account the challenging implementation context in its outcome rating.

(b)    Co-financiers—International Fund For Agricultural Investment

110.   No significant issues were raised by IFAD.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1   Relevance to National Development Priorities:

The design of PCDP II and its components are relevant to contribute to the government
development direction stipulated in PASDEP and GTP through assisting development of the
basic infrastructure for the nation in general, and for the marginalized areas, in particular.
It is clearly indicated in the rural development policies and food security strategy of Ethiopia
that livestock is the primary sources of pastoral livelihood and every development endeavors
should be geared towards livestock development. In this regard, the contribution of the project
in enhancing the production and the productivities of livestock through enhancing water supply,
veterinary service, and feed sources and market centers is considerable. Moreover, the project is
strictly in line of the millennium development goals as it gives due emphasis, among others, for
education, human health and poverty reduction.

3.1.2   The contribution to needs of the pastoral areas

Climate change-caused frequent drought, deterioration of assets (particularly livestock)
and thus sever food insecurity problems and high vulnerability to shocks are typical features of
the pastoral areas of Ethiopia. Until the late 1990s, pastoralists access to basic infrastructure and
services as well as markets were neglected. PCDP II duly considered these issues as top priority
problems and needs of the pastoralists. In pastoral areas where there was virtually few financial
services, establishment of local financial institution like RUSACCO was imperative.

3.1.3   The contribution to the achievement of PDO

The project components are found to be strongly interrelated and mutually reinforcing. First, the
targeted infrastructure (i.e.; water, school, health, road and irrigation) provide basic services
required for decent development of livelihood. Development of saving credit cooperative is an
engine to stimulate alternative income generating activities and to enhance household economy.
Second, the effectiveness of one component is dependent on the other and hence all components
are mutually inclusive and interacting. In general, there is strong synergy among the outcomes of
the project components towards the achievement of the project development objectives. FGD
with the communities and government line departments confirmed that the PCDP components
are highly complementary and reinforcing towards achieving the PDO.


3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Both the mid-term and end evaluations show that achievement of project development objectives
was generally highly satisfactory, with some variation across components and regions.

                                                 40
3.2.1. Community Investment Fund (CIF)

The performance of the community investment fund was highly satisfactory. About 2.85 million
people participated in project related meeting, training and awareness creation related to the
project. Community participation in terms of contribution was highly appreciable. As a result, a
total of Birr 61 million (100% of planned) was collected in cash and an estimate of Birr 82
million (73% of the planned) in-kind contribution made by communities for the implementation
of CIF subprojects (See Annex 1 for achievement of PDO level target indicators).

The performance of the CIF sub-components revealed that the accomplishment rate of
community subprojects is highly satisfactory with accomplishment rate of 99% of planned
subprojects were completed. Moreover, of the completed facilities, over 98 percent were
operational except 48 subprojects (22 schools, 16 human health posts and 10 veterinary health
posts subproject have been completed but not yet fully functional because they were not
yet furnished. Below are data on the level of achievement of project development goals.

Water: In the project period a total of 592 water supply subprojects were completed. The water
points developed served both for human consumption and for livestock. Nearly 1.1 million
people and 1.3 million livestock population got access to water. The results of the FGDs and
KII revealed that before the project intervention, these beneficiaries were traveling on foot
for about 10 hour to fetch water for home use, which could be roughly estimated at 10 to 15 km.
However, such a long distance is shortened to a radius of 2 to 5 km. Close to 87% of the total
sample households (but only 55% in Afar) revealed that their animals become healthier than ever
after the development of water points. About 76.3% and 73.6% of the respondent in the PCDP
woredas reported that they are satisfied with the water points for domestic use and for livestock
respectively (Loyya, March 201).

School: More than 874 schools were constructed and 852 of the completed subprojects became
operational in the project period and 73,784 students got the opportunity to go to school. Girls’
enrollment constituted 43% of the total. In the PCDP target areas; the maximum distance to the
nearest primary school is 3 km compared to 5.5 km in the control woredas. As reported by
interviewed teachers in the primarily school, dropout drastically decreased by about 53%
compared to the pre-intervention period; and 26% of the sample respondents reported that there
is only minor dropout. In general, 97.3% of the sample respondents have reflected that they are
satisfied with the schools constructed by the project of which 81.1% are very much
satisfied. As PCDP concentrated in the development of primary schools, this in turn created new
demand for secondary schools.

Human Health post: A total of 401 human health posts were completed, and 96% of them were
functional. As a result, 757,648 people (48% female) got access to the health services. The
results of the analyses of the household data also shows that about 81% of the respondents from
PCDP woredas, on average, travel only four km to get access to health facilities and 31% travel
less than half a Km. On the contrary, sample households in the control woredas reported that
they travel, on average, 11 km to access health facilities. Moreover, 64% of the sample
                                                41
beneficiaries reported that they are highly satisfied with the health service and 22% moderately
satisfied. Lack of adequate health personnel and drugs was repeatedly reported by the
community members.

Animal health post: It was planned to construct 373 animal health posts, and 363(97%) were
functioning. Nearly 400 thousand households and 2.3 million livestock got access to the animal
health service. The results of the survey shows that PCDP beneficiaries travel on average 4 km to
access health posts, while distance in the control woredas as far as 8 km. From the household
survey, 83% of the sample confirmed having better access to the animal health service; and 55%
rated that they are highly satisfied (85% reported in Somali) and 24.6% moderately satisfied.
Nevertheless, similar to the human health posts, the animal health posts suffer from lack
of drugs and health experts.

Irrigation: The project developed 3,468 ha of land for irrigation and all are functional. About
42,047 households (22% female head) got access to the irrigation. Somali and Afar regions
have each developed over one thousand ha of irrigated land. The household survey result
shows that 31% of the total respondents have access to irrigation scheme to produce
agricultural products; highest in Somali (48.2%) followed by those in Afar (34.2%), but much
lower in Oromia (14.5%) and SNNP (3.4%). In some areas like in Dallol woreda of Afar
region, there happens a complete land transformation – from bare to productive land.
From the group discussion, it was learned that the productivity of irrigated land (ton/ha) of
maize recorded 3 to 4 tons in Somali, 2.5 to 3 in Afar, 5 in Oromia. The yield for sorghum
recorded 2.5 in Somali, and 6 in Oromia, etc. Thus, the income of households engaged in high
value crop production has increased dramatically. Based on statistical results of the sample, the
total average income generated from using irrigation over the project period was
approximately 8,756 Birr per household (ranging from 12,927 birr in Somali to as low as 1,950
Birr in SNNP), which is significantly greater than the average income for those in the control
woreda (2,983 Birr).

Road and others: In the project period, 1,394 km rural road was constructed, ranging from 297
km in SNNPR to 423 km in Afar. Discussions with community members confirmed that
construction of the road has established stronger social and economic linkages among kebeles,
woredas and market centers than ever before. Of the total sample households in the project
woredas 52% reported having access to rural road, but only 7% in the control woredas which is
significantly different. In addition, the project provided support services to weredas and
kebeles in the construction and expansion of offices, stores, and residential house for local
Development Agents, health extension workers pastoral training centers, kebele offices, and
others as deemed necessary. However, as the demand for residential houses remains huge
(particularly for Development agents, teachers and health extension workers) which has massive
implications on the quality of their services.




                                               42
3.2.2. Rural Livelihood Program

Achievement of the objectives of the RLP has been satisfactory. Out of the planned 548 pastoral
saving and credit cooperatives, 448 (82%) with 30,442 members, (of which 20,202 (66%)
women) were established. These 448 saving and credit cooperatives have managed to mobilize
Birr 21.4 million saving and Birr 6.3 million paid shared capitals from their members. The
regional distribution of the established pastoral saving and credit cooperatives was 147 in Somali,
168 in Oromia, 60 in Afar and 73 in SNNPR. Out of the established 448 pastoral saving and
credit cooperatives, 447 (99.9%) were legally registered and 428 have opened saving bank
account. The remaining 20 RuSACCos are under process to open bank account.

In regards, to awareness creation, the achievements of RLP were satisfactory. While it was
planned to train 8254 pastoral saving and credit cooperatives committee members, 7,923 (96%)
committee members were trained. Similarly, it was planned to provide awareness creation for
26,448 pastoral saving and credit cooperative members. Accordingly, awareness creation was
given to 17,160 (65%) of whom 12,360 (72%) were women. Moreover, while was planned to
provide training to 124 woreda cooperative auditors and accountants, training was provided to 80
(65%). and 80 (64%) woreda cooperative auditors and accountants. Moreover, training of
trainers was planned for 143 cooperative experts and project staff in 2002 and 2003 EFYs,
respectively. Accordingly, the Federal Cooperatives Agency has provided a 10 days training on
organization and management of saving and credit cooperatives for 141 experts and regional
project. It was planned to cascade the training at regional level for 176, 147 & 120 woreda
cooperatives promotion staff and woreda and MST project staff in 2002, 2003 and 2004 EFYs,
respectively. Accordingly, the training was delivered to 155 (72%), 52 (35%) & 116(96%)
woreda cooperatives promotion staff and woreda and MST project staff in 2002, 2003 and 2004
EFYs, respectively.

Provisions of credit services under RLP were satisfactory. Out of the 448 pastoral RuSACCos
engaged in saving mobilization; 406 (91%) have provided Birr 23.68 million loan to 18,467
members, of which 71% were women, from own savings. Besides, from seed money disbursed
from project fund, 398 (89%) pastoral RuSACCos (110 in Somali, 49 in Afar, 168 in Oromia
and 71 in SNNPR) have provided Birr 39.14 million loan to 22,148 members, of which 68%
were women. According to the end-term evaluation, the majority of the credit beneficiaries
(63.6%) received credit only once, but there are members receiving two or more time. Moreover,
the result of the evaluation shows that repayment was 100% for the mature loan and no default
was recorded.

Moreover, he financial performance of 372 (83%) RUSACCOs have been audited (131 in
Somali, 37 in Afar, 163 in Oromia & 41 in SNNPR). The result of the auditing findings
confirmed no loss observed. See Annexes 3 to 7 for achievement of PDO level target indicators.




                                               43
3.2.3. Pastoral Risk Management

Achievement of the activities of the pastoral early warning system sub-component of this
program was satisfactory. As part of this sub-component, it was planned to establish/strengthen
different committees working on early warning and response activities. Based on this, all
regions have established/strengthened the regional level committees. During the same period,
45, 32, 33 and 12 Woredas of Somali, Afar, Oromia and SNNP regions respectively,
have established/strengthened the Woreda level committees. To make data collection simple
and understandable, existing weekly and monthly early warning data collection format was
translated in to Afaan Oromo, Somali and Afar languages. As a result, language barrier had been
fully resolved and the format is understandable by all data collectors particularly at grass roots
level. In addition, the project has supported the hiring of 529 community data collectors
(CDCs) in 529 nodal kebeles selected from 122 Woredas of four regions. Moreover, EWR
departments have fully collected, analyzed and interpreted 48 weekly and 12 monthly
early warning information on a yearly basis from 122 pastoral and agro pastoral Woredas.

Achievement of the Disaster Preparedness Strategic Investment Program sub-component has
been found to be satisfactory. According to the end evaluation, DPSIP was one of the poorly
accomplished sub-components. Out of 181 projects planned only 162 (89%) were completed.
Even those completed projects are about 80% concentrated in two regions only (Oromia 50%
and Somali regional state 30%). Major project activities undertaken were in the areas of
rangeland management, pond establishment, livestock market centers development, drilling and
construction of boreholes, forage development and rangeland management were undertaken in
Somali, treatment of upper water shades protection, forage development and drilling and
construction of boreholes and Drilling and construction of boreholes and small scale irrigation
scheme in SNNP. Thus, the sub-component performance towards achieving the targeted
project objectives was rated as satisfactory.

3.2.4. Participatory Learning and Knowledge Management

Generally, the achievements of this sub-component were evaluated to be moderately satisfactory.
The end evaluation observes that even though much was not accomplished through
the Participatory Action Learning sub-component, remarkable achievements were recorded with
the project knowledge management. The project has familiarized itself with the public and
created a positive image. Moreover, targeted activities such as dissemination of information
via Community Radio using local language, developing and lunching of web site,
experience-sharing visit, and documentation of best practices were accomplished. Physical
capacity building for resource centers for the four regions and at FPCU level was also
accomplished. In addition, mini media clubs established in some school and equipment were
procured and disseminated. Bilingual documentary films were produced and distributed to
stakeholders. Moreover, three policy implementation studies such evaluation conflict prevention
and resolution strategy. Implementation of Development policies in the pastoral & Agro-pastoral
areas and      constraints & opportunities Sedenterizing pastoralists and its implication studies

                                               44
were conducted respectively by Ministry of Federal Affairs (MoFA),SNNPR and Oromia. See
Annexes 14 to 17 for achievement of PDO level target indicators.

3.3. Efficiency

In general, the overall efficiency of the project was found to be satisfactory and,
particularly efficiency of the sustainable livelihood enhancement component is rated as highly
satisfactory.

3.3.1. Budget planned Vs. utilized

A total of USD 113.34 million was allocated from IDA and IFAD for PCDP II. All of (100%)
the budget allocated by IDA was utilized by the project, while of the budget allocated by IFAD,
89% was utilized. The average fund utilization was 96%. In regards to regional governments’
contribution, ETB 67,684,467 was allocated and 100% of it was utilized. Similarly out of ETB
60,983,845.13 community cash contribution, 99.9% was utilized. However, only 73% of
the expected community in-kind/labour contribution of ETB 112,334,444.87 was utilized by
the project.

The critical problem, which compromised the efficient utilization of the project’s budget,
was the delay in releasing funds from federal to regions and then reaching each beneficiary
community. As reported by the FPCU, the root cause of the problem for the release of the
fund was delays by the beneficiary Woredas and other implementing agencies to report the
Statement of Expenditure on time. In general, the rate of disbursement of fund often lags
behind the schedule rate at which the communities contribute and limited the speed of
implementation of some sub projects in many regions.


3.3.2. Quality of the works done against the costs incurred

Cost wise, all PCDP completed projects are cost effective with better quality compared to non-
government projects. All completed projects so far complied with the standard set by the
regional respective sector bureaus and Woreda offices. Moreover, the FGD and KII conducted
for the end evaluation confirmed that all constructed facilities have better quality compared to
similar facilities constructed by the government and NGOs, which rises demand for PCDP
projects among most pastoral communities in target and control Woredas.

Even though cost of projects varies from place to place, the average cost of most of the
community subprojects implemented so far in all four regions ranged from about 475 to 800
thousand Birr. In terms of projects, the cost of the first cycle primary school varies from 450,000
to 675,000, health post from 517,647 to 667,000, veterinary posts from 494,118 to 588,235
birr and birkas from 250,000 to 370,500 birr. From the experience of the consulting firm,
these costs of construction of the infrastructure are fair and the qualities of the facilities produced
are to the standard.
                                                  45
Moreover, average cost of infrastructure through the PCDP II was much lesser than that of
Government or NGOs. The cost of construction and furnishing human health posts by the PCDP
II was 42% less than that of the government or NGOs, animal health post 43% less and primary
school 57% less. Thorough discussion with the government and PCDP field level staffs
also confirmed the result of the analysis. Therefore, the community based infrastructure
development by the PCDP II was cost-efficient.

Time efficiency of PCDP II projects, was, however, found to be less than cost efficiency. The
end evaluation found construction through the PCDP takes relatively       less time than the
government practice. That is mainly because of close follow up and control by community
committee.

3.3.3. Project cost versus total number of beneficiaries

Considering the total project cost in relation to the number of beneficiaries, PCDP II activities
have high efficiency. The project supported about 1,910,538 beneficiaries at a cost of
approximately 1.611 billion birr. Thus, the project cost per capita was roughly 842.6 birr during
the entire project period, which is about 5,000 birr per household.

3.4. Sustainability

Evaluated from institutional, technical, environmental, and economic and financial perspectives,
the project results were found to be potentially sustainable. Section four of this report presents
detailed discussions of the above components of sustainability and presents the potential
challenges and strengths. (Summary of key performance indicators is included in the Table A16
and A17 in the Annex).

3.5. Overall outcome rating

The “Satisfactory” rating is given for the project on the basis of a combined rating of the
relevance of objectives/design, achievement of development objectives, and efficiency. The
design and objectives of PCDP II were found to be highly relevant to the national development
agenda, as reflected in the focus of PCDP II on critical pastoral development issues in the GTP.
Moreover, the CIF was found to pay due attention to priory needs of pastoral areas, particularly
access to services and market linkage.

In addition, PCDP II, on the average, has satisfactorily achieved most of its project development
objectives. Achievement in the sub-components of the community investment fund such as
water supply, human health and vet posts, primary schools and community roads are particularly
commendable.

Furthermore, the overall efficiency of the project was found to be satisfactory. Particularly
efficiency of the sustainable livelihood enhancement component is rated as highly satisfactory. It
                                                46
was further found that the quality of constructions done through PCDP II was much higher, per
unit cost, as opposed to constructions through other projects. The same observation was made
regarding project cost per beneficiary.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Other important overarching outcomes expected are poverty reduction, improvement of women’s
conditions and social services enhancement. The percentage share of the gender composition of
community consultation participants revealed that there was a considerable improvement not
only on the overall number of participants but also on the level of participation of women from
time to time.

The project was thoughtful and gender-sensitive to include women as key players in the sub-
projects and in the establishment of saving and credit cooperative. Participation and
benefits of women and girls were vibrant. As per the finding of the household survey carried out
for end assessment (Loyya, March 2014), 98.2% of the respondents reflected that female’s
participation in the project cycle management and decision making is satisfactory.

The results of focused group discussion with the communities and local government experts
shows that the role of women and youth (particularly girls) in the local development and
decision making process through PCDP II were considerably high. Beside labor/cash
contribution, women were involved in all development committees at community and Kebele
levels and fully engaged in decision making process. More appreciably, women and girls seem to
have benefited more from the project results. Women comprised the largest proportion of
membership in saving and credit cooperatives. As women and girls are the most
disadvantaged group bearing huge workload, their access to water, schools and health
services provided them two- pronged advantage: one being developing their human capital and
life quality, and the other improving the livelihood situation of their families.

Contributions of improved water supply enhanced: Improving water supply relieved
women and girls from the workload and contributed to increased school enrollment. A
number of boreholes, shallow wells, ponds and birkas/Ella have been developed in most project
areas. Construction of water supply points reduced distance to travel to fetch water. Though the
actual impact of such projects on morbidity and mortality should be put for further investigation,
the discussion with communities, school teachers and local development experts confirmed that
the water supply points greatly curbed the work-load of women and girls and contributed to
increased school enrollment.

Irrigation development enhanced crop farming and induced sedentarization: The introduction and
expansion of irrigation schemes increased area under irrigation farming, crop production and
productivity. High value crops are introduced and farmers were able to get access to modern
crop production technologies, improving their income. Beyond increasing cash income, the
                                             47
introduction of irrigation farming reduced chronic food insecurity and facilitated the
transition of pastoralists from pastoralism to agro pastoralism and to sedentary farming
livelihoods, as confirmed also by the beneficiaries discussed with. Furthermore, irrigation
farming enabled pastoralists/agro-pastoralists to get access water and pasture without moving far
and influenced them to live in settled/sedentarized manner.

Increased school enrolment with no gender bias: With construction of schools by the PCDP, the
rate of enrollment significantly increased and larger number of children attended their education
than ever before the intervention. It is observed by study group that fairly equitable access to
school for girls and boys was realized with improved quality. In Afar, group discussion
revealed that educated girls have started to challenge the “Aksuma system” where old men marry
to young girls as early as 14 years old. In Somali, the construction of schools also contributed to
the rising number of adult education. The evaluation study has also proved that combination of
water development and modern school infrastructures significantly reduced school dropout as a
result of reduced migration for water and pasture. The long run impact of expansion of
education facilities on human capital development and subsequently on socio-economic
development is perceivable.

Access to better health service: Post and prenatal counseling services have been made available
at health posts. Women group discussion indicated that child mortality due to preventable
diseases declined due to better vaccination services. In some areas, nutritional support has been
provided to reduce lifelong disability and retardation caused by chronic malnutrition.
Furthermore, incidence of epidemics decreased due to proper preparedness and regular
awareness creation through health extension program. The health service under PCDP II
also contributed to reduced negative impacts of traditional harmful practices, which aggravate
serious health complications on vulnerable groups such as women, girls and children.
Furthermore, the project improved knowledge, perception and attitudes of communities towards
modern health services complemented with the health extension programs of the government.
However, availability of drugs and health experts is a challenge to sustainable human and animal
health services, particularly in Afar and SNNPR.

Stock of basic infrastructure increased: Evidences from direct observation, responses
of communities and secondary data disclose that the pastoral project areas have relatively larger
stock of basic services/structure most of which are constructed through the support of the project
with the community participation. If properly managed on sustainable manner, the positive
implications of the stock of these basic infrastructures on the socio-economic development of the
communities will be immense.

Saving and credit culture improved and involvement in IGAs increased: In order to promote
alternative livelihoods and diversify income sources, PCDP introduced and promoted rural
saving and credit cooperatives. Accordingly, 78% of total eligible members for loans received
loans. Similarly, 100% of the total members of RUSACCOs have active saving accounts. The
credit beneficiaries engaged in different income generating activities such as petty trade,

                                                48
livestock marketing, grain marketing, vegetable production, goat and sheep fattening and selling,
milk marketing, and cattle fattening, etc.

As a result, the sample household obtained on average 2,477 Birr of net income from one round
of loan for the IGA activities. The benefit ranged, from 2,858 Birr in Afar to 4200 birr in
SNNPR. Those who repeatedly received loans generated more than Birr 7000 per head. The loan
beneficiaries managed to increase their cash income on average by 182%. Thus, it was made
possible for 63% of loan beneficiaries to increase their income (87% in Somali, 60% in Afar,
58% in Oromia & 43% in SNNPR). As a consequence of the credit service, target communities
highly dramatically improved their saving culture, got better access to credit service, which led a
number of members of the cooperatives to engage in alternative income generation
activities. A good evidence is that average income from petty trade accounted for only 1% of the
total average household annual income before the intervention and with the control groups, but
now it grew up to 10% with intervention group of PCDP. It was also observed that women are
dominant beneficiaries of the credit service, with more engagement in
enterprises/entrepreneurship. As a result, credit beneficiaries gained on average 4200 Birr of
additional income from alternative income sources using the credit service. This certainly
contributes to reduce their vulnerability.

Improved access to market: Considerable kilometers of roads have been developed, and many
Kebeles/villages are networked. The discussion with the communities pointed out that the
development of livestock market centers as induced by or complemented to the road
construction significantly reduced the long distances pastoralists were supposed to travel to
sell their livestock and buy food and non-food products.

Poverty reduction and pastoral transformation: The project has significantly contributed towards
the regional/national policy objectives for poverty alleviation and economic transformation of
the pastoralists. For instance, considerable population got access to water, education, health, road,
and financial services and become healthier and more productive society because of the
intervention of PCDP II. Note that these indicators are also measures of achievements towards
the Millennium Development goals.

3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has well responded to top priority needs of the regional states dominated by pastoral
and agro-pastoral livelihood. The project massively addressed the problems of lack of basic
infrastructure and services, absence of local financial institutions, proper disaster-risk
management in the short and long-run.

Capacity building provided to project staff members and affiliated stakeholders at federal,
regional and Woreda level significantly enhanced the knowledge and skill of the experts and
project managers, particularly in the areas of project management and response to early warning
and disaster risk management. This greatly contributes to human capital development of the
nation.
                                                49
PCDP II realized decentralized local development approach: Analysis of the project design
and implementation indicates that PCDP II was started through initiating community
participation, cultivating traditional knowledge, developing self- reliance and trust, empowering
the community and mobilizing resources and introducing the practices of decentralized
management.
Integration with activities of other development partners: To avoid duplication of resources and
efforts, PCDP II worked together with Government and other NGOs and formed a kind of
Stakeholders Forum. In so doing, it was found that the development partners were collaborative
and reinforcing their activities at the grassroots level. For instance, strong project link was
observed with PSNP, and with activities of UN agencies like WFP, UNICEF, etc. which is
often uncommon in many other projects in Ethiopia. Decision on project budget allocation and
utilization was done with mutual understanding of the F/RPCU, line departments at regional
offices and the Woreda Development committee.

3.5.3 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In the course of the project period, it has been observed that some positive unintended outcomes
have evolved. These include:

Based on their experience in PCDP, communities have started to question and create pressure on
government and NGOs to make the planning, budgeting and M&E systems of their projects
transparent and participatory. Because of the development of basic infrastructure, particularly
water, there is a tendency of reduction of movement of the pastoralists in search of water.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

4.1 The Institutional Risk to Development Outcome

PCDP has adopted the most decentralized community based development approach in Ethiopia.
To ensure sustainability, the PCDP organized local committees (KDC, CPMC, CPC and Appeal
Committee) which are responsible for the overall coordination, management and
implementation of projects that selected and prioritized by the communities. These
committees are capacitated through awareness creation, consultation meeting, regular
training on the principles and procedures of project management, need assessment and
developing fundable project profiles. Apart from their major responsibilities, these committees
are mandated to mobilize community resources. Furthermore, the WDCs are established and
supported by the Woreda technical committees organized from the Woreda sector offices
and experts to appraise, coordinate the overall implementation of the community projects.
The evaluating team of Loyya Consulting (March, 2014) found that nearly in all the
established committees women comprised 25% of the committee members. All the committees
have regular meeting and clearly know their roles and responsibilities. Their discussions and
decision making process are transparent. Participatory decision making and M&E system have

                                               50
become their culture. Besides abiding by the PIM of the project, accountability of the committees
is reinforced by the culture and tradition of the community.

Procurement of CIF projects is undertaken by the community procurement committees who are
trained in the subject matter. Except some procurements that need higher level skills and
experience, which are effected by Woreda and RPCUs on the behalf of the communities,
many of the procurements are carried out by the community procurement committee,
while the project management committees ensuring that the quality of materials and level of
costs are of acceptable level.

Furthermore, the committees established at Woreda and Kebele levels such as the WDC
and the KDC are part of the formal government permanent development structures which
live up beyond the span of the project time. The PCDP projects become part of the
woreda and sector integrated plans once the WDC and the technical committee complete
the appraisal of these projects. Sector offices would allocate the necessary budget for
operational cost and assign manpower for the PCDP infrastructure up on project completion.
Furthermore, once the projects are completed, projects are managed by communities
with technical supports by the respective sector offices. The communities would remain
responsible for operation and maintenance of subprojects.

The knowledge and experience gained in project management by the communities as a whole is
immense. As gathered by the study mentioned above, all respondents feel that the basic
infrastructure and services developed by the project belong to them and that they are always
ready to protect and maintain for proper utilization.

An important observation made in the survey sites was that most committee members are
illiterate which would create a challenge to keep up minutes of discussion and meetings. This is
crucial particularly with committees involved in procurement and RuSACCOs since they are
dealing with finance that needs well done records. In a few cases, MSTs and facilitators are
providing assistances.

In conclusion, all institutional arrangements were strengthened and the majority of the Woredas
and the communities are currently self-reliant to manage and plan development
projects and programs in their respective areas. They developed trust, voluntary participation,
accountable and strong sense of ownership better than any other time in pastoral societies. Thus,
generally the institutional risk to development just moderate. However, illiteracy is limiting
their performance in terms of record keeping and financial management independent of
technical assistance from the facilitators and MST. Therefore, the potential for sustainability of
the project outcomes with respect to institutional factor is subjected to further technical
assistances to the committees.

4.2 The Technical Risk to Development Outcome

The PCDP project in general is community driven, managed and implemented within the
capacity of the community. The design of these projects is simple and local materials are used to
effect implementation. The largest part of construction materials for the CIF projects are wood,
stones and sand and semi-skilled human power. Nearly all these inputs are procured from local
markets.

The MSTs and the engineers from the relevant sector offices regularly monitor construction
activities. The regional FPCU and the sector offices also provide technical support during
implementation to ensure the quality of construction and the functioning of the projects. As
a result all CIF sub-projects have been proved for their good qualities and authenticated for
fulfilling technical considerations.

The risk assessment knowledge and experience of the communities and staff is better than the
pre project period. The Kebele early warning committee and the staff of the relevant offices
are relatively capacitated in risk identification, preparedness, prevention and mitigation.
Regular reports and assessment have been submitted. However, to improve the quality and
expand scope of their activities regular and frequent training that acquaint them to more
knowledge and technologies have to be introduced. In general, most PCDP outcomes are
based on indigenous knowledge, simple technological and technical option and depend on local
resources. Therefore, results are easily adaptable and replicable to various socio economic
circumstances.

The management, operation and maintenance arrangement for the infrastructure after the project
phase out is well defined. Since local communities have little or no experience of the
management and maintenance of some advanced facilities such as water reservoir and pipelines,
sustainability of these facilities are uncertain as in the cases of many government constructed
projects. Moreover, many activities and facilities for the PRM sub-components of PCDP
II are not completed and need continuous follow up. It is also not clearly defined how the
monthly and quarterly reporting system on early warning is sustainable after the support of
PCDP II expires. In general, sustainability of most infrastructure and facilities developed is
technically very questionable, making the technical risk to development outcome of high level.

4.3 The Environmental Risk to Development Outcome

Though the problems are not crucial at present, there is a likely occurrence of
sedimentation and siltation with the water points. Even though silt structure is constructed,
it is too small to capture heavy silt sedimentation in the birkas. Furthermore, in most of
the areas where irrigation is developed converting the earthen canals into concrete structures is
needed to reduce seepage, water logging and lose of water. In addition, because of the growing
demand, the limited supply irrigation could be a source of social conflict. Some incidences of
conflict have been noted in Shinile and Errer woredas of Somali region. Similar problems might
happen with regard to potable water points for human and livestock. The water points developed
                                               52
in the target communities are few in number and have limited volume in relation to the human
and livestock population. Furthermore, quality of water from birkas is not to the standard for
human consumption, requiring sanitation and hygiene education and continuous training and
monitoring of health in place. Thus, water supply and irrigation schemes need utmost attention to
ensure their environmental sustainability and impacts. The level of environmental risk to
development outcome was thus assessed by the same study mentioned earlier to be low.

4.4 The Economic and Financial Risk to Development Outcome

It is obvious that the largest source of PCDP fund is from the international development
partners. Thus unless the Ethiopian government takes special financial arrangement to sustain
the funding of the activities for a continuous delivery of services and community projects
with same number and quality is at high risk post- termination of PCDP II. Although there are
some efforts in Oromia to introduce user fees or service charges for water use, the system is not
well articulated. Besides, this approach is not attempted in other regions. Also, the source of fund
for maintenance and operation costs of the infrastructure in place is not yet clearly and
formally defined.

On the other hand, however, the local government has the capacity to take over projects
already completed and to ensure their functionality. Woredas have allocated the necessary
human resources, logistics and materials to ensure full functioning of the infrastructures and to
ensure satisfactory service provision. Similarly, commitment of communities to increase their
contribution (up to 25% of the investment cost) may ensure maintenance and management of the
infrastructure. Moreover, the established RuSACCOs are good potential for financial
sustainability for IGAs. If further monitoring and technical support is given, the prospect for
rapid development of entrepreneurship and household income growth is high. Although the
overall level of economic and financial risk to development outcome is assessed to be low,
the financial sustainability of the project is still subject to further work on proper phase out
strategy

5. PERFORMANCE OF STAKEHOLDERS

5.1 Bank Performance

The World Bank provided frequent and close technical supports/advisory services and facilitated
financial transfer, which significantly contributed to the success of the project. Overall, the
project management and partners’ supports were satisfactory, both in the implementation process
and towards achieving the desired outcomes of the PDO.

5.2 Borrower Performance

It is learned that in some regions capacity gap seems to prevail to effectively implement
the RLP sub-component. For example, there is an implementation capacity limitation at
regional Cooperative Office in Afar region while the woreda level structure is not yet
                                            53
equipped with manpower in Somali region. In Afar region, the regional office lacks field vehicle
to support the woredas and also all woredas lack the necessary technical staffs required to
facilitate the formation of RuSACCOs. The capacity gap at regional cooperative office in Afar is,
nonetheless, a new phenomenon, which was not anticipated during the project design and
hence requires further attention in order to alleviate capacity gaps created at regional level.

In the SNNP region, shortage of budget, lack of transport facilities, staff turnover both at
regional and woreda level and low Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) are some of the concerns
reported to have constrained the cooperating institutions.

It is learned that in some regions (e.g., in Afar and Somali) the MSTs are not travelling together
to the woredas and kebeles within their coverage. The FGDs participants among the MSTs in the
woredas visited indicated the need for a continuous technical support at community level.

In Somali Regional State, the co-operative agency has been restructured and it is not represented
at woreda level although there is one cooperative expert assigned in Woreda Agriculture
and Pastoral Development Office. Thus, due to lack of cooperative structure at woreda level
there was no direct communication between regional cooperative agency and woreda
cooperative experts. Notwithstanding this, some experts from the region in collaboration with
the MSTs have managed to mobilize and organize saving and credit groups with the help of 21
cooperative accountants/promoters who were employed by the project to fill the gap.

The commitments of both the Project Steering Committee (PSC) at regional level and the WDCs
vary from region to region and from woreda to woreda. For example, in Afar region, the regional
PSC does not meet regularly. Similarly, in some woredas of the same region, the WDC is
composed of the woreda administrator, PDO head and FEDO head only, while the rest of the
committee members are passive and not actively participating. On the other hand, the
situation observed in the sample woredas of the SNNP and Oromia regions was different. For
example, strong and energetic WDCs have been observed in woredas of Hamer, Dirre and
Moyale where all members of the committee have implementation information equally and
participate in the meetings actively.

In the SNNP Region, it is learned that the regional PSC meets regularly, but absence of some
members of cooperating institutions particularly during budget appraisal and approval process
has been a concern, which led to a loose follow-up during implementation process. The
problem may be attributed to the fact that chairman of the steering committee is Head of the
Regional Bureau of Pastoral Affairs who have got similar status with the other Heads of
cooperating institutions like Marketing and Cooperatives Bureau, and Disaster Preparedness,
Prevention, Early Warning and Response Bureau. This could probably be addressed by making
a person of high official (e.g. at the level of Vice President of the Regional Government) the
chairperson of the steering committee.

6. LESSONS AND FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS

It is commendable that the project is highly participatory. The assessment has identified the need
for concerted and targeted community capacity building in the project areas, especially in light of
the particular need of pastoral communities in the country. In this regard, there is a need to
strengthen the technical capacity of the planning and implementing bodies through continuous
technical supports including training.
The inability to provide Statement of Expenditure (SOE) on time has resulted in the delaying of
releasing funds from federal to regions. This not only compromised the efficient utilization of the
project’s budget, but also potentially erodes community trust in the project and impact
participation. Thus, there is further need to carry out local capacity building and backstopping
work at the local level.

Women are the major beneficiaries of the credit service in PCDP II, with good
engagement in enterprises/entrepreneurship. This would help them in reducing their vulnerability.
Thus, sustaining and strengthening of the participation of women and youth in the local
development, promoting social inclusiveness and holistic approach to support livelihood
development are essential measures that need to be given attention in the decision making
process in PCDP III.

The PCDP II has clearly contributed to solving of the problems of lack of basic infrastructure
and services, absence of local financial institutions, and in establishing proper disaster-risk
management system and promoting livelihood diversification. These initiatives and foundation
need further development and refinement, and institutionalization in order to ensure their
technical and service sustainability.

Water supply and irrigation schemes are crucial factors for sustainable pastoral and agro-pastoral
development and to enhance environmental sustainability and impacts of PCDP investments and
projects. In connection with this, there is a need to ensure that capacity gaps of implementing
projects are filed in on time. Although, pastoral communities have demonstrated that they are
able to plan for and effectively implement investment sub-project, there are gaps that need
further attention such as broad participation/inclusiveness, effective facilitation of community
discussions and community level learning from experiences of the local development process

The role of Woreda Development Committees (WDC) is critical to the success of
implementation PCDP projects at woreda and kebele levels: Although there is variability among
the regions and woredas, there is a need to strengthen the capacity and encourage the
commitments of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) at regional level. Also commended is
continuous sensitization of the woreda leadership and office heads as well as regular experience
sharing among woredas.

It should be also noted that there is a need to strengthen harmonization of PCDP projects with
other programs such as PSNP in order to facilitate their effectiveness and sustainability of their

                                                55
impacts. Moreover, scaling-up and institutionalization of community driven development
approach is essential to ensure sustainable development of pastoral and agro-pastoral systems.

Initiatives by communities and local government need to be complemented by adequate
implementation/oversight support, financial management and literacy training, procurement and
technical capacity building. There is also a need to for a continuous staff training and adequate
allocation of resources to enable the FPCU, RPCUs and MSTs to provide effective support to
beneficiary communities and woreda implementing agencies.

Another point that deserves attention in the future PCDP the need for promoting improved
nutrition among pastoral/agro-pastoral communities: Nutrition awareness can be incorporated
more explicitly in community discussions of their local development issues as well as research
component in pastoral livelihood development.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
IFAD

   1) Despite the demanding decentralized implementation arrangement of the project
      involving multiple stakeholders dispersed in 55 woredas, implementation of the PCDP II
      over the last five years has been successful. Accordingly, the project has been effective in
      meeting its development objectives and has registered tangible results in all components.
      IFAD noted with satisfaction the many important achievements in the areas of basic
      service provision and livelihood improvement interventions.
   2) The demand driven nature of the project has helped the communities to identify their
      needs from within, ensured participation of women and youth, and the approach worked
      well and was adapted to the conditions of pastoral communities, hence contributing to
      ensure sustainability of the project as well as to increase the sense of ownership.
      Moreover the federal and regional governments have demonstrated their support for
      participatory approaches that enhance ownership, accountability and community
      empowerment with decision making authority and access to resources.
   3) Implementation progress of the three inter linked sub-components under the PLKM
      component namely Knowledge Management and Networking (KMN), Participatory
      Action Learning (PAL) and Policy Implementation Studies (PIS), have gathered
      encouraging momentum over the last five years. Under the Knowledge Management and
      Networking sub-component IFAD appreciates the user friendly project website
      www.pcdp.gov.et with dynamic and comprehensive information on the pastoralists,
      which already had over 60,000 visitors.
   4) IFAD noted with satisfaction the implementation arrangement, which brought deeper
      positive changes from the ‘business as usual’ model to an all-round ‘pastoralist friendly’
      and enabling environment. The implementation support and supervision mission’s
      finding reveal that participatory monitoring and evaluation sub-component has already
      set up a best practice model for the country and hence rated highly satisfactory.
   5) A strong selling point for PCDP II is that apart from the fact that the project is fully
      encored in the GoE’s Growth and Transformation Plan, it is also a people-centred project
      that addresses pastoralists and agro-pastoralists development priorities in a holistic
      manner and not merely focussing on their animals or the rangelands that they inhabit. The
      successful introduction of this local development process (CDD) has enabled
      communities to set their own priorities for access basic public social services, i.e. health,
      education, and communication while introducing incentives for investment private goods
      by beneficiaries
   6) PCDP II is highly relevant to IFAD's mandate in Ethiopia to one of the three pillars of
      IFAD’s engagement in Ethiopia. These pillars are defined in the IFAD Country Strategy
      Paper (COSOP) for engagement in Ethiopia and are: a) rural financial service; b) natural
      resources management and smallholder irrigation development; and c) pastoral
      community development. The project (PCDP II) also provided a strong avenue for the
      IFAD scaling up agenda in Ethiopia that’s focuses on scaling up positive and successful
      results rather than simply scaling up projects. This is demonstrated in the third phase of
      this project (PCDP III) that’s only scales up successes from PCDP I and II. Overall IFAD
                                               57
       rates this project as Satisfactory. However, based on evidence presented here, it can also
       be argued that it be ranked overall as Highly Satisfactory as the project closes on a
       relatively high performance note. In addition, part of the evidence for this high rating is
       the joint supervision and implementation support mission and collaboration model
       between WB and IFAD that was implementation in this project under the leadership of
       the Bank TTL. This successful arrangement stands out as a positive reference point in
       IFAD for collaboration with co-financiers elsewhere across IFAD.

Additional Comments From IFAD Project Coordinator

IFAD is fully in agreement with the ratings in the ICR and also notes that there is no significant
discrepancies in the report and the ratings. It is also to be noted that IFAD will so use this same
ICR for its internal Project Completion Processes. The strong government and community
ownership of this project is another positive aspect of this process. It is our opinion and
assessment that the overall ranking of the project is arguably between satisfactory and highly
satisfactory.

From IFAD Regional Director

Indeed a very good example of operational and practical collaboration at field level. The highly
satisfactory results are closely associated with the champions of IFAD and WB. I share with our
Regional Economist so we can include this story line in the Annual Portfolio Review Report
currently in its final stages of being put together.

Once more well done to both teams for exemplary work!
