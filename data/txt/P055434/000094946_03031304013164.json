Bosnia and Herzegovina will focus\n            activities in the Southeastern part of the country. The area\n            has a Mediterranean climate, which is favorable for early\n            production of fruit and vegetables, has potential for\n            on-farm irrigation resources and continues to have\n            traditional trade with neighboring countries. This area was\n            impoverished by the war but has the potential to respond\n            readily to a revitalization program. The project will 1)\n            encourage farmers to adopt more productive and profitable\n            production systems and increase the marketability of their\n            surplus production; 2) create a dynamic commercial\n            agriculture by strengthening linkages among farmers and\n            markets through the promotion of private sector investment,\n            and credit for farming, agro-processing and trading; 3)\n            facilitate the export of agriculture products, through\n            information and technical assistance; and 4) support\n            measures and investments to strengthen the physical and\n            institutional infrastructure of rural communities. The\n            project components are: a) market integration; b) private\n            agribusiness support; c) commercial farmers development; and\n            d) project management. The increased production and\n            productivity resulting from the project will increase\n            farming and other rural incomes, and reduce unemployment and poverty."}, "docdt": "2003-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
