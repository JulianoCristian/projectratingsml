Agriculture Development Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            project provides the lesson that complex designs, especially\n            those with many overlapping activities, are more difficult\n            to understand and manage, and measure. Many of the grants\n            were awarded to and managed by specialists from one or two\n            academic or research institutions, indicating that the\n            process was less than competitive. In addition, there was a\n            tendency for many grants to be research-driven rather than\n            farmer-driven and thus not always entirely responsive in\n            addressing the farmers' problems. The development of a\n            credit system geared to agricultural producers is difficult\n            when a subsidized interest program is also in operation, and\n            makes it difficult to encourage modifications in operational\n            practices by banks and Mutual Fund Institution's\n            (MFIs). The project clearly showed that formation and\n            development of cooperatives and associations is a long-term\n            undertaking requiring continuing efforts, often longer than\n            the project period."}, "docdt": "2010-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
