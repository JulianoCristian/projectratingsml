market-integrated commercial agriculture in low income,\n            though high-potential areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus\n            increasing farming, and emphasizing enterprise credit,\n            technology development, micro-credit, and irrigation\n            rehabilitation. Potential environmental adversity could come\n            from agrochemical pollution, and surface water\n            contamination, soil erosion, indiscriminate dumping of\n            excavated deposits from drains, and structures, and, damage\n            caused during construction. Mitigation measures include: a)\n            provision of agricultural extension, and advisory services,\n            including training for best application techniques of\n            fertilizers, and pesticides; b) regular training for\n            improved irrigation management practices, to reduce soil\n            erosion, and sedimentation on rivers; c) landfills, and dump\n            sites will be selected, and, as possible, excavated\n            materials will be appropriately disposed of at selected\n            disposal sites; precautionary clauses for contractors works\n            will be included in the bidding documents, proposing\n            rehabilitation, and improvement works; d) monitoring, on the\n            use of pesticides, chemicals, and fertilizers will be\n            conducted, which will include increased training and\n            extension activities, towards reducing the use of inputs as\n            possible. Soil erosion will be assessed by Cantonal\n            Environment Inspectors (CEIs), and training efforts will be\n            intensified as needed. Contractors activities will be\n            supervised by the local municipal, or consulting engineers,\n            monitored as well by CEIs."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
