The key lessons for future projects in the rural\n            finance sector are: (i) training of rural bank staff and\n            directors, perhaps more than any single technical assistance\n            activity, has emerged as the most important ingredient for\n            the development of a viable rural banking sector; (ii) in\n            order to be effective monitoring tools, inspection\n            management audits of the rural banks should be combined with\n            regular feedback to the rural banks, with clear guidelines\n            for correcting observed deficiencies, a time frame for\n            addressing exceptions noted, and possible sanctions for\n            failing to rectify deficiencies; and (iii) inventory credit\n            has emerged as an innovative marketing tool crucial in\n            linking the formal and informal sectors."}, "docdt": "1995-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
