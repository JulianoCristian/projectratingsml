MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHN  FOR A
RURAL FINANCE PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 15.2 million (US$20.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance a rural finance project. The project
is expected to be cofinanced by OPEC Fund, CIDA and GTZ for SDR 6.8 (US$8.9
million equivalent).
2.          Background: The Government of Ghana has requested an IDA Credit of
US$20 million fer a Rural Finance Project to help increase the volume, improve
efficiency and ensure sustainability of rural financial intermediation. In 1983
the Government launched an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) to improve producer
incentives; restore fiscal and monetary discipline; encourage private sector
development; and restore the country's social, economic and physical
infrastructure.   Under the ERP, the Government initiated macroeconomic and
sectoral policy reforms to develop the agricultural sector on the basis of
competitiveness, efficiency and equity. The second phase of the ERP aims at
continued economic growth, sustained fiscal and monetary discipline, increased
domestic savings and investment, improved efficiency of public sector resource
management, and further development of the private sector. To achieve the basic
objectives specified above, the Government's policy framework includes:  (a)
further improvements in incentives for efficient production, through continued
reforms in exchange rate and trade policies; (b) increased public sector
investment in the rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure; (c)
measures to improve public sector savings and allocation of expenditures; (d)
reform of the state enterprise sector; and (e) improvements in economic
management.
3.          In spite of the positive initial response to these reforms, the
productivity of small-holders, who account for nearly 90Z of agricultural
production, is very low compared with the potential. The low productivity is
largely attributable to the inadequate dissemination of technological packages,
input delivery delays (particularly fertilizer), lack of credit, and inadequate
infrastructure. The Government has initiated programs for: (a) strengthening
the farm input supply system through progressive privatization; (b) revitalizing
the extension system through pilot programs to test new delivery mechanisms; and
(c) rehabilitation of the physical infrastructure to improve coumunication and
reduce marketing costs. To support the ongoing reforms, and to facilitate the
restructuring and rehabilitation of the economy, Ghana needs an efficient and
well functioning financial sector that can provide credit for productive
investments in key growth sectors of the economy. Rural credit will facilitate
the achievement of Government objectives of increasing investment in rural
economic activities aimed at increasing the production of food and industrial
raw materials and thus also creating raral employment opportunities. Credit is
expected to play a catalytic role in increasing productivity by facilitating the



-2-
purchase of farm implements, improved seed and fertilizer (wbert prices have
increased several times because of exchange rate adjustments and subsidy
removal). Other rural credit neeqs include financing for agro-processors, input
supply traders, and rural transporters who require investment and working
capital.
4.          The flow of credit has been constrained by * weak institutional base,
inadequate funds for term lending and high risks of rural lending. The BOG is
implementing a financial restructuring program through the IDA financed
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) which seeks to improve the efficiency
of financial intermediation through the deregulation of interest rates, removal
of Lending quotas and the strengthening of the regulatory framework.  These
macro-financial and Institutional reforms will enhance the financial health of
national level banks and enable them to mobilize additional deposits and increase
term lending to the productive sectors of the economy.
5.          lationale for IDA Involvement.   To sustain the growth momentum
created by the ongoing structural adjustment program, it is essential to
implement sectoral programs that increase supply response. The agricultural
sector contributes half of GDP, hence, growth in agriculture has a significant
impact on the aggregate performance of the economy. Ghanaian agriculture is
predominantly mallholder: over 80 percent of all agricultural production comes
from small producers with landholdings of less than 2.5 ha (6 acres). Rural
credit is needed to increase smallholder access to productivity enhancing inputs,
and on-farm investments critical for medium and long-term growth as well as for
rural business development and rural employment creation.   There are major
impediments to increasing the flow of credit to rural areas and to agriculture
in particular: (i) banks are reluctant to provide loans to smalIholders because
of the high transactions costs involved, and have tended to grant only short term
(seasonal) credit to agriculture; (ii) input supplies are erratic because foreign
exchange availability is still scarce, even though it is much improved; and (iii)
the banking system is beset with several institutional, financial and banking
weaknesses. The proposed project would be consistent with IDA's lending strategy
in agriculture which has emphasized strengthening farm support services including
extension, agricultural research, and fertilizer distribution, as well as with
the IDA lending strategy in the financial sector which has emphasized
restructuring of financial institutions to enable them to mobilize increased
domestic resources and provide increased credit to productive resources. The
proposed project would seek to complete the overall financial restructuring by
picking up the remaining institutions comprising the privately owned Rural Banks
(RBs) Credit Unions (CUs), and the "susu groups (informal savings and loan
associations), and thus enable them to mobilize more deposits and increase the
flow of credit to the largest and most important sector of the economy.
6.          Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project are to (a)
expand productive capacity and employment in the rural sector by providing
financing for profitable projects in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, artisanal
agro-processing, and input supplies through a multi-agency lending approach; (b)
implement a financial restructuring program for RBs and strengthen the



_3-
organizational and financial management of CUs to enable them to become more
efficient in deposit mobilization and in the delivery of short and medium term
credit, especially to smallholders; (c) strengthen the Association of Rural Banks
(ARB) and the Credit Union Associations (CUA). two important local NGOs that are
promoting financial intermediation in informal sectors; (d) build an enhanced
capacity for the appraisal of rural credits; and (e) build a local capacity for
research in rural finance policy.
7.          Project Description.  To achieve the above objectives, the project
vould comprise two components:  (i) a line of credit; and (ii) institution
building, comprising technical assistance for the restructuring of about 80 of
the total of 120 RBs in operation; the strengthening of the ARB and CUA and
rationalizing the roles of the Rural Banking Department and ARB; improving rural
credit appraisal capacity of RBs and selected commercial banks; strengthening
BOG capacity for RU Examination; strengthening rural cooperatives; and
establishing in BOG a Rural Finance Department (RFD) to implement the project
and to form a nucleus of a permanent institutional arrangement for implementing
rural finance programs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$38
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$27 million (71Z).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in the Republic of Ghana are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7554-GH, dated April 13, 1989, is also attached.
8.          Actions Asreed.  The main agreements reached at negotiations are
thats    (i) BOG would abolish the ¢25,0O0  and ¢125,000 ceilings  on RB
shareholdings by individuals and companies respectively to enable RBs to mobilize
additional capital, and abolish sectoral quotas on lending by RUs to allow them
to build a good quality portfolio; (ii) GOG shall review the cooperative laws
relating to Credit Unions and implement changes, arising from the review, by
December 31, 1990; (iii) BOG would (a) prepare, by December 31, 1989, a
ionitoring system of the rural finance operations of the banking sector including
operations under this project; and (b) sign a contract by June 30, 1990, for a
twinning arrangement with an external agency to provide start up support for
policy research and to strengthen mechanisms for program monitoring. For credit
effectiveness, the main actions agreed upon are that: (i) GOG shall establish
a Rural Bank Recapitalization Fund in BOG with an initial sum equivalent to
US$0.3 million  for purposes of providing liquidity  to RBs'  implementing
restructuring programs; (ii) BOG shall recruit specialists with qualifications,
experience, and terms of reference acceptable to IDA, for the positions of Rural
Finance Adviser, and Rural Banks Restructuring Adviser; (iii) GOG shall enter
into an agreement with BOG for the channelling of part of the IDA credit to BOG
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA; (iv) the restructuring plans
acceptable to IDA, for the 20 RBs already studied, as well the restructuring plan
of the Agricultural Development Bank shall have been completed; (v) BOG shall
prepare a statement of operating policies and procedures for the Rural Finance
Department acceptable to IDA; and (vi) GOG would provide a deposit guarantee on



-4
a one-time-only basis to RB depositors who have outstanding claims in the event
of liquidation up to a limit of ¢100,000 per depositor.
9.          Justification.   A well  functioning rural  financial  system is
important because of its crucial role in mobilizing and allocating resources,
in facilitating market exchange, promoting specialization and market development,
and in providing investable resources necessary for rural capital formation and
growth. Ghana is in the process of strengthening its rural financial system.
Significant policy, institutional, and operational constraints have Inhibited
the mobilization ot resources and constrained the availability of credit to
productive rural activities for which there is untapped demand. This project
wills (a) improve the efficiency of financial intermediation by strengthening
rural financial institutions through a program of financial restructuring and
staff training in managerial and financial skills; (b) increase efficiency
through the restructuring of aBs which will enhance their capacity to mobilize
additional resources and increase credit to the rural sector and thereby enhance
the private sector role in agriculture; (c) expand the volume of rural financial
intermediation through an injection of term resources; and (d) improve the links
with the informal sector through support for ns and CUs both of wh 'ch pr,vide
financial services to small clients and informal operators; further gains will
be made through improved links between cosuercial and development banks on the
one hand, and RBs and CUs on the other as both become more effective and
efficient financial intermediaries; (e) help growth of CUs which represent one
of the main sources of smallholder credit, with loan funds generated through
internal savings mobilized by their own network. Thus their members benefit
twice: first, through the inculcation and reinforcement of a savings habit, and
second, through increased access to credit. An additional positive feature for
members is that they own and control their credit unions thus giving them the
opportunity to participate fully in democratic decision-making and the
development of their own institutions; (f) support the development of a policy
analysis and program monitoring capacity in rural finance, thus improving the
information and analytical base for the Government's management of the rural
sector; and (g) provide long term benefits of training and technical assistance
in developing skills essential for the sustainability of rural financial
intermediation.
10.         Risks.  The main risk of the project is the possible slow pace at
which the banks may increase their share of term credit under the project to
the rural sector which they perceive as being more risky than the financing of
large scale commerce, trade or transport activities. The other risks include
the inability of banks to make quality loans; possible reluctance of some RBs
and CUs which are private sector institutions to participate in the financial
restructuring; and BOG's limited capacity to manage the restructuring program.
These risks will be minimized by requiring that: (a) banks that need additional
resources from BOG contribute 20 percent of the total financing requirements for
eligible subloans; (b) for RBs that are unwilling to restructure, BOG would
enforce changes via the enforcement of prudential regulations, and by the
exercise of its power to close banks that are not financially sound; (c) BOG's
ability to manage the restructuring program will be enhanced by technical



aesistance supportt (d) the Nulti-agency approach will mlnmitse the-risk of
dependency oz a single agency; and (e) the mid-term review in December 1990 will
also provid4 &A opportunity to reorient the project should unforeseen problems
arise.
11.         Recoummndations.  I am  satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
