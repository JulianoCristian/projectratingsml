IiJTERNATIONAL BAINK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPI4ENT
REPORT AND RECCMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD, SINGAPORE FOR
A SECOND POVER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$20.5 million to the Public
Utilities Board, Singapore (PUB), to be guaranteed by the Republic of
Singapore.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed loan would finance part of the foreign exchange cost
of the expansion of Singaporels electric power distribution system for the
three-year period 1969 through 1971. Two previous Bank loans made in 1963
(337-SI) and 1966 (473-SI) contributed to the financing of electric power
generation and one made in July 1967 (503-SI) to the financing of the expan-
sion of the electric power distribution system for the 1967-68 two-year
period. At the time that the 1967 loan was made the Bank recommended that
the PUB engage consultants to review its distribution development program.
The consultants' report was received in February 1969 and the program was
modified to include the additional work recommended by the consultants,
the Montreal Ehgineering Company of Canada.
3.       The project was appraised in November/December 1968. Negotiations
took place between March 24 and 27. Dr. Ong Swee Law, Chairman of the PUB,
represented the Singapore Government and the PUB. The other participants
for the PUB were Messrs. Z.K. Fiuczek, Chief Electrical Engineer; K.K. Wee,
Acting Chief Financial Officer; L.R. Estrop, Deputy Chief Electrical
Engineer; and Quek Peck Cheng, Consumers'. Engineer.
4.       The proposed loan would be the eighth to be made in Singapore;
one loan was guaranteed by the United Kingdom when Singapore was still a
U.K. dependency and one by Malaysia, when Singapore was a part of
Malaysia. In the case of the latter loan Singapore has recently proposed
that it assume the guarantee in lieu of Malaysia and we expect to complete
the necessary formalities in the near future. The following is a summary
statement of Bank loans to Singapore as at February 28, 1969.

5.       The execution of projects financed under Bank loans to Singapore
and the rate of disbursement of these loanshavebeen satisfactory.    Future
Bank lending is contemplated for industry, technical education and public
utilities. Within this lending program, loans for industrial development
and for telecommunications are expected to be proposed in the Fiscal Year
1970 to the Executive Directors for their consideration.
6.       Singapore became a member of the IFC on September 4, 1968.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of the Public Utilities Board Second
Power Distribution Project - Singapore" (FU-lla) dated April 7, 1969.
9.        The PUB was established in 1963 as an autonomous public corpora-
tion to take over the City Council's responsibility for the electricity,
water and gas utilities. It is a single financial entity but is required
to keep separate accounts for each utility and to charge rates sufficient
to cover the cost of each utility and to provide a surplus. The Board,
presently composed of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other members
appointed by the President of the Republic for periods not exceeding three
years, but eligible for reappointment, is responsible for matters of policy.
A General Manager, appointed by the Board with the approval of the Govern-
ment, is charged with the management of the day-to-day operations of the
PUB. The PUB is presently operating in a satisfactory manner, although the
extent to which the Chairman and the Board still carry out the functions
of management remains one of PUB's organizational problems. The term of
the incumbent General Manager expires in July 1969. He does not want it
renewed and steps are now being taken to find a suitable candidate with
wide management experience in a public utility to fill the post. The
Bank will be consulted prior to the appointment.
10        Demand for power in Singapore, particularly from industry and



-14.-
commerce, is increasing rapidly. Sales by the PUB's Electricity Department
during the period 1964-1968 increased at an annual rate of just over 15%
and the Department's forecasts show an average annual growth rate of about
16% for the next 3 or 4 years, falling to 15% by 1972 and to just under 12%
by 1973.
11.      The PUB's 1969-71 expansion program for electric power distribu-
tion is required to meet the expected load growth of the system. The
project consists of this program, excluding the carry-over from the 1967/68
program which is partly financed from the 1967 Bank loan (503-SI) and   -
provides for the installation of 430 Mva of primary and 650 Mva of secon--
dary distribution transformers, for about 250 miloe of primary and secon-
dary cables together with switchgear and ancillary equipment for primary-
and secondary substations. Total cost, without interest during construc-
tion, is estimated at US$13.3 million and the foreign exchange component
at US$32.3 million. Suppliers' credits, with terms varying from three
to seven years and with interest averaging 6%, as well as internal cash
generation will finance the balance of the foreign exchange cost not covered
by the proposed Bank loan. The local cost of the project will also be
financed by the PUB's own resources.
12.      The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable
and the arrangements for construction are satisfactory. The procurement
procedures of the PUB comply with the Bank's requirements for international
tenidering.
13.      The estimated rate of return on the project is over 9% and may be
as high as 16%.
14.      The PUB has in hand the planned expansion of electric power gene-
ration. Present generating capacity amounts to 464 Mw. The first stage
of the new Jurong thermal station (comprising two 60 Mw generators) which
has been partly financed by suppliers' credits is scheduled for commission-
ing during the latter part of 1969. A contract for the second stage compri-
sing a further two Mw generators scheduled for commissioning in 1970/71
has been placed. This stage will also be partly financed by suppliers'
credits. The station is designed for ultimate expansion to a planned
capacity of 480 Mw to be reached by 1974.
15.      The PUB's financial position is sound and its cash position is
good. Its financing plan is satisfactory and it should be able to finance
more than 50% of its capital development program over the next five years
from its own resources. As in previous loans the PUB will be required to
maintain a minimum rate of return of 8% on the average net fixed assets
in operation and is not to incur long-term debt unless maximum debt service
requirements are covered at least 1.5 times. Short-term debt is limited to
15% of the PUB's operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of the previous
year. The PUB should have no difficulty to comply with these requirements*
Through 1973 it should be able to show a return on the average net fixed
assets in operation averaging about 10%. The debt service coverage, al-
though expected to drop from 1.9 times in 1969 to 1.8 in 1970 and 1971,
should improve to 2.3 times in 1973. The debt/equity ratio is expected
to improve from 49:51 in 1969 to 38:62 in 1973.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Public Utilities
Board, Singapore, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Singapore and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements conform
substantially to the pattern of loan and guarantee agreements used for
projects of this kind.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
17.       Singapore's good economic performance continued during 1968.   The
rate of growth of GNP, although below 1966 and 1967 when trade with Indo-
nesia resumed, was 8%.  General prosperity reinforced a strong savings trend,
reaching about 17% of GNP. i"ore important for the long-term viability of
Singapore is the continued progress made in the manufacturing sector.
Manufacturing output increased by 18% in 1968 and industrial investment
seems to have risen considerably with even better prospects for the future.
The newly established industries appear to be sufficiently export-oriented
to remove any doubt that the separation from M4alaysia will have a lasting
adverse effect on Singapore's industrialization owing to the reduced size
of its domestic market. Singapore, over the years since separation from
Malaysia in 1965, was able consistently to export about one-third of its
manufacturing output.
18.       Increases in export and earnings from entrepot trade, supplemented
again as in 1967 by a large inflow of private capital from the region,
considerably strengthened the balance of payments and exchange reserves went
up by a sizeable amount, despite some loss of foreign exchange earnings due
to the start of Britain's withdrawal from her military bases.
19.       However, inspite of this unprecedented prosperity, uncertainties
over the pace of growthl and the development of the balance of payments in
the 1970's persist. First, unemployment, presently about 9-10% of the
labor force, is becoming a major problem, particularly so in the context
of a largely urban society. Second, the phasing-out of the British
military bases by 1971 will cause loss of (i) employment for about 50,000
base workers, (ii) income equivalent to around 15% of GDP, and (iii)
foreign exchange earnings of about US$180 million a year in the years
immediately ahead. Third, the recent fast rate of increase in entrepot
trade will subside in the early 1970's, as the recent rapid growth in
Indonesian and Vietnamese trade is likely to level off and as Singapore's
share of the Malaysian market is expected to decline further. The long-
term solution to these problems, the success of which is only partly within
Singapore's control, seems to lie, as in Hongkong, in the continued
expansion of export-oriented manufacturing industries, in which field
Singapore in recent years has been making good progress. In the medium
term, the Government plans to step up public investment particularly to
further strengthen public utilities, to convert military bases for produc-
tive uses and to broaden technical education. In view of the financial



-6-
and balance of payments strains expected to occur in the early 1970's the
Government is seeking to obtain foreign finance, including Bank loans,for
these investment efforts. Singapore is creditworthy for additional
borrowing from the Bank. The present debt service ratio is less than
one-half percent.
20.      A memorandum in which recent economic developments are reviewed
and which is based on a recent visit to Singapora by a staff member is
being distributed separately.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - FECMMENDATION
22.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
