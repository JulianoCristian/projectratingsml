However\n            the implementation of the project faced delays due to number\n            of factors of which the major ones are: a) delays in signing\n            and mobilization of the technical assistance for the project\n            management team; b) the prevailing conditions in the country\n            in relation to preparation for and carrying out of the\n            national referendum which took place in January, 2011; and\n            c) the rebidding of the major work contracts that was\n            necessitated following a necessary repackaging to attract\n            more competition from contractors. The Multi-Donor Trust\n            Fund for Southern Sudan which was originally going too\n            closed on June 30, 2011, has now been extended by the\n            oversight committee to June 30, 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
