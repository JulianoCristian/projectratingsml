            SOUTH SUDAN - WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT

                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.   This paper proposes a Level 1 restructuring of South Sudan Water Supply and Sanitation
     Project (P 111061) based on the findings and agreements reached between the Bank and the
     project stakeholders of the Republic of South Sudan (RSS) at a Mid Term Review (MTR)
     conducted during October 17-21, 2011.

2.   The preparation and submission of the restructuring paper was delayed to give time to
     incorporate the decisions of the Oversight Committee (OC) of the Multi Donor Trust Fund -
     South Sudan (MDTF-SS) which decided at its regular meeting on May 3, 2012, to change
     the closing date of the MDTF-SS to June 30, 2013.

3.   The project was approved by the MDTF-SS Oversight Committee on December 16, 2009
     and became effective on May 7, 2010 with an initial closing date of June 30, 2011
     (afterwards extended to June 30, 2012). The Project Development Objective (PDO) is
     "(i) increase access to safe water supply and sanitation in all states of South Sudan by
     building a sustainable managementsystem (ii) develop the knowledge on water resources."
     It includes five project components (Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion,
     Water Resources Technical Support, Capacity Building and project management support)
     with a total project cost of US$30 million provided under MDTF -SS as a Grant. The
     Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) is the responsible implementing
     agency.

4.   The restructuring is necessary to extend the project closing date by six months to December
     31, 2012, to allow for completion of project activities and to rationalize the project
     development objective (PDO), development outcomes and outputs that are achievable by the
     new closing date. The proposed restructuring thus includes: (i) revision of the PDO;
     (ii) deletion of one of the project outcome/result indicators in line with the proposed revision
     of the PDO; (iii) reduction in outcome targets, (iv) alignment of project costs in line with the
     reduced outputs, (v) reallocation of project funds (vi) extending the project closing date by
     six months to December 31, 2012.

5.   The request for extension confirms that: (i) the PDO continues to be achievable,
     (ii) performance of the counterparts is satisfactory and (iii) the government has prepared a
     specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project (Annex - 2). Audit report
     for the year ending December 2010 is not qualified and there are no overdue IFRs.

B. PROJECT STATUS

6.   The project was approved for US$30 million, fully financed from the MDTF-SS and has
     five components: Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion, Water Resources
     Technical Support, Capacity Building and Project Management Support.

                                                  6
7.   Since inception, the timeline for the implementation of this project has been very ambitious.
     The first twelve months of the project implementation period were largely consumed by
     initial,mobilization, preparatory and readjustment of activities (recruitment of the Technical
     Assistance Team members, updating of procurement plan, packaging/repackaging of
     different procurement lots).

8.   Project implementation has improved significantly in the last few months. All the planned
     activities (works, goods and services, worth US$27.4 million) have been contracted and
     committed. As of May 30, 2012, the project assisted the drilling of 39 new boreholes and
     the maintenance and repair of 340 boreholes and the remaining activities are at various
     levels of implementation. Disbursement has also improved substantially reaching US$14.7
     million (49 % of the Grant). The project used the financial management systems which are
     managed by the GoSS Project Financial Management Unit for all MDTF projects which is
     satisfactory and acceptable. The project would still use the same system during the period of
     extension. Audit report for the year ending December 2010 is not qualified and IFRs are
     submitted on time. FM risk rating is moderate and FM ISR rating is satisfactory based on
     the FM supervision of April 2012. . ,

9.   Despite this progress, it became obvious during the MTR that the time available for pyoject
     completion by the current closing date (June 30, 2012) was insufficient to achieve the
     development outcomes fully and complete the full spectrum of the original project activities.

10. Consequently, a decision was taken to: (i) drop the design of Hydro-meteorological
    Information System (HIS), which was estimated to cost US$ 1.3 million; and (ii) reallocate
    this amount to other works activities that could be completed in a shorter time.

11. The decision to drop the design of the HIS will have an impact on the PDO as this activity
    aimed to contribute towards achieving the second part of the PDO, which is "develop the
    knowledge on water resources". As a result, the PDO needs to be revised and the
    corresponding project outcome indicator needs to be updated to reflect this change.

12. The last ISR has rated the progress toward achievement of PDO as MU. The main reason
    for this downgrading was the cancelation of the HIS, which has been a major contributor for
    the second segment of the PDO, the reduced scope on some of the activities, and the delay
    in implementation. The last ISR has maintained the IP rating as MS taking into account the
    clear commitment of the client to complete most of the activities by putting in place an
    enhanced supervision arrangement at state level and the adequacy of its performance on
    financial management and procurement. With the completion of the remaining activities, the
    rating is expected to improve.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

13. The original development objective of the South Sudan Water Supply and Sanitation Project
    was "(i) increase access to safe water supply and sanitationin all states of South Sudan by
    building a sustainablemanagement system (ii) develop the knowledge on water resources.


                                                7
14. The revised PDO shall read as follows: "Increaseaccess to water supply and sanitation in
      all states of South Sudan".

15. In order to mitigate the various factors which are affecting implementation schedule, in view
    of the upcoming rainy season and the fast approaching project closing date, providing
    additional time is necessary for proper closure of most of the activities.

16. In line with the proposed change in the PDO, and the ongoing circumstances in the country
    which are affecting the implementation schedule, it is proposed to: (a) delete the project
    outcome indicator "Water resources assessment carriedout andpublished"; (b) change the
    unit of measure for the indicator "Targeted Water Community Points with an established"
    from "percentage"to "number"; (c) scale down the outputs for the indicators: (d) to extend
    the project closing date from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012. The proposed revised
    project outcome indicators and targets axe as shown below.

 #      ProjectOutcome Indicators                                    Original project       Revised project
                                                                     end date target        end target

        (yes/no) (proposed to be dropped)

17. The significant change in project end target is because of the reduced number of boreholes,
    due to lack of responsive contractors in areas such as Jonglie and upper Nile. The closure of
    the oil pipelines, as well as the ongoing hostilities between Sudan and South Sudan has
    heavily affected all contracts by increasing fuel and material prices, disrupting supply lines
    and minimizing supervision capacity, leading to termination of some contracts. This
    necessitated the revision of some of project output targets. On the other hand, despite the
    reduction of most of activities under component 2 and the subsequent reallocation of funds
    from this component, the construction of institutional latrines was maintained and hence the
    beneficiary number (25,000) remains unchanged.

18. Reallocation of funds: The proposed reallocation of funds by component is as follows,

                                    Project Costs (USm.)
               Components/Activities                                    Current                Proposed

19.      Reallocations by category: The proposed reallocation by category is as follows.

  Category of Expenditure                       Allocation                    % of Financing

  training                training
  2) Works                2) Works                 15,572,000    16,286,864       100%         100%

      The proposed reallocation is necessary, due to the cancelation of the Hydro - Metrological
      Information System (HIS) and accommodates the client's decision to finance the
      construction of Haffir (an open water harvesting structure) in Jonglei as a conflict mitigation
      measure. This required revisiting of the allocation between categories and use part of the
      operating cost whose initial estimate was on the higher side. Moreover while most of the
      reallocation of funds is a response to price escalation, the major change is also due to
      changes under Component 2. Activities identified under this Component: Sanitation
      (construction of oxidation ponds in 5 urban areas and provision of vacuum tracks and
      backhoes) required a more detailed study and clarification of institutional responsibilities
      within the government. MWRI decided to do preparatory works under this project and defer
      the construction and procurement of goods for some other time and reallocate part of the
      resources under this component to other activities that can reasonably be completed in the
      available time

20.     Financial management: No changes in financial management.

21.     Procurement: The changes on the procurement plan are reflected in the updated
        procurement plan attached here with (Annex - 3).

22.     Implementation schedule: The new project closing date is December 31, 2012, and the
        revised implementation schedule is attached (Annex - 2).


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

23.     The decision to cancel the activity "design of Hydro - Metrological Information System
        (HIS)", during the MTR and the subsequent reallocation of the resources to other works
        activities was a well informed and objective decision by the client which minimized
        significant technical and financial risks. Since this activity was contributing directly to the
        second component of the PDO, its revision is necessary.

24.     The adjustment of the outcome indicators as well as the revision of project cost allocation
        by category and by component directly follows subsequent measures to go with the
        revision of the PDO.
25.   Given the umbrella extension of the MDTF-SS in general which has created favorable
      situation and taking into account the compelling facts on the ground triggered by the recent
      developments (the closure of the oil pipelines and the recent hostilities) extending the
      project closing date from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 will give the much needed
      time for completion of all activities to the required quality and for a proper project closure.
