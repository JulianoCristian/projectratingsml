Some\n            lessons learned includes: political and technical\n            considerations must be closely managed during project design\n            and implementation, and expectations on what a project can\n            realistically deliver clearly accessed and communicated to\n            all stakeholder constituencies' right from the outset.\n            Project design in fragile and post conflict States, which\n            often face multiple barriers to service delivery, including\n            a capacity conundrum characterized by weak institutional\n            structures and other limitations to the enabling\n            environment, should be simple and flexible. Projects in\n            fragile and post-conflict environments are sometimes\n            developed and appraised with limited or incomplete\n            information, and other dynamic conditions, which may create\n            risks to implementation and outcomes. Trade-offs between\n            quality and timeliness of delivering services should be\n            carefully balanced, and project design should be cognizant\n            of the fact that sustainable WSS service delivery requires\n            adequate time to do well, especially in regard to the need\n            for strengthening institutional capacity at the national,\n            state, community, and civil society levels, and elements\n            that require behavioral change such as CLTS. All aspects of\n            procurement planning, including selection of procurement\n            methods, contract packaging, and timing allowed for\n            implementation of activities, and other pertinent factors in\n            fragile and post-conflict situations such as South Sudan\n            should be more flexible, duly considering the context in\n            which operations are implemented."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
