This paper a level one\n            restructuring of the project based on the findings and\n            agreements reached between the Bank and the project\n            stakeholders of the Republic of South Sudan (RSS) at a Mid\n            Term Review (MTR) conducted during October 17-21, 2011. The\n            restructuring is necessary to extend the project closing\n            date by six months to December 31, 2012, to allow for\n            completion of project activities and to rationalize the\n            project development objective (PDO), development outcomes\n            and outputs that are achievable by the new closing date. The\n            restructuring thus includes: (i) revision of the PDO; (ii)\n            deletion of one of the project outcome/result indicators in\n            line with the proposed revision of the PDO; (iii) reduction\n            in outcome targets; (iv) alignment of project costs in line\n            with the reduced outputs, (v) reallocation of project funds;\n            and (vi) extending the project closing date by six months to\n            December 31, 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
