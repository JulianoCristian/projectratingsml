                         procurement activities matured and MWRI was able to sign contracts committing more than two thirds of the project funds.

                         At the MTR it was agreed to cancel and defer the consultancy for the design of the Hydro-meteorological System (HIS) [USD 1.2 million] to be picked up later at the next earliest

                         structures] in addition to those already underway. However, given the existing work load on the PMT (supervision and monitoring the already signed contracts) and the uncertainties
                         in South Sudan, questions about the viability of adopting this path have persisted. These have been subject to an ongoing dialogue between World Bank management, the
                         government and the major donors to the MDTF following which it has been agreed to pursue the option preferred by MWRI under a revised procurement plan
