While the major\n            policies of the first phase of the ERP will be retained for\n            the second phase, the program focuses most specifically on\n            measures to: (i) reduce the fiscal deficit and increase the\n            efficiency of government expenditures and public investment;\n            (ii) strengthen the performance of the agricultural sector,\n            including reforms in groundnut processing/marketing policies\n            and institutions; and (iii) improve public sector\n            management, including civil service reforms and a\n            comprehensive reform of the Gambia Commercial and\n            Development Bank, and steps to improve the performance and\n            focus the role of public enterprises."}, "docdt": "1989-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
