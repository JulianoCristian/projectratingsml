Lessons\n            address the critical aspect of continuity of leadership and\n            permanence of key staff, which extends to an essential\n            adequate and timely supervision. In the case of INPARQUES -\n            National Parks Institute, the supervisory role of MARN -\n            Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources - as well\n            as of the Bank should have been more evident. The Bank, when\n            faced with clear incompliance on the part of the\n            implementing agency, should have applied more strictly its\n            leverage and sanction accordingly. Institutional capacity\n            depends largely upon the economic and political context, and\n            varies accordingly. Although difficult to predict, the\n            course of an economic crisis or the impact of political\n            change, are factors that should be considered as obvious\n            risks in terms of institutional strengthening and\n            complementary non-monetary reward mechanisms (ex:\n            promotions), performance incentives (ex: internships,\n            scholarships) and recognition schemes (ex: rotations) should\n            be incorporated to the organizational structure.\n            Implementation depends upon effective coordination between\n            the executing agency, the Planning Ministry in charge of\n            resource allocation, and the Finance Ministry in charge of\n            actual disbursements."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
