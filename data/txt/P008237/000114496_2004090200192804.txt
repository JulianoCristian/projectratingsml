Re:
Loan No. 3902-VE (Inparques Project)
Amendment to the Loan and Project Agreements
Dear Sirs:
1.
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), 
and the Project Agreement between the Bank and Instituto Nacional de Parques 
(INPARQUES), both dated October 12, 1995, as amended.  Whenever used in this letter, 
the terms defined in the Loan Agreement have the same meaning as set forth therein.
2.
We are pleased to inform you that, pursuant to your request in letter dated July 
20, 0200 and in consideration to the irregularities found in the 1999 audit which were 
communicated to you and limit our possibility of agreeing in full to your request at 
this moment, the Bank agrees to reallocate loan proceeds as required to carry out all 
components of the Project by the new Closing Date as specified in the Action Plan of 
INPARQUES which was published on July 13, 2000.
3.
Therefore the Bank hereby agrees:
(a)
that, albeit on an exceptional basis because of the 1999 audit results, 
all components, although at reduced scope following the cancellation as outlined 
below, will continue to be carried until December 31, 2000 and the agreement set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amendment letter of June 14, 2000 between the parties 
hereto is hereby superceded; and
(b)
to amend the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement to 
modify the allocations in Categories (1) through (4) and reflect the cancellation of 
$8,000,000, all as set forth in the Attachment to this Amendment Letter.
4.
If you agree with the proposed amendments, please sign and date the three 
counterparts of this letter in the space provided below, and return one fully executed 
counterpart original to us.  The amendments set forth in this letter shall enter into 
effect upon receipt by the Bank of said duly executed counterpart original.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
