Re:

Amendment to Loan Agreement
Dear Minister:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Venezuela (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) 
dated October 12, 1995.
This is in reply to your letter dated October 29, 1998 requesting an increase of 
the Authorized Allocation of the Special Account from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000.  The 
Bank hereby agrees to your request, and the Loan Agreement is amended by deleting the 
amount of “$1,000,000” specified in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 5 thereof and replacing 
it by “$2,000,000”.
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original and shall become effective on the date upon which the Bank dispatches 
to the Borrower notice that the Bank has received one fully executed original of the 
amendment letter.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the two counterparts of this amendment letter.  Upon your confirmation, please return 
one fully executed original to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
