                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress of the project has been good despite some early challenges including the delayed appointment of the Auditor General (AG). With the AG at post it is expected that
                         progress will continue. The audit of GoSS financial statements for 2005 and 2006 have been completed, but have still not been sent to the Legislative Assembly (LA). The audit of
                         GoSS financial statements for 2007 and 2008 have delayed due to the request to increase the scope and include some specific MDAs. Presently, the additional MDAs included in the
                         expanded scope do not pose a higher risk in terms of their share of the GoSS budget. The Audit Chamber should assess the extra benefit it will derived by expanding the scope

                         against the timely completion of these audits and work towards their timely completion. The AG has been urged to submit the reports to the LA and also work towards completing the
                         2007 and 2008 audits.

                         The preparation of the 2009 is also late and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning has been advised to complete it on time for audit. These financial statements are
                         expected to be completed in February 2011.
                         The accounting component has no issues to highlight. The team is doing a good job and supporting the project teams with satisfactory and timely disbursement of funds for project
                         activities. The donors and Government have indicated their willingness to extend the the life of the MDTF by a further 12 months. This will require this project to be extended by the
                         same duration to ensure that projects get accounting services and also get audited.
