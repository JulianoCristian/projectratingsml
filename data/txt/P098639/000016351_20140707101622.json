was judged\n            to be moderately satisfactory. The Bank and borrower\n            performance were satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was moderate. Significant changes included: (a) an\n            additional financing of US$ 3 million for the procurement\n            component to strengthen the capacity of the Procurement\n            Policy Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning\n            and to enhance the procurement functions of key Ministries,\n            Departments and Agencies. Other significant changes\n            included; additional financing for 5 components,\n            reallocation between 3 components, 7 amendments to trust\n            funds, a change to the project accounting firm component,\n            substitution of  a procurement agent with a procurement\n            advisor, and an extension of the closing date to March 31,\n            2013.  Several lessons were learned.  External agents,\n            particularly for audit and procurement, can contribute\n            significantly to institutional strengthening priorities, but\n            this should be accompanied by the transfer of skills in\n            order to facilitate longer term capacity building.\n            Implementation efficiency can be enhanced through\n            flexibility on procurement procedures, and by focusing\n            external agents on salient, project-related tasks rather\n            than assisting on broader government functions. Depending on\n            the core function(s) involved, individual consultants can\n            provide more efficient and cost-effective services compared\n            to firms, and may result in quicker transfer of knowledge.\n            The timely appointment of Government counterparts is\n            essential for efficient and successful implementation.  At\n            entry, it is important to clarify objectives to stakeholders\n            to avoid unrealistic expectations from the project."}, "docdt": "2013-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
