    1.1 Context at appraisal
    1. The Republic of South Sudan (RoSS), formerly the territory of Southern Sudan, is located on the
        southern plain of the White Nile and its tributaries, bordering Sudan to the North, Ethiopia and Kenya
        to the East and South East, respectively, Uganda to the South, and the Democratic Republic of Congo
        and Central Africa Republic to the West. It has a population of about 8.26 million people, of whom
        83 percent live in rural areas. About 51 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. 1

    2. The twenty year-old civil war with the North ended in January 2005 with the signing of the
       Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) by the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the
       Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM). This was preceded by the signing of the Machakos
       Protocol in 2002; a Wealth Sharing Agreement in January 2004; a Power Sharing Agreement; and
       two significant protocols on key disputed areas in June 2004. The CPA created a basis for lasting
       peace and economic development, and called for a referendum on the political and economic future
       of Southern Sudan after a six-year interim period. During this period, Southern Sudan was governed
       by a Government of National Unity (GoNU), which included members of SPLM. A semi-
       autonomous provisional Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) was established in October 2005 in
       parallel to oversee the territory under the control of SPLM, with its capital in Juba. The RoSS was
       established as an independent nation on July 9, 2011, following a peaceful referendum in January
       2011. 2

    3. Perhaps uniquely for a post-conflict government, GoSS in 2005 had immediate access to millions of
       dollars of domestic oil resources with which to fund its budget. Oil revenues comprised more than 95
       percent of total domestic revenues during 2006-2011 and grew rapidly. 3 When the CPA was signed,
       the Department of Finance and Economic Development was based in Yei and handled, on average,
       monthly revenues of around $10,000 per month. The fund flows increased to about $360 million in
       2005, escalating to around $800 million in 2006 and around $1.5 billion in subsequent years. It
       clearly did not have the capacity to handle these. A Joint Assessment Mission (JAM)4 carried out in
       March 2005 and comprising World Bank, UNDP, Government of the Republic of Sudan and SPLM,
       identified that governance systems, including Public Financial Management (PFM) systems, were not
       in place to make efficient and effective use of these funds. Such systems that had at one time been in
       place had become very run down. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) had
       very few technical staff, and their skills were not suited to operating modern PFM systems.
       Additionally, office infrastructure, IT capacity and communications were poor. The situation at line
       ministry level was also poor. Meanwhile, as also identified by the JAM, Southern Sudan faced huge
       infrastructure and public service delivery gaps which needed to be addressed urgently.

  budget and budget performance during 2008-2011. Also see the subsequent Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
  (completed in 2012).

  This was the only assessment that existed then on the PFM systems
                                                               1
      4. The JAM report considered it essential to have core PFM functions as quickly as possible in order to
         support GoSS’ desire to address Southern Sudan’s urgent needs and to avoid the undesirable situation
         of donor agencies addressing all these needs directly, outside GoSS’ systems. The entire public
         service had to be built up virtually from scratch. As this would take a number of years, the JAM
         recommended that responsibility for implementing core PFM functions (accounting, procurement and
         auditing) should be contracted out to international firms for at least the first two years following the
         CPA. Beginning in 2008, the GoSS would start to take over the responsibility for the core PFM
         functions on the basis of capacity building that would be supported by donor agencies, for example,
         through the Capacity Building Trust Fund (CBTF), the Bank-funded ‘Low Income Countries Under
         Stress’ (LICUS), the CFSSP itself, UNDP, ODI and USAID. 5

      5. The overall context in Southern Sudan was an environment of weak institutional arrangements, poor
         oversight over public finances and large-scale rent seeking. The fiduciary arrangements put in place
         were inadequate to handle the magnitude of financial flows that occurred. Given all these challenges
         on accountability, there was therefore, a strong need to have a platform to ensure that MDTF-SS
         funds would be used for the intended purposes.

      6. The CPA called for the creation of two multi-donor Trust Funds (MDFT) to finance Sudan’s
         enormous development needs; the first, the MDTF-N for the GoNU, and the second, the MDTF-SS
         for the GoSS. The MDTF-SS was to be administered by the Bank from 2005 with a closing date of
         December 31, 2011. This was extended twice to December 2012 and June 30, 2013. Prior to the
         approval of the CFSSP, the Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP) effective on March 2, 2006, was
         the first project to be financed from the MDTF-SS and included Procurement Agent (US$1.5 million)
         and Project Accounting firm (US$0.25 million) as two of its components. The Procurement Agent
         component supported the contracting of a consulting firm to establish a Procurement Division in
         MoFEP and support procurement activities of GoSS for a period of two years; while the Project
         Accounting Firm component supports the sole source contracting of a consulting firm (KPMG); who
         was already engaged as the Government Accounting Agent working with the GoSS (MOFEP) to
         establish the Project Disbursement Unit, for a period of 6 to 12 months until the long term project
         accounting agent is hired. The CFSSP became effective on September 6, 2006 and builds on this
         initial support by RIEP. It provided funding for recruiting a longer-term Project Accounting Agent
         (PAA) to support all MDTF-SS projects. Also, since GoSS did not have audit capacity, the CFSSP
         was to support in engaging an External Audit Agent (EAA) to work with the Audit Chamber and
         provide independent audit assurance on the MDTF-SS and GoSS funds.

      7. The original cost of CFSSP was $6 million, of which $3 million each would be financed by MDTF-
         SS donors and GoSS. The total cost had increased to $16.447 million ($13.447 million from MDTF
         Donors and $3 million from GoSS) by project closure through various additional financing. The
         CFSSP would address the emergency needs of GoSS for establishing basic fiduciary systems to
         ensure accountability and transparency in the use of MDTF-SS resources for implementing
         development projects. An international accounting firm would be contracted as the PAA. The weak
         capacity of the Audit Chamber would be addressed through contracting an EAA, which would
         support the Audit Chamber in its role as both the external auditor of MDTF-financed projects and of
         GoSS, and would help to strengthening the capacity of the Audit Chamber. With the approval of the

       Oversight Committee (OC) of the MDTF, a procurement component was added through additional

   8. The project comprises of two Trust Funds(TF): TF56336 for a total cost of US$11.147 (including $3
      million of GoSS contribution) and funding the Accounting firm and Auditing firm components; and
      TF97653 for $5.3 million (all MDTF donor funds) and funding all three components (Accounting
      firm, Auditing firm and Procurement components).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

   9. The original PDO as indicated in the Letter Agreement dated February 21, 2006 is to put in place a
      robust framework for channeling of MDTF and GoSS counterpart funds to provide reasonable
      assurance regarding the use of these funds. The framework would provide reasonable assurance that
      the funds would be used for their intended purpose and that the provision of core PFM functions
      would be met. The framework would be ‘robust’ in the sense that the use of the funds would be fully
      controlled, accounted for and reported on.

   10. At approval, the PDO’s key performance indicators (KPI) were:
           1. Accountability and transparency in the use of MDTF-SS and GoSS counterpart funds;
           2. Independent audit would be operational; and
           3. Use of information technology to support the budget execution process would be established,
              leading to increased efficiency, transparency and accountability.

1.3 Revised PDO
    11. There was no change to the PDO. However, as a result of the introduction of the procurement
        component in September 2010 and to ensure clearer and more robust indicators, the PDO indicators
        were revised (Table 1).

    c) Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that were audited;
    d) All ten States that were audited;
    e) Participating MDAs in which MDTF projects were implemented;
    f) National Legislative Assembly, which used the audited reports as the basis for exercising its
        legislative oversight responsibilities; and

1.5 Original Components 6 (as approved)

The project had two original components:

Component 1: Project Accounting Firm (US$3 million of which $1.5 million is GoSS contribution)
  13. Provision of consulting services to support the project accounting, internal audit and aid accounting,
      build up on processes established by the Interim Project Accounting Agent, including (i) establishing
      a Project Disbursement Unit within MoFEP; (ii) establishing and maintaining financial management
      systems at national and sub-national levels; (iii) reporting of transactions as per international
      accounting standards; (iv) providing capacity building for key staff at MoFEP; (v) providing limited
      internal audit services; and (vi) assuming fiduciary responsibility regarding the use of MDTF funds
      and counterpart funds for a period of two years.

Component 2: Auditing Firm (US$3 million of which $1.5 million is GoSS contribution)
  14. Provision of consulting services for providing external auditing services for all MDTF funded
      projects, and other selected projects, including (i) drafting legislation and regulations; (ii) undertaking
      external audit of MDTF projects and other selected projects; and (iii) providing capacity building
      support for a period of two years.

1.6 Revised Components

Procurement Component

      15. An additional financing of US$ 3 million was approved in September 2010 for a procurement
          component to strengthen the capacity of the Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) of MoFEP and to
          enhance the procurement functions of key Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). It
          involved the recruitment of an international procurement firm with specialization in procurement.
          This was previously a component under the Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP) project which
          funded similar activities for two years and the contract ended in December 2009. The services were
          still required to support MDAs; as a result, the Oversight Committee approved that the component be
          included in the CFSSP. This did not affect the development objective of the project.

   16. Additional Financing: There were five additional financing in the project. Two were under the
       original TF56336 while three were approved under a new TF97563. The details are in table 2 below.

                                                         Table 2:

                         ($m)

   December 4,              2.6     Additional costs on the External Auditing Firm Component under TF56336. The same
      2007                          amount was also provided as additional funds by the Recipient.

    September               2.6     Due to fiscal challenges, GoSS counterpart funds requirement (unpaid amounts) was
     15, 2009                       waived for all MDTF-SS projects and MDTF donors covered this additional cost with
                                    the AF.

   September 1,             3.0     This was under a new TF097653 in respect of AF to include the procurement
      2010                          component in the project to enhance and strengthen GoSS public procurement
                                    functions.

    March 2,                1.3     Second AF under TF097653 for extension of the services of the External Audit Agent
     2012                           by one year.

    August 2,                       Third AF under TF097653 to cover expenditure and other outstanding commitments
     2012                   1.0     related to the extension of the MDTF-SS and project closing date




   17. Reallocation: There was a re-allocation between the three components. The Procurement
       Component’s allocation was reduced to $2 million while the Accounting and Auditing Components
       were allocated an additional US$ 1.5 million and $6.95 million respectively. Table 3 shows the
       revised costs of the Project by Component.

   18. Amendment to Trust Funds. There were seven amendments to the Grant Agreements for the project;
       five amendments to TF56336 and two amendments to TF97653. These are in tables 4 and 5 below.

    19. Change to Project Accounting Firm Component. Prior to the effectiveness of the CFSSP, a project
        accounting firm was recruited in December 2005 under MDTF-SS first project, the RIEP, through
        sole source contracting as an interim arrangement (interim Project Accounting Agent - iPAA), to
        provide accounting and disbursement services to all MDTF funded projects and provide fiduciary
        responsibilities for release of GoSS and MDTF donors funds until an international accounting firm
        could be recruited under the CFSSP as the Project Accounting Agent (PAA). The same firm had
        previously operated as the CBTF Financial Management Agent and was operating as the Government
        Accounting Agent. This interim arrangement continued into 2008 as protracted attempts to negotiate
        a contract with an international accounting firm which started in March 2006 were unsuccessful. The
        top ranked firm in the procurement process was under investigation which prolonged decision
        making; thereafter the next ranked firm who was also the iPAA wanted changes in their proposal due
        to the prolonged period since the submission. Because of these difficulties, GoSS decided not to
        recruit a PAA, but to set up a Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) within MoFEP, staffed by
        international and local individual consultants. The PFMU was approved by the Oversight Committee
        of the MDTF and took over from iPAA in January 2009. 7

    20. Substitution of Procurement Agent with a Procurement Advisor. Until August 2010, procurement
        fiduciary functions were implemented by a Procurement Agent contracted under the RIEP. With
        RIEP due to close, GoSS and MDTF-donors agreed to bring the function under CFSSP. A
        procurement firm was recruited in 2010 as a procurement agent under a one-year contract to provide
        support to GoSS’ procurement system. This engagement faced several problems from the onset.
        First, it took over a year to contract the firm due to government indecision on the process. Second, the
        location of the firm’s office away from the Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) limited the required level
        of interaction with counterpart staff. The Terms of Reference indicated an on-the-job training but this
        could not be effectively carried out. The donor funded projects had contracted the services of

7
  The situation regarding the procurement of an Accounting Agent was further complicated by KPMG bidding for the PAA
contract when it already held the IPAA contract. Also, the top ranked firm bidding for the PAA contract was at that time under
investigation for suspected fraudulent practices.
                                                                6
      procurement specialists who provided support and hands-on training to the counterparts of the
      respective entities. At the end of the contract in August 2011, GoSS replaced the firm with the
      services of an individual consultant who was engaged as a Procurement and was located in the PPU
      which enhanced a direct support to the staff of the Unit.

   21. Extension of Closing Date. The closing date was extended three times: from November 30, 2008 to
       June 30, 2011; September 30, 2012; and finally to March 31, 2013. The first extension is related to
       delays in recruiting of firms for the components as recommended by the JAM. Subsequently, since
       CFSSP provides fiduciary services support to all MDTF-SS projects, extensions of the MDTF-SS and
       the various projects under implementation also impacted on the CFSSP.


                       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

   22. The conditions in South Sudan prior to the preparation of the CFSSP as noted in the JAM and
       articulated in the independent evaluation of MDTF-SS included almost complete lack of physical
       infrastructure and public services, and human development indicators that were among the lowest in
       the world. There was insecurity and other physical risks that made employment in the country
       unattractive to professionals and the likelihood of getting individuals as technical assistants was low.
       Given the need to quickly respond to the clients need, the JAM recommended the use of international
       firms to implement core PFM functions and the project was designed taking this into consideration.
       This was similar to the ongoing and established arrangements in government, other donor agencies
       and RIEP project. The lessons learnt from the challenges in preparing the RIEP including poor state
       of infrastructure and living conditions also informed the preparation and design of the CFSSP. The
       CFSSP focus on establishing a strong fiduciary system to reasonably assure stakeholders that funds
       provided by MDTF and GoSS for financing much needed infrastructure and public services would be
       utilized for the intended purposes with due regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.

   23. Governance Structure for MDTF and CFSSP: The Bank’s role as the MDTF-SS administrator
       was approved by the Bank’s Executive Directors based on a Board paper on April 7, 2005. Similar to
       other MDTF-SS projects, the CFSSP was approved by the Oversight Committee (OC) and the Bank
       management at Regional Vice President Level. The OC provided overall strategic guidance and
       inter-ministerial and donor coordination and was chaired by the Minister of Finance and co-chaired
       by the Joint Donor Team (representing the EU, Germany and other donors). Membership of the OC
       also included representatives of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
       (UNOCHA), and concerned implementing ministries/agencies. The OC was supported by a Technical
       Secretariat (TS), also administered by the Bank, which would review proposals and make
       recommendations to the OC regarding selection of projects to be funded by MDTF. The OC
       approved the work plan and budgets for the Technical Secretariat, and reviewed audit and quarterly
       progress reports prepared by it. The quality at entry was managed by the Technical Secretariat, the
       Sector and Country Management Units as well as the OC.




                                                      7
   2.2 Implementation

24. The project was implemented by the GoSS through the Policy and Planning Unit in the MoFEP
    which had the overall responsibility for financial management, procurement and capacity building at
    all levels as well as coordinating and tracking project implementation activities. It was headed by the
    Project Coordinator with overall implementation responsibility. The auditing firm component was
    directly under the National Audit Chamber while the procurement component was under the
    Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) of MoFEP. The implementation timeline was initially set for two
    years, between December 2005 and June 2008, on the assumption that (i) it took about six months to
    complete the procurement process; and (ii) the firms recruited to provide core accounting and
    auditing functions would fulfill their contractual obligations over two years.

25. However, there were delays in starting project implementation. The project became effective
    September 2006; first withdrawal application for the initial deposit to the Designated Account was in
    March 2007 and the second withdrawal Application was in March 2008, three months to the end of
    the original closing date. The time taken for GoSS and its MDAs to become effectively operational
    after moving to Juba also delayed the start of project implementation.

26. The competitive process for recruiting the EAA was launched in March 2006, the same time as the
    PAA. However, most of the firms competing for the PAA also submitted proposals for the EAA;
    there was therefore need to sequence the two selections leading to delay of the EAA in order to
    finalize the PAA. Due to reasons explained in paragraph 19 above, the engagement of the PAA was
    suspended while the iPAA continued to render accounting services, as a result, the selection process
    for the EAA resumed and the contract was signed in December 2007, while the firm was mobilized in
    January 2008, almost two years from the launching of the procurement process. To further compound
    the delays in the Auditing component, in February 2008, a month after the mobilization of the EAA,
    the Auditor General and entire senior management of the Audit Chamber were suspended by
    presidential order while other staff were confined to the audit office. A new Deputy Auditor General
    was appointed in November 2008 as acting Auditor General, but with very limited resources to carry
    out the required functions. As a result, the EAA’s functions were limited to audits of the MDTF-SS
    projects until June 2010 when a new Auditor General was appointed. Despite these delays, the
    robustness of the TOR of the EAA which included enhanced capacity building elements, training
    needs assessment, support to recruitment and induction of Audit Chamber personnel played an
    important role in the success of this component. As at the time of this ICR, all MDTF-SS audits were
    fully completed and GoSS audits for years 2005 to 2010 have been completed and four of these (2005
    to 2008) already presented to the NLA. The EAA’s contract was expected to be for three years (2008
    to 2010), however, due to extension of the MDTF projects which this component supports; the
    contract was variously extended and finally ended on March 15, 2013.

27. Regarding the Procurement component, an important milestone was supporting MDAs in carrying
    out procurements in line with GoSS procurement regulations. The project worked with the PPU to
    prepare a Procurement Bill which would replace the Interim Public Procurement and Disposal of
    Assets Regulations (IPPDAR) established as a temporary measure in 2006. The Bill has been
    prepared and at the time of this ICR, was with the Council of Ministers for approval. Following
    approval, the Bill would be submitted to the NLA and passed to law. This will support in
    streamlining of GoSS’ procurement processes. Additionally, the project supported PPU in reviewing
    procurement requests and tender processes; and organizing several private sector awareness seminars.

                                                  8
   It supported MDAs in preparing Procurement Plans; and both formal and on-the-job training for the
   PPU and MDA staff.


   2.3 Achievement of Implementation Targets

28. All three components were effectively implemented and most of the targets achieved. At the closing
    of the first Trust Fund (TF56336) on September 30, 2012, all of the grant funds had been fully
    disbursed and fully documented; the Additional Grant (TF097653) which closed on March 31, 2013
    was also fully disbursed and documented.

29. The Accounting and Auditing components achieved their respective targets satisfactorily within the
    revised time frame, while the Procurement component was rated moderately satisfactory due to the
    challenges in achieving the PDMIS activity which was dropped. Specifically, project achieved the
    key performance indicators as follows:

30. 18 monthly bank reconciliations conducted (one per MDTF-SS project) and 18 Quarterly
    statements of Sources and Application of Funds prepared according to established standards
    (one per MDTF-SS project): The project maintained accountability and transparency in the use of
    both donor and government funds through preparation of timely and robust monthly bank
    reconciliations statements, Quarterly statements of Sources and Application of Funds; annual
    financial statements and withdrawal applications for all eighteen MDTF-SS projects according to
    established international standards. In addition, the project maintained necessary designated and
    bank accounts and had all documents forwarded to both the government and Bank and the relevant
    donors. Two government accountants from MoFEP were seconded to the Unit for capacity building
    and benefitted from various trainings and on-the-job capacity building and are still part of the unit
    supporting on-going World Bank projects in similar capacity.

31. Annual project audits completed and 6 Annual audits of GoSS accounts completed: The project
    supported NAC to operationalize independent audit. Annual independent audits of all MDTF-SS
    projects were supported through each project implementation period and there was no overdue audit
    in any year and at the closure of all MDTF-SS projects. This supported in assuring independent
    opinion on the use of donor and government funds for all projects. In addition, the NAC was
    supported to carry out audit for government funds and clear back log for six years with four of these
    presented to the National Legislative Assembly and published on the public website of NAC. The
    project also supported the drafting and passing into law of the Audit Chamber Bill and regulations,
    code of conduct and strategic development plan to enhance the strengthening of the audit chamber
    and sustainability of the achievements of the project. This has promoted accountability and
    transparency. The project assisted in the process of recruiting government auditors and training in all
    seven years of the project implementation. The EAA complimented the work of the Auditor General
    who still retained the responsibility for assuring quality of all reports and signed all the reports while
    the EAA worked jointly with the staff of the NAC to carry out the audit thus enhancing on-the-job
    training and knowledge transfer.

32. Five MDAs that comply with GoSS procurement regulations. GOSS procurement regulations
    require the MDAs to carry out procurement functions including preparing procurement plans. To
    carry out this function effectively, the PPU needs to support the MDAs with necessary guidelines and
    training. The project supported the PPU in drafting the public procurement bill; preparing
    procurement plans, and various awareness seminars on institutionalizing public procurement. Six
                                                   9
   ministries had procurement plans for the GRSS budget for the financial year 2012/2013. These are
   Ministries of Health; General Education and Instructions; Agriculture and Forestry; Higher
   Education, Science and Technology; Water Resources and Irrigation; and Gender, Social Welfare and
   Religious Affairs. The project dropped the installation of a Procurement Data Management System
   (PDMS) activity due to successive failures to hire a qualified expert to support the Procurement
   Policy Unit in installing the system.


   2.4 Risks and Mitigation

33. The project proposal highlighted a number of potential risks that are common to all sectors of the
    government including delay in the implementation of the peace process; resurgence of civil unrest;
    longer lead time required for establishing the Government of South Sudan and the emergent
    ministries; delay in approving 2005 and 2006 budgets from GoSS that may reduce the amount of
    counterpart funding available; lack of experience in program implementation; time taken for GoSS to
    become effective after shifting to Juba; and difficulties in identifying qualified external technical
    assistance. The risk assessment at appraisal was therefore, adjudged as high. The high fiduciary risks
    were addressed by outlining and implementing a series of mitigating measures including (a)
    recruiting a Monitoring Agent for all MDTF-SS projects to ensure that funds were used only for the
    intended purposes; (b) establishing the PFMU to ensure that reliable accounting and financial
    management systems were in place and that expenditures were properly accounted for and reported
    timely; (c) retaining an External Audit Agent to provide assurance that the financial statements of
    MDTF and accounts of GoSS were reliable; (d) hiring a Procurement Agent to ensure that
    procurement was undertaken transparently and in an accountable manner and which would support
    the Procurement Policy Unit at MoFEP; and (e) establishing a Project Steering Committee, which
    included the Joint Donor Team. As at project closure, the fiduciary risk was rated as moderate.

34. The project provided a basis for attaining a sustainable system by government. Given that there was
    no capacity at the commencement of the project, it sets a framework that government can build on by
    addressing issues including human resource capacity, financial constraints and infrastructure
    acquisition which could lead to effective strengthening of the institutions and ensuring continuity and
    sustainability of the efforts under the project. On-going Bank programs and support by other
    development partners to some of these institutions would also ensure sustainability of the gains under
    the CFSSP.

   2.5 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35. Design. The Project proposal indicated that the performance of the PAA (which was replaced by the
    PFMU) will be monitored against key financial variables for each project, and the effectiveness of
    cash management and accounting including bank reconciliation statements for each bank account;
    monthly statement of cash position for project funds from all sources, taking into consideration
    significant reconciling items; monthly statement of expenditure and statement of sources and uses of
    funds. For the External Audit Agent, progress was to be monitored against key deliverables such as
    up to date audit reports for each project; progress in drafting audit law and regulations; and number of
    persons trained in basic auditing procedures. The additional financing of August 2010 and addition
    of the Procurement Component to the project included a results framework and monitoring, which
    indicated that the output monitoring for this component will be a functional procurement policy unit
    and an up-to-date and timely implemented procurement plan for MDAs.

                                                  10
36. Implementation and Utilization. The PDO indicators were revised in June 2011 as shown in Table
    1. The revised indicators provided a better match for the project activities; were more measureable
    and attributable to the Project; and captured outputs which were related to the PDOs. The Monitoring
    and Evaluation (M&E) for the project was carried out by the Monitoring Agent (MA) engaged by the
    Technical Secretariat for all MDTF-SS. The responsibilities of the MA included monitoring the
    procurement of the goods, services and other items, screening and recommending withdrawal
    applications for Bank’s approval and payment, monitoring all expenditures financed under the Grant,
    and screening the financial management capacity of the Recipient so as to ensure that the proceeds of
    the Grant are disbursed only for the intended purposes and according to applicable Bank procedures.
    The MA team reviewed project activities and prepared quarterly reports which were shared with
    stakeholders including Development Partners, and presented and reviewed at the Oversight
    Committee meetings. The MA also carried out a Value for Money Performance review of the project
    which indicates an overall performance achievement of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
    parameters (Annex 4). Also, there were periodic monitoring and review of the Auditing Component
    by a Steering Committee which met quarterly and was made up of the MoFEP, NAC, World Bank
    and the Joint Donor Team. Quarterly IFRs and annual financial statements were also reviewed by the
    project financial management specialists and comments followed up with the implementing entities
    and borrower.

   2.6 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

37. Environmental Safeguards. The project was classified as Category C with no potential impact on
    the environment.

38. Financial Management Arrangements. The financial management (FM) risk assessment at
    appraisal was rated as high. The Financial Management of the Project was carried out first by the
    interim PAA (KPMG under RIEP) and later by the PFMU. With the various mitigating measures put
    in place, all Interim Financial Reports, financial statements and audits were timely prepared. As at
    project closing, all funds had been fully disbursed and documented; there were no outstanding reports
    and no major internal control issues were identified. The FM risk was moderate and FM performance
    was rated as satisfactory during supervision.

39. Procurement Arrangements. The procurement activities for the project were supported by the
    procurement agent and then the procurement advisor under the procurement component of the
    project. The procurement process for the Procurement Data Management System (PDMS) could not
    be completed due to successive failures to hire a qualified expert to do the job. Otherwise,
    procurement activities under the project were effectively carried out. The Project’s overall
    procurement performance is rated as moderately satisfactory during supervision.

   2.7 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40. There is still need to support GoSS in various fiduciary aspects of PFM, including in accounting,
    auditing and procurement in order to sustain the ongoing fiduciary reforms and institutional capacity
    in MoFEP and NAC. With respect to the external audit function, the NAC is receiving significant
    attention from other Development Partners and discussions are ongoing on likely support to the
    Chamber, particularly in capacity building and institutional strengthening, as a follow up to the
    support rendered under CFSSP. With respect to Bank-financed projects, each project is supporting
    the NAC in financing the engagement of an Audit Agent that will work with the national staff in

                                                 11
           carrying out the project audits in line with international standards. Similar support is required in
           aspects of accounting and procurement.



                                                3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives and Design – Satisfactory

      41. Objectives. The relevance of the project’s objective is satisfactory. The project development
          objective was relevant to the government, Bank and donor priorities for the country. The South Sudan
          Core functions developed in 2011 focuses on having strong systems of accounting, financial control
          and oversight in place. Similar to this objective, one of the four pillars of the 2011- 2013 South Sudan
          Development Plan (SSDP) is governance with emphasis on strengthening the capacity of major
          accountability institutions to increase accountability and transparency. The project development
          objective which focuses on putting in place a robust framework for channeling funds is
          complementary to these government agenda. Also, the Bank Interim Strategy Note for FY 2013 –
          2014 for the Republic of South Sudan has a strong focus on public financial management and
          improving accountability as one of its two clusters.

      42. Design. The relevance of project design is satisfactory. The project design sought to establish a
          fiduciary framework for public financial management for resource flows through the recruitment of
          various experts who would establish core PFM functions. Very weak PFM systems and severe
          capacity constraints in GoSS implied very high fiduciary risk to development partners and GoSS of
          spending excessive amounts of money on urgently needed infrastructure development and basic
          services delivery. Recruitment of the experts, as recommended by the JAM, would mitigate this risk.
          The PAA would manage disbursement, accounting and financial reporting. The EAA would audit
          projects funded by MDTF and GoSS counterpart funds. A procurement advisor (which was added
          later in the project) would support the Procurement Policy Unit in MoFEP and the procurement units
          of MDAs. A monitoring agent would ensure that disbursements were for project purposes. A Project
          Task Force (PTF) and an Oversight Committee made up of key stakeholders and experts from MDTF
          and the UN would be formed to monitor closely project implementation and fiduciary compliance.

      43. An independent evaluation 8 concludes that the MDTF-SS was integrated into the CPA; aligned with
          the JAM framework; relevant to the goals and aspirations of stakeholders and continued to reflect
          government’s priority through its operational life. Similarly, the design of CFSSP was relevant to the
          government priorities both at the time of project preparation; effectiveness and even at this ICR and
          post completion stage. The project design was tailored along the JAM recommendation (which in
          itself was the basis of establishing the MDTF) that responsibility for implementing PFM functions
          should be contracted to international firms for at least two years of the CPA. Establishing a strong
          fiduciary framework is still very core to strengthening the PFM structure in the country and relevant
          to building the capacity of the PPU, NAC and the accounting functions. The project focus on this
          areas and the recruitment of the various Agents to help develop basic fiduciary systems has resulted
          in accountability and transparency in the use of MDTF and GoSS funds; independent external audits;
          and oversight of Procuring Entities (MDAs). It has supported development in the use of country
          systems, particularly with substantial capacity development at the NAC. The flexibility of the design
          which enabled a change from use of firms (as recommended by the JAM but which proved very

    Independent final evaluation of the MDTF-SS; final report 7 July 2013
                                                                 12
       difficult and led to initial delays) to individual consultants was also very useful and relevant to the
       achievement of the project outcomes.



3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives - Satisfactory

   44. The development objective of the project was achieved satisfactorily. Annex 2 provides details of
       the outputs achieved on each of the three components. In line with the PDO, the project put in place a
       robust framework for channeling over US$503 million MDTF-SS funds and US$159 million GoSS
       counterpart funds that was disbursed to eighteen projects over the seven years of project
       implementation. It supported accountability and transparency in use of project funds for all MDTF-
       SS projects and additionally, for seven World Bank grants through regular preparation of monthly
       bank reconciliation statements; quarterly statements of sources and application of funds; and annual
       financial statements. Also there were operational independent audits for all projects based on
       international standards of auditing and no back log or outstanding audits as of closure of the MDTF-
       SS. In addition, the project supported the audit of GoSS financial statements for six years. The
       project provided the framework for country ownership particularly in the auditing arrangements.

   45. All three components were effectively implemented and targets achieved. At the closing of the first
       Trust Fund (TF56336) on September 30, 2012, all of the grant funds had been fully disbursed and
       fully documented; the Additional Grant (TF097653) which closed on March 31, 2013 was also fully
       disbursed and documented.

   46. The project sets a base for putting up basic fiduciary arrangements which is now being built upon.
       The PFMU, an important part of the delivery and achievements of the project, is still existing and
       used for on-going Bank projects. Because of the success, government is also in the process of setting
       up similar unit as part of their Aid Coordination Unit to support all Donor projects. 18 monthly bank
       reconciliations were conducted monthly and 18 quarterly statements of sources and application of
       funds for all projects in accordance with established standards.

   47. With respect to the auditing component, the EAA supported both institutional strengthening and
       capacity development. The EAA carried out joint audits with the staff of the Audit Chamber which
       supported on-the-job learning for these staff; the Auditor General performed his statutory
       responsibilities by reviewing and signing the audit reports; the Audit Chamber Bill, Code of Ethics,
       strategic plan and other working papers were developed and is still been used by NAC. Annual
       project audits were completed for all 18 projects for all their years of implementation and there are no
       due audits at the closure of the MDTF-SS. Additionally, 6 annual audits were completed for the
       GoSS accounts.

   48. Additionally, Procurement Adviser worked closely with the staff of the Procurement Policy Unit and
       carried out on-the-job training which developed their procurement capacity. More than five MDAs
       were supported in developing their procurement plans and complying with GoSS procurement
       Regulations. These include Ministries of Health; General Education and Instructions; Agriculture and
       Forestry; Higher Education, Science and Technology; Water Resources and Irrigation; and Gender,
       Social Welfare and Religious Affairs.

3.3 Efficiency - Satisfactory

                                                     13
    49. No economic analysis was undertaken for the Project during preparation due to the emergency nature
        of the operation and dearth of information. The Monitoring Agent engaged by the Technical
        Secretariat, conducted a Value for Money Assessment (VFM) of the Project and issued a draft report
        on October 31, 2012 to determine whether or not disbursements made for Consultants’ Services met
        the Bank’s basic tenets of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The assessment confirmed that (i)
        the contracts were within the approved budget with payments being consistent with contract
        provisions, and procurement processes being transparent and competitive; (ii) actual outputs of
        budgeted activities matched the expected outputs; and (iii) activities contributed to the achievement
        of the project objective. Substantial cost savings were achieved through the move to the PFMU
        arrangement from the PAA arrangement and similarly to the use of individual procurement Advisor
        instead of the firm of Procurement Agent. 9 The assessment concluded that the overall VFM for the
        contracts was fully achieved.

    50. Additionally, MDTF involvement was aimed at providing accountability regarding use of MDTF and
        GoSS counterpart funds; help to start building financial management capacity in GoSS; and
        strengthen the MDTF funds flow mechanism as well as improving government ownership and control
        over donor resources. The PFMU, EAA and Procurement consultant worked within the government
        agencies as core components of the funds flow process and provided reasonable assurance on the use
        of resources. The project provided the framework for country ownership particularly in the auditing
        arrangements.

    51. Also, the project supported fiduciary arrangements for various projects. Despite the fact that this is a
        new country with significant governance issues and high cases of accountability and transparency
        challenges in government, all the project funds were properly spent and documented with no case of
        misappropriation of funds. The project succeeded in building some capacity in the implementing
        entities it supported and the structure is used for other funding mechanisms.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

    52. The project development objective, design, implementation and outcomes were considered relevant
        to the building of the critical fiduciary systems of the country. It was consistent with the requests of
        the GoSS and the need of the implementing entities. The PFMU was established resulting in the
        maintaining of accounting records for all MDTF and Bank projects, and the preparation of unaudited
        interim financial reports (IFRs) as required by the Financing Agreement. The audits of all MDTF-SS
        projects have been finalized and GoSS financial statements for FYs 2005-2010 have been audited.
        The audited financial statements for 2005-2008 have been presented to NLA, while those for 2009-
        2010 are in the process of being presented.

    53. The project was effective and achieved its development objectives. It had major impact and achieved
        wider effects on the government activities particularly with the audit of government accounts and the
        accountability issues that were discovered. The achieved results are sustainable and government
        could build on the achieved results in the NAC and the PPU.

9
  The paper prepared in 2009 by Fiona Davies, referred to above, also points out the high costs of contracting international
companies: costs amounted to $20 million in Southern Sudan over 4 years. Costs of hiring individuals tend to be much lower as
the overhead costs associated with companies are virtually eliminated. The paper also points out the difficulties in ensuring that the
activities implemented by companies are well-aligned with government priorities; these difficulties were prominent in the case of
the KPMG iPAA contract under RIEP.
                                                                 14
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

   54. Poverty Impacts. The Project supported strengthening of governance arrangements; Good
       governance is a necessary condition for reducing poverty in any country.

   55. Gender Aspects. Gender aspects were not reflected in the PDO and the project was not specifically
       focused on gender requirements. However, females also benefited in large numbers from the project
       output, particularly as part of the capacity building under the Auditing component.

   56. Social Development. The Project had no specific social issues that needed to be directly addressed,
       though many social issues need addressing in South Sudan (e.g. lack of legally defined rights,
       continuing conflicts in some areas, and various grievances and inequities in society).

3.6 Institutional Change/Strengthening

   57. The CFSSP, beyond its PDO, helped build institutional capacity in MoFEP and NAC.

   58. Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU). The unit, located in MoFEP, trained three national
       staff who were seconded to the unit. However, capacity building in MoFEP is still required, and is
       being provided through various DP-financed projects (e.g. the multi-donor funded Capacity Building
       Trust Fund administered by the Joint Donor Team, the Bank LICUS, ODI, UNDP, and USAID-
       funded programs).

   59. National Audit Chamber. The Project helped NAC to be transformed from near obscurity to a
       recognized Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). One hundred auditors were trained in the audit of
       financial statements and accounts of MDTF and GoSS. NAC staff carried out joint audits with the
       EAA and these helped them to develop their skills. The Project supported the drafting of an Audit
       Bill, which was enacted in 2011, and prepared an audit manual and strategic development plan.

   60. MoFEP-PPU. The Procurement component supported the Procurement Policy Unit (PPU) of MoFEP
       and the procurement units in MDAs through on-the-job training in terms of understanding of the
       2006 IPPDAR. Beyond its stated PDO, the Project also advised on the drafting of the Procurement
       Bill, which is awaiting the final endorsement of the Council of Ministers before being presented to
       NLA for approval. Thirty one MDAs were trained in procurement management including contract
       monitoring and commitment controls and six MDAs were trained and have up to date procurement
       plan.

   61. These local capacities are still remaining in each of these entities and supporting them in the
       government functions as well as for on-going World Bank projects.


                           4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Overall Rating: Moderate

   62. The changes in the project which allowed the use of individual consultants instead of firms in the
      Accounting and Procurement components were very important milestones that helped to address the
                                                 15
       likely risk to achievement of the development outcome. Also, the engagement of a very active and
       versatile Auditor General in June 2010 who took a strong lead in the Auditing component and
       worked very closely with the External Audit Agent engaged by the project led to a major turn around
       and achievement of all the agreed milestones in the component.


                          5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
   63. The project responded to the recommendations of the JAM carried out in March 2005 by the World
       Bank, UNDP, Government of Republic of Sudan and the SPLM. The report identified lack of
       governance systems, including PFM, to make efficient use of funds. The project therefore, sought to
       put in place such systems that are necessary to ensure reasonable assurance regarding the use of
       MDTF and GoSS counterpart funds.

   64. The CFSSP builds on the initial support by RIEP, the first MDTF-SS project by funding longer term
       Project Accounting Agents and Procurement Agents which were previously funded as an interim
       arrangement under the RIEP project. The OC recognized the need to continue to fund these two
       activities under a project that is focused on putting in place a robust fiduciary framework such as the
       CFSSP.

   65. Also, given the low capacity of the government staff and country physical condition at preparation
       stage, lessons learnt from similar countries like Afghanistan in a post conflict situation and with very
       low capacity informed the design of the project and supports the use of firms as the best scenario
       during the preparation stage of the project.

   66. The Bank, as the administrators of the MDTF-SS also provided necessary management support
       including preparation and prompt approval of the project. The Bank worked with the government
       team in MoFEP to prepare the project and consulted with other stakeholders including the National
       Audit Chamber. The preparation team also ensured simplicity and clarity of the PDO and its focus on
       the main issue of importance at that period which was delivery of the MDTF-SS activities as well as
       ensuring use of the funds for the purpose intended. Also the flexibility of the project design allowed
       an additional component to be included without need for a change in PDO and allowed for additional
       financing as the need arose.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

   67. The country-based task team provided adequate supervision support to the MDTF projects and GoSS
       counterpart fund. The composition (see Annex 5) of the project team was well balanced with a mix of
       operations, financial management, and procurement specialists and staff. The government Project
       Management Team had low capacity and, in response to this condition, the Bank provided direct
       supervision, advice and guidance in project implementation. Bank supervision intensity was
       commensurate with the level of assessed risk. In addition to supervision missions mounted twice
                                                  16
        annually, which prepared aide memoires highlighting key implementation issues observed, a
        continuous hands-on support was provided by the resident Bank Task Team. Action plans were
        developed with milestone dates to ensure that the issues were promptly addressed by Implementing
        Agencies.

     68. As noted in the review of the MDTF-SS and the ICRs for many MDTF projects, the dedication of
         Bank field staff to sustain uncommon adversity of living and working conditions and other
         implementation challenges contributed immensely to the satisfactory outcome of the project. The
         staff initially lived and worked in tents without air conditioning in 100+F. degree heat with minimal
         office equipment and only graduated to shipping containers after six months in the country and in an
         insecure environment. Other challenges facing Bank staff were the severe capacity constraints in
         GoSS, represented by lack of basic office technology, weak fiduciary systems, lack of government
         structures (at best, slowly evolving structures and institutional arrangements) all providing
         opportunities for corruption and likely ineffective use of MDTF and GoSS funds.

     69. There were initial delays experienced in procuring the PAA and EAA, due to protracted contract
         negotiations. The PAA contract arrangements turned out to be unsatisfactory, as indicated elsewhere
         in this ICR, and, as a result, GoSS established the PFMU in 2008 to implement the responsibilities
         envisaged for the PAA. Similarly, the contract negotiations for the EAA took a while to conclude;
         the vacant position of a substantive Auditor General compounded the delay in providing auditing
         services to the GoSS 10 and audit was limited to the MDTF projects. The Bank’s supervision
         addressed these issues by proactively working with GoSS to change the procurement requirement for
         the use of firms to individual consultants to ensure effective implementation.

     70. There were no Bank safeguard policies triggered by the implementation of this project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

     71. The overall performance rating for the Bank was Satisfactory due to the hands-on approach used to
         provide support and services both at entry and supervision during the implementation of this project.
         Some of the hands-on approach by the Bank included direct supervision, advice and guidance in
         project implementation and on-the-job training of some procurement officers in MoFEP. The support
         was provided by international staff resident in the country office, responding promptly to project
         issues and providing timely implementation support.

5.2 Borrower Performance

     (a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



10
  One reason for the delay in recruiting the EAA was that firms bidding for the contract were also bidding for the PAA contract. A
decision was therefore made to delay the tendering for the EAA contract. After the EAA tendering process started, one of the
competing firms complained that its financial proposal had been tampered with, leading to further delays as the complaint was
investigated by the Bank.
                                                               17
     72. The Government performance in relation to the Project can be said to be moderately satisfactory.
         Specific project objectives and activities have been achieved with the support of the government. Due
         to lack of existing fiduciary systems and the urgent need to ensure accountability and transparency,
         the GoSS devised a strategic objective for this project to establish, at a minimum, a fiduciary
         structure that would provide assurance to the government and MDTF donors regarding the use of
         donor and GoSS counterpart funds. Building of such fiduciary structures, however, had been fraught
         with challenges posed by lack of institutional capacity in the country.

     73. Disbursement did not commence until March 2008 when the first Withdrawal Application was
         prepared. There were indecision and some disagreement among the decision makers in government
         which led to delays in procuring the Agents. For instance, there was disagreement in MoFEP on the
         need for a Procurement Agent. The government informed a Bank mission that the hiring of a
         Procurement Agent was discontinued and subsequently, sent a letter, requesting that procurement
         agency services were still needed by MOFEP. Also, there were various changes in government
         which affected implementation. The Director General for Procurement who was leading the
         Procurement Agent selection process was suspended and for a long time, there was no substantive
         counterpart to champion the completion of the contracting process. Similarly, the activities on the
         external audit component were slowed down because there was no Auditor General between
         February 2008 and June 2010. In addition, while the project supported in drafting the Procurement
         Bill, the review process was delayed at various levels of government.

     74. External Agents were recruited to help establish fiduciary structures. The Agents were charged with
         the responsibilities for maintaining adequate financial management systems, producing a Project
         Implementation Manual; conducting audits of MDTF projects and GoSS financial statements and
         accounts, strengthening the capacity of the NAC exercising oversight and regulatory responsibilities
         for the procurement process, and advising MoFEP on complaints received from bidders. The
         government worked effectively with these Agents and consultants and this impacted on the success of
         the project implementation.


     (b) Implementing Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

     75. The Implementing Agencies were MoFEP and NAC. The PFMU took over the financial management
         responsibilities of the PAA in 2008, with similar terms of reference. Payments have been made on
         time and reports produced and submitted to various stakeholders on specified due dates. At the time
         of the closure of the Project there were no outstanding financial management issues. In fact, apart
         from FM responsibilities for MDTF and GoSS funds, the PFMU also took responsibilities for seven 11
         World Bank assisted projects which was outside their TOR.

     76. The Procurement Agent and subsequently the Advisor that supported the Procurement Policy Unit
         (PPU) in MoFEP improved the procurement process by providing training on contract management
         to both PPU and MDA personnel. The component supported the process of drafting the Procurement
         Bill which is before the parliament for enactment into law. Additionally, it supported MDAs in
         preparing procurement plans, tender documents and forms. The Advisor worked closely with the PPU

           to review procurement request from MDAs, developing a matrix to monitor performance and
           compliance and compliance of the MDAs with the IPPDAR 2006 and on-the job training for staff of
           both the PPU and the MDAs.

       77. The NAC has in general been an effective implementing agency, which has contributed to the relative
           success of the EAA in terms of performing audits and building capacity. Despite initial delays in
           recruiting the EAA and appointing a substantive Auditor General (not firmly in place until 2010)
           which were addressed partly with the various extensions, the EAA delivered on all the activities
           under its TOR and under this component. Also, apart from the audit of MDTF and GoSS accounts
           which in itself was an expanded scope, the NAC and EAA also audited three 12 Bank Assisted
           projects for all their years of implementation. GoSS and State audits have been carried out for six
           years ended December 31, 2005 to 2010. Four of these have been presented to the president and the
           National Legislative Assembly and publicly disclosed. The Auditor General was very proactive and
           made significant contributions that led to the success of the component.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

       78. The overall performance of the Borrower was assessed as Satisfactory due to the factors noted above.



                                                  6. Lessons Learned

       79. With the benefit of hindsight, there are important lessons to be drawn from the project for the Bank’s
           engagement in building capacity in post-conflict countries with extremely weak capacity as well as
           for practitioners in similar situations in the future.

       80. External agents, particularly for audit and procurement could contribute significantly to
           institutional strengthening priorities, but this should be accompanied by the transfer of skills in
           order to facilitate longer term capacity building. The work of the external agents (Project
           Accounting Agent/PFMU, External Audit Agent and Procurement Advisor) contributed to the
           institutional strengthening of the MoFEP, the PPU in MoFEP, procurement units in MDA and the
           NAC. The Agents and consultants supported in drafting various laws, guidelines, working documents
           and some other ad-hoc work that supported the institutional strengthening. It could be argued that
           capacity building should have been included in all the External Agents’ terms of reference to allow
           for proper transfer of the much needed financial management and procurement knowledge to
           counterpart staff. This, however, is easier said than done. The first priority of the External Agents
           was to get core PFM functions up and running, itself a time-consuming task and the Project was
           originally supposed to end in 2008. The severity of the capacity constraints, including the limited
           skill sets of counterpart staff, meant that transfer of FM and procurement knowledge to these staff
           would probably be difficult and time consuming. Moreover, other DP-supported projects/programs
           specifically focused on PFM capacity development (as referred to above) were being prepared and
           implemented, including in MoFEP.

81. Implementation efficiency could be enhanced through flexibility on procurement procedures,
    and by focusing external agents on salient, project-related tasks rather than assisting on
    broader government functions. Many of the tasks of the Procurement Advisor were bogged down
    in government bureaucratic processes which led to unnecessary delays. It is pertinent that
    government should separate project work from bureaucratic set up in order to achieve efficiency.
    Additionally, the procurement process for the contracting of the firms was ICB/QCBS and this took
    inordinately long time. Given the country situation, with limited number of accounting and auditing
    firms (which is still the case now seven years into project effectiveness), it might have been more
    efficient to start with a short list for the contracting process. In fact, an interim sole source contract
    of the PAA provided essential fiduciary coverage during the time taken to conduct a competitive
    process which eventually was unsuccessful. Procurement delays were also experienced in most of the
    MDTF-SS projects. As noted in the MDTF-SS evaluation report, procurement policies need to be
    flexible in response to institutional capacity constraints, local market conditions and other risks.

82. Depending on the core function/s involved, individual consultants could provide more efficient
    and cost-effective services compared to firms, and may result in quicker transfer of knowledge.
    The project design took into consideration, the recommendation of the JAM for use of international
    firms to implement core PFM functions. However, it was impossible to hire a firm for the Accounting
    component while a firm was used for the procurement component for only a year. Subsequently, the
    Oversight Committee approved the use of individual consultants. The experience shows that is more
    cost effective and efficient to hire the services of individual consultants than firms. Much time was
    lost in procuring the services of firms. The PAA was eventually replaced by the PFMU made up of
    individual consultants, while the Procurement Agent was replaced by an individual Procurement
    Advisor. Moreover, it is probably easier for Government personnel to engage with individual
    consultants than with the staff of a firm and the process of transferring knowledge is quicker. Also,
    the difficulties and adjustments in procuring firms and agents suggest the need to review the
    adequacy of some procurement requirements with respect to similar fragile country situations.

83. The timely appointment of Government counterparts is essential for efficient and successful
    implementation. A major issue that could determine the success of implementation of a project is
    availability of government counterparts to actively participate and support implementation.
    Substantial delays in implementation were due to the delay in the appointment of the Auditor General
    and a proactive Director General of procurement to lead the implementation of these components.
    Also, the most effective period of implementation of the procurement component was when the Bank
    had a Technical Assistant sitting with the PPU in MoFEP and working closely with the Director
    General and the PPU staff.

84. At entry, it is important to clarify objectives to stakeholders to avoid unrealistic expectations
    from the project. As was the case with the MDTF-SS and as noted in the independent final
    evaluation report for the MDTF-SS, inflated expectations can leave MDTF and the projects being
    held accountable for events beyond its scope and create unrealistic benchmark for assessing
    performance. While the main focus of the CFSSP was putting in place a framework for channeling
    MDTF and GoSS funds to provide reasonable assurance regarding the use of funds, many
    stakeholders believe the project should do more in capacity building for national staff. Clarity of
    objectives and goals are very pertinent to avoid similar situation in future.

85. The draft Bank ICR was sent for review to the PFMU, Project Coordination in MoFEP, PPU,
    Procurement Advisor, NAC and EAA Team Leader. Their review shows general agreement on the
    report particularly the implementation and impact of the project. Major comments include concerns
    on continuity and sustainability of the engagements under the three components and the likely gap
    due to project closure. There is general agreement on the ratings for the project.

Annex 2.      Outputs by Component

The outputs achieved by each of the three components are as follows:

The Accounting Component

    1. The accounting component provided support to GoSS in project financial management and
    disbursements for all MDTF and World Bank projects. It funded the establishment of the Project
    Financial Management Unit (PFMU) as Accounting Agents. The component supported eighteen (18)
    and seven (7) MDTF and Bank projects respectively with a total disbursement of US$718 million as at
    closing date of March 31, 2013. In addition to Head of the PFMU, the Deputy Head and the Assistant
    Accountant who were regional specialists, the PFMU staff included five South Sudanese, two of whom
    were seconded to the Unit by government for training in Bank financial management and disbursement
    procedures. Other outputs of this component are as follows:

      i.      Preparation of twenty five monthly bank reconciliation statements for each of the eighteen
              MDTF and seven Bank projects supported for the project duration;

The Auditing component

    2. The component provided support to the National Audit Chamber (NAC) in institutional
    strengthening and audit of GoSS, MDTF projects’ and World Bank projects’ financial statements. The
    outputs of the component includes the following:

       i.   Audit of GoSS financial statements for six (6) years from 2005 to 2010. The audit reports for
            2005 to 2008 have been presented to the President and the National Legislative Assembly while
            the reports for 2009 and 2010 are in the process of being printed and presented;

The Procurement Component

      3. The Procurement Component which was first managed by a Procurement Agent and subsequently by
      an individual consultant recruited as a Technical Advisor supported the Procurement Policy Unit in the
      Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. The outputs of the component include the following:
    i. Support in drafting the public procurement bill;
   ii. Support to MDAs and MDTF projects in preparing Procurement Plans;
 iii. Leading and guiding staff of the Procurement Policy Unit in MoFEP to review procurement requests
          and processes of MDAs/ spending agencies;

                                                    February 2013

1. This report contains findings of an end of project evaluation for the Core Fiduciary Systems Support Project
   (CFSSP) conducted by a consultant on behalf of the government, as the recipient of the grant. This evaluation was
   conducted between 16 January 2013 and 10 February 2013 to assess the impact of the project and its attainment of
   the development objective, pick lessons to be learnt for future projects of a similar nature and assess the level of
   sustainability for the activities supported by the project.

2. CFSSP was established in February 2006 following approval of a grant from the MDTF-S. The project
   development objective was to establish a robust framework for channeling of MDTF-S and government
   counterpart funds and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the use of those funds. The project which is due
   to close on 31 March 2013 has received total funding of US$16.447m including a government counterpart
   contribution of US$3.0m. The project has supported core fiduciary services of Project Accounting through the
   Project Accounting Agent (KPMG East Africa) and later the Project Financial Management Unit, External Audit
   Agents through PKF (UK) LLP as well as procurement function support services to MoFEP.

3. With the MDTF-S drawing to closure having disbursed over US$718 million through various projects, overall the
   CFSSP has strongly delivered on providing a robust framework for disbursing the funds as well as providing
   assurance, through regular financial and audit reports, on the use of these funds. There have been implementation
   challenges such as delayed procurements and slow progress for some activities, switch over from firms to
   individual consultants for Accounting and Procurement components but these have not derailed the project from
   achieving the development objective.

4. Sustainability of the activities supported by the project remains the biggest challenge. Whereas, the External Audit
   Agent has closely worked with the National Audit Chamber in terms of building capacity, there are institutional
   challenges including human resource capacity, financial constraints and infrastructure acquisition that require to be
   addressed before effective strengthening of the institution. The PFMU has largely been resourced by consultants
   and project staff and there has not been strong evidence of ownership or of attempts by the Treasury/Directorate of
   Accounts to mainstream the unit’s activities. Strengthening of the procurement function in government has been
   significantly affected by the delayed finalization of the procurement bill. The procurement regulations and the
   accompanying manuals and forms have to be in line with the procurement law which is currently still in draft
   form.

5. Among the key lessons learned from this project include:
   i. The need to have deeper counterpart involvement in the design, execution and supervision of activities to
      engender ownership.
  ii. The need for capacity development plans to be specific to the operating environment for better
      capacity/knowledge transfer.
 iii. For sustainability and effectiveness in capacity transfer, technical assistance/support during the life of a
      project, should be designed in such a way that it gradually reduces from being of an executive nature to being
      largely advisory.

6. Key recommendations include:
  i.  The need to mainstream project/aid accounting into the Directorate of Accounts for sustainability – possibly
      with appropriate initial support.

  ii.   The government continues to make positive steps towards institutional building and future support in areas of
        deficiency should have strong emphasis on sustainability of the reforms or of the activities being supported.

Core Fiduciary System Support Project (CFSSP)
Project accounting agent, Procurement agent and External Audit Agent
At the start of the MDTF-SS in 2005, the accounting capacity within the MoFEP of the GoSS was weak and
it needed substantial strengthening. The MoFEP engaged an Interim Project Accounting Agent (IPAA) to
provide accounting services and fiduciary assurance for projects funded through MDTF-SS resources. The
IPAA formed part of the Project Disbursement Unit of the Treasury of the GoSS, and was responsible for
preparing and issuing the Project Implementation Guidelines and accounting for all projects related
expenditures. In addition, the IPAA was responsible for ensuring that all project accounting activities were in
strict compliance with: the requirements of the GAs; and the Project Implementation Manuals. In December
2008, the IPAA was replaced by the Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) which was also based in
the MoFEP.

The MoFEP contracted a Procurement Agent to carry out procurement tasks for programs that were financed
by MDTF-SS resources. The Procurement Agent had the responsibility of building procurement capacity
within government and providing the GoSS, donors and the bidding community with assurance that
procurement was carried out in a sound (responsible, accountable and transparent) manner. The Procurement
Agent was responsible for supporting all procurement functions for all MDTF-SS projects/programs.

Projects/programs financed through the MDTF-SS were subject to a financial audit on an annual basis. The
MoFEP contracted an External Audit Agent to carry out the functions of an external auditor of the MDTF-SS
projects.

Minimum fiduciary systems established in the RSS
MDTF-SS ensured that annual MDTF-SS portfolio and RSS audits were completed, MDAs followed
procurement guidelines in their procurement processes and the MDTF-SS project were supported to ensure
proper financial accounting.

The overall task of CFSSP was to address the emergency needs of the GoSS in establishing minimum
fiduciary systems for channeling fund flows from the donors as well as for counterpart funds. This project
supported the recruitment of a Project Accounting Agent (PAA) to provide accounting services as per World
Bank Financial Management Guidelines and international standards. However, in December 2008 the PAA
was replaced by PFMU which was based in the MoFEP. The Project also supported an External Audit Agent
(EAA) to provide auditing services in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, and a
Procurement Agent to ensure MDAs’ procurement plans were prepared, implemented on time and their
capacity in undertaking procurement for the Government was enhanced.
The Project, which was implemented by MoFEP and NAC, achieved the following results.

Impact of MDTF-SS (extract)

Culture of accountability in the public service


                                                      34
The RIEP and CFSSP supported establishment of minimum fiduciary systems in the MDAs to provide
assurance in the use of funds by RSS. MDTF-SS projects used accounting, auditing and procurement
guidelines that promoted a culture of accountability regarding the use of donor and RSS funds. Considering
that Ministries were prime recipients of MDTF-SS funding, their compliance with grant agreement
covenants (on fiduciary functions) inculcated a culture of accountability in the public service.

Challenges (extract)
 a. Lack of counterpart staff to understudy consultants hired by MDTF-SS projects
Consultants working in the MDTF-SS projects were expected to transfer their skills, knowledge and
experience in financial management, procurement, and M&E, to local counterpart staff. However, there was
lack of counterpart staff to be attached to the consultants hired by MDTF-SS projects. As a result, the
consultants were not able to build capacity of national staff in financial management, procurement and
M&E.
Recommendation: RSS to develop Technical Assistance guidelines, including mandatory twinning of
consultants with counterpart staff.

 b. Delay in enacting draft bills and regulations into legislation
All the projects had components of developing relevant draft bills and draft policies. MDTF-SS projects
supported the development of relevant draft bills and regulations. The legislative process was slow and
beyond the control of MDTF-SS. At the end of MDTF-SS, the procurement draft bill and regulations had not
been enacted into laws.
Recommendation: RSS to establish a Taskforce on pending Bills and legislation.
