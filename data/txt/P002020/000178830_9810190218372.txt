INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIA
FOR A FIFTH HIGHIWAY PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of $26.3 million
to help finance a fifth highway project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.          The proposed loan - the seventeenth Bank/IDA operation in
Nigeria and the eighth for transport - would increase total Bank/IDA
commitments to $417.7 million (net of cancellations), representing over
45 percent of Nigeria's external debt, including undisbursed. A summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of February
29, 1972 is given at Annex I.
3.          Nigeria's performance in executing Bank/IDA financed projects
was described fully in paragraphs 34-42 of my report and recommendation
on the rehabilitation program loan (P-911 dated April 2, 1971) and, more
recently, in paragraphs 3-8 of my report and recommendation on the second
education loan (P-1046 dated March 16, 1972).
PART II - THE ECONOMY
4.          An economic report on Nigeria (AW-22a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on January 29, 1971 and my report on the rehabilitation
program loan (P-911 of April 2, 1971) contained additional material relat-
ing to the Nigerian economy. An economic mission returned from Nigeria in
November, 1971 and its report will be distributed to the Executive Directors
within the next two months. The principal conclusions of the mission were
summarized in paragraphs 9-24 of my report and recommendation on the second
education loan (P-1046 dated March 16, 1972). A country data sheet is
provided at Annex II.
PART III - THE PROJECT
5.          The report entitled "Nigeria - Appraisal of a Fifth Highway
Project" (PTR-78a dated March 28, 1972), attached herewith, contains a
summary of Nigeria's transport sector (paragraphs 2.06-2.19) and a
detailed description of its highway sector (paragraphs 3.01-3.29).
Details of the Bank Group's involvement in Nigeria's transport sector
are given at Annex 1 of the appraisal report.



6.          The project was initially appraised in November, 1970.
Negotiations began in Washington on April 19, 1971 and were substantially
completed on April 23, 1971. The Nigerian delegation was unable at that
time to give the Bank the assurances it sought regarding the timing of
measures to (i) improve highway planning; (ii) improve highway adminis-
tration; (iii) introduce legislation for adequate vehicle weight controls;
and (iv) implement the agreed recommendations of consultant advisers for
the improvement of the Western State's road maintenance procedures; however,
satisfactory progress has been made on all four points since then. During
the summer of 1971, the Federal Government requested the addition to the
project of eight damaged bridges and an increase in the provision for
feasibility studies from 1,000 to 2,000 miles of roads. Negotiations were
resumed briefly and concluded in mid-December, 1971.
7.          The project comprises:
(a)   the construction or reconstruction of 109 miles
of trunk roads in the Western State;
(b)   the reconstruction of eight damaged bridges on
federal roads A121, A122 and A232;
(c)   consultant and technical services.for supervising
the above construction and for feasibility studies,
final engineering, and improved highway planning and
maintenance operations; and
(d) equipment for highway planning and for control of
vehicle weights.
A map showing the location of the project items is attached to the -appraisal
report.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
8.          The total project cost is estimated to be $42.6 million,
including $26.3 million in foreign exchange. Detailed costs are give in
Annex III and in the appraisal report. The proposed loan will finance
the entire foreign exchange cost. The Federal Government will pass on the
proceeds of the loan allocated for road construction/reconstruction and
supervision to the Western State Government, which will finance the local
cost of this work, including consultants' supervision. The Federal Govern-
ment will finance the local cost of the balance of the project.
Project Execution and Procurement
9.          The Western State Ministry of Works and Transport will be
responsible for road construction and reconstruction in that State and the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing for the remainder of the project.



- 3 -
10.          Contracts for road construction/reconstruction will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines.  Their amount, ranging from $2 million to $7 million equivalent,
should attract both local and foreign contractors, particularly those already
working in Nigeria. The Western State Government has already commenced
prequalification procedures: bids are expected to be invited shortly and
contracts awarded by August, 1972. Contracts for reconstruction of the
eight war-damaged bridges have already been awarded, under arrangements
acceptable to the Bank. Items of equipment required for traffic counting
and control, costing less than $10,000 up to an aggregate of $200,000, may
be procured through local competitive bidding.
11.          The Federal Government and the Bank have agreed on a list of
roads for reconnaissance and/or feasibility studies amounting to 1 ,480 miles
and the balance of approximately 520 miles to be studied under the project
will be selected by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in agreement
with the Bank. The nation-wide highway maintenance study is under way and
is expected to be completed by the end of 1972. Negotiations are proceeding
between the Federal Government and the U.K. Road Research Laboratory for
assistance in setting up a traffic data collecting and processing unit in
the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing; technical assistance funds for
this work may therefore be provided by the United Kingdom Government.
Disbursement
12.          The proposed loan will be disbursed against the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment, actual foreign exchange payments to consultants
and 60 percent of expenditures for civil works, representing the estimated
foreign exchange component. In view of the urgency of the nation-wide
highway maintenance study referred to in paragraph 11 above, the draft
Loan Agreement providbe for withdrawals in respect of expenditures incurred
after October 1, 1971 in an aggregate amount not exceeding $150,000.
Economic Benefits
13.          The project is justified by economic and financial benefits
in the form of reduced vehicle operating costs, time savings for commercial
vehicles and their drivers, and savings in road maintenance costs. Savings
in vehicle operating and road maintenance costs alone are expected to yield
rates of return ranging from 12 to 32 percent for the individual roads;
internal economic returns for the bridges to be reconstructed are expected
to range from 12 to 35 percent. For the project as a whole, the internal
economic return is 22 percent. The detailed calculations are set out in
paragraphs 5.01-5.08 of the appraisal report.
PART IV - I-E   L INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
14.          The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of
Nigeria and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Western State
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,



Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan have been distributed separately. The draft
Loan and Project Agreements follow the pattern of agreements for similar
highway projects.
15.          The conclusion of arrangements by the Borrower to pass on the
proceeds of the loan allocated for road construction/reconstruction and
supervision to the Western State and the employment by the liestern State
of the consultants referred to in Section 2.02 of the draft Project Agree-
ment, acceptable to the Bank and upon terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, will be conditions of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.
16.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
17.          I recommend that the Executive D rectors approve the proposed
loan.
