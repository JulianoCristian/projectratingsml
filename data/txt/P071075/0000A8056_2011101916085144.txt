                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's principal development objectives are to improve reliability and financial viability of selected urban water utilities, and to increase access to piped
                         water networks in selected urban areas. Progress toward these principal development outcomes will be measured through i) the increase in water delivered
                         through existing and extended networks; ii) improvements in cost recovery, and iii) increase in the number of household connections to the piped water
                         network.
