                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's principal development objectives are to improve reliability and financial viability of selected urban water utilities, and to increase access to piped water
                         networks in selected urban areas. Progress toward these principal development outcomes will be measured through i) the increase in water delivered through existing
                         and extended networks; ii) improvements in cost recovery, and iii) increase in the number of household connections to the piped water network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last ISR there has not been any mission undertaken other than just project specific discussions, reviews and visits to states to verify issues, because project
                         implementation has slowed down due to delays encountered in transiting from the old credit to the Additional Financing credit. However, out of the 13 water treatment facilities under
                         rehabilitation 8 are now fully completed and commissioned (Ijebu-ode, Enugu, Papalanto, Ogere, Kaduna, Zankwo, Kafanchan and Nsukka). These plants can now run at full design

                         capacity, but due to lack of power and high cost of fuel to run the standby generators it has become impossible to run these plants for 16 hours in a day. Customer enumerations in
                         Ogun and Kaduna have been completed with an increase in the number of registered customers by 30% (Kaduna from 88,000 to 116,346, Ogun 33,000 to 38,987 and Enugu 15,500
                         to 21,700). Kaduna has revised the tariff rate from N21/m3 to N32/m3 for domestic customer and up to N210/m3 for industrial customers while that of Raw water was increased from
                         N7.25/m3 - N100/m3. Billing and collection efficiency has increased from 25% to 54%.

                         The implementation of the Management Contract for the treatment plant in Kaduna and Zaria is progressing smoothly, and the Ugandan-inspired model in Ogun has taken a firm
                         footing with evidence on improvement in revenue collection, water production and improvement on staff inputs. The revenue circle management contract is moving well in Enugu with
                         over 5,000 house hold meters installed. Currently, there is a massive house connection of 8000 without meters in Enugu and Nsukka that is being directly handled by the
                         Government.
                         The Government have requested for an extension of the closing date to enable the project meet the PDO. The project will achieve the physical targets for the PDO, regarding
                         reliability and access to piped network but the financial viability is unlikely to be achieved.

                         Rehabilitation works on treatment plant in the three state are almost completed and water production is increasing, at the same time the rehabilitation of the existing distribution
                         networks are completed. If there is good power supply to treatment plants the hours of operation will increase and also more water can be delivered to customers.There are
                         improvements on the PPP, but being hindered with the delays in getting the water laws approved by Government. This has also made it difficult for the Utilities to adjust their tariff as
                         and when required.
