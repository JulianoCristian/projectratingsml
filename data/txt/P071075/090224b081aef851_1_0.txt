                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's principal development objectives are to improve reliability and financial viability of selected urban water utilities, and to increase access to piped water
                         networks in selected urban areas. Progress toward these principal development outcomes will be measured through i) the increase in water delivered through existing
                         and extended networks; ii) improvements in cost recovery, and iii) increase in the number of household connections to the piped water network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is 8 years old and is rated satisfactory. Cr.4784 has disbursed 53% - while 35% of the credit is committed. At the time of mission, there have been significant
                         improvements towards increase in water production, and improvements in billing and collection efficiency which has risen to 70%. All the 13 water treatment plants have been
                         rehabilitated and about 492.5 km of old pipes of different sizes replaced including valves, and bulk meters at strategic locations..

                         The request for additional financing was essentially provided to complete the project by carrying out network expansion, increasing the new house connections, and improving the
                         financial sustainability of the participating States. Progress is ongoing now with about 284 km of new pipe networks under construction spread over the three States together with
                         house connection and meter installation. This network extension will increase access to water supply, increase the number of new house connections from 27,000 to 60,000 and

                         reduce the unaccounted for water to a more reasonable level of 35%. In Enugu State, the network expansions in Enugu and Nsukka cities has been completed and progress is now
                         ongoing with 10,000 house connections and 3,500 household meters. The State Government alone has replaced 800 km of pipe lines and is now participating in the house
                         connections deployment.

                         In terms of the reforms process, it is worth noting that Kaduna has implemented the internal delegated management system where each district officer is responsible for the operation
                         of his district and should be able to raise enough revenue to cover staff salaries as well as O&M costs. The district officers have the right to choose the right caliber of staff he thinks
                         can work with him and send anyone that is not required to the Headquarters. If at the end of the month he is not able to collect enough revenue to pay salaries then, he is left to find
                         solutions on how he will pay his staff. Excess revenue collected, after taking care of staff cost and O&M cost as agreed with Headquarters, is sent back to the headquarter account.
                         This autonomy given to the districts has raised the moral of the officers and has built confidence in them to perform better than before. It is worth noting that since January 2012 the
                         State Government has stop providing subvention to the Water Board to cover costs for Staff salaries and O&M. A similar approach is being practiced in Ogun but it is not as good
                         and as efficient as that of Kaduna.

                                 Improvement has been made with data management where the States are now able to easily identify their customers, their locations and have developed software to track
                         customer bill and collections. More effort is being made to continue with customer enumeration and mapping by the utilities themselves.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Rehabilitation works on treatment plant in the three states are completed and water production is increasing, at the same time the rehabilitation of the existing distribution networks
                         are completed. If there is constant power supply is available the hours of operation will increase and also more water can be delivered to customers. Pipe network extension is in
                         progress as well as house connections and water meters. There are improvements on the PPP, but being hindered by the delays in getting the water laws approved by Government.
                         Kaduna and Enugu have revised their tariffs and collection/billing efficiency has risen to 75%.
