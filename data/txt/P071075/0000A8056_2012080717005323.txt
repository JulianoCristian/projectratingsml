                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's principal development objectives are to improve reliability and financial viability of selected urban water utilities, and to increase access to piped water
                         networks in selected urban areas. Progress toward these principal development outcomes will be measured through i) the increase in water delivered through existing
                         and extended networks; ii) improvements in cost recovery, and iii) increase in the number of household connections to the piped water network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is now 8 years old and is rated satisfactory. Credit 3924 has disbursed 99% and Cr.4784 has disbursed 33% - while 45% of the credit is committed. At the time of
                         mission, there have been significant improvements towards increase in water production, and improvements in billing and collection efficiency which have improved the coverage of
                         operation and maintenance costs. All the 13 water treatment plants have been rehabilitated and about 492.5 km of old pipes of different sizes replaced.

                         The request for additional financing was made to complete the project by carrying out network expansion, increasing the new house connections, and improving the financial
                         sustainability. Progress is ongoing now with about 284 km of new pipe networks under construction spread over the three States. This network distribution is being carried out
                         together with house connection and meters installation. This particular activity was awarded assuming there would be an extension of time for this project – given the 10 months lost

                         between the signature and the access to the funds. This network extension will increase access to water supply, increase the number of new house connections from 27,000 to
                         60,000 and reduce the water losses. In Enugu State, the network expansions in Enugu and Nsukka cities have been completed and progress is now ongoing with 8,000 house
                         connections and 2,500 household meters. The State Government alone has replaced 800 km of pipe lines and is now participating in the house connections deployment. This entire
                         process is expected to take between 9 to 12 months after September 2012. Therefore, it would be advisable to either delay the closing date of the project by one year or find an
                         alternative solution to allow for the above works to be completed smoothly.
