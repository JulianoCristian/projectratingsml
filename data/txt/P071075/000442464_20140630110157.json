          outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: projects\n            involving the introduction of significant reforms to improve\n            sector outcomes based on global good practice should set\n            realistic timeframes and targets based on candid assessment\n            of the local context, including the political economy,\n            market risks, and the sector\u0092s ability to hedge them, and\n            sector readiness for changes, as well as recognition of the\n            fact that reform is a long-term process that requires the\n            engagement, commitment, and support of all key stakeholders.\n            Project design should also include incentives to make\n            Borrowers more accountable for achieving results on all\n            critical activities, including reforms required to ensure\n            achievement of development outcomes. The design of project\n            implementation arrangements that are decentralized to the\n            sub-national level such as state level should ensure that\n            adequate checks and controls are included and enforced in\n            supervision arrangements, especially where capacity is an\n            issue. The design of project implementation arrangements\n            should ensure that staffing policies include incentives that\n            promote the retention of experienced staff seconded by\n            government or externally sourced who have benefitted from\n            capacity building opportunities provided through the\n            project. The use of an independent technical auditor on an\n            annual or bi-annual basis will enhance the integrity and\n            reliability of the project monitoring data. Assessment of\n            project implementation readiness should not only focus on\n            having a procurement plan for the first year of\n            implementation, but also pay adequate attention to\n            completing critical preparatory activities such as detailed\n            designs for investments, to allow for timely commencement,\n            and implementation of activities once the loan or credit\n            becomes effective."}, "docdt": "2014-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
