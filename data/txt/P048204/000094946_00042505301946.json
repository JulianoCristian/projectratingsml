Capacity enhancement Project in Cameroon, is to\n            ensure a national capacity, in regards to environmental, and\n            monitoring practices for the implementation of the Petroleum\n            Development and Pipeline Project, which involves\n            construction, and operation of an oil export pipeline, in\n            the border with Chad. The components will: 1) enable the\n            establishment of a regulatory framework, in compliance with\n            the National Environment Management Plan, to support the\n            enforcement of the Environmental Law. The component will\n            develop a long-term vision for the environmental management\n            of the petroleum sector. Studies will assess institutional\n            capacity, and provide adequate alternatives for the sector;\n            2) strengthen the technical coordination of field\n            interventions : health, biophysical, and socioeconomic\n            impact management. Liaison with sponsors will be ensured,\n            and, training will be provided to institutional staff, in\n            coordination with counterparts in Chad, to maximize\n            synergies; 3) support implementation of the environmental\n            management plan, and, the improvement of skills,\n            responsiveness to oil spills, and, capacity building within\n            the decentralized services of the Cameroon Authority; and 4)\n            monitor, and evaluate project management, through an\n            International Advisory Panel, who will compile information\n            on performance indicators, and evaluate activities under\n            sound environmental management."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
