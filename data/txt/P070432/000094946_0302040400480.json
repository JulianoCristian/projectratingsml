Flood Emergency\n            Recovery Project for Mozambique was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was modest, and the Bank and borrower performance\n            were both satisfactory. The lessons learned found that it\n            was important to mobilize a multisectoral team at an early\n            stage to produce the macroeconomic, sectoral damage, and\n            reconstruction assessment. Sharing the analytical documents,\n            such as the damage assessment and the macroeconomic\n            evaluation with donors and Governments contributes to a\n            common understanding of the dimensions involved. Promote\n            partnership in an open and transparent manner. Coordinate\n            and leverage external assistance from the international\n            community for reconstruction. Field negotiations with\n            quality control and legal staff permitted a smooth process\n            in the emergency project."}, "docdt": "2002-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
