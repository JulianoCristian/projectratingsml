The first section, from Kingston to Spanish\n            Town, which accounts for about 70 percent of the expenditure\n            included in the project, is the most travelled and heavily\n            congested highway in the country and serves an area composed\n            of commercial and industrial enterprises. The opening of the\n            new four-lane road will result in a substantial reduction in\n            vehicle operating costs. The improvement of the second\n            section north from Spanish Town to Bog Walk serving an area\n            which is agricultural in nature, will also reduce vehicle\n            operating costs by permitting greater speeds, a reduction in\n            distance, and the elimination of a lengthy detour which has\n            to be made whenever the present road is closed to traffic\n            because of recurrent floods. The improvement of the third\n            section, from Moneague to Crescent Park, which is in poor\n            condition, will permit traffic to use this road instead of a\n            detour via Ocho Rios which is unsuitable for heavy traffic."}, "docdt": "1965-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
