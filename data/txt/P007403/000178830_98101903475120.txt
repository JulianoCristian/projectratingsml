JAMAICA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGhWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        Early in 1964 the Government of Jamaica asked the Bank to assist
in financing its highway program. A Bank appraisal mission reviewed the
program in March 1964. Later, in November 1964, the Government requested
assistance in financing the construction and reconstruction of three
sections of the high priority road from Kingston to the north which is
included in its Highway Development Program.
ii.       The section from Kingston to Spanish Town (15 miles, h lanes)
accounts for about 70 percent of Project costs; this is the most heavily
travelled highway in Jamaica. The other two road sections are from Spanish
Town to Bog Walk (7.5 miles, 2 lanes) and further north from Moneague to
Crescent Park (4 miles, 2 lanes).
iii.      The estimated cost of the Project, amounting to US$11.0 million
equivalent (including contingencies), is based partly on preliminary and
partly on final engineering by the Ministry of Communications and Works and
is reliable. The foreign component is estimated to range between 38 and 48
percent for the construction work, and about 60 percent for engineering.
The proposed loan covers 50 percent of Project's total cost or US$5,5
million.
iv.       Contracts for construction of the works will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding, except for the Moneague -
Crescent Park section which is considered too small to interest foreign
contractors. Execution of the Project will be the responsibility of the
MIinistry of Communications and Works.  The Ministry is well organized and
its staff is efficient. Since the Project will impose a very heavy work
load on the Ministry, some additional full-time staff will be engaged by
the GovernmXent to coordinate all aspects of the Project and outside
consultants will also be retained to finalize the plans and contract docu-
ments and supervise the execution of the Project.
v.        The construction of the road sections included in the Project will
sharply reduce transport costs on some of the most heavily travelled road
sections in Jamaica. The rates of return on the investments in the three
road sections range from 10 to 25 percent,which is clearly satisfactory.
vi.       The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.5
million equivalent to the Government of Jamaica for a term of 25 years,
including a 5-year period of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Jamaica asked the Bank early in 1964 to assist
in financing its highway program. A Bank appraisal mission reviewed the
program in Jamaica in March 1964 and concluded that a number of projects,
consisting of the construction to higher standard of three highway sections
on the Kingston to Crescent Park Road, the replacement of the Olivier
Bridge near- Morant Bay, and the preparation of a feasibility study of a
future expressway would be suitable for Bank financing. (see Map).
2.        The Government, after considering several solutions for financing
this program, informed the Bank in November 1964 that it would limit its
request for financial assistance to the three highway sections already
proposed. The replacement of the bridge is being considered separately
under a Canadian Aid program and the Government has postponed its decisien
about proceeding with the feasibility study.
3.        This report is based on the findings of the Bank appraisal mission
and on documents prepared by the Jamaican Ministry of Communications and
Works and by the Road Research Laboratory, an agency of the U.K. Government.
A loan for the Project would be the first Bank loan to Jamaica.
II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
4.        Jamaica is an island with an area of 4,400 sq.miles, about 200
miles long and 22 miles wide on the average. It has a population of more
than 1.7 million, and is thus one of the world's most densely populated
countries. Jamaica's gross national product grew by about 7 percent
annually between 1953 and 1960, but the growth slowed down to about 3 per-
cent in recent years. The per capita income is about US$425 equivalent.
The transport sector has accounted for about 17 percent of Jamaica's
national product in recent years, an increase from 7 percent 10 years ago.
5.        Geographically, Jamaica may be divided into three regions - the
eastern mountains, the central and western plateau, and the coastal plains.
The eastern mountains are so rugged that only one main road crosses them.
The central and western plateau consists of limestock rock and contains
the world's largest workable deposits of bauxite. The coastal plains vary
in width from a few yards to several miles and contain some of the richest
soils on the island. About two-fifths of the land is unproductive, largely
due to the mountainous terrain.
B.   Transport in Jamaica
6.        Highway transport is the backbone of Jamaica's domestic transpor-
tation system (see Map). The railway, which is Government-owned, is
important only for the transport of bauxite products. Scheduled domestic



air service was begun in 1963 and is still on an experimental basis.   Coastal
shipping is virt.ually non-existent.
7.        The railway was started in 1845 and has now 205 miles of line.   In
1963 it carried about 1.3 million tons; the total traffic amounted to about
44 million ton/miles of freight.  Bauxite products accounted for about 70
percent of freight revenues of B760,000, bananas for slightly less than 20
percent and the remainder was largely parcel traffic. Passenger traffic is
less than 1 million per year, with revenues of about ;170,000. The railway
has nearly always operated at a deficit; in 1963 total revenues were less
than U1 million and the deficit was nearly L300,000.
8.        The highway transport industry has expanded vigorously in the
last 10 years (see Table 1). The motor vehicle fleet has increased from
about 19,000 in 1953 to 72,000 in 1963, an annual increase of 15 percent.
Jamaica can still expect a very substantial growth of highway transport.
The increase in the last 5 years was actually slightly higher than in the
preceeding 5 years; in 1963 there were about 24 inhabitants per vehicle,
compared to 13 in Italy and 5 in France.
9.        As in most developing countries, the trucking industry consists
primarily of one-truck owner operators; there are only two small companies
operating several trucks. There is no economic regulation of the industry;
licenses are freely available to all who meet minimum safety standards and
rates are not prescribed.  Passenger service, on the other hand, is
regulated and fares are set by the Government.
10.       Road traffic legislation provides adequate regulation for the
size and load capacity of vehicles. Axle loads are limited to 500 lb per
inch width of tire. Many exceptions are granted for trucks to carry
excessive weight, such as the carriage of bauxite or heavy equipment; this
damages roads built several years ago to standards which are no longer
adequate.
l1.       Transport coordination turns primarily on the question of what
to do with the railway. The railway manager believes that serious
consideration should be given to limiting the&railway to the transport of
bauxite; this would permit closing a major part of the system. The
Government, on the other hand, seems to fear the consequences of dismissing
about 1,600 railway employees. In either event, the Project would not be
affected significantly.
C.   The Highway System
The Network
12.       Jamaica's highway network is relatively extensive.   It consists
of 2,692 miles of the most important roads which are the responsibility of



- 3 -
the Ministry of Communications and Works and a small number of scattered
agricultural and local roads, which are the responsibility of local
authorities. The roads for which the Ministry is responsible are
classified as follows:
Length in Miles
Gravel           Asphalt
National roads                         -                 418
Main roads                             149                357
Other roads                          1,120               648
1,269             1,4723
The national and main roads are arterial and connect all the major towns
and important agricultural and industrial areas; the others are feeder
roads.
Road Administration
13.       The Ministry of Communications and Works exercises general
direction and control over all transport and communications, including
both their operation and construction (see attached organization chart).
The professional administration of the Ministry is under the supervision
of a Permanent Secretary who is a civil servant; under him are two under-
secretariats for Communications and Public Works. The technical aspects
of public works, including roads, are supervised by a Chief Technical
Director who is responsible to the Permanent Secretary. The Director
supervises four directorates: Technical Services (building design
roads, surveys, design standards, etc.); Electrical and Mechanical Services
(equipment and workshops); Construction (buildings, roads and airfields);
and Maintenance (roads and buildings). The engineers of the Ministry are
qualified professionals and there are clear lines of authority. An
Establishments and Personnel Officer deals with all staff matters and is
responsible to the Permanent Secretary.
14.       So far, most construction has been done directly by the
Construction Directorate, using its own equipment and staff. Major works
have had to be carried out in small, successive steps because of limited
annual budgetary appropriations. The Directorate of Mechanical Services,
which maintains and controls all mechanical equipment used for construction
and maintenance, is well organized and efficient. Modern machine accounting
systems are operated in the various directorates. The accounts are
controlled by an internal auditing organization and examined by the Auditor
General who reports to the Legislature.
Maintenance and Design Standards
15.       Maintenance of roads and buildings is an island-wide function
which is controlled by the Director of Maintenance. The island is divided



- 4 -
into six areas, each of which is controlled by a Senior Superintendent and
divided into "parishes". This organization functions efficiently and road
maintenance is generally good.
16.       The design standards used up to now in the construction or improve-
ment works are generally satisfactory. An exception is the omission of
ditches along the sides of the road because of very narrow rights-of-way
(40 to 50 feet for most roads). Water runs along the shoulders, which are
generally surfaced. However, in many places the roadway has been widened
over the shoulders, and the wear and tear caused by the traffic, combined
with the water erosion, call for extensive maintenance. The necessity for
wider rights-of-way and adequate cross-sectional standards was discussed with
the Ministry, which agreed to the improved design standards set forth in Table 4,
Highway Expenditures
17.       As shown in Table 2, annual expenditures on highways amounted to
about US$8 million equivalent in recent years. New construction accounted
for about 45 percent of this, maintenance for 40 percent, and administra-
tion for the remainder. Maintenance expenditures have averaged about
US$1,200 per mile annually, which is adequate. A rough calculation shows
that, on the average, about US$550 of this accounts for routine maintenance,
US$100 for maintenance of bridges and structures, and US$200 for asphalt
resurfacing; the remaining US$350 has been necessary to repair the severe
damage done by hurricanes and floods.
18.       Table 3 indicates that in 1963 the users of the highways paid in
user charges about 50 percent more than the costs of highways. Not all of
these charges can be regarded as special taxes on highway users since
customs duties, for example, are also imposed on imports other than
vehicles; however, those on vehicles are substantially higher than average
duties. Even when allowance is made for these considerations, charges on
road users still exceed the expenditures on roads. Moreover, the relative
burden on highway users has increased significantly in recent years; while
the excess of receipts over expenditures was only about 10 percent in 1958,
it reached 50 percent in 1963. The Government does not seem to have an
explicit policy on the taxation of highway transport but the ease of
collecting these taxes and the relatively high income of owners of
passenger cars undoubtedly have been important considerations.
D. Transport in the Development Plarn
19.       Jamaica's five-year Development Plan, 1963-68, with total planned
investments of 191.4 million, allocates 111.6 million, or about 13 percent,
to transport investments.  Of this 18.8 million  or about three-quarters,
is for highways; nearly all of the remainder is for civil aviation. An
additional 15.7 million will be spent on roads in connection with agricul-
tural and housing developments. Since the Plan covers only public invest-
ments, the transport sector does not include investments in vehicles;
these are likely to be at least three times as great as the investments in
highways.



- 5 -
20.       Budgetary expenditures on highways by the Ministry of Communications
and Works, which are the core of the highway program, are planned to increase
from fl.0 million to fl.7 million annually between 1963 and 1968, or about
70 percent. No major expenditures on the proposed Project were initially
included in the Development Plan, though some expenditures were expected in
the later years of the Plan. There were two major reasons for this:
First, the U.K. Road Research Laboratory (RRL) was making a highway survey
of Jamaica and, pending its conclusion, the Development Plan could not
include specific major projects. Second, the Plan is geared to the construc-
tion capabilities of the Ministry, which cannot be increased drastically
within a short period. This meant that major new projects were not included
because at the time the Plan was being prepared no adequate sources for
funds appeared available.  It is now clear from the traffic studies of the
RRL that the road sections in the proposed Project have a high priority,and
the Government has decided to include them in its highway construction
program starting in 1965.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
21.       The Project consists of:
(a) the construction of a four-lane road section from
Kingston to Spanish Town, about 15 miles long;
(b) the relocation of a two-lane road section from Spanish
Town to Bog Wa2ck, for a length of about 7.4 miles;
(c) the improvement, with some realignment, of a section
of about h miles, from Moneague to Crescent Park.
22.       The three road sections are on the route from Kingston to the
north coast. The existing two-lane road from Kingston to Spanish Town is
already congested; it would be upgraded and improved and supplemented by
another two-lane roadway. This will involve difficult construction with
sand drains through marshland, building of two interchanges, and several
smaller structures. It would also include two-lane by-passes on the south
and west side of Spanish Town to connect with existing roads to Old Harbour
in the west and to Bog W4L1k in the north. In the outskirts of Kingston
the Project also includes the widening to four lanes of the two-lane urban
avenue between North Street and Duhaney Bridge.
23.       On the 7.4 miles section from Spanish Town to Bog Walk the existing
road runs in the bottom of a deep rocky gorge. This section is subject to
frequent and heavy flooding, and the main crossing at Flat Bridge is used as
a submergible deck without railing to allow water and boulders to flow over



- 6 -
it during rainstorms.  The Project includes the widening of about 1.3
miles and the relocation on the other bank of the remaining part of this
section, with the construction of a new bridge upstream to replace the
submergible deck. This will involve difficult cuts in rocky steep slopes.
24.      The section from 1Moneague to Crescent Park, situated a few miles
north of Bog Walk, would be a continuation of improvement works recently
carried out by the Ministry's own forces. It involves the widening and
relocation of a 4-mile section of the present narrow winding road. This
limited improvement work is part of a larger project prepared by the
Government, which includes a new road of about 11 miles further north from
Crescent Park to Mammee Bay. As existing roads cannot be improved to
adequate standards in this area, the design and the location of a new road
would be justified. However, its construction should be deferredi a few
years until a further growth of traffic can economically justify the high
costs.
B.   Design and Execution
25.      The design standards for the proposed Project will be similar to
the standards now used in Jamaica (see Table 4). They are generally
satisfactory, except for minimum right-of-way (or reservation) widths,
which will be increased as nearly as possible to the desirable widths
indicated in Table 4, for the reasons described in paragraph 16. Road
building materials are available at all Project locations, but some
technical difficulties will have to be overcome in the crossing of the
marsh section west of Kingston and the deep rock cuts in the Bog Walk gorge.
26.      Since the Project would involve nearly a doubling of the
Ministry's construction activity for the next few years, it has been
agreed that a firm of outside consultants will be employed to review the
existing designs, prepare specifications and final documents, and supervise
the construction. Also, the Ministry will establish an office, staffed
with about 9 full-time experts, to coordinate all aspects of the Project
during its execution. Construction will be carried out under unit price
contracts let on the basis of international competitive bidding. The work
will probably be contracted to foreign firms since there is no large local
road construction industry in Jamaica. An exception was proposed by the
Ministry on the short Moneague-Crescent Park section where the Government
intends to carry out the improvement with its own forces. This is
acceptable since the limited amount of work involved is too small for
international competitive bidding, and since it is desirable to employ the
availablelabor and construction equipment of the Ministry's Mechanical
Department and to continue to train engineers and technicians within the
Ministry. The consultants to be employed will provide the Ministry with
advisory service on the preparation of final designs for this small section,
including periodic field inspections of the works. On the two main road
sections, local labor will be used for such works which can be accomplished
without impairing the quality of the road. However, the technical and



geological conditions of these sections, together with the necessity for
constructing them in the shortest possible period to overcome the present
acute problem of traffic congestion, requires the substantial use of heavy
and specialized construction equipment.
27s      A total period of about four years has been estimated for the
completion of construction, which includes about 6 months to a year for
the completion of designs and biddings. In addition, the road will remain
under maintenance and guarantee by the contractors for a period of one
year, at the end of which the guarantees will be released.
C.   Cost Estimates
28.      The cost of the project is estimated as follows (for details see
Table 5):
US$ Equivalent
Kingston-Spanish Town                7,950,000
Spanish Town-Bog Walk                2,270,000
Moneague-Crescent Park                 780,000
Total                            11,000,000
The above cost estimate includes for each item the cost of right-of-way
(about 9%), construction, engineering and supervision and an additional
amount of about 20 percent for contingencies, of which about 10 percent
is for unforeseen quantities and 10 percent for possible price increases
during the Project's execution; this appears adequate. The estimates are
based on detailed quantities resulting from the final or preliminary
engineering done by the Ministry's engineers and on an analysis of unit
prices for similar works recently carried out by contractors or by the
Ministry in Jamaica. The cost of the individual works appears high,
especially for the 2-lane Bog Walk section; this is due to the difficult
condition of the terrain and the generally high prices prevailing in
Jamaica.
29.      The foreign exchange component of the Project has been estimated
on the basis of a detailed study of the required equipment and imported
materials. For the Kingston-Spanish Town and Spanish Town-Bog Walk sections,
the foreign component represents about 48 percent of the cost, without
engineering, for contracts carried out by foreign contractors. On the
Moneague-Crescent Park section, which is to be executed by force account,
the foreign component is about 38 percent. The foreign component of
engineering services by consultants will depend on the number of local
engineers which will be employed by the firm to be selected; taking into
account the Ministry's cost for staffing the coordination office, the
average foreign component for engineering services can be estimated at
about 60 percent.



-8-
D.   Financing
30.       In view of its other commitments, financing a substantial part
of the Project's cost will represent a large effort on the part of the
Government. The Bank loan will finance 50 percent of the Project's total
cost, which is slightly higher than the approximate 48 percent total
foreign exchange component.
31.       The fiscal year in Jamaica is from April 1 to March 31. Owing to
the need to engage consultants for the preparation of final design and
contract documents, the fiscal year 1965-66 would involve only small
expenditures. The schedule of financing can tentatively be established as
follows:
(in US$ million equivalent)
1965-66   1966-67   1967-68   1968-69   1969-70  Total
Total Expenditures       0.3       3.4       4.5       2.2       0.6    11.0
Loan Expenditures        C.15      1.7       2.25      1.1       0.3     5.5
32.       The Government has given assurances during loan negotiations that
it will give priority to the construction of the project roads and will
provide adequate local currency funds from its investment budget to carry
out the Project on schedule.
IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Introduction
33.       The essence of the economic justification for the Project is that
it will sharply reduce transport costs on some of the most heavily travelled
roads in Jamaica. The rates of return on the investments in the three road
sections range from 10 to 25 percent, which is clearly satisfactory.
34.       As previously mentioned, the Road Research Laboratory (RRL), an
agency of the U.K. Government, has carried out a survey of the roads of
Jamaica. The survey resulted in a great deal of information being available
on both traffic counts and estimates of vehicle operating costs. The
economic justification for the Project is based to a considerable extent
on this information.



B.   Future Traffic
35.       The economic benefits of the Project have been calculated over a
20 year period although the economic life of the Project roads will likely
exceed this period. It has been assumed that the traffic will increase by
about 10 percent annually in the first 10 years and 5 percent in the
second 10 years. The estimates of future traffic are presented in Table 6
for each road section. These estimates are somewhat more conservative
than those used in the calculations of the RRL, which assumed increases of
12 percent in the early part of the period and 10 percent later. The
traffic estimate is based on the following major considerations:
(a) The number of motor vehicles registered has increased by 15 per-
cent annually in the last 10 years; the increase has actually been scme-
what higher in the last 5 years (see Table 1).
(b) The Development Plan postulates an increase in national income
of 5 percent annually in 1963-68. Even if the actual rate of growth
should be lower, experience in recent years indicates that highway traffic
has been growing at about three times the growth in national income.
(c) Gasoline consumption in the last 10 years has increased 9 per-
cent annually and the consumption of diesel oil 14 percent.
(d) A comparison of traffic counts made on the Kingston-Spanish Town
road in 1960 and 1963 indicates an annual traffic growth of 11 percent.
This road accounts for about 70 percent of Project costs.
C.   The Individual Roads
36.       The Kingston-Spanish Town road is the most heavily travelled
highway in Jamaica. EL^gTt6on is Jamaica.s capital and Spanish Town is the
countryts third largest city. The Kingston area has a population of more
than 400,000, and its future expansion will be largely toward Spanish Town
because of mountains on the other sides. A proposed alternate locauion
for a new expressway to Spanish Town was discussed in Jamaica with local
authorities and the RRL team, but due to very high construction costs, its
economic justification was not sufficient to warrant further consideration.
At the hingston end, there are a large number of small industries adjoining
the road, as well as lumber yards, bottling and welding plants, etc.;
between the two cities the road is surrounded largely by fields of sugar
cane and to a lesser extent of bananas; in Spanish Town there are sugar,
cigarette, textile, dye and acid factories. The road is the main thorough-
fare from Kingston to the west and north of Jamaica. The existing road is
heavily congested, with an average daily traffic in 1963 of about 6,400
vehicles; on a large part of the road it was approaching 8,000. The
reduction in vehicle operating costs after opening of the new 4-lane road
is estimated at about 25 percent. This saving will bring a rate of return
of 25 percent on the investment during its estimated useful life of 20 years.

37.       The Spanish Town-Bog Walk road is a section of the main road
from Kingston to the north and on to Montego Bay. Its average daily traffic
was about 2,700 vehicles in 1963. The proposed improvement would reduce
vehicle operating costs by about 20 percent by permitting greater speeds, a
7 percent reduction in distance, and avoiding a lengthy detour when the
existing road is closed to traffic because of recurrent floods. The rate
of return on the investment would be about 18 percent.
38.       The Moneague-Crescent Park road had an average daily traffic in
1963 of about 850 vehicles.  Even though the distance from Moneague to St.
Ann's Bay and on to Montego Bay is somewhat shorter via Crescent Park, a
large part of the traffic uses the road via Ocho Rios because of the poor
condition of the Moneague-Crescent Park-St. Ann's Bay road. However, the
road via Ocho Rios is also deteriorating; a stretch of it is very narrow in
the bottom of a gorge, subject to flooding and cannot be widened. Govern-
ment officials fear that it may become necessary to close the road to
truck traffic.  It is estimated that perhaps 10 percent of its traffic, or
about 80 vehicles, will divert to the Moneague-Crescent Park road after it
is improved. The benefits from the improvement will bring a rate of return
on the investment of about 10 percent.
39.       The above calculations are based on conservative assumptions.   In
addition, they do not take into account such benefits as savings in non-
working time, reduced accidents, and greater comfort and convenience. Even
the lowest of the estimated returns - 10 percent - would appear to be
satisfactory in Jamaica.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECNI'iENDATIONS
40.       The Project will greatly improve the conditions for road trans-
port on some of the most important highways of Jamaica. It is well planned,
technically sound and will yield a good economic return on the investment
from lower transport costs alone. The Jamaican Ministry of Communications
and Works is well able to execute the Project, with the assistance of
consultants.
41.       The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.5
million equivalent to the Government of Jamaica for a term of 25 years,
including a 5-year period of grace.

NOTES: The above design standards apply to two-lane national roads, and to
each of the two-lane carriage ways of four-lane sections.
The design of pavement is generally based on CBR tests. According
to the traffic requirements it includes a subgrade of selected fill,
a base of marly limestone, generally 6" thick, a bituminous binder
(or water macadam) of 2" to 3", and an asphalt concrete carpet of
li". The design and thickness of the base and pavement for the
Project will be determined on the basis of site investigations and
traffic requirements. The surfacing will be asphalt concrete carpet
of 11"' to 2" in thickness.
It has been agreed that reservation wi.dths for the Project roads
will, as nearly as possible, be the optimum wTidths indicated above.
