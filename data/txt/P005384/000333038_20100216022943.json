The project will do this by financing farm\n            investments through CNCA during the period September 1979 to\n            August 1982, including: (A) investments by small farmers\n            with incomes below 1.6 times the absolute rural poverty\n            level; (B) investments by Agrarian Reform Cooperative and\n            Farmers' Associations; (C) investments by medium and\n            large farmer clients; and (D) agro-industry investments.\n            CNCA's monitoring and evaluation system would also be\n            strengthened. About 40 percent of beneficiaries are expected\n            to be small farmers whose present income falls beneath the\n            absolute rural poverty level. The major project risk is that\n            of abnormally adverse weather conditions which will reduce\n            crop yields and the project's rate of return."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
