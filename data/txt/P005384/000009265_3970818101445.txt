FOURTH AGRICWLTURAL CREDIr PROJECT
DOAN 1704-M0R
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCa) for the Fourth
Agricultural Credit Project for which Loan 1704-NOR was approved in May 1979
for the sum of USt70  million. The Project was cofinanced by KFW
(USS50 million) and IFAD (USt25 million). The loan was closed with an eight
month delay due in part to the 1980-81 drought which curtailed investment and
credit recovery and the fast appreciation of the US dollar which slowed down
loan disbursements vis-b-vis C(CA disbursements.
This PCR was prepared by the EXENA Projects Department,
Agriculture II Division in June 1984. The PCR was prepared on the basis of
information available in the Department and made available by Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole of Morocco. The main sources of information were:
Appraisal Report No 2426 MOR dated April 30, 1979, Supervision reports,
correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda as contained in
the EMENA Information Center. The PCR was received by OED on June 11, 1984.
The PCR was not selected for audit by OED.
The draft completion report was sent to the Borrower and cofinanciers
for comments on September 4, 1984. Comments which were received have been
taken into account in the report and are reproduced as Appendices 1 and 2.

FOURTH AGRI CULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT IOAN 1704 14OR
PROJECT COMPlETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project objectives were to finance:
e           (a)  livestock and irrigation and agricultural equipment for small farmers;
(b) mechanization for Agrarian Reform Cooperatives;
(c) mechanization, irrigation equipment and land improvement for medium
and large farmers;
(d) agroindustry mainly for oil processing, flour milling, milk
pasteurization; and
Ce) a computerized monitoring and evaluation system.
2.       The Bank Agricultural Sector Strategy in Morocco emphasizes faster
growth in rainfed areas and increased operational efficiency and financial
self-sufficiency of agricultural activities within large irrigation schemes.
It also supports structural adjustment policies to broaden the impact of
sectoral investment and lending and institution building with special
attention to medium term planning and Project preparation.
3.       The Pro.ect achieved its main objectives to finance subsistence
production at the small farmer level and to increase coummercial crop
production. It was less successful in financing agrarian reform cooperatives
because of lack of credit worthiness of most cooperatives and a review of
agrarian reform policy by the Government which held up investm2nt. It also
fell short in reaching its objectives in agroindustrial investment as a
consequence of the 1980-82 economic recession and lack of appropriate
promotion. These two components,however, involved only 19Z of Project
financing and absorbed about 8% of Project's funds.  The impact of their
partial lack of success was marginal with regard to the Project's main
objective. Project investment costs were in line with SAR estimates although
the cost distribution percentages differed to some extent. Efforts to
establish an efficient monitoring and evaluation system did not meet with
success and eventuall, a similar but revised component had to be included
under the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project (FY84).



- iv -
4.       CNCA financial performance was fully satisfactory during Project
implementation. From 1979 to 1983 its assets more than doubled with the
largest increase taking place in the medium and long-term portfolio on account
of increased loans to small farmers. CRCA. operating income increased more
rapidly than total assets and long-term borrowings, indicating an increase in
the average return on portfolio. CNCA loan recoveries during Project
implementation were generally good and interest rates were raised to maintain
positive levels.
5.       On the institutional side, CNCA has substantially strengthened its
credit distribution and saving collection network. Management and staff
salaries were increased. Audit and Procurement requirements complied with.
6.       The Project financed about 350,000 farmers and substantially
increased their income and created a large number of rural jobs. Economic and
financial benefits were in line with appraisal estimates.
7.       The Project success was primarily due to excellent performance by
CNCA staff and continuous Government support and assistance. The major
lessons learnt are that:
(a) a more careful design might have avoided overlapping of Bank
resources for the same purpose; (para. 3.08 and 5.03a) and
(b) a more realistic assessment at appraisal of the monitoring and
evaluation needs should have been made (para. 3.23 and 5.03b).
In all, there has been a highly satisfactory improvement in the agricultural
credit system in Morocco since the First Credit Project (Loan 433-MOR) in 1966.

PROJECT COOPLETION REPORT
FOURTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT - LOAN 1704-MOR
I. INTRODUCTION
<
Background
1.01     The Bank's agricultural sector strategy in Morocco emphasizes faster
agricultural growth in the rainfed areas, where a large untapped potential
exists and most of the rural poor live, by supporting production and market
oriented programs and introducing technological innovation in key fanming
systems such as cereal/livestock production systems. The strategy is also
aimed at increasing operational efficiency and financial self-sufficiency of
existing large irrigation schemes, to increase productivity and reduce sector
financing dependency on Government's budget resources.
1.02     The Bank also supports structural adjustment policies to broaden the
impact of lending and investment in the sector. Specifically, it supports
rationalization of price incentives of marketing and inputs supply policies
and land policies aimed at increasing land use and productivity. At the
institutional level, the strategy is aimed at strengthening medium term
planning and project preparation facilities.
1.03     To date Bank group lending in Morocco has financed 65 projects with
an amount equivalent to about US$2.5 billion. Lending for agriculture has
been provided under 18 projects, totalling about US$615 million. Four of
these projects were for agricultural credit aimed at providing funds for
on-farm investment and at strengthening the Moroccan Agricultural Bank's
(CNCA) 1/.
Bank Financed Agricultural Credit Projects
1.04     Since 1966 the Bank financed, through agricultural credit, aggregate
investments of about USl.l billion, gradually extending funds to most
sub-sectoral activities. The first and second projects (Loan 433-MOR, and
Loan 861-MOR, Credit 338-MOR) financed mechanization and modernization of
medium and large farms resulting in a maximum short-term production impact in
an effort to meet urgent domestic food requirements. Part of the Third
Project (Loan 1361-MOR) was directed to meet rural smallholder needs by
financing improved subsistence production. The Fourth Agriculture Credit
1/ The Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) is the principal
institutional source (70%) of credit to agriculture.

Project enlarged the project scope to include small and medium scale, rurally
based agroindustries to promote processing and exports. All four projects had
a strong institutional impact by strengthening CNCA's capital structure and
its lending appraisal and procedures, improving loan collection performance
and transforming it in an efficient credit institution. A summary performance
evaluation of the results of the first three projects is included in the PPAR
of the Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1361-MOR) 1/ as well as in the
SAR of the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-NOR) and Fifth
Agricultural Credit Project Loan (Loan 2367-MOR).
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project appraisal negotiations and effectiveness.
2.01     The identification and preparation of the Fourth Agricultural Credit
Project were undertaken in 1978 by CNCA with Bank assistance. The project was
appraised in November 1978, negotiated in April 1979, and presented to the
Board and signed in May 1979. The project was cofinanced by KfW and IFAD with
a total additional amount equivalent to US$75 million. It became effective on
December 5, 1979. The delay of four months in declaring the loan effective
was due to extended legal negotiations (para 3.01).
Project Design and Objectives
2.02     The project covered 90% of CNCA's mediumr and long-term lending
program over a three year period 1980-83 and consisted of financing:
(a) small farmers - Part A (47%): including livestock, plantations,
draft animals, wells and pumps, land improvements and small
implements,;
(b) agrarian reform cooperatives and precooperative associations - Part B
T10%) including farm mechanization, transport equipment, tractors,
harvesters and industrial crop farming in general;
(c) medium and large farmers - Part C (33%) including livestock,
tractors, combine harvesters, forage, irrigation equipment and land
improvement;
(d) agroindustry - Part D (9%) labor intensive, small and medium scale
industries such as olive oil processing, flour milling, milk
pasteurization, animal feed and meat processing plants; and
(e) monitoring and evaluation - Part E (1%) including vehicles,
equipment, computer consulting services.

-3-
2.03     Although the project's fundamental objectives, aimed at increasing
production, were similar to those of the three previous credit projects, the
Fourth project placed more emphasis on small farmer financing either directly
or through agrarian reform cooperatives (57Z). It also included, for the
first time, an agroindustrial component, to increase farmers' profitability
through value added.
2.04     Another important feature was the provision of an improved Monitoring
and Evaluation system (M&E) to assess the impact of CNCA lending on
production, input use, employment, and farmers income.
f
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Execution
3.01     Loan effectiveness was delayed by about four months due to extended
negotiations and procedural lags in ratifying the loan document.
3.02     The project was successful in meeting its main objective of
increasing production through financing production investments on individual
farms. It was less successful in promoting agrarian reform cooperatives and
agroindustries and in helping to establish an efficient M&E system in CNCA
(paras 3.07 - 3.09).
3.03     The loan was closed on August 31, L983 with an eight month delay.
This was in part due to the delays of effectivness. However, two other major
reasons were the severe 1980-81 drought which curtailed investment and credit
recovery and the fast appreciation of the US$ which slowed down loan
disbursements compared with CNCA's own disbursements. On September 1981 the
cofinanc:ers (IBRD, KfW, and IFAD) helped ease CNCA's liquidity constraints by
increasing their respective disbursement percentages.
Project Costs
3.04     Investment costs were in line with appraisal estimates, although the
cost distribution percentages by category of subborrowers (Annex 1) and
investments financed (Annex 2) differed substantially in some cases.
*        3.05     The inv-stment pattern over the three and a half years of project
implementation shows that the project's main objectives (a) to finance
subsistence production at the small farmers level and (b) to increase
commercial crop production were fully met. Small farmer financing amounted to
about 57% of the total project costs or 118% of SAR estimates. Medium and
large farmers financing (35%) was about the same as projected at appraisal
(33%).
3.06     The project fell far short of meeting SAR targets with respect to
financing agrarian reform cooperatives (49% of SAR estimates) and
agroindustries (32% of estimates).



- 4 -
3.07     The shortfall in agricultural reform cooperative financing occurred
(a) because some of the existing cooperatives were in arrears with payments
and hence were not eligible for additional borrowing and (b) because of MARA's
1980 decision to suspend establishment of new cooperatives pending a full
review of Government's policy vis-&-vis the Agrarian Reform Sector. Serious
managerial and financial problems had emerged in the land reform sector. With
the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the targets set at appraisal were
too ambitious.
3.08     Reduced CNCA lending to agrGindustry was in part a consequence of the
1980-82 economic recession. In addition, there was: (a) tough competition
from other financial sources; and (b) lack of sufficient promotional efforts
by CNCA. At the time of appraising the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project, a
Small Scale Industry Project (SSI - Loan 1687-MOR), including a significant
percentage (17%) of funds for food processing, was approved by the Bank. The
SSI project had more favorable terms, easier procurement requirements and
simpler appraisal procedures. It was fully committed well ahead of time. A
decisive factor of the rapid uptake was the effective promotion by the
National Development Bank (BNDE) and Commercial Banks. Eventually funds from
Category 2 (Agrarian Reform Coop) and Category 4 (Agroindustry) and Category 5
(Monitoring and Evaluation) under the Fourth Agriculture Credit Project were
reallocated to finance individual farmers.
3.09     Efforts to establish an efficient M&E system were discontinued in
October 1980 by CNCA's new general manager on the grounds that the proposed
system was too cumbersome and ill-suited to CNCA's management needs. The Bank
agreed and eventually recruited a cnnsultant, who visited CNCA in June 1982,
and proposed the main lines of a revised system. A revised component
established by the unit set up for this purpose within the Directorate-General
of the CNCA was included in the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project (FY84).
3.10     The distribution by investment categories (Annex 2) was similar to
appraisal estimates with the e-'eption of draft animals, citrus plantations
and agroindustry. High investments in draft animals were due to the 1981
drought which had caused the death of a large number of animals and to
rainfails in 1981-82 which raised demand substantially.
3.11     Investments in citrus plantations, estimated at appraisal to permit
establishment of 1,500 ha to 2,000 ha per year, reached only 20% of estimates,
a consequence of sharply declining exports to the EEC. This could have been
foreseen at appraisal because overproduction of citrus products in the EEC,
and associated countries, was a well-known fact.
3.12     In conclusion, more careful coordination within the Government and
the Bank, more exhaustive preparation of the project by CNCA and a more
critical appraisal by the Bank, could have led to better design of the
agroindustrial component, to more realistic fund allocations for agrarian
reform cooperatives, and to a more serviceable monitoring and evaluation
component. CNCA has now devised a new strategy under the Fifth Agricultural
Credit Project to promote agroindustrial lending. This strategy is based on:
(a) promotional campaigns; (b) technical assistance to entrepreneurs;
(c) cooperation with other main institutions financing agroindustry; and
(d) decentralization of lending activities. A more systematic assesment of
land tenure issues has been initiated in connection with a proposed land
cadastre operation. Finally, a streamlined monitoring system suited to CNCA
management needs has been designed.

Disbursements
3.13     Final disbursement took place August 28, 1983.  The Loan was closed
on August 31, 1983 with an eight month delay on the original closing date of
12/31/82. Up to the original closing date, CNCA medium term mending had been
less (68%) than estimated due to: (a) inflated base year lending estimates;
(b) lower than expected CNCA medium term lending growth due to the general
economic recession in 1980-82; (c) drought affecting Morocco in 1980-81, which
induced farmers to curtail investment; (d) appreciation of the US dollar; and
(e) lower than expected agrarian reform cooperatives established by the
Government and inadequate institutional efforts by CNCA to promote
agroindustrial investment. Reallocation of funds from cooperative on-farm
investment (Category 2) and agroindustries (Category 4) to individual farmers
on-farm investment (Categories 1 and 3) brought about a sharp increase in
disbursements during the last eight months of the project (Figure 1).
Financial Performance
3.14     CNCA's financial performance (Annex 3) continued to be satisfactory
during the implementation of the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project while its
role as the principal financial institution to provide development funds to
the sector was greatly expanded. From 1979 to 1983, CNCA total assets more
than doubled in current terms and increased about 50% in 1979 Dirhams. The
largest increase was in the medium and long term portfolio that grew from
DH 487 million to DH 1,919 million, especially on account of CLCA's 11 loans
to small farmers which experienced an average increase of 27% p.a.
3.15     This impressive growth was initially financed by a rapid increase in
long term liabilities, especially borrowings, which grew at an average of 18l
p.a. The bulk (90) of long term borrowing was from external sources with the
Bank covering about 50% of total. As a result of larger borrowings the long
term debt to equity ratio increased from 1.3 to 3.5, though remaining within
the limits (4:1) established in the Loan Agreement (Sect. 6.08).
3.16     Short term portfolio increases were financed partly by higher than
expected deposit mobilization. The bulk of short-term financial resources,
however, was provided by increased rediscounting facilities with the Central
Bank and by commercial banks, which, in July 1981, were instructed to invest
3.5% of their deposits in CNCA one year debentures, bearing a 3% interest
rate. CNCA total debt to equity ratio increased over the project period from
3.5 to 7.7, remaining well within the standards set for development banks.
3.17     CNCA's total operating income increased at an average annual rate of
34.9Z, noticeably more rapidly than total assets (20.3%) and long term
borrowings (18%) indicating an increase.in the average return on the
portfolio. In 1982-83 financial expenditures represented 55.9% of total
expenditures, slightly higher than at project inception (51.9%) indicating a
higher cost of resources and relative improvement in staff productivity. The
average cost of borrowed resources was 5.6% while the average cost of total
resources 4.7%. Both slightly higher than in 1979.

3.18     Net profits during the project period increased from DR 3.1 million
to DEH 51.2 million resulting in an increase of return on equity, from 1X to
about 1OZ, much higher than projected at appraisal.
3.19     CNCA loan recoveries during the project implementation period were
generally good. However, there was a decline in recovery performance in
1981/82 due to the 1980181 drought with repayments amounting to DR 458 million
being deferred by one year. Overall recovery rates averaging over 80Z are
among the best for agricultural credit institutions in developing countries.
Overall CNCA capital structure and financial standing vere kept at an adequate
level during this period in spite of rapid lending expansion. Financial
revenue would have been improved earlier with more frequent adjustments in
interest rates during project implementation. This would also have prevented
the slippage of the debt: equity and current ratios. Interest rates on loans
were eventually raised in October 1980 which brought a gradual improvement of
CNCA's profitability and again on September 1, 1983 as a condition of
negotiation for the Fifth Credit Project. They presently range from 7Z to llZ
on short term credit and from 11% to 13Z for agroindustry and medium and long
term credit. They were at best only marginally positive in real terms during
the project period when inflation averaged 10.3%.  However, following the
September 1, 1983 raise, they are now positive against a projected inflation
of 9% in 1983-84.
Institutional Development
3.20     Since appraisal, CNCA has substantially strengthened its credit
distribution and savings collection network. At CNCA headquarters, a
department was created to coordinate regional local offices. At the regional
level, six regional inspectorates, the function of provincial coordinator
(given to directors of regional offices in provincial capitals and major urban
centers) were created and seasonal offices (antennae of the CLCAs) were
opened. Moreover, seven new CRCAs 1/ regional agencies, four more CLCAs
b-ranch offices have been established and six deposit branches opened in major
urban centers. CNCA has also established a new agroindustrial department
unit, a new training department and has decentralized lending responsibilities
and simplified lending procedures.
3.21     Staff has been increased by about 20% and salaries to lower staff
were raised to adequate levels in accordance with Loan Agreement requirements
(Sect. 5.04). Management salaries were also increased but are still not quite
competitive with those of similar financial institutions in Morocco. New CNCA
statutes, under preparation, would permit the adoption of a fully competitive
management compensation system.
3.22     Audit requirements (Sect. 6.02) were complied with although, for a
period, the audit reports did not include separate opinions on statements
submitted for IBRD disbursements. On average, audit reports of adequate
standards were submitted with only brief delays.
3.23     Like under the Third Agricultural Credit Project, funds earmarked for
the establishment of a CNCA M&E (Sect. 5.05) were not used. Changes in CNCA
top management in 1980 led to suspension of M&E operations until the end of
1982. The temporary suspension of the M&E system deprived CNCA of valuable
information on the performance of credit operations and the adequacy of credit

norms and procedures. The Bank recognized that the proposed MNU system as
originally envisaged was overly ambitious in its objectives and rather
cumbersome to operate, and agreed to set up a system more directly useful to
the management of CNCA's credit operations. The new MUE system is being set
up under the Fifth line of credit (Loan 2367-MOR). A sectorwide ME system is
also presently being set up in the Ministry of Agriculture.
3.24     Procurement requirements (Schedule 5) were generally complied with.
CNCA project reporting, though often late, (4-6 months) was generally in line
with Bank requirements.
IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
4.01     In order to conform, as far as possible, with the methodology adopted
at appraisal, the same assumptions were applied to the SAR models, in
reevaluating ERRs.
4.02     Economic prices for tradable outputs and inputs were derived from
the World Bank's commodity price projections adjusted for transport, handling
and processing. Non-tradable outputs and inputs, such as labor and draft
animals, were valued at their current market price adjusted by appropriate
conversion factors. The project evaluation period, as in the SAR, was 10
years.
4.03     ERR calculations for the nine models reviewed, range between 10% for
investments in large farm tractors to 55% for dairy farms with three pure bred
cows and are in line with appraisal estimates (10% through 75%). FRRs range
from 8% through 21% and are also close to SAR estimates (9% through 27Z).
4.05     Mechanization and livestock ERRs were lower than FRRs because of
Government subsidies on meat and milk prices and equipment. Investments in
irrigation equipment yielded ERRs higher than FRRs due to price distortions
against agriculture. The agricultural investment study being currently
carried out by the Government will analyze price distortions and is expected
to provide relevant policy recommendations to the Government.
4.06     The project financed about 350,000 farmers and substantially
increased their income, especially for small farmers. It also created a large
number of rural jobs and increased laborers' salaries.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project achieved its main objectives.  Bank supervision missions
helped substantially to improve CNCA's institutional standards. Their
continued review and recommendations on lending policies and conditions,
capitalization, auditing, staffing, training, salary adjustments were a major
factor contributing to substantial institutional improvement and betterment of
CtCA's financial situation. The Bank's continuous intervention with
Government authorities in regard to CNCA's financial and administrative
problems helped the institution considerably to mobilize and keep sufficient
funds for maintaining minimal levels of investment and, hence, growth in tne
sector, while the country was struggling to overcome a major financial crisis.



- 8 -
5.02     Government policies, support and assistance were determinant factors
of project success. This is especially true for the strong government backing
of CNCA's efforts to enforce good financial discipline and achieve high levels
of loan recovery. They had a beneficiary impact on the efficiency of credit
especially at the small farmer level. Government's decision to leave CNCA a
large degree of independence and authority in making credit and management
decisions was also an important factor for project success.
5.03     The major lessons learnt were the following:
(a) More careful and coordinated review at appraisal of other Bank
projects would have avoided overlapping of Bank resources for
practically the same purpose, that is financing of agroindustry
(para. 3.08); and
(b) Monitoring and evaluation components are highly susceptible to
managerial changes. In this case, a more realistic assessment of the
difficulties of structuring a monitoring and evaluation system
(para. 3.23) could have suggested the setting-up of a less
comprehensive and ambitious system from the outset.

Subject:  Project Completion Report:
Morocco - Fourth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-MOR)
Dear Sir:
In response to your letter of September 4 asking me for comments on
the first version of this report, I am pleased to offer the following
observations, basically involving details only:                -
-    Page 1, paragraph 1.04, line 5:
For "Loan 961-MOR" substitut- "Loan 861-MOR."
-    Page 2, paragraph 2.02(a), l-.e 3:
Omit "fruits, vegetables, cereals and pulses."
-    Page 6, paragraph 3.16, line 5:
Replace "to invest 3.5Z of their portfolio" with "to invest 3.5Z of
their deposits."
-    Page 6, paragraph 3.19, lines 17 and 18:
For "8Z to lOZ for short-term credit and from 111 to 13Z for
agroindustry and medium-term credit" read "7Z to 11% for short-term credit and
... for medium and long-term credit."



APP-ENDI 2
Page 2
-    Page 7. paragraph 3.20:
Reference should also be made to the establishment at headquarters
of a department to coordinate the activities of local offices, and at the
regional level of six regional inspectorates. of the function of provincial
coordinator (given to directors of regional offices in provincial capitals and
prefectures), and of seasonal offices (antennae of the CLCA).
-    Page 4. paragraph 3.09. lines 6 and 7:
It is proposed that the text should read "... in June 1982 and
defined the main lines of a revised ,ystem. A revised component established
by the unit set up for this purpos-e within the Directorate-General of the CNCA
was included in the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project (FY84)."
Yours, etc.

Your Project Completion Report: Morocco Fourth
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-MOR)
Dear Mr. Watanabe,
thank you very much for inviting our comments on your project
completion report of the above mentioned project which was co-
financed by KfW.
The  only  comments  we  have  to  make  concern  the  delays  of
effectiveness. Having gone through our files we do not find any
indication for "extended negotiations or procedural lags in rati-
fying the loan document" as indicated in your para 3.01. On the
contrary, negotiations, signing of the loan agreement and com-
pletion of legal procedures were comparatively quick. The delays
of effectiveness of your loan were actually caused by the fact
that KfW was approached for co-financing only after the World
Bank appraisal had reached a rather advanced stage. Therefore, we
propose to change para 3.01 as follows, "Loan effectiveness was
delayed by about four months owing to the fact that.need of funds
was greater than expected, which in turn necessitated the finding
of co-financiers (KfW and IFAD) at rather an advanced stage of
appraisal".

Referring to para 3.03 we should like to emphasize that we do not
see any connection between the closing date of the loan and the
delays of effectiveness,  as all co-financiers  (IBRD,  KfW and
IFAD) had agreed to retroactive financing from 1 September 1979
onwards. The only effect could have been increased disbursements
after effectiveness, to keep up with CNCA's lending from
1 September 1979 until effectiveness.
We hope that you agree with our comments and are looking forward
to receivino a final copy of the report in due course.
Yours faithfully,
