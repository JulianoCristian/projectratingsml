The project\n            was successful in meeting its main objective of increasing\n            production through financing production investments on\n            individual farms. It was less successful in promoting\n            agrarian reform cooperatives and agro industries and in\n            helping to establish an efficient monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system in National Agricultural Credit Bank\n            (CNCA). The loan was closed on August 31, 1983 with an eight\n            month delay. This was in part due to the delays of\n            effectiveness. However, two other major reasons were the\n            severe 1980-81 drought which curtailed investment and credit\n            recovery and the fast appreciation of the US$ which slowed\n            down loan disbursements compared with CNCA's own disbursements."}, "docdt": "1984-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
