The project achieved many of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development has been\n            substantial, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, a\n            ministry with vested interests in a public enterprise should\n            not be in charge of the divestiture of the enterprise.\n            Second, it is essential to assess the feasibility of social\n            equity and universal coverage objectives during the design\n            of post and telecommunications sector reform projects.\n            Third, the best way to improve telecommunications service\n            quality, coverage, and regulation is to open the sector to\n            competition and not protect the incumbent company, whether\n            public or private. Finally, if it is necessary to grant some\n            exclusive rights, such rights should be precisely defined\n            and granted for a limited period of time."}, "docdt": "1996-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
