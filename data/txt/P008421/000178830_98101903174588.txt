REPORT AID RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE IJELLEEC STATE
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommcndation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$13.8 million to
the Hellenic State.
PART I. HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the third lending operation by the
Bank in Greece, the National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.k..
(NIBID) being the recipient of the first two loans.   In April 1969 a
UNESCO/FAO mission visited Greece to assist the Government in preparing a
loan request for an education project for submission to the Bank.   The
project was appraised in August 1969.   The findings of the appraisal missico.
resulted in some modifications of the project content which were worked out
by the Greek authorities in the following months.   During this period furtl-h,
discussions took place between the Government and the Bank on the substanre
of a law required for the establishment of the project.   This law became
effective on September 21, 1970.   Negotiations took place in Thashington
from September 21 to 28, 1970.   Dr. Haralampos Georgiopoulos, President ot'
the State Legal Council, and Messrs.Petros Papadakis and H. Dailianas of
the Ministry of Coordination represented the Borrower.
3.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Greece as
at September 30, 1970:

4.        Progress under the two loans to NIBID has been satisfactory.
An irrigation project and a road maintenance project are under consid-
eration for Bank financing.
5.        IFC has so far made five investments in Greece totalling about
$15 million, including an equity investment in NIBID made in 1965 at a
cost of about $700,000.  Other loan and equity investments have been mad-e
in a fertilizer plant ($600,000), two cement companies ($5 million), and
in FY 1970, Aluminium de Grece ($8.6 million). IFC's interest in the
fertilizer company was sold earlier this year to the Hellenic Industrial
Development Bank (ETVA).
6.             PART II.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
Borrower:                         The Hellenic State.
Amount:                           Various currencies equivalent to $13.8
million.
Purpose:                          To finance the foreign exchange costs ef'
the construction and equipment of five
Higher Technical Education Centers ant
associated technical assistance.
Amortization:                     In 20 years, including a five-year per±Lo
of grace, through semi-annual install-
ments beginning February 1, 1976 and
ending August 1, 1990.
Interest Rate:                    7-1/4 per cent.
Commitment Charge:                3/4 of 1 per cent.
PART III. THE PROJECT
7.        A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Greece"
(PE-13a, dated October 20, 1970) is attached.
8.        A significantly increased supply of properly trained technical
manpower will be necessary to attain the main objectives of the Greek
Economic Development Plan for 1966-72 which are to increase productivity
through modernization and re-structuring of the economy, thereby
improving competitiveness especially in industry and agriculture.



9.        Although the education system in Greece has many positive
features such as high enrollment ratios at all age levels, ample numbers
of qualified candidates for the next higher levels of education, and
academically qualified teachers at all levels, the primary orientation
of the system on preserving the nation's cultural heritage has resulted
in an over-emphasis on academic education.   Enrollment in the academic
secondary schools and universities has increased disproportionately during
the past 10 years in comparison with those in technical education.    A few
private technical schoo'ls, poorly staffed and equipped, have attempted to
fill the gap created by insufficiently financed public education, but have
been wholly inadequate to meet the manpower requirements of the expanding
and changing economy.   The post-secondary level of technical education
has consequently become a critical bottleneck, seriously restricting the
number and quality of sub-professional personnel.
10.       The proposed project consists of the construction and equipment
of Five Higher Technical Education Centers, and of provision for related
technical assistance.   The Centers would be the first stage in a long-
term program conceived by the Greek Government to make its education system
a more effective instrument for economic development.    The Project would
introduce into Greece the multi-discipline, post-secondary institution which
combines the requirements for instruction in a variety of study programs,
and thereby achieves economies of scale and more efficient use of specialized
teachers, equipment and facilities.    The Centers would be located at Athens,
Patras, Salonika, Larissa and Iraklion, which are the major cities of the
different regions of the country.    They will produce trained personnel
capable of performing sub-professional duties in a wide variety of
occupations in agriculture, business, engineering, food processing and health.
The number of departments corresponding to these fields which would be
established in each Center, and the variety of specialized options to be
offered within each department, take into account the specific regional and
national requirements.   The Centers will have a combined enrollment of
6,660 students and about 2,350 technicians will graduate annually.
11.       Because administrative or teaching experience in the proposed
type of institution is almost non-existent in Greece, the project would
provide for a team of specialists in administration and teacher training
for guidance to the Centers during their initial years, and for training
in similar institutions abroad of a number of the future teaching and
administrative staff.   Moreover, the range of specialized programs and
the number of enrollments have been determined in such a way as to ensure
that the progress of each Center during its initial years would not
exceed manageable limits.   Consequently, in many fields, the combined
output from the Centers will be well below the total required by the economy.
Subsequent stages of the Governmenttl long term program will progressively
increase the output.



12.       The law establishing the new Centers prescribes their object-
ives, staffing, administration, terms and conditions of staff appointment.
curricula, entrance requirements and status of graduates. It includes
provisions for the establishment of a Higher Technical Education Adviso y;
Council and a Regional Advisory Council for each Center, with broad
representation of non-governmental organizations and associations. The
Regional Advisory Councils can appoint curriculum committees to advise nor
the content of each course and program, taking into account the qualific:-
ations expected from students after graduation. The law provides a
satisfactory basis for developing this new form of institution.
13.       A Project Implementation Unit will be established within the
Ministry of Education to provide overall supervision of the project.  The
buildings will be designed and construction supervised by consultant
architects. Contracts for civil wcrks and for furniture and equipment
supply will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's guidelines on inter-
national competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers of furniture and
instructional equipment would be accorded a margin of preference for
purposes of bid comparison which would be the existing rate of customs
duty applicable to competing imports or 15 per cent of c.i.f. cost,
whichever is the lower.
14.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $24.0 million and
to be completed within four years. The proposed loan of '213.8 million
would cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of tlie prcject.
PART IV.  LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Hellenic StaL&e>
the Report of the Committee provided for in A-r-icle I-l,,   Section 4(iii)
ef the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Res-ut-io.r a-iproviTg the
proposed loan are being distributed separately to the Execuuive Directors.
The draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern of other Bank agree-
ments for education projects.
PART V. THE ECONOMY
16.       An eccnomic memorandum "Current Economic Position and Prospects.
of Greece" (EMA-21a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 20, 1970. A basic data sheet is attached.
17.       The economy of Greece has continued its vigorous expansion
which had started in 1968, following a period of slow grmoth during 1966
and 1967. GNP at constant prices increased by more than 8 per cent in
1969, and is expected to rise at a similar rate in the current year.
Industrial production rose by 11 per cent in 1969 and at a similar rate
during the first half of 1970. The growth in production was stimulated
by a rapid expansion of investment and exports which in 1969 increasc-d
by 18 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. During the first half of



1970, exports were 24 per cent higher than in the same period of 1969.
Prices remained relatively stable and despite fast-growing imports
external reserves continued to stay at a comfortable level.
18.       While the overall picture is encouraging there are some areas,
especially in the public sector, where structural reforms are needed to
carry the momentum of economic growth into the future. Public savings
have been less than satisfactory and considerable difficulties have beeZ;
encountered by the authorities in preparing and implementing a balanced
public investment program. The Government is aware of these problems
and recent efforts to increase public savings and to complete ongoing
investment projects have met with some measure of success. Some progress
has also been made in rationalizing agricultural policies.
19.       Public borrowing abroad has been heavy in recent years, and the.
external public debt has risen from $500 million at the end of 1966 to
about $800 million at the end of 1969. Since the terms of external
borrowing have deteriorated during this period, partly as a result of
reduced access to new loans on favorable terms from official sources,
service payments have risen rapidly. However, with fast rising foreign
exchange earnings the debt burden has remained manageable, and the debt
service ratio did not exceed 7 per cent in 1969. Taking into account
the external financing required by the public sector over the next few
years, this ratio could rise to about 12-15 per cent, depending on hoA
successful the Government is in regaining access to long-term external
capital. Considering the favorable prospects for further economic
growth, Greece appears creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART VI. C014PLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEmENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII. RECOP1DDIDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
