APPRAISAL OF THE 1970-71 INVESTMENT PROGRAM
OF THE ELECTRIC PWER SECTOR
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the 1970-71 investment pro-
gram and financial position of the Comision Federal de Eiectricidad
(CFE) and Compania de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (Centro), the two principal
entities that comprise the public Power Sector of Mexico.  A Bank loan
for US$125 million is proposed to help finance the foreign exchange costs
of generation, transmission and distribution facilities to be installed
during 1970 and 1971 as part of the sector's continuing development
program. The estimated construction expenditures in the two-year period
total US$491 million equivalent.
ii.       The proposed loan would be the third to the whole Power Sector.
It would assist the sector in the financing of its continuing expansion
program required to meet Mexico's power demand which is growing at an
average rate of 11% per year. The previous sector loans (436-ME and 544-ME)
were made in 1965 and 1968 for US$110 million and US$90 million, respectively;
the second one was largely disbursed by early 1970 except for the part
allocated to specific major generating equipment. Altogether, the Bank
has made nine loans for power in 1Mexico for a total of US$455 million.
iii.      The Borrower would be CFE as the entity responsible for the
planning and fiscal control of the power Sector. Nacional Financiera S.A.
(NAFINSA) would be the co-borrower, as in the previous sector loans.
Under a subsidiary agreement, CFE would make available funds required
for the expenditures of Centro from the Bank loan. Ultimately, Centro,
86% of whose stock is owned by CFE, should be merged with CFE. During the
last years some formal progress towards this goal was achieved, but
actual coordination of planning and operations of CFE and Centro was not
satisfactory. However, prospects for better coordination and a full merger
greatly improved when in January 1970 the Director General of CFE was
also appointed President of Centro.
iv.       Of the estimated US$491 million cost of the 1970-71 investment
program, the external financing is expected to total US$280 million;
US$147 million would come from the Bank (US$125 million from the proposed
loan and US$22 million from Loan 544-ME), US$76 million would come from
supplying countries (US$14 million as joint loans to loan 5424-ME, US$43
million as joint loans to the proposed Bank loan and US$19 million as
supplierst credits), and US$57 million from external bond issues. A
general agreement on joint financing is being worked out on the basis of
a 50-50 participation of thle Bank ar.d joint lenders.  Tne external bond



- ii -
issues, however, still have to be negotiated. The remaining US$211
million equivalent of the program's total cost would be covered by in-
ternal cash generation and contributions by the Government and others.
v.        The Power Sector's capital structure and financial position
are generally sound. An over-dependence on 5-year credits is being re-
dressed with the assistance of the Government and NAFINSA. The rate
of return improved from 9.4% in 1967 to 9.8% in 1968, which is well
above the 8% minimum agreed upon with the Bank. The sector is expected
to continue to produce a 9-10% rate of return during the next few years.
vi.       Items financed by the proposed loan would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding with a 15% margin of preference
for Mexican manufacturers.  The Bank - in part jointly with supplying
countries - would finance 100% of contracts won by foreign firms and
the foreign exchange component of contracts won by local manufacturers,
estimated to average 50% of the contract amounts.  The Bank would also
finance 35% of civil works contracts, which is the estimated average
foreign exchange component.  Civil works contracts above Mex$20 million
would be subject to international competitive bidding. As with the
pTevious programs, orders for about 20% of the investment program would
be placed in Mexico on the basis of local bidding.
vii.      The Power Sector has not lived up to past agreements on the
conversion of its 50 cycle Central System to 60 cycles. A new time-
table has been prepared by CFE and during negotiations agreement was
reached on this plan to convert 300 MW of selected large consumers in
the outskirts of Mexico City. Assurance was obtained that the Minister
of Industry and Commerce would promulgate the regulations to control
the changeover.
viii.     The 1970-71 investment program of the Power Sector is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$125 million for a term of 20 years, including a
4-year grace period.



MEXICO
APPRAISAL CF THE 1970-71 INVEST14MT PROGRAM
OF THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico has asked the Bank to make a third
loan to the Power Sector to help finance construction expenditures of the
continuing investment program for the sector. The Comision Federal de
Electricidad (CFE) would be the borrower and Nacional Financiera S.A.
(NAFINSA), the Governnent's development bank, would be co-borrower as
in previous Bank loans to CFE (paragraph 1.07). CFE would make available
a portion of the loan to Compania de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (Centro)
through a subsidiary loan agreement.
1.02      Messrs. R. H. Sheehan, C. de Beaufort, T. Berrie and R. Ribi
visited Mexico in May 1969 to appraise the programs and financial position
of CFE and Centro, the two major entities of the Power Sector.  Additional
information was obtained by Mr. Ribi during a visit to Mexico in October
1969 and during the negotiations which took place in January 1970. This
report was prepared by M4essrs. de Beaufort and Ribi.
1.03      The Bank's second Mexican Power Sector loan (5h4-YIE), for
uS$ 90 million, is divided in two parts: US$ 25 million with closing date
of March 31, 1971, and US$ 65 million with closing date of December 31,
1969. The first part helps finance specific major generating equipment
with long delivery times; the second part which has been fully disbursed,
has helped to cover the foreign exchange component of payments for current
construction and equipment contracts.
1.04      In the first quarter of 1970 new Bank financir.g will be required
for the development program of the Power Sector, and a loan of US$ 125
million is proposed to help cover expenditures for generation, trans-
mission and distribution facilities during 1970 and 1971.. The proposed
loan amount is based on the prospects that in this two-year period
US$ 75.5 million of payments for imported goods would be financed by
supplying countries. Financing for U1$ 32.5 million would be covered by
joint loans to Loan 5h4-ME (see Annex 1h, paragraph 6) and suppliers'
credits. The remaining US$ 43.0 million is to be negotiated with the
supplying countries under a joint financing formula similar to that used
in connection with loans 436-ME and 544-I4E.  However, under the new
arrangement the Bank and the supplying countries would each finance
50% of the goods eligible for joint financing (paragraph 6.05).
1.05      The Mexican power market consists of 10 major systems (see
attached maps) and numerous isolated undertakings. CFE now owns all of
the power facilities of these systems except those of the Central System,
where the distribution network and some transmission lines and generating
plants are owned by Centro.  Since 1960, in accordance with Government
policy, CFE has been the only organization to install new generating
plants and also has the responsibility to coordinate all investment planning
for the sector.  Except for the Central System, which runs at 50 cycles,
the Mexican power systems all operate at a 60-cycle frequency. Further



-2-
interconnections are under construction, the most important being the
one linking the Puebla-Veracruz and Michoacan-Guanajuato Systems through
a by-pass of Mexico City. Since mid-1969, when the first line of the link
was completed, the interconnected system extends for nearly 1,000 miles
through the entire central part of the country.
1.06      At the end of 1968 Mexico's total installed generating capacity
was 5,913 MW, of which 1,009 Ili was "captive plant" owned and operated
by industry for its own needs (see Annex 1). The 4,904 MW of capacity
available for supply to the public sector consisted of 4,227 MW owned
by CFE, 667 MW by Centro, and 10 MW by small utility companies.  For all
practical purposes, nationalization of the public electricity supply is
completed,  Although some progress toward consolidatioA has been made
since Loan 544-iME was signed in 1968, further integration of the sector
is required. This problem of integration is discussed in paragraphs
2.06-2.09.
1.07      The Bank has made nine loans for power in Mexico for a total
of US$ 454.8 million. Of this amount, US$ 390.8 million (86%) went to
CFE and US$ 64 million (14%) to Centro/Mexlight. The following table
gives some general information on these loans:

pending its reorganization; the reorganization was concluded in 1950
and the loan was repaid from part of the proceeds of loan 24-ME.



-3-
As of October 31, 1969, the total amount held by the Bank was US$ 371.3
million, of which US$ 27.9 million remained undisbursed. Over the past
20 years these loans have supported the development of the Power Sector
by helping finance about 80% of the secto.'s generating capacity, as well
as large amounts of transmission and distribution equipment.  Although
parts of previous programs have not been executed (e.g., frequency
unification discussed in paragraphs 3.03-3.08) or have suffered substantial
delays, the Bank's experience with the sector has generally been satisfactory.

2. THE BORR(WR
Comision Federal de Electricidad
2.01      CFE was created in 1937 by the Iexican Government as a wholly
Government-owned agency for th1e main purpose of constructing and operating
power facilities and participating in the ownership of separate power
undertakings. In 1949, CFE was restructured and designated as an auton-
omous public agency with its own equity and legal capacity to conduct
business. There are no liens or mortgages on its properties. It is headed
by a Board of Directors composed of (a) the Secretary of Industry and
Commerce, who is Chairman of the Board; (b) the Secretary of Hydraulic
Resources; (c) the Undersecretary of Finance; (d) the Director General
of Petroleos Mexicanos; and (e) the Director General of iHAPINSA. The Board
of Directors appoints CFE's Director General and the Assistant Director
General. The present Director General who has been in charge since 1964
and the Assistant Director General, who has been associated with CFE
during an even longer period of time, have formed a competent team which
has done much to improve CFE's administration and organization.
2.02      CFE operates through 1  divisions located in 10 geographical
regions. At present, it has about 20,000 employees and supplies 2,800,000
consumers, The Government exempts CFE from most taxes and also refunds
any import duties CFE pays.
2.03      As in the previous loan to the sector, funds required for
the capital expenditures of Centro would be made available through OFE.
Since the middle of 1969, CFE handles the whole debt and funds management
of the sector. This change represents an important step towards a complete
consolidation of the sector.
Compania de Luz y Fuerza del Centro S.A.
2.04      Centro is owned by the f4exican Light and Power Company Ltd
(IMexlight), founded as a Canadian corporation in 1902. In 1960 the M,1exican
Government gained control of Mexlight; variQUs governmental agencies now
own more than 91% of 14exlightts total shzare capital (CFE owns about 86%).
Up to 1963 Mexlight was a combination of a holding and an operating company
with very substantial assets and several wholly owned operating subsidiaries.
It ceased being an operating company and assumed the role of a holding
company in November 1963 when it sold its Ilexican assets to one of its
subsidiaries and took additional shares and bonds of the subsidiary.
This subsidiary - subsequently renamed Compania de Luz y Fuerza del
Centro S.A. - by far outweighs the other Nlexlight operating subsidiaries
in both size and importance because it serves the high-density Mexico
City market, whereas the other subsidiaries supply the outlying areas.
For purpose of simplification, whenever "Centro" is used in this report
the term should be understood to include the other Iexlight subsidiaries
The group can be considered as a single organization since Centro's top
officials also occupy the corresponding positions in the other Max1ight
subsidiaries. Three members of CFEts Board namely, the Secretary of



-5-
Industry and Commerce as Chairman, the Undersecretary of Finance, and
the Director General of NAFINSA, are also on the Board of Centro. in
January 1970, CFEts Director General who was already a member of
Centro's Board, was also appointed President of Centro.
2.05      Through its 50 cycle system Centro supplies consumers in
and around Mexico City, selling at retail only. In order to supple-
ment generation from its own plants Centro purchases large olocks
of power from CFE. In 1968 the bulk purchases of energy amounted to
5,898 GWJh or 73,8% of all energy generated and purchased by Centro.
Centro has about 13,500 employees and serves about 1,364,000 consumers.
Integration of the Power Sector
2.06      The electric power sector was nationalized in December 1960
by a constitutional amendment after the Government had obtained
control of the sector by acquiring: the assets of Impulsora de
Empresas Electricas S.A. (Impulsora), a subsidiary of American and
Foreign Power Company; the majority of the shares of Mexlight; a sub-
sidiary of the International Power Company of Canada, Ltd.; and several
distributing companies. After the nationalization the companies were
managed in three main groups, corresponding to the collective labor
contracts held by three different labor unions.
2.07      In 1963 Mexlight was reorganized (paragraph 2.04) and
Impulsora was taken over by Industrial Electrica h1exicana S.A. (IEIMSA)
which was affiliated with CFE. Eighteen other enterprises had also
become subsidiaries of CFE but because of the existence of different
labor unions they continued to have their own management and organiza-
tion, which was costly.
2,08      An agreement concluded in 1966 between CFE and two of the
unions made possible the integration of IEDSA and the 18 subsidiaries
with CFE. The actual merger took place during 1967. Thereafter the
Power Sector consisted virtually of two entities: CFE and Centro. In
January 1969 Centro's union joined the 1966 agreement between CFE
and the other unions, and pledged to support the Power Sector's in-
tegration in general and the frequency change in Centro's system in
particular.
2.09      During 1968, the integration process continued when CFE?s
share purchases gave it a majority of Mexlight shares. Another step
was taken in the middle of 1969 when, under the pressure of financing
problems, the debt and funds management of the sector was effectively
centralized under CFE. Although CFE had acquired a majority of
Mexlight's shares in 1968 little progress was made towards coordina-
tion of planning and operations between CFE and Centro. However,
now that CFE's Director General is the chief executive of Centro
as well, further moves may be expected towards a full merger.



-6-
Ja`tal Structure and Financial Position
2.10      At the end of 1968 the sectorts fixed assets were financed
about 45% by equity and about 55% by debt. Although this is a sound
ratio the capitalization wias not entirely satisfactory because of the
sizable 'arnounts of -.medium-term credits included in the debt.  In 1969
the sector faced up to t'he fact that it was becoming over-dependent on
five-year credits from financial institutions. It was successful in
obtaining additional long-term funds from the Government and others.
Wdith NAFINSA, the sector prepared a refunding agreement covering
Mex$ 1.1 billion (US$ 89 million), or 18% of the sector's total debt
maturing during the 5-year period 1970-75. A further refunding operation
is being planned (paragraph 6.06). These measures make it possible for
the debt service to be reduced to a level that will enable the sector to
gradually pay off the medium-term credits from commercial banks, rather
than continue the procedure of rolling them over as they come due.
2.11      The table below summarizes the sector's consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 1968, as shown in Annex 13.

2.12      The consolidated balance sheet has been compiled from auLdited
balance sheets of CFE and Centro. The mission made somiie revisions in
CFE's balance sheet to get a clearer picture of Works in Progress and the
current position.
2.13      The fixed assets have been stated at original cost (except for
a very small part, stated at 1940 valuation), which is acceptable in view
of the fairly stable level of prices in Mexico. The 1968 depreciation
charges were Mex$ 498 million (US$ 39.8 million), or 2.2% of average fixed
assets in service, which is somewhat low but acceptable. At the end of
1968, in addition to the annual depreciation charges, CFE transferred
Mex$ 670 million (Us$ 53.6 million) from equity to the accunulated provision
for depreciation in order to adjust for a deficiency in depreciatioLn charged
prior to 1967.
2.14      The sector's consolidated equity amounting to Hex$ 10.9 billion
(US$ 872 million) consists of CFE's equity of Mex$ 9.8 billion (US$ 784
million) and Mex$ 1.1 billion (US$ 88 million) of Gentrots equity.l/
2.15      CFE's equity has been built up from Federal and State appropria-
tions, proceeds of the power consumption tax (paragraph 2.32), and earned
surplus.  CFE does not declare dividends; Decree dated- January 11, 1949,
provides that as an autonomious agency CFE must reinvest its profits in
its system.
2.16      Centro's equity consists of Nex$ 551 million (US$ 44 million) in
preferred and common shares issued by Mexlight and Mex$ 1,371 million
(US$ 110 million) of surplus and reserves. At the end of June 1969,
78.5% of the preferred shares and 96.25% of the common shares of Mexlight
were beneficially owned by agencies of the Mexican Government. Purchases
from these agencies in 1968 and 1969 and shares contributed by the
Government in September 1969, brought CFE's ownership of Mexlight shares
to 86% of all outstanding shares. M4exlight is paying an annual preferred
dividend of Can$ 1.00 per share on the preferred shares, which have a
nominal value of Can$ 13.50. In 1968 the common shareholders received
an annual stock dividend- of one-tenth of a share for every share held.
2.17      The sectorts long-term debt at the end of 1968, amounted to
Mexe$ 13.4 billion (US$ 1.1 billion).  Annex 14 contains a detailed stata.
ment of the debt and the following table shiows a breakdown by creditors:
1/   Centro's total equity actually is Mex$ 1.9 billion (us$ 152 million);
in the sector consolidation IIex$0.8 billion was subtracted from that
amount because of CFE's ownership of Mexlight shares.

The debt is denominated 40` in Mexican pesos and 60% in othler currencies,
mainly U.S. dollars.
2.18      Two debt covenants of Loan 544-IME described in paragraphs 3
and 9 of Annex 1, have been repeated in the documents for the proposed
loan. As mentioned in paragraph 12 of Annex 14, the debt service covenant
has now been replaced by an income to interest test, an assets to debt
level test,and an assets to medium-term debt test.
2.19      The Deferred Debits, totaling 14ex$ 595 million, consist  of
unamortized financial charges and divisional balances pending distribution
to other accounts. The Deferred Credits, totaling I4e $ 1,750 million,
include a provision of MNex$ 1,450 million for employee pensions and about
Mex$ 100 million in customer deposits, plus some miscellaneous provisions.
2.20      In connection with loan 544-ME, CFE confirmed that it would
maintain for the Power Sector, as well as to the extent practicable
for itself and Centro individually, a yewr-end current position where
current assets at least balance current liabilities. At the end of 1968
the sector complied with this undertaking, its current rat.io being
1.09:1.00.  Centro's current position was 0.94:1.00 which is still acceptable.
The coordination of the sector'sdebt and funds management by CFE (paragraph
2.09) will serve to reduce the working capital needs of the sector.
2.21      Individual balance sheets of CFE and Centro for the years
1964 through 1968 are shown in Annexes 7 and 10. Financial ratios for
these years are shown in Annexes 9 and 12.
2.22      CFE's financial position remains sound.  Its rapid growth
continues to be financed in a balanced manner by increases in equity
and long-term debt. During 1968 loans obtained to finance the purchase
of Mexlight shares (Annex 14, paragraph 4) caused a slight change in the
debt/equity ratio from 53/47 to 54/46.
2.23      As a result of the agreement not to issue additional bonds
undar the indenture (Annex 14, paragraph 9), Centro's borrowing activities
are limited to intrasector loans and transactions with commercial banks.
During 1968 Centro's debt structure deteriorated further, as the outstanding
amount of medium-term debt to banks rose from 46% to 53% of its total



-9-
debt.I  As already mentioned in paragraph 2.10 measures taken in 1969 will
reduce thle sector's dependence on medium-term financing. It was also
decided that henceforth CFE will take care of thne debt and funds management
for the whole sector (paragraph 2.09).  Accordingly Centro would cease to
obtain direct credits from commercial banks. As the existing medium-term
credits are being paid off and replaced by intrasector debt, Centro's
financial position will become less vulnerable.
Earnings and Cash Flow
2.24      Both CFE's and Centro's rates of return for 1968 were satisfactory
at 9.8% each; the sectorts rate of return improved from 9.4% 1/ in 1967
to 9.8% in 1968.
2.25      Coverage of interest, by the sum of the proceeds of the Power
Tax and net income before interest, declined from 2.33 times in 1967 to
2.06 times in 1968. This was mainly due to an increase in thie average
rate of interest paid of 6.0% in 1967 to 6.6% in 1968.
2.26      An approximation of the sector's cash flow during 1967 and 1968
is given in the following table:
The sources were:                                  1967          1968

in a reduction in net fixed assets of about ,i4ex$ 1 billion (US$ 80 million).

2.27      Net internal cash generation financed 35,O of construction in
1:;57 and 44% in 1968.  The sum of the net internal cash generation and
federal and State subsidies covered 48% of construction in 1967 and
56% in 1968, which is satisfactory.  The acquisition of iex1ight shares
in 1968 was almost completely financed by loans from NAFINSA and other
Government agencies, which may only be serviced from excess funds (Annex
1h, paragraphs 3 and 4).
2.28      In 1967 and 1968, the sector's debt service coverage by internal
cash generation remained low but acceptable at 1.5 times. Centro's ratio
was still insufficient at 0.83 times in 1968, but this was an improvement
over the 1967 low of o.56 times. With such ratios Centro cannot obtain
financing without the assistance of NAFINSA or CFE, and it was therefore
a wise decision to centralize the sector's debt management under CFE.
T'ne increase in interest rates caused a decline in CFE's ratio from 1.9
times in 1967 to 1.8 times in 1968, but at this level the coverage was
still adequate.
Auditors
2.29      The auditing arrangements for the sector are satisfactory.
Independent auditors employed by Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional, the
supervisory agency for Government enterprises, audit CFE's and Centro's
accounts.  They are Manuel Resa, Jr., for CFE and Despacho Roberto Casas
Alatriste for Centro, both well qualified accounting firms that follow
generally accepted auditing standards. During negotiations OFE gave assur-
ance that the sector's accounts will continue to be audited by firms
acceptable to the Bank. Since CFE's divisions keep their own accounts,
mhich makes it difficult for thie auditors to compile the consolidated
statements within the 4-month period prescribed in previous loan agree-
ients, GFE and the Bank agreed to increase the period to five months.
Tariffs
2.30      At their present level, the electricity tariffs provide adequate
vevenues.  The Tariff Conmission for Electricity and Gas regulates the
tariffs, subject to final approval by the i'flnistry of Industry and Commerce.
The present 11 schedules for the various consumer classes, introduced in
1962, provide uniform rates for each consumer category throughout the
country (except for agricultural rates, not yet completely unified),
regardless of the actual cost of supplying energy in the still separate
power systems. This cost is higher in the predominantly thermal systems
and those with low load density than in th-e systems with extensive hydro
resources and/or high load density. However, CFE is increasingly inter-
connecting the main systems and in due course the present uniformity of
tariffs will be justified.
2.31      Since 1962, revenue per kWh from the different consumer categories
,and distribution of sales by categories have both been remarkably stable
(Annex 3). The relationship between sales and revenues can be summed-up
as follows:



-11 -
(a)  17% of the sales went to residential consumers and produced
27% of the revenues at an average rate of I4ex$ 0.47
(US¢ 3.8) per kWh;
(b) 16% of the sales went to commercial consumers and produced
27% of the revenues at an average rate of Mex$ o.48
(USO 3.8) per kWh;
(c)  51% of the sales went to industrial consumers and produced
37% of the revenues at an average rate of Mex$ 0.21 (US¢ 1.7)
per kWh; and
(d) the remaining 16% of thae sales went to agriculture,
government and special contracts at the very low average
rate of Mex$ 0.16 (US¢ 1.3) per kWh.
The overall average revenue is about Mex$ 0.29 (US¢ 2.4) per kWh.
2.32      The above revenue figures were calculated inclusive of sales;
taxes whose proceeds are turned over to CFE for its capital investment
program. These taxes - 10% for residential, small commercial and agriculture
loads and 15% for large commercial and industrial loads - are actually
surcharges on electricity bills; they can therefore be properly considered
as part of the sector's total revenues. The sales taxes do not apply to
mining and public lighting.
2.33      The rough analysis of the rates in Annex 20 shows that the
tariffs for the main consumer categories (residential, commercial and
industrial) seem to be broadly in balance. The possibility should be
considered to give commercial and small industrial consumers some incentive
to use more electricity off peak.
2.34      The Guarantee Agreements of Loan 544-ME and of the proposed
loan, contain a revenue covenant based on an 8% return for the Power Sector.
For the purpose of calculating the return, the rate base consists of the
net fixed assets in operation of the Power Sector at the beginning of the
year, adjusted by a notional 4% addition whlcil allows for completion of
plant during the year.  Should the actual earnings in any one year fail
to reach the required minimum level, the shortfall will have to be comnpen-
sated for in the following year, over and above all other requirements.
In case actual earnings exceed the required minimum level the Power
Sector may, at its option, set aside such excess funds to compensate for
shortfalls in later years or to make payments on certain acquisition
debts (Annex 14, paragraph 3).

3. THE SECTOR PROGRAM
The Bank Project
3.01      The Project proposed for the Bank's Third Power Sector
loan is, as for the two previous loans, the sector1q continuing
development program, which is designed to enable the sector to
meet the expected growth in demand (paragraph h.02) and to main-
tain an adequate standard of service. It covers the 1970-1971
construction period of the program and is estimated to cost US$491.4
million equivalent. It consists of:
-   1173 1%rM of hydro plant,
-   155h IRW of steam plant,
-    168 WT of gas turbines,
-     75 ItW of geothermal plant,
-     23 wgi of diesel generators,
-    866 km of 400 kV transmission lines,
-   4150 km of 220 kV transmission lines,
-   3830 km of 69-161 kV transmission lines, and
-   10,200 MVA of main transformer stations.
In addition, during 1970 and 1971 about Mex$1,700 million (US$136
million) are to be spent for the expansion of distribution networks
and rural electrification and about Mex$150 million (US$12 million)
will be allocated to the first phase of frequency unification.
Annex 5 shows a list  of the major facilities included in the program.
3.02      Planning for the expansion of the Power Sector is based on
a ten-year program which is reviewed and updated by CFE each year.
In the present program, the projects on which construction is to be
started in 1970 and 1971 are firm, while those to be implemented
later are subject to changes in size, or location, or timing, etc.,
depending on the results of the annual reviews'.
Frequency Unification
3.03      Since 1964 the sector program has included provisions for
the start of the frequency changeover in the Central System from 50
to 60 cyclesE, Although the Guarantee Agreements for loans 436-LInE and
544-1IE included covenants providing for th-e timely initiation and
completi6n of the-first phase, until to date no actual conversion of
any of'the connected load has been accomplished.
3.04      The complete frequency changeover involves the modification
of the '0 cycle hydro and thermal generating units to operate at 60
cycles and the conversion or replacement of consumer-owned frequency
sensitive equipment corresponding to some 1700 IN of connected load,
Its costs according to CFE's latest estimate will be about HIex $1,500
million (US$120 million)* The work will be done by CFE and Centro
in their respective zones of operation and installations, under the
general supervision of CFEI' Central System interconnection Depart.iente



-13-
3. 5      During the past four years work has progressed on the preparation
of' several master plans, each of which in turn became obsolete because the
uovernment and CFE did not take the necessary steps to implement them,
and due to a lack of cooperation from Centro and its union. In January
and February 1968 the Mexican Government issued two decrees which prepare
the way for unification by providing that frequency sensitive equipment,
either imported or manufactured in M4exico, must be capable of operating
at 60 cycles or both 50 and 60 cycles.
3.06      In August 1969, CFE and its consultants, Bechtel, completed a
new master plan, which was approved by the Minister of Industry and Commerce,
and which the Bank mission adopted as a basis for the project appraisal.
Arn analysis of this plan showed that the changeover was still economically
justified, since the expected return on the investment was 20% on the basis
of CFE1s figures for costs and benefits and about 1% when more pessimistic
assumptions were made. Any further delay in carrying out the unification
would reduce the return at a rate of 2.0 to 2.5% per year for the first
two to three years of postponement.
3.07      During negotiations CFE informed the Bank that it had been
necessary to make yet another change in the conversion plan.  In order to
overcome the resistance of Centro and its union, and to avoid the possibility
of consumers obtaining injunctions that could paralyze the operation for
years, the first phase of the unification would no longer comprise an
area by area conversion of Mexico City's outskirts, but would instead
eonvert selected large industrial consumers and major housing developments
within economic distance of the 60 cycle outer transmission ring around
the Capital. CFE hopes to be able with the new scheme to win progressively
general support for the changeover.
3.08      Agreement was reached with CFE on the new plan for the first
phase of the frequency unification to convert 300 IVW of connected load
'oy September 1972; its approval by the Minister of Industry and Commerce
is now pending. The decision to accept the new plan was based on an assurance
that the regulations to control the changeover would be promulgated by
the Minister of Industry and Commerce before Board presentation of the
proposed loan. The Loan and the Guarantee Agreements include covenants
to assure that the sector will carry out the first steps of the changeover
in accordance with the new timetable.



- 14 -
Nuclear Plant
3.09      On the basis of a joint study made by CFE and the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) in 1968, CFE has taken the first step towards
the possible installation of a nuclear power plant of about 600 NIW to be
commissioned at the earliest in l975. The SRI study concluded that the
economic justification for a nuclear plant in Mexico rested primarily on
its capital cost and to a lesser degree on the relation between fossil
and nuclear fuel costs. Since the capital costs of the nuclear plant can
be determined with a sufficient degree of certainty only from actual bids,
CFE engaged two U.S. consultants, NUS Corporation and Burns & Roe, to assist
respectively with a prequalification procedure for suppliers of the nuclear
steam supply system and with the preparation of specifications. In August
1969, eight prequalified companies were requested to submit tenders on this
system, including the fuel.  Seven of the eight prequalified firms submitted
bids that were opened on January 28, 1970. CFE will determine the economic
justification of the installation after completing the bid analysis. By
mid 1970 OFE should be in a position to decide whether or not the plant
submitted to tender should be built. Since the installation of the nuclear
plant is not yet certain, the present program for generating facilities still
takes into account only hydroelectric and conventional thermal plants. If
the decision is positive, CFE intends to finance the nuclear plant through
long-term credits which supplying countries normally grant for this type
of plant.
Design and Supervision
3.10      The sector's arrangements for engineering are satisfactory.  As
for the past several years, CFE's and Centro's engineering staff is carrying
out the design of the small generating plants, the transmission facilities,
and the distribution expansion. For the major new steam plants, CFE has
engaged consulting engineers to perform the design and supervise the con-
struction. The British firm of Kennedy and Donkin is responsible for the
2 x 150 MW Salamanca plant and the 2 x 150 MW extension to Valle de
Mexico I while BICA, the Association of Bechtel of the U.S., with
Ingenieros Civiles Asociados from Mexico is in charge of design and super-
vision of the 300 MW fourth unit at Valle de Mexico I and of the first two
300 MW units of Valle de Mexico II. The Canadian firm, TECSULT, was hired
for the 44 Nachi-Cocom station in Yucatan; and ALEN S.A., the Mexican firm
which did the original design of the Monterrey plant in the early 1960's has
been retained for the 150 MW extension; SOFRELEC of France will study trans-
mission line problens, especially the stability of the large transmission
systems.



-15-
The Board of' International Consultants2!wj2lM continue to revieu the
design and construction of major hydro projectso  It has approved CFE's
proposal of a rockfill dam for the La Angostura Hydro Development;
since CFE has developed an expertise in this kind of structure, it will
carry out the design itself. In addition to the above consultants, CFE
has engaged several foreign engineers for assistance with special problelis.

3.12      The estimated costs of the sector program are reasonable.
The cost estimates for equipment were made using current international
and Mexican prices; the assumed proportion of awards between local
and foreign manufacturers is based on past exDerience.  The estimates
for civil works are based on the cost of works of a similar nature
that have been completed most recently. An overall allowance of 10%
has been inc'luded for contingencies, to cover unforeseen difficulties
and any price escalation during construction. The new steam plantst
total capital costs (excluding interest during construction) are
estimated to range from US$87 per kW for the 300 NW installations
to US$310 per kW for the 22 MW plants. The 14 NW gas turbines are
estimated at US$97 per kW. Single-circuit transmission lines are
assumed to cost US$21,500 per km for 400 kV lines, US$10,000 per km
for 230 kV lines, and US$8,000 per km for 115 kV lines.
3.13      In the past, CFE has tended to underestimate the cost of
new facilities, in particular the cost of new generating plant. In-
variably actual costs have overrun the estimates. The present manage-
ment has brought about an improvement in both the quality of the
estimates and the control of construction costs. The item-by-item
forecast the sector uses in determining its overall financial require-
ments leads to an overestimation of these requirements for the first
one or two years ahead because the method does not take into account
the fact that the sectorts physical capacity to install new facilities
often places a limitation on the actual investment. In recent years
the overestimation of financial requirements has been about equal to
the actual overrun of the costs. It is therefore believed that the
overall estimates of financial requirements for 1970 and 1971 are not
inflated. Facilities required in later years are not planned to the
same detail as those to be installed in the immediate future, there-
fore the financial needs for the later years are probably under-
estimated.
3.14      The impending automation of inventory control, procurement
planning, and construction cost control, together with the use of
more sophisticated methods in establishing the sectorts development
program will undoubtedly improve the accuracy of future investment
forecasts.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM
Power Market
401       The Mexican economy, second largest in Latin America, is
one of the few economies in the developing world that have achieved
an impressively sustained growth over a fairly long period of time.
Since the early 1950s, GMP in real terms has been increasing at an
average annual rate of 6% and has raised per capita GNP to US$500-
600. The country's sustained economic growth has reflected an evolution
from a primary-production economy based on agriculture and mining
to the more balanced economic structure of a semi-industrialized
country.  Mqanufacturing is now the largest sector, accountiing for
27% of GNP. Mexico's remarkable economic performance over the past
two decades would not have been possible if its infrastructure had
not been growing apace to provide the services needed to support
broad range of industrial and other activities. Among the most
important of these basic services has been a secure and expanding
power supply. Energy sales have been increasing at a rate averag-
ing 11% annually. Present expectations are that the economy will
continue to grow at the same or even higher rates than in recent
years, and that the need for energy will likewise continue to
increase at least at the present 11% rate. Indeed, CFE's load
forecast for the next few years is even higher than this average,
due to important industrial loads which are expected to be con-
nected in these years.
4.02       CFE prepares annually, system by system, the sector's
forecasts of demand and required generation. The methods used are
adequate and the results reasonable.  For each system historic loads
and sales are the basis for extrapolating "normal growth'", to which
new industrial loads are added. The expected maximum load and in-
stalled capacity for each systermi until 1978 are shown in the charts
of Annex 4. In each case new generating capacity is scheduled so
as to make available sufficient firm capacity to meet the forecasted
load. The following table gives the maximum gross demand that is
expected, in the Power Sector with special emphasis on the southern
systems / that will be progressively interconnected; the most im-
portant step towards this interconnection being the frequency
unification (see paragraphs 3.03 to 3.08):
1/   Central, Puebla-Veracruz, Nichoacan-Chapala-Guanajuato and
Colotlipa-Acapulco systems.

4.03      In 1968, the sector's total sales to ultimate consumers amounted
to 16,700 GTWh; CFE accounted for 10,000 GWh and Centro for 6,700 GWh.
The increase in total sales for 1968 over 1967 was about 1,700 GWH or
11.4%.  This rate of increase is substantially lower than the 14.2% that
CFE forecast last year, mainly due to some of the large new industrial
loads expected for 1968 being delayed or connected more gradually than
planned.
4.04      Important sales increases are forecast for 1969 and 1970, when
a number of industries will begin to use additional large blocks of energy;
they include Aluminio S.A. at Vera Cruz, Hojalata y Lamina S.A. at Puebla,
Grupo Industrial at Monterrey, and several smaller industries in the
Puebla and Hinatitlan area.  In Annex 2 are shown the actual sales for
1966-1968 and the sales forecast for 1969 through 1973 which CFE has used
for its financing plan and which form the basis of the present appraisal.
Expansion Planning
4.o5      Planning for the sector program is adequate.  The program covers
a 10-year period, with the first five years elaborated in more detail
than the second five. Each year since 1961 CFE has reviewed the program
to establish the new generating capacity required and determine the ad-
visability of further extensions or interconnections of the transmission
systems.  In these annual reviews, CFE studies all practical alternative
schemes that would meet the same peak load and generation requirements,
given a minimum desirable dependability, and makes comparisons of their
total capital and operating costs. The cost comparisons use the latest
available information on capital costs of new plant and current operating
costs (fuel, materials and labor); they are carried out with the help
of a series of computer programs which take into account such factors
as the probabilities of runoffs at the intakes of hydro plants, scheduled:
maintenance, frequenicies of outages, etc.



-19-
4.06      The decision whether any alternative project is to be
included in the sector program is made on the basis of a present
worth discount of total costs, using a rate of not less than the
weighted average cost to the Government of local currency and
foreign exchange borrowing.  CFE is presently using a rate of 8%
and intends to raise it to 10% in the future. Although the 8%
rate is lower than the present cost of capital in Mexico, its
use has not distorted the program.
4.07      In 1962, Electricite de France and SOFRELEC drew up a
general electrification plan for IMexico that has served as a
general guide for the sector program. SOFRELEC reviewed the pro-
gram in 1963, 1964, 1967 and 1969; all changes with respect to
the 1962 basic plan were approved by the Bank and SOFRELEC. The
Bank mission has reviewed the present sector expansion plan and
agrees with it.
4.08      This procedure of annual revision of the sector program
by CFE followed by a review by the Bank has proved satisfactoryQ
CFE has agreed to continue the annual revisions, but has not
yet decided whether to retain SOFRELEC's services. During
negotiations CFE assured the Bank that in any case it will con-
tinue to have a capable independent organization make adequate
revriews, of the program.

5. THE LOAN
5.01      The proposed Bank loan of US$125 .million would not be a
to specific contracts, but rather would be available to help meet the
estimated payments on items in the sector program to be carried out during
the two-year period January 1, 1970, through December 31, 1971. The loan is
assumed to be for 20 years including a four year grace period, with interest
at 7%, and would cover:
(a) the full amount of payments for contracts for equipmenit
procured abroad but not covered by bilateral financing
agreements or by Part A of Loan 544-ME or joint loans;
(b)  50% of the payments for contracts covered by joint loans
to the proposed loan;
(c) the foreign currency component of equipment procured in
Me 1&co;
(d) the foreign currency component of civil works; and
(e)  payments to foreign consultantS not covered by bilateral
financing agreements.
5.02      The exact distribution of thae funds cannot be known until after
the biddings; therefore Annex 19 indicates only roughly from wl-ch sources
and in what amounts the several parts of the two-year program will be
financed.  Annex 19 and the table below, showing how the present and proposed
Bank loans are expected to be used, are based on the pattern of awards of
similar contracts in the past.

-21-
The closing date for the proposed Bank loan would be June 30, 1972,
which should provide sufficient time to process applications for re-
imbursement and allow for the possibility of some slippage in the
program. Since the loan helps finance a continuing program the Bank
should consider extending the closing date for a reasonable period if
any funids remain in the loan account on June 30, 1972.
Procurement
5.03      Equipment financed by the proposed loan would continue to be
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. Orders to
be placed in Mexico directly or on the basis of local bidding cover
numerous, small lots of subtransmission and distribution equipment, con-
struction materials and vehicles etc., amounting to about 20% of the
total program. This proportion of local procurement is about the same
as in the previous program.  As in the case of previous Bank loans
for power in Mexico, civil works contracts under Mex$20 million may
also be awarded without international bidding.
Disbursement
5.04      The Bank would make disbursements for imported materials and
equipment on the basis of their CIF cost. For equipment orders placed
with Mexican suppliers, the Bank would reimburse CFE for 50% of the
contract cost, that percentage being the estimated average of the
foreign exchange component. The Bank loan would also cover 35% of the
cost of the civil works which is the estimated average foreign exchange
component.
5.o5      The second part of Loan 5h4-ME (paragraph 1.03) was exhausted
early in January 1970 before all the payments made by the sector in
December 1969 could be reimbursed.  Thereafter, the sector has continued
to make payments for such equipment as cables, transformers and switch-
gear ordered in 1969 which would qualify for financing under the pro-
posed loan. Assuming that CFE will make payments for this type of
equipment at a monthly rate of about US$5 million during the three-
month period before the proposed loan becomes effective, the Bank has
agreed during the negotiations to allow retroactive disbursements under
the proposed loan up to US$15 million for such payments made after
December 1, 1969.

6.  FIT'ACI1iG PLAY AND FUTURTE FINTANCIAL POSITION
Proposed Financing Plan
6301      During 1970 and 1971 net internal cash generation is expected
to finance 38.4% of the construction program (39.3% in 1967 and 1968).
As a percentage of total financial requirements net internal cash
generation is expected to increase slightly from 3h.9% in 1967/68 to
30.3% in 1970/71. T'ith the inclusion of contributions and miscellaneous
receipts, the internal sources are expected to finance 46.3% of total
requirements (46.0% in 1967/68). Borrowings will therefore have to
cover 53.7% of the requirements (54.0% in 1967/68), which is -n
acceptablT  proportion.  The followiing table gives a sunmary of the
financing plan for 1970 and 1971:

Borrowings totalling Mex$1,253 million (US$100.2 million) and consist-
ing of bond issues and the new joint loans are tentative (paragraphs 6.0A and
6.05 below).
6.04      The timing of the bond issues included in the above table
for a total of US$57.2 million will depend on developments in the capital
markets outside Mexico. The amounts of the issues are based on the
volume of issues the Government and CFE have placed in the recent past.
Although the capital markets seem prepared to take additional amounts of
Mexdcan bonds, factors that may have nothing to do with investors' con-
fidence in the creditworthiness of Mexico and CFE may make it impossible
to place the assumed volume. Any delays in placing the bonds might
affect OFE's capacity to reduce the level of its medium-term debt.
6.05      During the meeting between representatives of the Bank and
the main equipment supplying countries held at Paris in December 1969,
provisional agreement was reached on a new joint financing program. As
was the case with the earlier sector programs, the Bank and the supplying
countries would share in the finaricing of equipment orders of USWCO,CC0
or more placed abroad on the basis of the international competitive
bidding, provided that the orders aggregate $1 million in any of the supplying
countries.  As the present 1/3 - 2/3 sharing formula would not produce
sufficient financing from the supplying countries, a 50-50 formula
expected to produce US$43 million, would be adopted for the present
program. During the negotiations NAFINSA and CFE agreed to make tileir
best efforts to obtain joint loans; such agreements will have to be
negotiated with each participating country.



_24-
6,06      MAFINSA and CFE have completed negot.at`ons 2or t-ie re--
funding of Mdex$1,111 million (US$89 million) of 197074 maturities
of sector debt to WAFINSA. After two years of grace to be calculated
from the original due dates, each matuarity would be paid off in equal
quarterly installments during a period of 13 years   The interest rate
on outstanding balances would be 11, poa .  Furthermore, negotiaticns
will start soon on the refunding of the balance of the sector's debt
payable to NAFINSA during the period 1970 through 1974 and amounting
to Mex$837 million (US$67 million). Since both refunding operations
are an integral part of the financing plan, they have been covered in
the loan documentsa In the case of the first refunding agreement its
conclusion is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. In
the case of the second transaction the guarantor las agreed that
satisfactory arrangements will be made before September 30, 1970.
Future Earnings
6.07      Net income is expected to increase at an average annual rate
of 15.5%. Forecast income statements of the sector for the five years
1969 through 1973 are included in Annex 15; a summary of pertinent
financial ratios is given in Anmex 18.  The projections are based on
the present level of tariffs.
6.08      Sales of energy are expected to increase at an average annual
rate of 12%. Since it is expected that industrial sales will increase
somewhat faster than the other categories, the average revenue per kWh
is expected to decline from the 1968 level of 26 centavos (US¢2.03)
per klAh to about 24.6 centavos (US¢1,97).  As a result operating re-
venues would increase at an average annual rate of 10,8%.
6.O9      Operating costs were forecast on a system-by-system basisO
It was assumed that further coordination of the power sector operations
would increase its productivity and thus make it possible for the annual
increase in the number of workers to be kept down to 2%. Over the
1969-73 period, the average annual increase in operating costs works
out at I'.7M, just under the rate of increase in revenues.  This results
in operating income increasing at the slightly higher annual rate of 11%.
6.10      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation is expected
to decline from 1.5 times in 1968 to 1.3 times in 19690 A further
deterioration to 1.1 times will be prevented by the refunding arrange-
ments with NAFINSA. Coverage is now expected to fluctuate between 1.4
times and 165 times during the period 1970 through 1973.  This is low
but acceptable. Interest coverage by net income from operations was
2.0 times in 1968. During the period 1969 through 1973 coverage will
fluctuate between 2.0 and 2.5 times, which is adequate,



-25_
6.11      The rate of return on the rate base (paragraph 2.34) is ex-
pected to increase from 9.8% in 1968 to 10.0% in 1969, but there would
be a decline to 9.2% in 1971. These returns are well above the rate
of 8% agreed with the Bank but are needed to obtain a sufficient cash
generation. During negotiations agreement was reached that the level
of tariffs will not be lowered during 1970 and 1971. The revenue
covenant included in loan 544-I4E would be repeated in the documents
for the proposed loan.
Future Financial Position
6.12      The value of the sectorts net assets is expected to increase
during the five years 1969-73 from about US$2 billion to US$3 billion.
Additions to equity are expected to finance 72% of this increase, and
a net increase in long-term debt the remaining 28%. Accordingly, the
debt/equity ratio which was 5/5/45 at the end of 1968 is expected to
change gradually to 47/53 by. the end of 1973. The additions to equity
stem mainly from net income and the proceeds of the power tax; hence
their volume is to a large extent determined by the volume of sales and
the level of tariffs. Balance sheet projections for the sector are
given in Annex 13.
6.13      The projections show a reduction in the current ratio from
1.09:100 at the end of 1968 to unity at the end of 1971, after which
there would be an increase to 1.12:1,00 by the end of 1973. As
mentioned in paragraph 2.20, the coordination of the sectorts debt and
funds management would make it possible to reduce the current ratio
somewhat under unity. During negotiations the Bank agreed to reduce
the minimum current ratio to 0.95:1.00. While this reduction will
release a considerable amount of working capital, it will in turn
require great care in the daily management of the sectorts cash position.
6.14      As mentioned heretofore, the present financing plan will
allow the sector to gradually reduce its medium-term debt from about
US$200 million to a more acceptable level. This goal will remain
elusive, however, if (a) the sectorts cash generation does not attain
the projected levels, (b) there are sizable increases in construction
costs, or (c) the sector is unable to obtain all of the projected
long-term financing. Under the debt covenant, included in Section
5 14 of the loan agreement for the proposed loan, the sector will
not be able to satisfy gaps in the financing plan by borrowing at
improper terms. In the event one or more of the adverse possibilities
outlined above materialize, it may become necessary to raise the
tariffs even though the revenue covenant (paragraph 2034) would not re-
quire that this be done.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      The following principal agreements iwere reached during
negotiaticns:
(a)  existing agreements to be extended for the life of the
proposed loan are:
(i)  the accounts will be audited annually by
independent accountants (paragraph 2.29);
(ii)  annual revi3ws will be made of the sector's
expansion program by a capable independent
organization (paragraph 4.08);
(iii) the sector will earn a return of at least
8% on the rate base (paragraph 6.11);
(iv) acquisition debt will only be serviced from
excess funds set aside if the rate of return
is higher than 8% (Annex 14, paragraph 5);
and,
(v) Mexlight will not issue additional bonds
under its Indenture or sell or pledge bonds
of the Series C now held in its treasury
(Annex 14, paragraph 9);
(b)  the initial stage of the frequency unification 'will be
carried out (paragraph 3.08);
(c)  retroactive disbursements will be allowed up to US$15
million (paragraph 5.05);
(d)  the Borrowers shall make their best efforts to obtain
joint loans (paragraph 6.05);
(a)  the balance of the sector's debt repayable to NAFINSA
during 1970 through 1974 will be refinanced (paragraph
6.06);
(f) the level of the tariffs will not be reduced during 1970
and 1971 (paragraph 6.11); and,
(g) the minimum year-end current ratio of the sector will be
0.95:1.00 (paragraph 6.13).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan is the signing of a
refunding agreement for Mex$1.1 billion of sector debt repayable to
NAFINSA during 1970 thirough 1974 (paragraph 6.06).

ANNEX 14

POWER SECTOR
Long and Medium-Term Debt
1.        A detailed statement of the debt outstanding at the end of
'968 is given on pages h and 5 of this annex.
2.        The debt owed to NAFINSA consists of more than a score of
different items, such as credits or loans obtained by the Federal Government
or NAFINSA on behalf of CFE from financial institutions and suppliers, and
direct loans to CFE and Centro by NAFINSA. The original maturities of some
of these items have been refinanced by NAFINSA.
3.        Included in CFE's debt to NAFIINSA are two loans totaling
Ilex$1.3 billion (US$103 million) obtained to finance the acquisition of
tihe assets of Impulsora owned until 1960 by the American and Foreign Power
Company, and thereafter by IEMSA which was merged into CFE in 1967. In
connection with loan 436-ME it was agreed that no payments for amortization
and/or interest would be made on this debt unless the Sector would generate
funds in excess of all its other financial needs.  This arrangement was
modified by Sections 3.08 and 3.09 of the Guarantee Agreement of loan
544-ME which provide that the I&ISSA debt and indebtedness for future
acquisitions may only be serviced from excess funds set aside if the rate
of return of the sector is higher than 8%. Th-e loans are repayable over a
period of twenty years beginning in 1973. Interest at the rate of 8% per
-ear, is to be paid by the Government.  In 1978 CFE will review with the
Government whether it will be able to reimburse the interest payments on
a long-term basis.
4.        In August 1968 CFE purchased a block of 1Mexlight shares from
11AFINSA. To finance this transaction NAFINSA granted CFE a loan of
Mo$341.5 million (US$27.3 million), repayable with interest at 9% p.a.
over a period of 25 years. For the same purpose CFE borrowied Me l$120
mlillion (US$9.6 million) from two other Mexican institutions. These
loans may only be serviced from excess funds. At the end of 1968 the
excess funds totalled Mex$464 million, sufficient to service the existing
acquisition debt for several years.
5.        In order to conserve as much as possible tile internal cash
generation of the sector for the financing of its construction program,
the limitation on the debt service for acquisition debt as agreed under
loan 544-TE, has been repeated in the documents for the proposed loan.
The nine loans made by the Banlk to the Power Sector, with a
total amount outstanding at the end of 1968 of Mex$3.9 billion (US$310
million), have been discussed in paragraph 1.07.  In connection with
loans 436-I,E and 544-IE a number of equipment-supplying countries agreed
to finance one-third of the cost of orders of at least US$200,000 placed
.n ti-leir countries provided total orders in any one supplying country would
at least reach US$1 maillion.  As ol the end of 1969 about US$ 20 million
lad been provides. und-r these "jolrL loans".

7.        Under medium-term credit arrangements with 18 banks in Europe,
M1exico and the U.S., the sector owed at the end of 1968 a total of
US$137 million equivalent. Some of these credits replaced 180-day notes
placed in the early sixties when sufficient long-term financing was not
available. Their maturities were usually rolled over including the
interest due, and, in addition, Centro obtained new medium-term credits
to finance its construction costs.  ibst of the credits have five-year
terms. at the end of 1968 their average remaining term was 3.4 years.
In line with developments in the financial markets, interest rates on
these credits have been rising steadily and they are now mostly expressed
as a percentage - ranging from 1-1/h% to 2% - added to the prime rate
in the U.S. or to the interbank rate for Eurodollars or Deutsche marks.
8.        Towards the middle of 1969 when the medium-term credits had
risen to about US$2Co million CFE followed the Bank's suggestion to stop
further increases. As already pointed out in paragraph 2.10 adequate
measures are being taken for the gradual liquidation of these credits.
9.        The bonded debt includes three issues sold to the public by
lIaxlight in the 1950's. At the end of 1968 their total outstanding amount
was Mex$137 million (US$11 million). Two of the issues are secured under
an Indenture of Nortgage for which the National Trust Company of Toronto
acts as trustee.  In order not to complicate a future dissolution of Nexlight
it was agreed in connection with previous loans that Mexlight's future
borrowings would be contained. The Guarantor undertook not to permit Haxlight,
without the Bank's consent, to issue additional bonds under the Indenture or
to sell or pledge bonds of the Series C which are now held in the treasury
of Yexlight.  An identical undertaking has been included in the Guarantee
Agreement for the proposed loan. The existence of debt secured under the
Indenture has in th1e past been used as an argument against a dissolution of
M4exlight since funds needed to finance the sector's expansion, would have
to be diverted to a refinancing of the secured debt. Now that the secured
debt held by the public has been reduced to about US$10 million this argument
has Lost most of its force.
10. The bonded debt also includes three issues placed in Europe by CFE.
One was issued in 1966 for 20 million European Units of Account (US$20 mil-
lion); its interest rate is 6-1/2% and it must be amortized in 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years. The second issue was sold in 1967 for
US$20 million, at an interest rate of 7% and it is repayable in 1972. The
third issue was placed in 1968 for 15 million European Units of Account
(US$15 million); its interest rate is 7-1/4% and it is to be amortized in
10 equal annual installments.
11.       Substantially the rest of the long-term debt consists of
suppliers' credits totaling Mex$249 million (US$19.9 million), debt
taken over or created in connection with the acquisition of small com-
panies totaling Mex$301 million (US$24.1 million), and loans from export
credit institutions totaling Mex$202 million (US$16.2 million).

12.       The Loan Agreements for loans 436-1E and 544-IE provJide that CFE
may only incur new debt, without the Bank's approval, if the maximum debt
service of the sector during any succeeding year is covered at least 1.4
times by net revenues of the sector during the twelve months preceding the
date on which the new debt is to be incurred. In the subsidiary loan
agreement between CFE and Centro this provision was also made applicable
to Centro. In view of the existence of debt service peaks in some future
years, the sector will be unable to meet the test in the foreseeable future.
In order to encourage the sector to continue to improve the structure of
its debt, it was agreed during the negotiations not to repeat the covenant
for the proposed loan but to replace it by an undertaking that, except with
the approval of the Bank, no debt shall be incurred by the sector if:
(i)  net income before interest is less than 1.6 times maximum
interest for any succeeding year; or
(ii)  the sum of net fixed plant in operation and work in progress
is less than 1.5 times the consolidated debt; or
(iii)  consolidated debt with an original term of 5 years or less
is more than one-tenth of the sum of net fixed plant in
operation and work in progress.
Under this formula the sector should be able to manage its debt during
1970 and 1971 without reference to the Bank, provided no major revisions
are made in the financing plan described in Chapter 6.

Revenues
Tables 1, 2 and 3 of Annex 3 show the total sales, the total
revenues from sales anid the revenues per kNIh sold for the years 1962 to
1969, i.e., since the unified rates were introduced in the Power Sector.
The following table gives the sales and revenue percentages, and the
revenues per kWh in average over these years:

The ratio between residential, commercial and industrial rates, as judged
by the above revenue return, would appear to be broadly satisfactory.
However, the above table suggests that the last four categories are
probably subsidized.
Marginal Co0t Pricing
So far, the Mexicans did not carry out any study in marginal
cost pricing for their Power Sector. The followTing material has been put
together from a rough analysis of the basic data for the Southern Systems/
on the assumption that they are interconnected.
Load Pattemrs
Electric utilities have daily, weekly and annual peaks in their
sales of electrical energy. Due to the random manner in which the consumer
loads can be switched on, it is not possible to predict exactly when these
peaks will occur; this is particularly so for the annual peak.
Typical Load curves kept by CFE for the southern systems show
the hourly rates of energy consumption for each 24 hour period in the year.
From these curves, load patterns for the future can be predicted. Analysis
shows that the peak hour of loading might occur at any time between 6:30
p.m. and 9:30 p.m. and that the winter week-day load curve can be broken
down conveniently into three semi-discrete periods:
1/ These are the Central, the Puebla-Veracruz, the Michoacan-Chapala-
Guanajuato and the Colotlipa-Acap-ilco systems.



ANNIEX 20

peak   6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
night  9:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
day    7:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
The summer peak is lorwer than the tanter peak, and summer week days can
be ccnveniently divided into two periods only:
night 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
day    7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
The system peak load may occur any week day from October through January.
This can be called the winter season and the rest of the year the summr.er
season. Levels in costs of electricity production correspond to the above
levels of demand.
Short Run Marginal Costs of Energy Production
These are the incremental costs of generating an additional kVih
at each level of demand for electrical energy. They are made up of incre-
mental fuel (for thermal generation) and incremental operating costs.
Incremental costs of generation will need to be calculated continuously
from the central dispatch center once the southern systems are fully inter-
connected. At present it is only possible to estimate roughly what the
short run marginal costs of energy production will be. Using 1967 prices
they are as follows:
Winter              Summer
Period          Mfx$/kWh generated            generated
Peak                    0.14                  -
Day                     0.10                 0.12
Night                   0.06                 0.08
The incremental energy costs to be charged for each discrete
period were determined by taking a weighted average of the incremental
costs of production corresponding to each different hour in that period.
Long-Run Marginal Costs of Production
At the time of the annual system peak the marginal cost (i.e.,
the cost of producing another kWh) is not limited to the cost of produc-
tion at the generating plant with the highest incremental energy cost
which is brought into operation last.  Additional capability (kw) to
produce energy is also required, the fixed charges of which must be added
to the incremental energy cost at time of system peak. Should the addi-
tional capacity provided be other than peaking plant (e.g. gas turbines),
then an allowance must be made for the savings which can be made off-peak,
in that other less-efficient plant of the system may be required to operate
less. Spreading the net fixed charges over the hours of the year within
T,,hich the system peak might occur leads to the following long- and short-run
marginal costs of production:

Night                  o.o6                o.08
Network Costs
Incremental load requires incremental network costs as well as
incremental costs of production. Like the incremental production costs
these have a short-run (operating or variable) and a long-run
(capability) cost aspect. That part of the network which links together
the generating stations by connecting transmission is best viewed as
exteniding the facilities provided by the generating stations. Its short-
run marginal costs include the incremental costs of operation and the
costs of incremental transmission losses at various levels of system
demand. Its long-run marginal costs which are much larger than the short-
run costs include the fixed charges of extending transmission capacity
per kw of ircremental demand spread over the peak hours in a manner similar
to that used for generating capacity.
The determdnation of short-run and long-run marginal costs for
the distribution system is not easy in that it depends so much on the un-
certainties of cons uption by each customer.  The distribution long-run
capability costs to be covered can approximately be divided in proportion
to the consumerst maximum demland at time of system peak.  This cost is
best spread over the peak hours.  After short-run distribution system
costs (incremental operating costs and losses) and also the incremental
transmission costs have beern added to the values in the preceding table
the following long- and short-run marginal cost of production and net-
work result:

Night                  0.07                0.10
Practical Range
To recast the above table into a more practical range requires
consideration of the very adverse effects on the public power sector of
charging such high peak rates. I-t could induce medium and large consumers
of electrical energy to install private generation, which cannot be to the
ovrarall benefit of the economly because economies of scale integrated
operaticn, etc. (wnich can be considerable) would be lost. In deciding
where the balance of charges between day and night periods should lie,
consideration must also be given to the special technical and administra-
tive costs of time-of-day or seasonal tariffs.

In the absence of any reliable knowledge of elasticities of
power demand in Mexico at the peak and in off-peak periods the present
analysis had to be based on very rough figures from somewhat similar
systems. These data indicate that the ratio between the energy rates at
the peak and those for the day hours should range from 1:0.15 to 1:0.25
to take the maximum benefit from margirnal cost pricing in the longer term
without the danger of financial loss in the shorter term.  Using a ratio
of 1:0.20 and making no differentiation between summer and winter rates
leads to the following weighted all-year round proportionality:
Peak             15
Day               4
Night     Base =  1
The likely effect of this proportionality on the different
sectors of consumption is shown below:
Daily                    Estimated 1969 Ratio
Load Factor                  of Average Revenue
Sector              %           Ratio             per kV.h
Residential        30            Base               Base
Comnercial         40            o.84               1.0
Ir.dustry          60            0.57               0.45
Others             30            1.00               0.31
The above table indicates that some incentive might be given for
cotmnercial (and small industrial)consumers to use more electricity off
peak; also that the sectors described as 'lothers" above (agriculture,
public lighting, public pumping) carry a large subsidy from other rate
classes.
