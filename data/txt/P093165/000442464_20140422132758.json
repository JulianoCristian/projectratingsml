were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory,\n            global environmental objective (GEO) outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, risk to GEO outcome was substantial, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the design of projects for implementation\n            under decentralized arrangements, using country systems,\n            should critically examine the existing capacity at all\n            levels. In order to build the strong decentralization\n            capacity at local, district, and national levels, the\n            project should have considered a long-term approach; using\n            flexible lending instruments for example, adjustable program\n            loan (APL) in order to ensure consistent and continued\n            support for a longer period of time than the planned five\n            year period. The sustainability of community empowerment\n            requires continued government follow-up, facilitating\n            appropriate linkages with service providers and agribusiness\n            value-chain players. There is need for clear targeting and\n            beneficiary selection criteria in order to maximize project\n            impact. It is always good practice to ensure that the\n            targeting and beneficiary selection criteria is well spelt\n            out in the project implementation manual, and that its\n            application is as participatory as possible to ensure that\n            it is fully understood by all stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2014-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
