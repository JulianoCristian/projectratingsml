                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Market-led Smallholders Project is supporting approximately 733 community-based organizations (CBOs) by financing activities designed to build capacity in areas such as:
                         organizational planning and management, literacy and basic accounting, business plan development, and agricultural production planning. These activities are geared towards
                         providing CBOs and their members with the tools and knowledge required to capitalize on income generation activities funded by the Project through the Community Agriculture and
                         Environment Investment Fund (CAEIF). To date, more than 1,900 micro-projects have been submitted for funding under CAEIF, out of which the Project has approved over 1,700
                         including those submitted by the CBOs. Micro-projects include construction of private household-level silos for grain storage, construction of community-based nurseries,
                         rehabilitation of road segments, and construction of community markets. In the area of natural resources management, the Project has introduced sustainable land management
                         practices on more than 17,500 hectares. The Project has been successful at introducing and scaling up income generating activities for CBOs and farming households (e.g. sesame
                         production), environmentally-friendly honey production (including for market sales), community-based forest management practices, and conservation farming activities. In the last
                         year of Project implementation, the Project has continued to use using CAEIF funds to introduce new activities aimed at improving agricultural incomes among Project beneficiaries.
                         Examples are: i) the provision of productivity enhancing kits to selected community facilitators (community-based lead farmers), and ii) the construction of community-based small-
                         scale irrigation schemes in various communities. Two approaches have been instrumental in achieving these results in the target districts: the implementation of a comprehensive
                         multi-layer capacity development program for CBOs, and the development of farmer-to-farmer extension services while strengthening public extension services.

                         The measures implemented since the Project mid-term review have continued to yield positive results. The Project team has shown noticeable progress in updating the values of
                         Project Performance Indicators, and the numbers show that the efforts are resulting in the expected outcomes on the ground. A significant number of the Project implementation team
                         is based in the Project area, which has allowed closer and continued supervision of activity implementation on the ground.

                         Project management has continued to show progress. The Project has made significant progress to achieve the target values of the Project performance indicators. To date, the
                         Project has achieved the target values for the following performance indicators: i) Number of CBOs engaged in activities supported by the Project; ii) Number of members of Savings
                         and Loans Groups (SLGs); iii) Number of micro-projects on sustainable land management, and iv) Calibration of a VIC Model for the Zambe zi River basin. By the end of the final
                         implementation support mission, the project had not been able to achieve the target values of the following performance indicators: i) Number of CBOs engaged in at least one CAEIF
                         micro-project (currently at 78%); and ii) Area with sustainable practices in natural resources management (currently at 89%).

                         The M&E function has continued to make progress. With technical support from the Bank DIME initiative, MAE/DNPDR has used the MINAG TIA 2012 data to validate the value of
                         the PDO indicator, and found that the actual increase in the agricultural incomes of smallholder farmers in the Project districts was 36% from 2007 to 2012. This follows on previous
                         efforts made by MAE/DNPDR to conduct a community and household survey conducted whose results were used to update the value of the PDO indicator. DNPDR has also

                         contracted INE for the end-of-project survey. INE has recently completed the field work and the results will be used to provided the actual values of various Performance Indicators
                         including the PDO indicator at Project closing.

                         The FM function has made progress despite existing challenges. The cumulative disbursement rate for the IDA financing has increased from 90% to 95% since April 2013, and the
                         cumulative disbursement rate for the GEF financing has increased from 87% to 92% in the same time lag. Despite all this progress, the Project's financial management function has
                         continued to require intensive implementation support from the Bank. The electronic submission of the final withdrawal application still has not been finalized regardless of regular
                         communication on this regard. The 2012 annual audit still has not been submitted to the Bank, and the escrow account still needs to be open.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has continued with the progress achieved after project restructuring. It has now validated the estimates made on the increase of the agricultural incomes of smallholders
                         in the project area. In the previous mission, the Project was recommended to access the TIA 2012 database to validate the data from a survey conducted by the project in 2012, and
                         to fully reconstruct the value of the PDO indicator at mid-term.

                         The rating for the likelihood of achieving the project development objective is upgraded to Satisfactory, and the overall implementation progress is maintained at Satisfactory (S). The
                         Bank has continued, in consultation with the Ministry of State Administration (MAE), to work closely with the project coordination team at the National Directorate for the Promotion of
                         Rural Development (DNPDR) to ensure that good performance is maintained and the project objectives and performance indicators are achieved.
