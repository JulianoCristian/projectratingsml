The performance of the project\n            has improved noticeably following the gradual implementation\n            throughout 2010 of the action plan agreed during mid-term\n            review. The strengthening of the project management team\n            (through the hiring of additional consultants) and its\n            relocation to the field have boosted the execution of\n            activities on the ground, which in turn has resulted in much\n            stronger involvement by and leadership of the corresponding\n            district administrations. The restructuring is aligned with\n            the provisions made for project supervision and the changes\n            do not involve any changes to the project development\n            objective. The changes are minor and cover four areas: i)\n            adjusting the end of project target for the performance\n            indicator on savings and loans groups to a more realistic\n            level to account for implementation delays; ii) revising the\n            financial agreement to reflect the remapping of the project\n            implementing agency to a different ministry; iii)\n            reallocating International Development Association (IDA)\n            proceeds to finance increased project coordination costs;\n            and iv) extend the closing date by six months to September\n            30, 2013, in order to align with the closing date of the\n            co-financing from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant.\n            The reallocation of IDA proceeds is needed to respond to\n            changes in project coordination and management costs\n            expected to result from improvements made to project\n            coordination and implementation arrangements."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
