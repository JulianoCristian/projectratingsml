Excellency:
REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE: Market-led Smallholders Development in the
Zambezi Valley (Credit No. 41980 MOZ)
Project Restructuring: Amendment and Extension of Closing Date
In response to your letter dated March 10, 2012 requesting a restructuring of the
above-referenced project, I am pleased to inform you that the International
Development Association (the Association) concurs with the request.
The changes approved for the project restructuring cover the following areas:
(i) adjusting the end-of-project target for the performance indicator on Savings and
Loans Groups to a more realistic level (now 6,000 members enrolled); (ii) revising the
Financing Agreement to reflect the remapping of the project implementing agency to
the Ministry of State Administration; (iii) reallocating financing proceeds to cover
increased project coordination costs; and (iv) extending the closing date.
Accordingly, the Association hereby reallocates the credit proceeds as set out in
the table contained in the attachment to this letter, which replaces the table in Section
IV, paragraph 2 of the Financing Agreement between the Republic of Mozambique
and the Association dated August 6, 2006.
Further, the Association has established September 30, 2013, as the later date
for purposes of Section IV.B, paragraph 2 of the above-referred Financing
Agreement, in order to reflect the full integration of the IDA funding with the co-
funding provided by the Global Environmental Fund for the same project.


﻿H.E. Aiuba Cuereneia                 - 2 -                    May 24, 2012
Please confirm your agreement with the above amendments to the Financing
Agreement by signing, dating, and returning to us one original copy of this
Amendment Letter and retaining one original copy for your records. Upon receipt by
the Association of the copy of this letter countersigned by you, this Amendment
Letter will become effective as of the date of the countersignature.
Sincerely,
