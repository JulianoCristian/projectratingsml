                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Market-led Smallholders Project is supporting approximately 717 community-based organizations (CBOs) by financing activities designed to build capacity in areas such as:
                         organizational planning and management, literacy and basic accounting, business plan development, and agricultural production planning. These activities are geared towards
                         providing CBOs and their members with the tools and knowledge required to capitalize on income generation activities funded by the Project through the Community Agriculture and
                         Environment Investment Fund (CAEIF). So far, the Project has approved over 1,900 micro-projects for funding under CAEIF, including those submitted by the CBOs. Micro-projects
                         include construction of private household-level silos for grain storage, construction of community-based nurseries, rehabilitation of road segments, and construction of community
                         markets. In the area of natural resources management, the Project has introduced sustainable land management practices on more than 17,500 hectares. The Project has been
                         successful at introducing and scaling up income generating activities for CBOs and farming households (e.g. sesame production), environmentally-friendly honey production
                         (including for market sales), community-based forest management practices, conservation farming activities. Two approaches have been instrumental in achieving these results in the
                         target districts: the implementation of a comprehensive multi-layer capacity development program for CBOs, and the development of farmer-to-farmer extension services (which have
                         produced almost 200 "graduates") while strengthening public extension services.

                         The measures implemented since the Project mid-term review continue to continue to yielded positive results. The Project team has shown visible progress in updating the values of
                         the Project performance indicators, and the numbers show that the efforts are yielding increased results on the ground. The Project team has also agreed to adopt the results of a
                         community and household survey conducted in 2012 and uses the values to assess evolution of household income in districts compared to baseline. MAE/DNPDR has been tasked
                         to work with the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAG) to access the 2012 Agricultural Survey (TIA) database and validate the figures of the community and household survey. DNPDR has
                         also contracted INE for the end-of-project survey, and INE is implementing the field work for the survey. Despite the above, the Project's financial management function will continue
                         to require intensive implementation support from the Bank to avoid further delays in the submission of quarterly Interim Financial Reports and Withdrawal Applications. Cumulative
                         disbursement rate for the IDA financing has increased from 85% to 90% since October 2012, and the cumulative disbursement rate for the GEF financing has increased from 78% to
                         87% in the same time lag. This is in part due to the lengthy time that DNPDR took to complete the submission of the electronic WA. A key challenge will be to ensure that the still
                         undisbursed amount is disbursed with the next WA.

                         The Project has made significant progress to achieve the target values of the Project performance indicators. To date, the Project has achieved the target values for the following
                         performance indicators: i) Number of CBOs engaged in activities supported by the Project; ii) Number of members of Savings and Loans Groups (SLGs); and iii) Number of micro-
                         projects on sustainable land management. Significant progress has been made in achieving the target values for the following Project performance indicators: i) Number of CBOs
                         engaged in at least one CAEIF micro-project (currently at 77%); ii) Area with sustainable practices in natural resources management (currently at 89%); and iii) Calibration of a VIC
                         Model for the Zambezi River basin (expected to be completed by June 2013).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has continued with the progress achieved after project restructuring, and has provided a first estimate of the increase of agricultural incomes of smallholders in the project
                         area (partial report on the PDO indicator). In the previous mission, the Project was recommended to access the 2009/10 Agricultural census data to validate the data from the survey
                         and fully reconstruct the mid-term value of the PDO indicator, but this was not possible due to problems with access to the database of the 2009/10 Agricultural Census. The project
                         Team is now tasked to access the Agricultural 2012 annual survey to validate the value of the PDO indicator.

                         The rating for the likelihood of achieving the project development objective is maintained at Moderately Satisfactory, and the overall implementation progress is upgraded to
                         Satisfactory. The Bank will continue, in consultation with the Ministry of State Administration (MAE), to work closely with the project coordination team at the National Directorate for
                         the Promotion of Rural Development (DNPDR) to ensure that good performance is maintained and the project objectives and performance indicators are achieved.
