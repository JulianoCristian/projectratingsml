outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            rural institutions can play a key service delivery role in\n            the absence of strong state capacity, but sustained support\n            is needed to ensure their good governance and capacity to\n            provide services to the poor. Social accountability tools\n            are important elements of a project intended to be\n            implemented through village-level organizations. A\n            market-based approach to developing the smallholder sector\n            requires an upfront analysis of skills, knowledge, and\n            capacity in order to engage in various value chain\n            activities, such as marketing. Simple technologies work best\n            in poor rural communities. Behavior and incentives, both\n            individual and at the policy level, should be placed at the\n            heart of programs geared toward supporting sustainable land management."}, "docdt": "2016-03-30T01:04:01Z"}
