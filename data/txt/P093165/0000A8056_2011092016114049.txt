                         The Market-led Smallholders Project is supporting approximately 370 community-based organizations (CBOs) by financing activities designed to build capacity in areas such as:
                         organizational planning and management, literacy and basic accounting, business plan development, and agricultural production planning. These activities are geared towards
                         providing CBOs and their members with the tools and knowledge required to capitalize on income generation activities funded by the Project through the Community Agriculture and
                         Environment Investment Fund (CAEIF). So far, the Project has approved over 700 micro-projects for funding under CAEIF, including those submitted by the CBOs. Micro-projects

                         include construction of private household-level silos for grain storage, construction of community-based nurseries, rehabilitation of road segments, and construction of community
                         markets. In the area of natural resources management, the Project has introduced sustainable land management practices on more than 10,000 hectares. The project implementing
                         agency has now recruited a monitoring and evaluation service provider; the service provider will estimate the baseline value for the main Project Development Objective indicator,
                         and it will carry out a community and household survey to provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of the progress achieved towards the project objectives.

                         The Borrower has submitted a draft request for the reallocation of IDA proceeds. As soon as the request is made official by the Ministry of Planning and Development, the Bank will
                         process the request and initiate a project restructuring. The Borrower and the Bank have carried out an implementation support mission in April 2011, which included a field trip to the
                         project area. Two follow up technical missions took place in June and August to focus on district financial management and the launch of the TeerAfrica funded series of activities on
                         sustainable land management. Based on the outcomes of the implementation support mission, the rating for Implementation Performance has improved from Moderately
                         Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
