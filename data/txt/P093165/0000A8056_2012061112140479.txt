                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Market-led Smallholders Project is supporting approximately 440 community-based organizations (CBOs) by financing activities designed to build capacity in areas such as:
                         organizational planning and management, literacy and basic accounting, business plan development, and agricultural production planning. These activities are geared towards
                         providing CBOs and their members with the tools and knowledge required to capitalize on income generation activities funded by the Project through the Community Agriculture and
                         Environment Investment Fund (CAEIF). So far, the Project has approved over 1,000 micro-projects for funding under CAEIF, including those submitted by the CBOs. Micro-projects
                         include construction of private household-level silos for grain storage, construction of community-based nurseries, rehabilitation of road segments, and construction of community
                         markets. In the area of natural resources management, the Project has introduced sustainable land management practices on more than 16,000 hectares. The Project has been
                         successful at introducing and scaling up income generating activities for CBOs and farming households (e.g. sesame production), environmentally-friendly honey production
                         (including for market sales), community-based forest management practices, conservation farming activities. Two approaches have been instrumental in achieving these results in the
                         target districts: the implementation of a comprehensive multi-layer capacity development program for CBOs, and the development of farmer-to-farmer extension services (which have
                         produced almost 200 "graduates" thus far) while strengthening public extension services.

                         The measures implemented over the last 6 months to address the poor performance of the Project in the areas of disbursement and monitoring & evaluation have yielded positive
                         results. The cumulative disbursement rate for the IDA financing has jumped to 74%, and the cumulative disbursement rate for the GEF financing has increased to 41%. Moreover,
                         through the partnership with the Bank's DIME initiative on Impact Evaluation, the baseline values for the project development indicators have been reconstructed for all 5 districts, and
                         a community and household survey is currently underway, implemented by the National Institute for Statistics (INE) with technical backstopping from the International Food Policy
                         Research Institute (IFPRI). The survey will be completed in June and will provide reliable and updated values for all indicators in the results framework. This exercise will be repeated
                         in 2013 to generate end-of-project data. Despite the above, the Project's financial management function will continue to require intensive implementation support from the Bank to
                         avoid further delays in the submission of quarterly Interim FInancial Reports and Withdrawal Applications.

                         The proposed restructuring for the Project has just been approved. It involves several changes: i) adjusting the end-of-project target for the performance indicator on savings and
                         loans groups to a more realistic level to account for implementation delays; ii) revising the Financial Agreement to reflect the remapping of the project implementing agency to a
                         different ministry; iii) reallocating IDA proceeds to finance increased coordination costs; and iv) extending the closing date by six months (to September 30, 2013) to align with the
                         closing date of the co-financing from the Global Environment Facility grant.

                         The next joint implementation support mission with MAE/DNPDR will take place June 4-15, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the progress achieved by the Project over the last six months period, the rating for the likelihood of achieving the project development objective has been raised to Moderately
                         Satisfactory, and the overall implementation progress is maintained at Moderately Satisfactory. Consequently, the restructured Market-led Smallholders project is no longer classified
                         as a problem project. Nonetheless, the Bank will continue, in consultation with the Ministry of State Administration (MAE), to work closely with the project coordination team at the
                         National Directorate for the Promotion of Rural Development (DNPDR) to ensure that the upward trend in performance is maintained and project objectives are achieved.
