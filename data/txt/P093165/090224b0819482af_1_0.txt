                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Market-led Smallholders Project is supporting approximately 495 community-based organizations (CBOs) by financing activities designed to build capacity in areas such as:
                         organizational planning and management, literacy and basic accounting, business plan development, and agricultural production planning. These activities are geared towards
                         providing CBOs and their members with the tools and knowledge required to capitalize on income generation activities funded by the Project through the Community Agriculture and
                         Environment Investment Fund (CAEIF). So far, the Project has approved over 1,600 micro-projects for funding under CAEIF, including those submitted by the CBOs. Micro-projects
                         include construction of private household-level silos for grain storage, construction of community-based nurseries, rehabilitation of road segments, and construction of community
                         markets. In the area of natural resources management, the Project has introduced sustainable land management practices on more than 17,000 hectares. The Project has been
                         successful at introducing and scaling up income generating activities for CBOs and farming households (e.g. sesame production), environmentally-friendly honey production
                         (including for market sales), community-based forest management practices, conservation farming activities. Two approaches have been instrumental in achieving these results in the
                         target districts: the implementation of a comprehensive multi-layer capacity development program for CBOs, and the development of farmer-to-farmer extension services (which have
                         produced almost 200 "graduates" thus far) while strengthening public extension services.

                         The measures implemented over the last 12 months to address the poor performance of the Project in the areas of disbursement and monitoring & evaluation have yielded positive
                         results. The cumulative disbursement rate for the IDA financing has jumped from 74% in mid-2012 to 85% by the end of the calendar year, and the cumulative disbursement rate for
                         the GEF financing has increased from 41% to 78% in the same time lag. Moreover, through the partnership with the Bank's DIME initiative on Impact Evaluation, a community and
                         household survey has been completed, and the values were used to assess evolution of household income in districts compared to baseline. Because the community and household
                         survey was limited to the project district, MAE/DNPDR is tasked to work with the National Institute for Statistics (INE) to access the 2009/10 Agricultural Census database and
                         validate the figures of the community and household survey and allow for comparison with non-project districts. The project team is already working with INE in the preparation of the
                         end-of-project survey. Despite the above, the Project's financial management function will continue to require intensive implementation support from the Bank to avoid further delays
                         in the submission of quarterly Interim Financial Reports and Withdrawal Applications.

                         The proposed restructuring for the Project was approved on May 23, 2012. It involves several changes: i) adjusting the end-of-project target for the performance indicator on savings
                         and loans groups to a more realistic level to account for implementation delays; ii) revising the Financial Agreement to reflect the remapping of the project implementing agency to a
                         different ministry; iii) reallocating IDA proceeds to finance increased coordination costs; and iv) extending the closing date by six months (to September 30, 2013) to align with the
                         closing date of the co-financing from the Global Environment Facility grant.

                         The next joint implementation support mission with MAE/DNPDR will take place March 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has continued with the progress achieved after project restructuring, and has provided a first estimate of the increase of agricultural incomes of smallholders in the project
                         area (partial report on the PDO indicator). The project will however need to access the 2009/10 Agricultural census data to validate the data from the survey and fully reconstruct the
                         mid-term value of the PDO indicator. The rating for the likelihood of achieving the project development objective is maintained at Moderately Satisfactory, and the overall
                         implementation progress is also maintained at Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank will continue, in consultation with the Ministry of State Administration (MAE), to work closely with the
                         project coordination team at the National Directorate for the Promotion of Rural Development (DNPDR) to ensure that good performance is maintained and the project objectives and
                         performance indicators are achieved.
