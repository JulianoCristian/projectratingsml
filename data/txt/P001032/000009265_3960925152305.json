was successful. The project achieved its main\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development has been\n            substantial, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was very good. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. They are that excellent\n            results can be obtained in resurrecting a badly rundown,\n            mismanaged Government-owned entity in a poor country\n            provided that: 1) sound feasibility studies and good quality\n            detailed engineering and supervision are carried out; 2) a\n            competent contractor is engaged to carry out the work; 3)\n            the Government and its executing agency are cooperative; 4)\n            all co-lenders closely coordinate their efforts and\n            thoroughly monitor progress; and 5) the project is\n            well-conceived from the beginning."}, "docdt": "1990-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
