    Independent auditors' opinion


    We have audited the accompanying Special Purpose Financial Statements of the Project "Post-Chernobyl
    recovery project" financed by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD") in accordance
    with a Loan Agreement # 7960 BY of 11 October 2010 between the Republic of Belarus and IBRD ("the
    Agreement"). These Financial Statements are comprised of:
       Statement of Sources and Application of Funds;
       Statement of Funds Application by Types of Project's Activities;
       Statement of Withdrawal;
       Statement of Special Account as of 30 April 2014 and for the period from 1 January 2013 to
       30 April 2014;         ·
       Disclosure of fundamental principles of accounting policies;
       Other notes (the Special Purpose Financial Statements on the Project) .


    Management responsibility for preparation of the Special Purpose Financial Statements on the Project
    Management of the Project is responsible for preparation and fair presentation of these Special Purpose
    Financial Statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards for Public Sector (IASPS)
    "Financial Statement on a cash basis" developed by Public Sector Committee of the International Federation
    of Accountants ("IFAC"); and also for development of internal control system which the Management
    considers necessary for preparation of the Special Purpose Financial Statements of the Project that are free
    from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.


    Independent auditors' responsibility
    Our responsibility is to express our opinion on re liability of these Special Purpose Financial Statements of the
    Project based on our audit. We performed our audit~ in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
    Those standards require that we comply with professional ethical requirements, so that we plan and perform
    the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatements.
    An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
    Special Purpose Financial Statements of the Project. The selection of audit procedures was carried out on
    the basis of professional judgment including the assessment of risks of material misstatement of the Special
    Purpose Financial Statements of the Project whether due to fraud or error.
    In making those risk assessments, we considered a system of internal control for preparation and reliability
    of these special financial statements in order to design audit procedures appropriate in the circumstances,
    but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of that system. An audit also included
    evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
    gained by the Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Special Purpose Financial
    Statements of the Project.

NOTES TO DESIGNSTED FINANCIAL SATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 JANUARY 2013 TO
30 APRIL 2014

1.   DISCRIPTION

On 26 April 1986 in Ukraine there was an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which resulted in
radioactive release, being almost a hundred times more than the radiation level recorded after the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As c:1 result of the disaster about 2.5 million of 10.5 million of people in
Belarus were affected; about 20% of the territory of the Republic was contaminated. In addition to economic
difficulties of transition period which were typical for all countries of the former Soviet Union, residents of the
areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster faced a number of problems caused by the radioactive
contamination. Among them: health effects and associated deterioration of mental health and peace of mind,
economic downturn, increased level of poverty and lack of confidence in the future, especially in the future of
children. The Chernobyl disaster became a heavy burden for the national budget due to the need to finance
works on decontamination, compensation payments and health programs.
The government is working in collaboration with international organizations, including WHO, IAEA, UNDP
and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the effects of atomic radiation, as weli as with well-known
national and regional organizations involved in radiation safety issues in the area of assessment, monitoring
and management of consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. As a result of implementation of the national
strategy to address the consequences of the accident there was reduced the collective dose of radiation
exposure of population and the level of radionuclides in food. Patients who have cancer of thyroid and other
diseases are provided with high-quality treatment. Scientific understanding of possible causes, scenarios
and consequences of accidents at. nuclear power plants is improved considerably.
Culmination of efforts of international community to assist in overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl
disaster was the Chernobyl Forum, during which the key consideration was given to economic and s.ocial
issues along with the analysis of research findings on Chernobyl. When preparing the next phase of the
program, the government aims at increasing the focus on social and economic development in order to
ensure normal living environment for the affected population and expand economic opportunities. The aim of
the project is to provide people who live in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, with energy-efficient
and reliable supply of heat and hot water in order to improve living conditions. The proposed energy
efficiency measures are aimed at solving the problems caused by the inefficiency and wear of boilers and
heating systems, low quality of window blocks, lighting systems and thermal insulation in social institutions,
namely schools, hospitals and orphanages. Such measures will ensure the restoration of essential services
for heating and hot water in the social institutions that do not currently receive services of adequate quality.
Investments made in supply of individual houses with gas from the existing gas pipeline will lead to the
improvement of heating as well as to the use of clean fuel in houses that are currently heated by firewood,
which results in negative consequences for health and environment. The Project aims at promoting the
objectives of the Cooperation Strategy in force (2002-2014), which is the fundamental document defining the
relationships between the World Bank and the Republic of Belarus. Cooperation strategy aims at improving
the living standards of the population of Belarus by assisting in solving social and environmental problems
that have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable population groups. The project will also contribute to
the solution of problems in the areas of global importance, where the benefits will be realized not only by the
population of Belarus .but al.so by the international community.
This project is the first step in implementing the findings of the Chernobyl Forum, which was held in
September 2005, which highlighted the need to address social and economic consequences of the
Chernobyl disaster as a means of building confidence and supporting the affected population in focusing on
improving the living conditions. The project aims at supporting the government in rehabilitation of the areas
affected by the Chernobyl disaster, and more efficient use of funds under the state program. The project will
allow local organs of government to finance arrangements to improve power consumption in such public
buildings such as schools and hospitals. Households will be able to save money through more economical
energy consumption, improve comfort of living and use the savings for other priority needs.
The Project will contribute to solving the problems of global significance through increasing energy efficiency
and promoting the use of more clean fuels, which will help to improve the environment in Belarus and
neighboring countries as well as to prevent global warming.
