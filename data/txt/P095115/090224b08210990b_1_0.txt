                         satisfactory throughout its entire implementation period. Most end target indicators have been achieved and several exceeded. Over 250,000 beneficiaries were reached with
                         improved energy efficient services (including replacement of windows and installation of energy efficiency lighting in public buildings, rehabilitation of boiler houses, and, in some
                         cases, conversion of boiler houses to mini combined heat and power plants). The emphasis of energy efficiency activities was on users of public institutions, such as schools and
                         hospitals, located in the Chernobyl-affected area. About 5,005 individual homes were connected to natural gas for heating purposes (before the project, they were using solid fuel for
