                         The Post Chernobyl Recovery Project (PCRP) has made good progress towards achieving its development objectives. About 137,000 patients, students, teachers, hospital staff and
                         families have benefited from the energy efficiency improvements. An estimated 355,050 megawatt hours/year of heat energy have been saved. An estimated 4,800 megawatt
                         hours/year of electricity have been saved. Most of the contracts are completed and the remaining contracts are expected to be completed by March 31, 2011. An Additional Loan of
                         US$30 million was approved on September 28, 2010, and became effective on February 2, 2011.
