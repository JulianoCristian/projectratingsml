Although it is early for the\n            reform measures to show results, performance indicators\n            reveal health services' compliance has increased, and,\n            similarly, health referral, and/or diagnosis related\n            centers, show increased productivity. The lessons spell out\n            the benefits of useful preparatory technical assistance,\n            drawn from the preceding Technical Assistance Health Reform\n            Project (TAHRP), which paved the way to a national\n            commitment to reform. However, several implementation\n            problems could have been avoided, had its pilot testing\n            mechanisms been used more extensively. Furthermore, given\n            the fact that implementation of reform programs take longer\n            than expected, financing a well phased program through\n            follow-up projects, such as an Adaptable Program Lending,\n            could produce better results, for it would take into account\n            the lessons from the preceding operations. While\n            decentralization implies competition, it would be useful to\n            enhance competitiveness among entities through the provision\n            of technical assistance, in order to compensate those\n            institutionally weaker; for, although the project included a\n            training component, a competitive training fund, as included\n            in the TAHRP, would have produced better results. It is\n            further suggested that the Bank's operational\n            efficiency be extensively re-enforced."}, "docdt": "2000-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
