the\n            quality of health services in selected areas. The project\n            constitutes the second phase in the Bank's lending\n            assistance in the sector and it has four principal\n            components. The first is the decentralization of health\n            services delivery which will finance the pilot tests or\n            start-up activities and nationwide implementation, as\n            appropriate, of the reorganization of the Ministry of Health\n            (MOH). The second is facility investments for a new health\n            care model which will enhance the integration of health\n            services delivery in eight Health Service Areas (HAS). The\n            third is support for special programs which would mean the\n            financing of equipment and operating costs for the\n            implementation of the Cervical Cancer Program and\n            Environmental Health Education Program. Finally, the fourth\n            is project administration, this will support the operation\n            of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to assist the MOH to\n            coordinate and manage project implementation, provide\n            training to the HASs, and undertake monitoring evaluation."}, "docdt": "1992-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
