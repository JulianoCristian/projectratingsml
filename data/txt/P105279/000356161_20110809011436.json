Sector Recovery\n            Development Policy Credit Project for Senegal were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was high; the Bank's performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; and the Borrower's\n            performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: importance of dialogue and coordination with\n            government and donors/partners. The quality of the dialogue\n            was high and the team was pro active in the advice given to\n            the authorities before and during the implementation of the\n            program. Another lesson learned is that the rapidly changing\n            circumstances of the sector required an intensive and\n            continuous dialogue which was possible because of the\n            presence of the Bank's energy team in the field office\n            in Dakar. Focus on underlying causes and design simple and\n            feasible solutions to address them. The reform program\n            should have been more modest and focused and perhaps\n            supported by an investment component that will have\n            supported the achievement of some key pre-conditions."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
