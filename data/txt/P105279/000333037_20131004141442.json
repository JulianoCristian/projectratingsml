Project for Senegal was as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: proper\n            sequencing of sector policy dialogue and investment support\n            is important for success when the two are closely connected.\n            The Bank has an important role in ensuring that investment\n            decisions are made based on technical, financial, and\n            economic merits. Where a country's political timetable\n            is liable to bring significant shifts in policy, a keen\n            appreciation of political economy is necessary. The Bank has\n            much to gain from locating key operational staff in the\n            field, particularly where a continuous and intense dialogue\n            is required, such as Senegal's energy sector.\n            Inattention to the good practice principles for the\n            application of conditionality can result in policy-based\n            operations that are unbalanced and lack focus. In designing\n            policy-based operations, a realistic sense of the pace of\n            reform will take account of political economy considerations."}, "docdt": "2013-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
