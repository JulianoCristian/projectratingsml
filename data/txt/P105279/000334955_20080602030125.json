To achieve this\n            objective, the operation comprises: (a) financial support to\n            the Government to allow the power utility of Senegal -\n            Societe Nationale d Electricite (National Power Utility of\n            Senegal) (SENELEC) - to restore by end CY2009 its financial\n            equilibrium and to meet standard financial ratios and credit\n            worthiness; and (b) policy measures aimed at ensuring that\n            the electricity sub-sector and the downstream hydrocarbon\n            sub-sector develop and operate in an efficient and\n            transparent way with adequate governance. The main risk\n            under this operation is related to the rising and widely\n            fluctuating international energy prices particularly of\n            petroleum products, which create instability in domestic\n            energy costs and may induce the Government to suspend or\n            only partially implement the continued pass-through of cost\n            increases to consumers. This risk is mitigated by: (a) the\n            Government's commitment for reform and actions to\n            reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, invest in\n            efficient and least cost facilities and to diversify; and\n            (b) the existing regulations and price adjustment mechanisms\n            for electricity services as well as for petroleum products\n            allowing for monthly or quarterly adjustments."}, "docdt": "2008-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
