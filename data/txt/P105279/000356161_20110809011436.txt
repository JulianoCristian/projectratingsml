F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The primary objective of this operation is to ensure a sustained and sound long-term development
of electricity services and supply of petroleum products for Senegal. To achieve this objective,
the operation comprises: (a) measures to allow the power utility (SENELEC) to restore by end of
calendar year 2009 its financial equilibrium and to meet standard financial and credit worthiness
ratios; and (b) policy measures aimed at ensuring that the electricity and the downstream
hydrocarbon subsectors operate in an efficient and transparent way with adequate governance;
and (c) measures to ensure a sustainable long term development of Senegal’s energy sector.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     In 2006, Senegal was viewed as one of the best economic performers in Sub-
Saharan Africa. This performance was characterized by a real Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growing at an average by about 5 percent annually since the devaluation of 1994,
marking the first sustained increase in average per capita growth since independence in
1960. Over the past decade, the Government has shown a capacity to generate economic
growth and implement appropriate macroeconomic policies. The Authorities maintained
their focus on enhancing revenue mobilization and a tight control on current
expenditures, while allowing for further increases in capital and pro-poor spending.
Supported by a well targeted fiscal stimulus and a moderate easing of monetary
conditions by the Central Bank of West African States, the economy remained on a solid
growth and low inflation trajectory. Senegal benefited from significant capital inflows
over the past decade and continues to attract the interest of many donors. Furthermore,
workers’ remittances have generated an important flow of resources, estimated at around
US$900 million in 2006 1 which supported economic growth and social protection in
Senegal.

2.      In 2006 however, Senegal’s economic performance moved away from the
historical trend, with a real GDP growing by 2.3 percent and a significant increase in
fiscal and external deficits which are largely explained by two main factors: (i) the surge
in international oil prices and by financial difficulties in the real sector of the economy,
particularly the electricity sector; and (ii) the significant increase in public wages and
investments. As a result, the fiscal deficit rose from 3.0 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5.8
percent in 2006, leading to the first accumulation of arrears vis-à-vis the private sector
since 1997.

3.      In 2006 and in the first months of 2007, Senegal suffered from a severe energy
crisis evidenced by power shortages, low quality and high cost of energy services;
increased dependence on expensive imported petroleum products, and deep financial
problems in key government owned energy companies. The situation of the energy
sector has been worsening overtime and its inability to absorb a combination of factors,
was at the root of the deterioration of the energy sector situation: (a) lack of timely
investments for maintenance and expansion, especially in the power sector; (b) lack of
attention to the growing financial problems of the sector; (c) delayed and partial
adjustment of electricity tariffs and petroleum retail prices to reflect rapidly increasing
costs; (d) poor management of the two main energy companies, SENELEC and SAR; and
(e) political interference in decision-making and management of the utilities.

    This figure does not include non-official transfers.



                                                           1
4.      In 2007 and 2008, the financial situation of SENELEC and SAR had become a
huge concern for the Government. The dramatic increase in international oil prices made
things worse. The energy crisis led to significant pressures on the national budget and on
the fiscal position of Senegal. Public resources that should have been allocated to the
social sectors were redirected to the energy sector. In the period 2005-2008, about
US$350 million were transferred from the budget to the energy sector. The energy crisis
also had direct and measurable consequences on Senegal’s economic performance: the
weak economic performance of 2006 (2.3% GDP growth) was for a large part related to
the problems of the energy sector.

5.      This Development Policy Credit (DPC) of SDR 49.1 million (US$80 Million
equivalent) was designed to support the policy changes needed to restore the financial
equilibrium of Senegal’s energy sector with particular emphasis on the electricity sub-
sector as well as activities related to the importing, refining, storing and distributing
petroleum products in Senegal. Such policy changes were seen as critical for a sustained
expansion of the energy sector both to support Senegal’s economic growth and meet the
demands of the population for a stable and reliable energy supply. This also required an
improved performance and governance by the main energy companies especially
SENELEC, the national power utility and SAR, the petroleum refinery company. The
government’s energy sector investment program and this operation enjoyed strong
support from the donors’ community and the private sector. The latter was particularly
involved in power generation, through two independent power producers (IPPs).

6.      The Government recognized that: (i) a performing energy sector is essential for a
successful implementation of its growth strategy and for freeing-up budgetary resources
essential to the social sectors; (ii) a comprehensive strategy is required; and (iii) a
sustained effort will be needed for the recovery of the energy sector.

7.      To demonstrate its commitment the Government laid out a new vision and
strategy described in the February 2008 Energy Sector Development Policy Letter. It
called for a two-pronged approach: (a) Accelerating investment both in urban and in rural
areas to provide energy to the economy and the population, to increase the quality of the
services, and to reduce costs. Impressive actions had been underway since 2007 regarding
investment in electricity generation, others were planned to increase access and the
supply of petroleum products, bringing together private, public sector and donors
expertise and financing; and (b) Improving the operational and financial performance of
SENELEC and SAR, the two main companies in the energy sector, by financially
restructuring them, controlling costs and establishing performance targets, increasing
transparency and governance, and mobilizing private sector expertise and financing.

8.      The government requested the Bank to work with other donors on critical issues
of the energy sector such as financial restructuring, institutional reform, diversification of
energy sources, etc, through policy advice and financing.

9.       The funds provided under this DPC were to be disbursed in two tranches. The
first tranche of SDR 34.4 million equivalent was to be disbursed upon effectiveness on



                                              2
the basis of actions already taken by the Government. The second tranche of SDR 14.7
million equivalent was to be disbursed once the conditions of second tranche release, as
discussed below, would be met.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

10.      The primary objective of this operation is to ensure a sustained and sound long-
term development of electricity services and supply of petroleum products for Senegal.
To achieve this objective, the operation comprises: (a) measures to allow the power
utility (SENELEC) to restore by end of calendar year 2009 its financial equilibrium and
to meet standard financial and credit worthiness ratios; and (b) policy measures aimed at
ensuring that the electricity and the downstream hydrocarbon subsectors operate in an
efficient and transparent way with adequate governance; and (c) measures to ensure a
sustainable long term development of Senegal’s energy sector.

11.    The complete list of key indicators is given in section F: Results Framework
Analysis above.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

12.    The original project objective was not revised over the life of the project.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

13.     This operation covered three policy areas meant to prevent the recurrence of the
financial crisis experienced by Senegal’s energy sector in 2006 and 2007. The action
plans in these three policy areas were expected to provide sustainability and
irreversibility of reform. They were also addressing fundamental issues of the sector
(effectiveness of the Boards of Directors, quality of internal auditing, procurement
processes, regulatory frameworks and institutional restructuring) and long term issues
through the investment program.

14.     The policy areas were: (i) Restoring the financial viability and sustainability of
the electricity and downstream hydrocarbon sub-sectors; (ii) Improving the governance of
these two sub-sectors; and (iii) Ensuring the long term development of the energy sector.

       Policy Area 1: Restoring the financial viability and sustainability of the
electricity and downstream hydrocarbon sub-sectors. Policy area 1 encompasses
actions needed to restore and maintain the financial health of SENELEC and SAR over
the medium to long term with the specific objectives of restoring SENELEC key
financial ratios through recapitalization and refinancing, clearance of arrears, increasing
working capital, and amortizing SAR accumulated debt. Investment in electricity
generation and unloading and storage facilities for petroleum products were seen as an
essential part of the Government and companies’ strategies for financial viability.



                                             3
       Policy Area 2: Improving the governance of the electricity and hydrocarbon
sub-sectors. Policy area 2 encompasses measures aimed at improving the governance of
SENELEC and SAR. Key governance actions related to reporting, procurement,
performance of the Boards of Directors, internal auditing and, sector organization and
structure.

       Policy Area 3: Long Term Development of the Energy Sector. To ensure a
sustainable long term development of the power and hydrocarbon subsectors, the
Government main policy goals were to: (a) increase energy security by diversifying
energy sources; (b) develop a new legal and regulatory framework promoting increased
private sector participation; (c) implement a demand side-management and energy
efficiency program; and (d) increase coordination between the Government, its
development partners and the private sector. Timely implementation of priority
investments in the electricity and hydrocarbon subsectors (in particularly storage facilities
and sea-lines) was deemed essential for the development of Senegal’s energy sector.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

15.     The policy areas were not revised during implementation.

1.6 Other significant changes

16.     The DPC second tranche release of SDR14.7 Million was cancelled on December
28, 2010 not only because several key conditions for second tranche release were
unlikely to be met even with an additional extension of the closing date, but also because
the program had lost much of its relevance and potential impact towards achieving the
viability and sustainability of the energy sector.

17.    Following the first six month extension (from June 30, 2010 to December 31,
2010), the Government of Senegal did not seek to further extend the Credit closing date
of December 31, 2010, and requested cancellation of the undisbursed funds, which were
eventually recommitted to the Senegal - Tertiary Education Project approved in May
2011.

09/05/2008 and the first tranche was released 20 days later.

                                        Tranche 1                                               Status
 Policy Area 1: Restoring the financial viability and financial sustainability of the
 electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors
 1. Partial recapitalization of SENELEC through the transfer by the Government of                Met
 SENEGAL to SENELEC of an amount equal to 65 billion FCFA (“2007 Recapitalization
 Amount”).
 2. Cosigned letter by State Minister, Minister of Economy and Finance and by Minister of        Met
 Energy, confirming decision and commitments by the Government of SENEGAL to:

      amount equal to 37 billion FCFA in Fiscal Year 2008 (”2008 Recapitalization
      Amount”) and of an amount equal to 7 billion FCFA in Fiscal Year 2009 (”2009
      Recapitalization Amount”) so as to enable SENELEC to: (A) achieve a debt-service
      coverage ratio of at least 1.2 in Fiscal Year 2009, 1.3 in Fiscal Year 2010 and 1.4 in
      each Fiscal Year thereafter; (B) reduce its accounts receivable so that in Fiscal Year
      2008 and at all times thereafter, they do not exceed 95 days; (C) reduce its arrears to
      its suppliers so that they do not exceed 100 days in Fiscal Year 2008, 95 days in
      Fiscal Year 2009 and 90 days at all times thereafter;
      (ii) make further transfers to SENELEC in Fiscal Year 2008 (in addition to the 2008
      Recapitalization Amount) in amounts sufficient to enable SENELEC to earn an
      amount equal to its Maximum Authorized Revenue, as decided by CRSE during its
      Extraordinary Revision in Fiscal Year 2008 (“2008 Maximum Authorized Revenue
      Amount”);
      (iii) adjust SENELEC’s electricity tariffs so that its average electricity tariff is
      sufficient to enable it in Fiscal Year 2009 to produce revenues, without budgetary
      transfers from the Recipient, equal to its Maximum Authorized Revenue, as decided
      by CRSE during its Extraordinary Revision in Fiscal Year 2008 (“2009 Maximum
      Authorized Revenue Amount”);
      (iv) reschedule the existing arrears on SENELEC’s debt to the Recipient over 5
      years, with no penalty interest; and
       (v) make a further transfer to SENELEC in Fiscal Year 2009 (in addition to the
      2009 Recapitalization Amount), of an amount equal to 9 billion FCFA in the form of
      a subordinated shareholder loan, repayable commencing in Fiscal Year 2011.
 3. Decision by the Recipient, following the decision by the Board of Directors of SAR, to       Met
 recapitalize SAR by the end of Fiscal Year 2009 in accordance with the requirements of
 the OHADA Legislation.

19.     Second tranche release: The disbursement of the second tranche of the DPC
required that the Bank be satisfied that: (a) the macroeconomic framework remains
appropriate, (b) the implementation of the energy sector reform overall program is
satisfactory; and (c) the critical actions of the overall program (“Second Tranche
Conditions”) were implemented.

20.     The Second Tranche Conditions covered the three policy areas and had been
selected to ensure the completion of the recapitalization and refinancing of SENELEC
and the electricity tariff adjustment process, putting in place transparent procurement
rules for SENELEC and SAR in accordance with the National Procurement Code,
strengthening the internal audit of these two companies, putting in place an efficient
regulatory framework for the downstream hydrocarbon sub-sector, supporting new and
renewable energies, and deciding on a least-cost investment program. The detailed status
of implementation at credit closing is given below:

 Policy Area 1: Restoring the financial viability and financial sustainability of the
 electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors
 Further partial recapitalization of SENELEC                  Met: Following the disbursement of the DPO first
 through the transfer by the Recipient to                     tranche, the government transferred the 2008

Creation of an agency to be responsible for                Not met: The Government has prepared a draft law
regulating the import, refinery, storage, and              to create a Hydrocarbon Regulatory Agency and

                                                           under the Ministry of Energy, carried out some
                                                           regulatory functions such as monitoring the pricing
                                                           level and structure. It had a limited interaction with
                                                           the industry and did not comprehensively cover
                                                           many areas of the downstream petroleum sector
                                                           such as the import, transport, handling, storage and
                                                           distribution of petroleum products. In addition, its
                                                           powers of enforcement were very limited. The
                                                           Government recently announced that it is now
                                                           considering establishing a single regulatory agency

                                                           hydrocarbon). This may require amending the 1998

21.     The five conditions precedent to the release of the first tranche were met and the
tranche was released on September 25, 2008. Out of the 11 conditions attached to the
release of the second tranche, only two were met, five were met only partially and four
were not met at all. Some of the conditionalities were loosely linked to the achievement
of the project development objective, such as the unbundling of SENELEC meant to
promote private sector participation, but were premature in view of the situation of the
sector. The adoption by the Board of SENELEC of the master plans for the production,
transport and distribution carried more form than substance. This applies equally to the
same condition on the refinery company (SAR). The creation of a regulatory agency for
hydrocarbons was not at it turned out a pressing need and the Bank should have either
postponed the issue for another day or examined other alternatives such as the creation of
a multi-sector regulatory agency combining electricity and hydrocarbons (which the
government did after delaying the creation of an agency solely dedicated to
hydrocarbons) or beefed up the existing Commission Nationale des Hydrocarbures, etc.

22.    As mentioned in section 1.6 above, the GoS requested in its letter dated December
28, 2010, the cancellation of the DPC second tranche for the amount of SDR 14.7 million
(US$ 24 million). The cancellation was proposed because a number of key conditions for
second tranche release could not be met before the closing date of December 31, 2010, or
even during a reasonable extension of the later (e.g. six months), if it were to be granted.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

23.    The following factors had a major impact on the implementation of the project,
prevented the fulfillment of the conditions for second tranche release and the
achievement of the objectives of the project.

       1. The increase in the price of fuel: The energy crisis of 2008, with a barrel at
          U$147 in July 2008, was exceptional in its severity. Fuel price increases had a
          detrimental effect on SENELEC’s recovery efforts and made difficult
          financial transfers by the government to the electricity sub-sector.

          In addition, the international food and financial shocks over 2007-08 slowed
          the economy down through lower remittances, foreign direct investment and
          tourism, boosted the price level, and resulted in a significant deterioration of
          Senegal’s external and fiscal positions, and thus of the Government’s ability
          to provide timely allocations for SENELEC to meet its MAR.

       2. Weakened government commitment: The government was very active in
          the preparation of this operation, and remained generally quite focused on the
          attainment of the project development objective. However, the Government’s
          commitment was dampened by its inability to implement a number of reforms
          such as the increase of SENELEC’s revenues through tariff adjustment and
          restoring SENELEC’s financial viability; complete the unbundling of
          SENELEC; strengthen the Governance of sector institutions; etc.

          One of the program’s main goals, which was to fully restore SENELEC’s
          financial viability without subsidy from the national budget from 2009, had
          not been reached for a number of reasons including: the dramatic surge in oil
          prices in 2008 which sharply increased electricity production costs; the sharp
          increase in budget compensations required of the government to bridge the
          tariff deficit in 2007-2009; and the limitations in residential consumer
          affordability, due to the spike in oil prices and the impacts in Senegal of the
          international financial crisis. As a result, despite some tariff adjustments
          between 2007 and 2009 (including at one time a tariff decrease when fuel
          prices declined early in 2009), the authorities were unable to set a tariff
          benchmarked to SENELEC’s costs and performance and tried to address
          SENELEC’s financial problems through significant budgetary transfers and
          limited tariff increases, but this approach soon proved its limits. The repeated
          large government budget transfers to the energy sector were not sustainable as
          these were having negative consequences on availability of funds for the
          social sectors and on the country’s fiscal position. At the same time,
          increasing electricity tariffs when those tariffs are considered high by regional
          standards was not easy in a difficult social context where consumers were
          becoming more and more vocal and when SENELEC’s services quality was
          declining. This was compounded by SENELEC’s inability to mobilize debt or
          capital financing to cover its operational deficit.



                                            9
3. Lower priority for unbundling: The unbundling of SENELEC that was
   foreseen under the DPO had lost its urgency compared to the urgent need to
   durably restore the quality of electricity supply, while further private
   participation in the electricity sector (beyond the three existing IPPs) was not
   a reasonable prospect until the operational and financial position of the energy
   sector improved and tariff levels actually reflected the costs of the service.

4. The changes of ownership of SAR: The DPC's specific governance
   conditions for the formerly government-owned refining company (SAR) had
   been overtaken by events with the change in ownership of SAR, to majority
   private shareholding. This however did not eliminate the need for appropriate
   regulation in the downstream hydrocarbon sector. The related objective of
   creating an independent Regulatory Agency for the hydrocarbon sector was
   not met as the government: (i) did not see it as a pressing issue because the
   existing Commission Nationale des Hydrocarbures (CNH) was already taking
   regulatory decisions in the hydrocarbons sector in matters related to pricing
   for example though its purview could be extended to other areas; and (ii) the
   government wished to have more time to examine the opportunity of having a
   single regulatory commission for petroleum products and electricity and
   therefore saving on scarce managerial and regulatory talent. The change in
   SAR’s ownership led Government to reconsider its approach on regulatory
   issues for hydrocarbons.

5. Delays in coming into stream of new generating capacity: Lack of realism
   on the part of SENELEC and the Ministry of Energy concerning the coming
   into stream of new generation capacity, which would have changed the
   prospects of the sector in terms of greater capacity and lower cost through
   sizeable natural gas and coal-fired power plants, significantly affected
   SENELEC’s financial position and projections for financial self-sustainability.
   The new target date for cheaper coal-fired power to come on-stream is now
   2014.

6. Weak governance environment: During the implementation of the project,
   there were tensions between the Ministry of Finance designated as
   implementing agency and the Ministry of Energy which was charged with
   carrying out major elements of the program. There was also interference of
   the Ministry of Energy into the day-to-day operation and management of
   SENELEC. SENELEC – whose role was central in these reforms - was not
   empowered to take position as or to be responsible for some of the actions that
   had a direct impact on its financial viability, such as of the purchase of fuel,
   which was directly managed by the Minister of Energy.

7. Inadequate tariff formula: The formula for SENELEC’s revenue control
   that prevailed, between 2005 and 2009, was inadequate to ensure SENELEC’s
   financial viability on a yearly basis insofar as the formula took into account
   future, lower production costs in setting current prices. However, with the



                                    10
             second revision of the tariff methodology, concluded in May 2010, the
             authorities decided to maintain the same approached (i.e. a price cap averaged
             over five years)2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

24.     M&E Design: The policy matrix, designed in consultation with several
stakeholders including the IMF, gave an accurate picture of Senegal’s electricity and
petroleum products sub-sectors, measures accomplished or to be taken, benchmarks yet
to be reached as well as program outputs linked to the operation. The key indicators were
relevant and designed to measure periodically the progress made towards the attainment
of the PDO.

25.     M&E Implementation and Use: The policy matrix and the corresponding sections
of the legal agreements were an essential M&E tool for the government. The Bank team
had always had access to all data it needed from the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
the Ministry of Energy and SENELEC to monitor key program indicators. There were
occasional delays in obtaining data but the ministries and SENELEC’s data systems were
adequate for the purposes of M&E. Bank supervision of the operation by the Bank’s team
based in Dakar with support as needed from Washington was close. The team was
focused on the progress towards the satisfaction of conditions precedent to the release of
the credit tranches and the achievement of the program development objective. However
the team spent a major part of its time on issues related to SENELEC because it was
simply the largest issue of the energy sector and also because SAR became a majority
privately owned company. The ISRs and aide memoires were comprehensive and
allowed both the government and the Bank to follow up the operation’s progress and
agree on actions to be taken.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

26.     Despite the decision to cancel the second tranche of the DPL, the sector policy
dialogue remained strong between the government, the Bank and other donors (including
the IMF). At the Government’s request the Bank team first considered the recommitment
of the undisbursed funds to the Senegal – Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC
V), subject to the following three key conditions: (1) adoption by the Recipient of an
emergency plan acceptable to the Association designed to remove bottlenecks in the
electricity sector and improve SENELEC’s financial situation, (2) Signed letter from the
independent regulatory agency (a) stating that SENELEC’s request to establish a new


2
  In February 2011, the Minister of State informed the Bank of the important decisions taken with regard to
changes to SENELEC’s concession contract and to the tariff setting formula. With regard to the contract,
the duration of the tariff conditions has been reduced from 5 to 3 years, and the compensation will be paid
quarterly rather than on a yearly basis. On the formula side, the main issues were: dropping the “smoothing”
and undertaking a review of sales and inflation indices on a yearly basis; reducing the period considered in
determining the composite index of inflation, etc.



                                                    11
tariff formula is receivable, and (b) indicating the schedule for the establishment of such
formula, and (3) changes to SENELEC’s tariff structure or adjustment of SENELEC’s
electricity tariffs to (a) produce additional revenues and (b) increase energy efficiency /
improve demand-side management of energy resources.

27.     Despite significant progress in reaching the three conditions, it was politically
impossible for the Government to comply with the third condition without significant
restoration in the quality of service. The Bank decided not to recommit the undisbursed
funds under the PRSC V, but rather recommitted them under the Senegal – Tertiary
Education Project approved in May 2011, while continuing the engagement in the energy
sector through a new proposed SIL.

28.    The appointment in October 2010 of a new Minister for the energy sector has
brought a new impetus, vision and direction for energy sector recovery and reform.
With support from international and national firms, the new Minister mandated the
preparation of a major restructuring and recovery plan for the whole energy sector, based
on a 360 degree diagnostic and audit.

29.     The Bank team advised the government and its team of consultants in the
preparation of the 2010-2014 electricity emergency plan (Plan Takkal) aimed at (a)
removing the electricity supply bottlenecks by ensuring additional power capacity prior
to the commissioning of a coal-fired power plant scheduled for 2014/2015 and enhancing
demand side management and energy efficiency; and (b) addressing SENELEC’s cash-
flow and financing constraints. The Bank has found the program relevant to address the
issues of the electricity sector in Senegal and decided to support it through a new
investment operation, which is being prepared for Board presentation in FY12.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

30.      With the continuing crisis of the energy sector, the reforms at the heart of the
DPC remain very much relevant today, nonetheless program priorities, means and timing
to meet the objective have changed. That is why the dialogue on the energy sector
reform is expected to continue under the new energy operation now under preparation.
The development objective of the DPC is therefore still in line with the country’s
priorities. It is also in line with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2007-
2010 and particularly its Pillar I: accelerated growth/wealth creation. Strengthening GDP
growth to an annual rate of 7 percent, which is about 2 percent higher than the historical
average, is perceived by Senegal as one of its prerequisites for reaching the MDGs. WBG
support in the energy sector was especially directed to achieve the following outcomes:
(i) promoting a competitive investment climate; (ii) building and maintaining basic
infrastructure for growth; (iii) promoting good governance; and (iv) financial viability of
sector institutions.




                                            12
31.     Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis for this DPC was
quite extensive, and based inter alia on the work of the authorities in preparing their
Letter of Development Policy (February 2008), various consultants’ reports and on the
findings and recommendations of a number of Bank reports, particularly the PRSP and
the CAS. The program for this operation was defined in close collaboration with other
donors such the French Development Agency (AFD), which was also supporting the
program with Euros30 million of budgetary support with the same conditions and
triggers, and with the International Monetary Fund, which was particularly preoccupied
by the public finance risks posed by the energy sector.

32.    Assessment of the operation’s design. The project failed to take into account the
Bank’s recommendations regarding good practice principles for the application of
conditionality in DPC such as: (i) reinforcing ownership of the Ministry of Energy and
SENELEC; (ii) customizing the accountability framework and modalities of Bank
support to country circumstances and in particular the balancing of the conditionalities
and financing between tranches; (iii) choosing only actions critical for achieving results
as conditions for disbursement; and (v) choosing the right instruments to effect the
changes on the financial situation of SENELEC.

33.     The energy sector reform program was managed by the Ministry of Energy, and
involved a Government team comprised of senior staff from the Ministry of Energy, the
Prime Minister’s office, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Budget as
well as the managing directors of the key energy companies. Many donors, the World
Bank Group, AFD, African Development Bank, GTZ, KFW, Islamic Development Bank
and BOAD, participated in the initial discussions to develop a consensus on the design of
the reform program. Other donors and financiers, notably IFC, PROPARCO, European
Investment Bank, China, and the private sector were also involved in the financing of the
investment program for the energy sector. The specific reform measures supported by the
DPC are those set in the Letter of Sector Development Policy approved by the Council of
Ministers and forwarded to the Bank by the government in February 2008. Nevertheless,
the Ministry of Energy, and SENELEC, had little sense of ownership of the program as
the official implementing agency was the Ministry of Economy and Finance. They in
effect had little handle on issues affecting them such as budgetary transfers to SENELEC
or electricity tariffs.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by
operations and outcomes)

34.    The primary objective of this operation which was to ensure a sustained and
sound long-term development of electricity services and supply of petroleum products for
Senegal was not met. As can be seen in the Results Framework Analysis in Section F of
the data sheet, out of 14 key project development indicators only two were met. They
concern the completion of the generation, transport and distribution master plans and the
development of a demand side management and energy efficiency programs. Seven,
almost all related to SENELEC’s financial situation and governance, were not met and



                                           13
five were only met partially, due in part to the fact that during the program certain
requirements no longer applied to SAR as a private company.

35.     One of the program’s main goals, which was to fully restore SENELEC’s
financial viability without subsidy from national budget from 2009, was not reached for a
number of reasons including: the dramatic and unforeseen surge in oil prices in 2008,
which sharply increased SENELEC’s operating costs; the fiscal crisis, which resulted in
government delays in budgetary transfers; and various disruptions in fuel supply to
SENELEC in 2009 and 2010. In addition, despite tariff adjustments (including at one
time a tariff decrease) between 2007 and 20093, the authorities have been unable to set a
tariff benchmarked to SENELEC’s costs and performance because of the costly
generation mix heavily dominated by diesel generators and of customer affordability
constraints. Furthermore, the tariff methodology (i.e. a price cap averaged over five
years) did not ensure the financial viability of SENELEC. This is compounded by
SENELEC’s inability to mobilize financing for its operational deficit, and by institutional
shortcomings in terms of managing for efficiency.

36.     The project failed to ensure sustainability and some elements of the program such
as the unbundling of SENELEC, while still necessary, became less urgent. The DPC was
over ambitious in believing that the sector could be transformed in about two years. Even
if one were to exclude the effect of the unexpected rise in fuel prices, it would have been
difficult to reach the program’s objectives within such a short timeframe. The tranching
of the disbursement and conditionalities were not balanced and this may have had an
impact on incentives to push for the fulfillment of the conditionalities for release of the
second tranche. The first tranche with 70% of the financing had only five relatively easy
to meet conditions. The second tranche, on the other hand, was only supported by 30%
of the financing but was loaded with eleven conditions which were difficult to satisfy,
and for which ownership declined in light of the evolving context (fuel price surge, SAR
privatization, critical energy shortfalls, etc.).

37.     The quality and reliability of electricity services in fact worsened significantly
during the implementation of the program. even though the GoS and SENELEC have
taken important actions toward achieving the objectives of the program, including: i/
diversifying the energy mix to lower generation costs, with a coal power plant to be
commissioned in 2014/15, additional hydropower (OMVS FELOU to be commissioned
in 2013 and GOUINA in 2015/16) and the contemplated conversion of some generation
units (GTI’s IPP, SENELEC’s TAG 2) to natural gas; ii/ increasing private participation
in the sector with majority private participation in the oil refinery (SAR); iii/ initiating the
reform towards unbundling of SENELEC’s activities with the completion of the separate
accounting for business lines; iv/ implementing legal and regulatory measures to ensure
the long term development of the energy sector, such as the renewable energy law, and

    With the current energy mix, Senegal has one of the highest electricity tariffs in West Africa.




                                                       14
enhancing the powers of the Commission Nationale des Hydrocarbures to regulate the
import, refining, storage and distribution of petroleum products.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

38.     The unsatisfactory rating is justified by the fact that, in spite of the Government’s
and SENELEC’s efforts, the program’s main goal, which was to fully restore
SENELEC’s financial viability without subsidy from national budget from 2009, was not
reached. The Development Objective of the project was and remains very relevant and
fully in line with the country’s priorities to establish a sustainable energy sector and
contain and eventually stop the deleterious impacts of the sector on growth prospects and
public finance. However, the program set to reach it was over ambitious and the
instruments, such as budgetary transfers that the Government relied on in the end were
unsustainable.

39.     SENELEC’s situation remains precarious, mainly because of (i) a volatile
external environment (global economic crisis and fuel crisis); (ii) the difficult transition
from a predominantly hydrocarbon based power system to a more diversified one to
mitigate shocks of future oil price increases; and (iii) the difficulties in attracting
private interest in the sector until SENELEC’s financial position is strengthened to a
point at which it can reliably pay for privately generated electricity. Several actions under
the DPC operation were postponed such as the unbundling of SENELEC and the
establishment of a regulatory agency for petroleum products.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

40.     Senegal’s overriding economic challenge is to raise growth and reduce poverty.
In this context, the reduction of the sector’s burden on public finances could have had a
positive impact on poverty reduction by making more resources available for social
services to low-income populations. The DPC however failed to reduce the energy
sector’s burden on public finances as SENELEC is still in need of government support to
operate.

41.      Furthermore, the objective of cost-reflective energy prices, as supported under the
DPC, had potential negative social impacts. With respect to electricity prices, the
Government has indicated that further adjustments to electricity prices will not be applied
to the social tranche (less than 40kWh/month). In addition, to mitigate the effects of
energy price increases, a demand side management and energy efficiency program have
been launched to reduce electricity costs and provide households and other consumers of
energy services with options to reduce their energy expenditures, including a program of
efficient (CFL) lamps. The tariff structure has been revised to introduce progressivity in
tariff blocks to encourage energy saving and provide a lifeline tariff for poor households.


                                             15
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

42.     The Program was instrumental in strengthening the governance of the electricity
sector, especially through the establishment of two committees on finance and internal
audit to support SENELEC’s Board of Directors and in completing the accounting
separation within SENELEC. An in-depth audit of SENELEC was completed after the
closing of the operation. The regulatory agency for petroleum products was not
established as the government preferred to evaluate alternative options, notably to create
a single regulatory agency for electricity and petroleum products. Streamlining
procurement procedures at SENELEC was problematic in light of an established practice
to purchase fuel on a sole source basis through the Ministry. Fuel procurement is now the
responsibility of SAR. In the hydrocarbon sector, SAR became a private company during
the implementation period.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

43.    The project did not have unintended outcomes or impacts, except that the
increased budgetary transfers to SENELEC in light of the fuel spike may have
contributed to changes in public expenditure allocations that are difficult to attribute to
the operation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
 Rating: High

44.     The closing of the DPC operation did not do away with the concerns that led to it
in the first place namely, the inability of SENELEC to operate without government
support, and the burden of the energy sector on public finances at the expense of other
socially important needs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

45.     The Bank team in cooperation with AFD, other donors, the IMF and the GoS
designed a program based on a large and robust body of analytical work on the electricity
and petroleum product sub-sectors. The DPC operation was however ambitious and
difficult to carry out over a two-year implementation period even if one did not factor in
the unexpected and unpredictable spike in fuel prices. There were too many conditions
(indeed they increased as a result of the internal review process during preparation) and



                                            16
their distribution between the tranches was not balanced. The program was expecting a
too rapid financial recovery in an internationally difficult context and a too ambitious
reform path for SENELEC, not having sufficiently taken into account the rigidities in the
energy sector in Senegal such as government attitude towards a tariff increase. At the
same time, Government ownership as reflected in the Letter of Sector Policy appeared
strong during the design phase.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.     A very dedicated and focused project team made for good supervision. The ISRs
and aide memoires were comprehensive and made project follow up easy. All issues
were reviewed during the supervision missions to ensure that the appropriate actions were
taken to meet the disbursement conditions of the two tranches (i.e. the Bank was
instrumental regarding the tariff increases and tariff compensation from state budget).
Unfortunately, the second tranche was not disbursed for the reasons explained earlier.
Problems and difficulties experienced during implementation were promptly brought to
the attention of management and to the GoS. The Bank team communicated widely,
including at the highest level of government, to draw attention to the problems of the
sector through aide memoires, management letters, presentation and meetings. Finally,
the supervision was intense4 and continuous as it was carried out by the team based in
Dakar with support as needed from Bank’s HQ in Washington.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

47.     The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory reflects the shortcomings in the design of
the DPC operation. Its PDO was in line with country’s priorities and its indicators,
though too many, served in following the achievement of the operation objectives. The
supervision team was based in Dakar and the dialogue with the GoS, SENELEC and
SAR was very close and sustained. The team also closely liaised with other donors such
as the AFD and with the IMF.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
 Rating: Unsatisfactory

48.    The GoS was very involved in the DPC operation during its preparation and
implementation. However, the level of attention it has given to the sector and
commitment to DPC actions fluctuated from strong to weak and strong again near
closing. The weak commitment revealed itself when it came to adjusting tariffs, taking

    Formal supervision mission were carried out every three to four months (most of them jointly with AFD)




                                                     17
timely action to resolve implementation and policy issues, and enhancing the governance
of sector entities. The government found itself in a bind between continuing budgetary
transfers to the energy sector it could not sustain and increasing already high tariffs that
would hurt consumers while not being able to bring on-stream the cost-reducing changes
in energy generation mix quickly enough. The consumers were particularly vocal
concerning the quality of service and tariffs. There was also the issue of insufficient
coordination and disagreements between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Energy regarding sector reform and SENELEC’s recovery. In the end, conditions for the
second tranche release were not met and the tranche was not released.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Unsatisfactory

49.    Although the Ministry of Economy and Finance was laudably able to provide to
SENELEC the tariff compensations in a difficult budgetary context (though with delay),
the implementing agency was the Ministry of Economy and Finance and therefore part of
the government. As such, the rating of the government applies to it as well.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Unsatisfactory

50.    The rating is justified by the fact that most of the conditions prior to the release of
the second tranche of the DPC were not met. As a consequence, the PDO was not
achieved and SENELEC and the sector remain in crisis.

6. Lessons Learned

51.     Importance of dialogue and coordination with government and
donors/partners: The quality of the dialogue was high and the team was pro-active in
the advice given to the authorities before and during the implementation of the program.
This operation is also a good example of coordination and dialogue with other donors,
particularly the AFD, but also with the IMF because of the macroeconomic implications
of the situation in the energy sector.

52.    Field based staff and dialogue: Another lesson learned is that the rapidly
changing circumstances of the sector required an intensive and continuous dialogue
which was possible because of the presence of the Bank’s energy team in the field office
in Dakar.

53.    Need for more pro-activity: Although tight in an implementation period of just
over two years, the DPC second tranche should perhaps have been cancelled earlier or the
funds reallocated to a new energy operation sooner when it became clear there was little
chance that the conditions for the release of the tranche will be met before the closing
date, however the team opted to respond favorably to the Ministry of Economy and
Finance’s request to remain engaged in the sector and extended the closing date by six
months.



                                             18
54.     Choosing the right instrument: While it can be argued that the DPL is useful
instrument for reform, it is clear that a two tranches DPL is not flexible, the number of
conditions (5 for the first tranche and 11for the second tranche) was excessive5 and the
distribution between the tranches was not balanced with 70% disbursed upfront and most
of the difficult conditions back loaded. A series of DPL’s with limited objectives and
financing may bring more flexibility and be more suited to country and sector
circumstances than a single complex operation.

55.      Focus on underlying causes and design simple and feasible solutions to
address them. Some key conditions based on specific targets have created an excessive
focus on monitoring of financial indicators and targets rather than on the underlying
causes for SENELEC’s poor financial performance. Examples are SENELEC’s
recapitalization over the 2007-2009 period to restore its financial equilibrium and meet
standard financial ratios by end of calendar year 2009 such as the debt service coverage
ratio, days of accounts receivable and arrears to suppliers. This objective was not
ultimately met. If a part is met (e.g. DSCR) the other is off track (e.g. days of accounts
receivable), etc. It was not clear how SENELEC was supposed to reach these multiple
targets without major changes in its cost structure, especially following the surge in fuel
prices..

56.    Need for timely supporting investments: The reform program should have been
more modest and focused and perhaps supported by an investment component that would
have supported the achievement of some key pre-conditions. For instance, an investment
operation that would help diversify the energy mix to lower generation costs would have
contributed to reaching the development objectives of the program.

57.     Realism in the pace of reform and managing expectations: As has been shown
through the implementation of this program, although the temptation is to do many things
as fast as possible, this temptation should be resisted and one should be realistic about
what can be achieved and at what pace, given country and sector circumstances.

     I.         Introduction

     The World Bank has put at the disposal of Senegal an IDA credit of SDR49.1 million
     or US$80 million to finance the changes in public policies and contribute to the
     restoration of the financial equilibrium of the energy sector in Senegal with particular
     emphasis on the electricity sector and the activities linked to the importation refining,
     storage and distribution of petroleum products. This support as well as a number of
     public and/or private projects, either ongoing or under preparation, are essential to the
     sustained expansion of the energy sector. The investment program of the energy
     sector (and this operation) has the support of a relatively important group of donors.
     The private sector is also very much involved in important activities.

     The closing date of the Financing Agreement of the Project was December 31, 2010.

     The financing was divided into two tranches: A tranche to be disbursed at project
     effectiveness and a second to be disbursed when conditions for its disbursement are
     met.

     The distribution of the financing is shown below:

II.         Objectives of the project

       The main objective of this operation is to ensure a reliable and sustained long term
       development of the generation and distribution of electricity, as well as the supply of
       petroleum products to the Senegalese economy. To reach this central objective, the
       operation comprises two specific components:

            a) A financial aid component to the government of Senegal to help SENELEC
               reach a financial equilibrium, meet certain financial ratios and become credit
               worthy at the end of calendar year 2009 at the latest;

            b) A component of sector policy measures meant to develop an efficient and
               transparent development and operation of the electricity and downstream
               petroleum sectors along with investments and suitable governance.

The program of support to the recovery of the energy sector in Senegal was aimed at the
financial viability, the improvement of the governance and the long term enhancement of
the electricity and hydrocarbons sub-sectors.

The program fits neatly in the economic and social program of the government and its
strategy for poverty reduction. The implementation of a reform program for the energy
sector with a focus on electricity and hydrocarbons constitute a key element of the
government’s strategy.

III.        Results and Impacts of the Project

A disbursement of 70% of the Credit (24 billion FCFA) for the Energy Sector Recovery
Project was dedicated to an injection of equity by the government into SENELEC. This
was an addition to a transfer from the government budget of 65 billion FCFA.

The second tranche for budgetary support of 14.700.049,12 SDRs was to be disbursed
with the fulfillment of the following conditions:

                     Condition                                Status         Responsibility               Remarks

IV. Difficulties and weaknesses of the project

Given the international financial context, several factors, particularly the increase of the
price of oil in 2008 and the financial crisis, had a significant impact on the activities of
the sector and consequently on the disbursement of the second tranche of the Credit.

In effect, the financial ratios required of SENELEC were not achievable with the
worsening of the international environment. The indicators for SENELEC’s operation
and recovery were too severe.

Moreover, the financial model used to calculate the financial ratios have been modified in
2009 to correct certain problems identified.



                                                                25
We note that the quality of the electricity supply and the difficult financial situation of
SENELEC continue to hamper in a significant manner the economic growth of Senegal
and to pose serious budgetary risks to the government. Therefore, the recovery of the
energy sector project approved in 2007 has in part lost its relevance and its potential
impact on the viability and sustainability of the sector.
