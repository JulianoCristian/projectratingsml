The project\n            also aims at developing and testing an institutional\n            framework for decentralized water resource management\n            through local community participation and promoting private\n            sector participation in the management of water and\n            wastewater utility services. The project consists of three\n            components: a) well drilling and conveyance to Taiz; b) a\n            compensation package for people in the Habir area who will\n            give up water for Taiz, consisting of rural water supply\n            schemes that include a pilot program of activities targeted\n            at women; two demonstration irrigation schemes including\n            wells, piping and technical assistance; school rooms; and\n            studies for an aquifer recharge dike in Habir area; and c)\n            studies of surface and ground water sources for urban and\n            rural development; technical assistance for the preparation\n            of a second phase project for Taiz city and Al Qaidah town;\n            and preparation of a management contract for Taiz National\n            Water and Sanitation Authority branch for implementation in\n            the second phase project."}, "docdt": "1996-07-19T00:00:00Z"}
