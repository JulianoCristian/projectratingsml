The key lessons learned from this project\n            include: Do not combine a pilot approach with an emergency\n            project. In an emergency project, time is scarce.\n            Established, low-risk approaches should be used to deliver\n            results quickly. In a pilot project, new approaches should\n            be tested, the risk of failure should be deliberately taken,\n            and time should be allowed for careful monitoring and\n            evaluation. All risks should be assessed in a comprehensive\n            and realistic manner. At preparation and supervision, staff\n            with all specialties should be included. Project objectives\n            not reflecting reality should be revised and changes should\n            be formalized in the credit agreement. Even at the cost of\n            being limited to a more narrowly focused sectoral approach,\n            avoid three different implementing agencies and Project\n            Management Units. It is essential to have a good\n            understanding of the water resource, the shape of the\n            aquifers and the relation between them, and the\n            relationships between surface and groundwater resources.\n            There is a need to spell out the \"hydraulic goal\"\n            of the project. There is a need for upfront stakeholder\n            analysis which should be used as the basis to select upfront\n            representative stakeholder institutions."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
