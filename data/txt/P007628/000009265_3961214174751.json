"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Solid Waste Management\n            Pilot Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, project sustainability was unlikely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also a satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: complex\n            institutional arrangements, which have impeded the success\n            of many Bank projects, should be avoided in project design.\n            Multiple agency involvement dilutes the focus of\n            accountability and subjects the project to competing agendas\n            and objectives that better coordination does not necessarily\n            solve. Without some type of enforcement pressure,\n            municipalities will be prone to continue to muddle along\n            with the quality of existing solid waste services. Public\n            clamor for better services has not yet reached a high enough\n            pitch to prompt change. The federal government will need to\n            strengthen its enforcement efforts in parallel to the\n            strengthening of enforcement by agencies at the state level.\n            To be effective, such controls will require a harmonized\n            system of regulation among all levels of government. The\n            Bank will need to develop stronger relationships with\n            clients at the local level in order to become more\n            effective. The use of federal agencies to assist local\n            governments has not been an effective means to tackle this problem."}, "docdt": "1996-07-03T00:00:00Z"}
