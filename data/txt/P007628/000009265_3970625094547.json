Project\n            directly for solid waste management.  The project comprises\n            two components.  The pilot component intends to finance the\n            development, testing and evaluation of replicable techniques\n            for the delivery of services in about eight medium-sized\n            municipalities and one metropolitan area.  The national\n            component, to be executed at the federal level, aims to\n            finance technical assistance, consulting services, studies\n            and equipment.  This last component furthermore seeks to\n            help:  (i) define subsector policies and options for\n            effective and efficient delivery of services and to reduce\n            dependence on the Government's budgets.  It will also;\n            (ii) strengthen institutions; (iii) develop plans to address\n            subsector constraints; (iv) undertake plan preparation and\n            prefeasibility studies in 26 selected cities; and (v)\n            prepare follow-up solid waste management projects."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
