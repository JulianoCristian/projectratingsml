THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1549-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
The Project involved the construction at Trombay (Bombay) of a 500
MW unit with triple fiLed boiler (coal, oil or gas), A1lectrical and
mechanical plant including pollution control equipment and associated
civil works. A Bank loan of US$105 million was made to the Tata Electric
Companies (TEC) on February 8, 1979. The Project was to be completed by
December 31, 1982. However, because of substantial delays in the delivery
of equipment and materials, precipitated largely by deveLopments beyond
the control of the borrower, the Project was not completed until
January 1, 1984, and the Loan was not closed until December 31, 1984.
The Project, though successfully completed, was implemented at a
higher cost than was originally estimated, US$241.2 millionl/ compared to
US$209.3 million, largely because of higher than anticipated increases in
the cost of equipment and materials and custom duties, the need to replace
contractors whose performance was inadequate, the acquisition of more
spare parts than specified and an underestimation of the quantities of
cable required. The cost overruns were financed by TEC from its own
resources, additional borrowing from local financial institutions,
suppliers' credit and debentures.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared jointly by the
borrower and the South Asia Region on the basis of the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 1788b-IN, dated March 28, 1978 and the Loan and Project
Agreements, both dated June 19, 1978. The PCR has been amended in light
of the comments of GOI and TEC which are reproduced in Annex 8.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Conpletion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedutes, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government and the Borrower. Comments received from them have been
reproduced as Attachments A and B to the report.

THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT - UMAN 1549-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
Loan 1549-IN was for the construction of a 500 MW unit with a triple
fired boiler (coal, oil or gas), electrical and mechanical plant including
pollution control equipment and associated civil works at Trombay (Bombay).
It was to be implemented by the Tata Electric Companies (TEC), the borrower
of the loan. As per the Staff Appraisal Report estimates, the Project was to
be completed by December 31, 1982 and the loan was to be closed on Mar-h 31,
1984. However, because of delays in the delivery of equipment and materials,
precipitated mostly by developments beyond the control of the borrower, the
Project was not completed until January 1, 1984 and the loan was not closed
until December 31, 1984.  In fact, the completion of the Project would have
been delayed further had the borrower not increased its work force and im'ple-
mented numerous tasks concurrently. For this, the borrower needs to be
commended.
In addition to being commissioned one year behind schedule, the
Project was implemented at a higher cost than was estimated by the Appraisal
Report, US$241.2 million compared to US$209.3 million.l/ The actual cost
exceeded the appraisal estimate largely because of higher than anticipated
increases in the price of the turbogenerator, labor and material for civil
works and custom duties, replacement of contractors for civil works, acquisi-
tion of more spare parts than envisaged at appraisal to take advantage of
favorable internaticnal prices, provision for an additional electrostatic
precipitator, and underestimation of cable quantities required.
Despite these setbacks, the Project was successfully completed and
its objectives were fully achieved. Specifically, the Project assisted in
the transfer of technology for the design, construction and operation of
large thermal power plants whose role in the country's power subsector is
expected to increase substantially over the forseeable future. Moreover,
with the installation of the computerized analogue simulator, the Project has
provided the facilities needed to train local personnel in the operation of
the 500 MW power plants. Finally, the Project has been instrumental in
augmenting the generating capability of TEC, a critical private sector ele-
ment in the country's power subsector.l/

THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1549-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01    Power shortages were widespread throughout India between 1970 and
1976, and several states including Maharashtra were experiencing power cuts
of up to 30%. These shortages, though likely to continue, were expected to
become less acute as the states generation development programs were
implemented and the large thermal power plants, as well as the associated
transmission network, were brought into operation by the Center to augment
the states generating capacity. The Project was to assist in alleviating the
power shortages in the State of Maharashtra and was an integral part of its
generation development program for FY80-FY84.
Maharashtra State Power Subsector
1.02    As in other Indian States,l/ the responsibility for the operation
and development of the power subsector in Maharashtra, including the
regulation of licensees, is assigned to tie State's electricity board. The
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) ge.ierates and distributes
electricity throughout the state except in concession areas served by four
private licensees, the Tata Electric Companies (TEC), the Bombay Suburban
Electric Supply Undertaking (BSES), the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport
Undertaking (BEST) and the Thana Electric Supply Company (TESCO). These
licensees, except TEC, are involved solely in the distribution of electricity
which they purchase from MSEB and TEC, the borrower of the loan.
1.03    As of March 31, 1977, TEC, the largest private licensee in
Maharashtra, was operating four power stations, three hydro and one thermal,
with a total installed capacity of 622 MW. About 54% of the generating
capacity was thermal and the rest hydro. A 40 MW power station at Chola,
which is owned by the Indian Railways, was also connected to the TEC system.
TEC's transmission network, consisting of medium and high voltage lines
(110-kV and 132-kV)2/ was about 2,200 circuit km. It was tied in with
MSEB's 220-kV network at three points with an aggregate step-down capacity of
1,250 MVA. The aggregate transformer capacity of TEC's system was about
3,500 MVA. Losses in the network were relatively low, amounting to about

Annex 1.

about 3% of sales. TEC wss also operating a modern load despatch center at
Trombay.
1.04    TEC was supplying energy in bulk to textile mills and other large
industries, distributing licensees and local authorities in Bombay and
surrounding areas. It was also supplying about 60 MW of power to the Indian
Railways. The Chola station, which was connected to the TEC system at
Kalyan, provided about 25 MW of power to the Indian Railways. The remaining
15 MW was sold to a group of consumers, mainly textile manufacturers, who,
because of the power restrictions, were prepared to pay.a higher price for
Chola power which was wheeled over TEC's system. Charges were collected by
the Mill Owners' Association and passed to Indian Railways via TEC which
applied a "wheeling charge" of 6%. In 1977, TEC was serving a total of 214
customers. The maximum demand on the TEC system was about 1,000 MW, which
necessitated purchases of about 500 MW of power from MSEB.
1.05    TEC consists of three companies:  the Tata Hydroelectric Power Supply
Company Limited, formed in 1910; the Andhra Valley Power Supply Company
Limited, formed in 1916; and the Tata Power Company Limited, formed in 1919.
These companies are a part of the Tata group of enterprises which have
substantial financial resources, an excellent credit rating and a long and
successful history of operations in many industrial and other fields. The
three companies are independent publicly-owned entities in the private
sector; however, they operate as a group under the same management. The
Board of Directors of the three companies, though separate, have four common
members: the Chairman, the Managing Director and two other directors
including the Director of Finance. Other members of each Board include
representatives of the Government of India (GOI), the State Government and
leading industrial and banking institutions. The companies are well managed
utilities, operated in accordance with sound commercial principles. In 1977
the companies together had a staff of 2,645.
1.06    The three companies comprising TEC function as an interconnected
grid. The hydroelect'ic power stations (para 1.03) are owned individually
and the Trombay thermal power station together with the transmission system
and substations are owned jointly in the ratio of 20:30:50 by Tata Hydro,
Andhra Valley and Tata Power, respectively. Although each company operates
under a separate license, a joint license was granted to all three for
Trombay.
1.07    TEC's licenses had been the subject of a series of meetings between
TEC, MSEB and Government of Maharashtra (GOM) during 1977. A satisfactory
settlement of the whole question of license extension and rationalization of
distribution facilities was reached in principle, in September 1977. This
settlement, which had to be formalized, provided for an extension of TEC's
licenses and franchise for a period coterminous with the last repayment of
the Bank loan. In order to ensure that no action would be taken which would
interfere with TEC's performance or adversely affect its financial posicion,



-3-
including delimiting TEC's area of suApply, the formal extension of TEC's
licenses was set as a condition of disbursement of the loan.
Bank Group Involvement
1.08    The Bank Group's involvement with TEC began in 1954 when a Bank loan
of US$16.2 million (Loan 106-IN) was made to finance the construction of two
62.5 MW thermal generating units at Trombay. A second loan of US$9.8 million
(Loan 164-IN) was made in 1957 to expand the generating capacity at Trombay
by another 62.5 MW. The Project was the Bank's third lending operation with
TEC.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin, Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiations and Approval
2.01    COM had given high priority to eliminating restrictions on power
supply by the end of the 1970s and had proposed an investment program of
about US$1.5 billion for the period FY75-FY79 to increase the State's
installed generating capacity to 4,730 MW. However, as less than one half
of the proposed expenditures were approved, the installed generating capacity
was not expected to exceed 3,610 MW by the ene of FY79, implying that load
restrictions, which were increasingly becoming a constraint to the State's
industrial base, would continue into the early 1980s. The generation
developments that were either under implementation or had been approved and
were expected to be commissioned by FY84 are shown below:

come on stream by FY84 but had not been approved are shown in Annex 2.
2.02    The Project, which was an integral part of MSEB's generation
development program, was to be implemented by TEC.  It was assigned to TEC
mainly because the demand on its system had for some years exceeded its firm
generating capacity and had necessitated bulk purchase of power from MSEB,
which by FY77 was in excess of 500 MW (para 1.04). Since MSEB was also
experiencing capacity shortages, implementation of the Project by TEC was
expected to release MSEB's capacity to meet its own demand. Accordingly, the
Project was prepared by TEC with the assistance of its consultant. The
Project was appraised in July and August of 1977, and negotiations were held
in Washington, D.C. in February/March 1978.
Project Objective
2.03    The objective of the Project was to assist in alleviating power
shortages in Maharashtra through the expansion of the generating capacity at
Trombay. In addition, it was to promote institution building by assisting in
the transfer of technology for the design, construction and operation of
large thermal power plants.
Project Description
2.04    The Project consisted of a 500 MW unit with triple fired boiler
(coal, gas or oil), electrical and mechanical plant including pollution
control equipment and associated civil work. It was to be erected on
reclaimed land (ash disposal area) owned by TEC, adjacent to the existing
Trombay power stations. Basic infrastructure facilities for coal handling
and water supply were available at the site and were to be extended to meet
the requirements of the Project.
III.   IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness
3.01    As one of the conditions of loan effectiveness, TEC was required to
complete security arrangements satisfactory to the Bank involving:
(a) a first specific mortgage on the properties provided under the
Project and those subsequently added, pari passu with Indian
financial institutions in respect of their share of co-financing;



-5-
(b)  a first floating charge on all existing immovable and movable assets
held under the Trombay Thermal License pari passu with other
lenders; and
(c)  assignment to the Bank by way of mortgage of the Trombay Thermal
License including extensions and/or renewals thereof.
The other conditions of loan effectiveness required TEC to furnish letters
of unqualified commitment from local financial institutions for loans of
Rs 550 million and secure permission from the Government of Maharashtra for
special appropriation, as may be necessary, to meet the cash shortfall for
debt redemption.
3.02    Following compliance with the conditions of effectiveness, the Loan
was made effective on February 8, 1979, about four months later than the date
specified in the Loan Agreement. This was largely because of delays in the
creation of a valid security in favor of the Bank. Originally, as a
condition of effectiveness, TEC were required to secure the Loan by a written
mortgage in favor of the Bank in the form of a Trust Deed. Due to delays in
obtaining GOM's approval of TEC's exemption from stamp duty on the
registration of the Trust Deed, TEC proposed to the Bank (letter dated
January 5, 1979) to make the Loan effective upon creation of an equitable
mortgage by deposit of title deeds (an instrument free of stamp duty). TEC
could then execute the Trust Deed within 90 days after effectiveness of the
Loan. The Bank agreed on this arrangement and the Loan was declared
effective after equitable mortgage was created. Subsequently, security by
the Trust Deed dated May 14, 1979, was completed. The postponement of Loan
effectiveness, however, did not delay the implementation of the Project.
Project Execution
3.03    The Project was executed satisfactorily, but because of substantial
delays in the delivery of equipment and materials, the plant was commissioned
about one year later than originally planned, January 1984 instead of
December 1982. Most of this delay was due to developments beyond the control
of the borrower.l/ First, as the steam generator was the first of its size to
be produced in India, local manufacturers took more time than anticipated in
preparing the engineering information needed to design the foundations. As
this information was not made available until the end of 1979, pile driving
had to be postponed by one full year.
3.04    Second, delivery of critical sections of the high pressure piping
system was delayed due to a fire on board the ship M.V. 'ARIS'. The piping
system, which was shipped in January 1982, arrived at site in September 1982
1/ Amended in light of the comments of the Borrower.



-6-
after protracted negotiations between the salvors, charterers, owners of the
vessel and hull and cargo insurers.l/ Consequently, the hydro tests, which
were scheduled for mid-1982 were delayed by seven months.
3.05    Third, critical bent pipe sections of the cold reheat line had to be
remanufactured because the thickness of the bends provided by the
manufacturer in late 1981 was less than statutorily admissible. The
remanufactured pipe sections were received in October 1982. Most of the
joints in the main steam and reheat piping, which had to be welded
sequentially from terminal points, were therefore available for erection only
after October 1982, when the pipes aboard the 'ARIS' and the remanufactured
pipe sections were received. Erection took eight months and was completed in
June 1983.
3.06    Fourth, the delivery of valves and reheaters for steam generator was
delayed by eight months, August 1982 instead of January 1982, because of the
takeover of the European supplier by another company.2/
3.07    Finally, pressure parts for the steam generator were not received in
the correct sequence. For example, links and headers above the boiler roof
were received in early 1982 instead of in mid-1981, delaying the erection of
the boiler roof and the superheater and reheater coils. Erection of the
steam generator had therefore to be rushed through in 1982 to meet the hydro
test target date, and the items delivered late had to be erected after
September 1982.
3.08    Largely because of these developments the hydro test of the steam
generator water walls and superheater could not be completed before February
1983, and that of the reheater before June 1983.  The original schedule,
which envisaged seven months from hydro test to synchronization was
maintained, resulting in synchronization on January 25, 1984.  The project
percentage completion curves and bar charts, actual and scheduled, are
presented in Annex 3. It is estimated by the borrower that these
developments would have resulted in a delay of about two years in the
commissioning of the Project had TEC's management not decided to employ
double shifts and implement a variety of tasks concurrently. For this, the
borrower needs to be commended.
3.09    During implementation, TEC changed the scope of the Project with the
approval of the Bank. Instead of modifying the existing 150 MW analogue
1/ The ship was abandoned at sea and given up to salvage. It was towed to
Singapore, the salvage vessel's principal port, from where TEC reclaimed
the piping and shipped it to India, causing a delay of eight months.

simulator at Trombay to simulate the dynamic responses, interlocks and
operational sequences of the 500 MW unit as was originally planned, TEC
installed a computerized 500 MW simulator for which rhe main frame computer
and the associated hardware and software were imported. Additional software
packages, input/output systems, etc., were developed mostly by Tata
Consulting Engineers and TEC's operational staff and its Research and
Development Department. The simulator, which was installed at a cost of
about US$3 million 1/, is now in operation and is being used to train TEC's
staff. This facility is also available for the training of operators
employed by NTPC, SEBs and foreign utilities.
3.10    At the request of GOM, the appraisal report had made provision for
space to be left for the installation, if necessary, of flue gas
desulphurization (FGD) equipment because the power plant was expected to burn
coal. The installation of this equipment was contingent upon the findings
of a study to be conducted by TEC's consultant (para 2.02) to determine if
such equipment was necessary to meet environmental quality standards. The
study c-.ncluded that the power plant posed no significant environmental
problems because, for some years, it was expected to burn sulphur free gas
rather than coal. In view of these findings, the State Pollution Control
Board (SPCB) was requested to waive its requirement for the installation of
flue gas desulphurization equipment. SPCB acceded to this request, but
recommended the installation of a pilot FGD unit following the commissioning
of the plant. Accordingly, TEC is now installing a pilot plant using new
technology for removing sulphur dioxide. It is estimated to cost Rs 88
millionl/ which is expected to be met by special appropriation of two
paise/khh for which GOM's approval would be sought. The plant is expected
to be commissioned by the end of 1986.
Reporting
3.11    TEC met all of the Bank's reporting requirements, submitting on a
regular basis quarterly progress and annual reports.
Project Cost
3.12    The Project was completed at a cost of US$241.2 million,l/ which is
about 15% higher than the appraisal estimate of US$209.3 million. This was
due to:
(a) negotiated increase in the price of the turbogenerator and
associated equipment which, as stipulated by GOI, was ordered
without competitive bidding on a single tender basis from BHEL
under Kreditanstalt Fuer Wiederaufban (KFW) financing;
1/ Amended in light of the comments of the Borrower.



-8-
(b) higher than anticipated increases in custom duties and prices of
labor and materials for civil works including cemeut steel, form work
materials, sand, etc.;
(c) replacement of civil work contractors whose work was inadequate;
(d) acquisition of more spare parts than envisaged at the appraisal
to take advantage of favorable international prices;
(e) provision for an additional electrostatic precipitator; and
(f) underestimation of the quantities of cable required because of TEC's
inexperience in implementing a unit of this size.
A detailed comparison of the appraisal estimate and actual Project costs is
presented in Annex 4. The actual cost exceeded the appraisal estimate by
about 36% for civil works, 20% for turbogenerator and associated equipment,
9% for the steam generator, 47% for electrical equipment, 49% for
miscellaneous electrical and mechanical equipment, 10% for coal and ash
handling, 28% for switchyard equipment and 122% for engineering and
administration. The cost overruns were financed by TEC from its own
resources, additional borrowing from local financial institutions, suppliers'
credit and debentures.
Procurement
3.13    All procurement requiring international competitive bidding (ICB)
was done according to Bank guidelines. In only one case was there some
disagreement about the award of contract. The lowest bidder for concrete
pumps submitted a bid bond which failed to arrive on time because of a
banking delay. At the Bank's insistence the contract was awarded to another
bidder from the same country; the impact on project cost was, however,
negligible.
3.14    The Bank accepted all the other recommendations of the borrower.
There was one representation by an Indian manufacturer of a water treatment
plant who did not meet the qualification requirements, and whose evaluated
price was higher than that of the successful Indian manufacturer. After
additional details had been furnished the Bank accepted the borrower's
recommendations.
3.15    The contract for the electrostatic precipitator was awarded for three
fields plus the S03 conditioning equipment, to achieve the 99.5% efficiency
recommended by the TEC and the review consultants, Ebasco Services, Inc.
However, after reviewing the import proposal, OI insisted on the addition of



-9-
a fourth field instead of the S03 conditioning equipment which would have
required imports of sulphur throughout the life of the plant. The fourth
field was procured from the same vendor at an additional cost of US$3
million.
3.16    The foreign component identified in the SAR cost estimate of Rs 1,800
million was Rs 780 million, including the Rs 204 million foreign component
for the steam generator. The contract for the sLeam generator was won by an
Indian manufacturer and was denominated in rupees; the contractor arranged
his own imports amounting to Rs 150 million. The Bank's ICB requirements
ensured competitive prices, particularly from local manufacturers, who are
permitted by GOI to treat such orders as deemed exports, and hence to import
the required raw materials free of duty. TEC has estimated that the cost of
indigeno : equipment was about 30% less under ICB than it would otherwise
have been.
Disbursements
3.17    The appraisal estimate of disbursements and actual disbursements are
presented in Annex 5. Cumulative disbursements were slower than the
appraisal estimate and as a result the loan amount was not disbursed fully
until December 31, 1984, about nine months later than was originally
planned.l/ Factors contributing to this delay include the postponement of the
award of contracts until 1982 for the coal and ash handling systems whose
implementation was deferred because the generating unit was to be fired
initially by oil or gas; and the decision by TEC to make payments under case
I procedures to local vendors from internal sources and claim reimbursement
from the Bank at a later date. In addition, to enable payment withheld on
contracts pending the completion of performance tests on the entire unit, the
closing date was extended by nine months upon Bank approval from March 31,
1984 to December 31, 1984.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.18    The performance of Projec. consultants was satisfactory.  They held
regular coordination meeting with TEC's staff throughout the project
implementation period and seconded construction engineers to the Project's
management and supervisory team. The consultants also assisted TEC in
expediting project implementation, monitoring quality control at vendor's
works and in issuing clearance for shipment after inspection. Likewise, the
consultants' associatesl/ ass5sted in reviewing the specifications of the
more sophisticated equipment, instrumentation and controls.
1/ Amended in light of the comments of the Borrower.



-10-
3.19    The contractors, all of whom were prequalified, also performed
satisfactorily except for the ones listed below:
(a) A Rs 25 million contract was awarded in mid-1981 for miscellaneous
civil works including switchyard foundations, raw water and fuel oil
pump houses, demineralization plant building and ash water
pumphouses. The company, however, was unable to mobilize its
resources adequately to achieve an average monthly billing of Rs 1
million. Hence, work amounting to Rs 10 million had to be awarded
to other smaller contractors in 1982 at a slightly higher rate.
(b) A contract of Rs 3 million for cement mortar lining of circulating
water pipes was awarded to a contractor who was unable to mobilize
the equipment for the contracted work because of legal disputes with
the owners of the equipment. This work, therefore, had to be
completed with the assistance of the borrower which took eight months
instead of the normal three months.l/
(c) Fabrication of 3,500 tons of structural steel for the turbogenerator
building and bunker bays was given to local contractors. However,
their resources for erection of the structural steel at site were
inadequate and they were unwilling to mobilize more forces as their
quoted contract rates had become unremunerative. Consequently, over
350 tons of erection work had to be deleted from the contract and
done by others.
3.20    As can be expected in a project of this magnitude where equipment
must be manufactured to specifications, problems did arise during erection
and commissioning. Ihese problems were addressed expeditiously by the
appropriate manufacturers. The only exception to this were the local
manufacturers of the relatively small equipment packages such as sump pumps,
low pressure valves, etc. The selected vendors did not have the required
resources/quality control and alternative vendors had to be found for about
Rs 2 million of equipment.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01    As noted (para 3.03), the Project was completed in January 1984 and
after initial trials, the unit was first synchronized on January 22, 1984.
The anit attained full load on April 27, 1984 and in the first year of
operation generated 3,108 GW' of electricity, corresponding to a utilization
factor of about 71X. Unit availability during this period was over 85% which
is commendable. The unit, however, had to be taken out for three weeks in
October 1984 to install baffles in the second pass to overcome the problem of
duct resonance on the steam generator. The unit was also shut down three
times and tripped 17 times; most of these trips occurred while correcting and



-11-
optimizing protective and control circuits. The unit, however, was brought
back on line within two hours of each shutdown because of the provision of a
turbine bypass.l/
4.02    Performance tests on all individual plants which were conducted at
either the site or works were satisfactory. Preliminary tests indicate that
the plant is operating at specified efficiency.
V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01    The earnings of licensees like TEC are regulated by the Sixth
Schedule of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. This schedule provides,
inter alia, that licensees shall so adjust their charges for the sale of
electricity, whether by enhancing or reducing them, that their "clear profit"
in any year shall not, as far as possible, exceed their amount of "reasonable
return". "Clear profit" represents the entity's income (from the sale of
energy, rentals and other utility receipts), less its admissible expenses
(including operating expenses, interest on money borrowed, income tax,
certain appropriations to statutory reserves, and other special
appropriations permitted by the State Government). The admissible expenses,
together with a margin for clear profit, form the basis for determining the
average sale price of power which is set at the maximum allowed under the
Act. "The amount of reasonable return" is defined as the sum of:
(a)  seven percent of that part of the capital base equal to the capital
as of March 31, 1965;
(b)  a percentage on the balance of the capiLal base equal to 2% over the
Reserve Bank rate prevailing at the beginning of the year (currently
the Reserve Bank rate is 102); and
(c)  additional sums equal to 0.5% on capital borrowed
( i) from institutions approved by the State Government; and
(ii) by the issue of debentures.
In the event that the Companies' "clear profit" would exceed the amount of
reasonable return for the year, provision is made in the Act for its
disposal.

-12-
5.02    TEC's income statements, sources and application of funds statements,
balance sheets, clear profits statements and capital base and reasonable
return statements are presented in Annex 6. The financial statements compare
the appraisal forecast foL the period FY78-FY83 with the actual results.
However, since the Project was not completed until 1984, the actual results
for that year are also presented.
5.03    TEC's financial performance between FY78 and FY83 was satisfactory.
In each of those years except FY83, profits, after tax and appropriations,
were higher than forecast by the appraisal, about 17% higher in FY78, 10.7%
in FY79, 50% in FY80, 140% in FY81 and 73% in FY82. In the following year,
by contrast, profits were 46% lower than the appraisal estimate, Rs 26.8
million compared to Rs 49.3 million. This was due to both, depressed
electricity sales (para 5.04) and TEC's decision to increase the investment
allowance reserve and special appropriation to cover the Project cost
overruns (para 3.12).
5.04    The improvement in TEC's financial performance between FY78 and FY82
was due to higher than forecast increases in both electricity sales and
tariffs. Electricity sales were about 6.3% higher than the appraisal
estimate in FY78, 16.3% in FY79, 6.2% in FY80 and 8.4% in FY81. This trend
was interrupted in FY82 by the strike in the textile industry, and TEC's
electricity sales dropped below the SAR forecast in FY82 and FY83. As shown
below, this decline, however, was more than offset by the upward adjustments
in tariffs which increased between FY78 and FY83 at an average annual rate of
about 20.7% compared to the SAR forecast of about 1.7%.

5.05    Despite the improvements noted above, TEC had problems in maintaining
sufficient liquidity to conduct its operations. During the Project
implementation period the current ratio, instead of increasing from 1.5 in
FY78 to 1.7 in FY83, dropped to 1.0 in FY81 and remained at that level
thereafter. The cash flow problem was precipitated by the difficulty TEC had
in securing financing from GOM for which an understanding was obtained from



-13-
GOI and TEC in the preamble of the Loan Agreement. As per that
understanding, COM was required to contribute to the Project an amount equal
to the difference between Rs 172 million and any security deposits which TEC
might collect from its consumers. Under the Act, TEC had the right to
collect from each consumer a security deposit amounting to a maximum of three
months' billings, or an aggregate of about Rs 150 million. As TEC was
collecting these amounts, several consumers brought suit against a different
utility in the Greater Bombay area contending that because of their long
histories of paying bills promptly, the posting of security was unnecessary.
The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and, in a separate action enjoined
TEC from collecting any more security deposits from its consumers; however,
it did not require TEC to refund the Rs 51 million already collected, leaving
a financing gap of about Rs 121 million. GOM agreed to contribute Rs 73
million to bridge the financing gap with the rest being secured by TEC
through the revenue enhancement measures that it had instituted in 1981.
Although an amount of Rs 73 million was included in COM's PY83 budget, TEC
received only a partial payment of Rs 40 million on March 31, 1983, together
with the assurance that the remaining Rs 33 million had been budgeted and
would be paid during FY84. However, TEC did not pursue the release of this
balance as it was able to cover the financing gap for the Project through a
special appropriation fund and by deferring some minor capital improvements
(para 5.06).l/
5.06    The problem of TEC's liquidity was also exacerbated by the
substantial cost overruns in the implementation of the Project which it had
to meet in advance of realizing reimbursements or refinancing of these costs.
To meet these cost overruns, TEC raised an additional Rs 266.4 million in
loans from local financial institutions; Rs 39.1 million in fixed deposit
loans from shareholders and the public at large, and Rs 16.6 million from
i: .ernal sources. To cover the remaining gap, and also to ease the
constraints caused by its inability to collect the aforementioned Rs 121
million, TEC created and began contributing two paise/kWh on all power sold
to a Special Appropriation for Project Costs beginning 1981 without the
approval of GOM. However, a favorable ruling regarding the admissibility of
past contributions to this Special Appropriation was recently obtained. TEC
had contributed Rs 267.7 million to this by FY84. This contribution was
intended to cover the remaining gap of Rs 195.3 million for the Project
together with the Rs 48 million differential between GOM's obligation to
finance Rs 121 million and its agreement to meet only Rs 73 million of the
Project cost. TEC had also raised the Rs 33 million that was to be secured
from GOM, thereby ensuring full financing for the Project.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01    One of the objectives of the Project was to promote institution
building by assisting in the transfer of technology for the design,
construction and operation of large thermal power plants (para 2.03). This
objective was fully achieved with the commissioning of the 500 MW unit at
Trombay. The experience gained has had beneficial spin-offs for the
follow-up Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 2452-IN), where greater
attention is being accorded to: completing the civil works earlier to
provide clear access and a clean working environment for equipment erectors;
and packaging civil works contracts differently to make them more manageable.
The Project has also benefitted CEA and NTPC in that TEC, as per the
agreement with GOI, made available its facilities and expertiese to these
entities for training their staff in implementing 500 MW power plants. The
installation of the computerized 500 MW analogue simulator (para 3.03),
moreover, has provided the facility needed for the training of TEC's and
other power utilities' staff in the operation of 500 MW power plants.
Finally, the Project was instrumental in augmenting the generating capability
of TEC, a critical private sector element in the country's power subsector.l/
VII. ECONOMIC REVALUATION
7.01    In the staff appraisal report the return on investment for the
Project was calculated on the basis of quantifiable benefits to be derived
from the 500 MW unit at Trombay. It was defined as the discount rate at
which the present worth of the Project costs equal the present worth of the
benefits over the life cycle of the Project. The measurable costs included
were:
(a) capital and labor costs involved in the implementation of the
Projert;
(b) the annual operation and maintenance costs; and
(c) fuel cost.
The measurable benefits included the revenues to be derived from the sale of
electricity.
1/ Amended in light of the comments of the Borrower.



-15-
7.02    Based on the measurable costs and benefits associated with the
Project, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return (IERR) was estimated
at about 14%. However, because of substantial reductions in the cost of fuel
precipitated by the use of associated gas until F'i90 instead of coal as was
originally planned, this same approach results in an ex-post IERR of about
30.5%. Details of the assumptions used are presented in Annex 7. The
ex-post IERR which compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital of
about 12% fully justifies the Project on economic grounds. It also validates
the appropriateness of the Government's decisi3n to allow the use of
associated gas, which otherwise would have been flared, for power generation.
VIII.   PERFORMANCE OF IHE BORROWER AND THE BANK
8.01    The performance of TEC, the executing agency, needs to be commended
because it was able to overcome unexpected implementation problems and avoid
an additional year's delay in the commissioning of the plant by increasing
the work force and implementing a number of tasks conc:urrently. Specific
areas in which TEC played a critical role in the successful implementation of
the Project are:
(a) involvement of key operation and maintenance personnel in the
design of the Project to ensure that feedback from their experience
was built into the specifications;
(b) quality control and quality assurance programs at manufacturer's
works, and shipping releases after detailed inspection from the raw
material stage up to finished product;
(c) involvement of operational personnel in the testing of equipment at
manufacturers' works and at the site;
(d) meticulous attention to housekeeping to improve productivity and
safety and maintain morale;
(e) close attention to monitoring all field activities, equipment
supplies, transport and related matters; and
(f) use of mechanized concrete batching plant and placement equipment.
8.02    The Bank supervised the Project nine times and maintained good
relations w.th the borrower. This involvement resulted in the processing of
the follow-up Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 2542-IN) which
involves the installation of yet another 500 MW thermal power unit and in a
further extension of TEC's license to August 15, 2004.

IX.   CONCLUSIONS
9.01    The Project was entirely successful in that the power plant was
completed satisfactorily and is functioning properly.  The VAjor factors
leading to the successful completion of lndia's first 500 KW thermal power
unit were the active involvement of the borrower in all stages of Project
preparation, implementation and quality control. The Project has introduced
into India the technology for designing, manufacturing and implementing large
thermal power units whose role in the country's power sector is expected to
increase substantially over the foreseeable future.l/ The Project, with the
installation of the computerized analogue simulator, has also provided the
facilities needed to train local personnel in operation of those power
plants. Finally, the Project has been instrumental in augmenting the
generating capability of TEC, a critical private sector element in the
country's power subsector.2/
1/  Presently, twelve 500 KW units ere being implemented.
2/ Amended in light of the comments of the Borrower.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Organization of the Power Subsector in India
Responsibility for the supply of electricity is shared between the
Central and State Governments. The State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and
the Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) are controlled by States; the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the National Thermal Power
Corporation (NTPC), the National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation (NHPC),
and ti.e Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) are controlled by the
Central Governmeat. SEBs were instituted under the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948 (the Act), to promote the development of the power subsector and
to regulate private licensees. Although SEBs are supposed to autonomous
in managing their day-to-day operations, in practice they are under the
control of State Governments in such matters as capital investment,
tariffs, borrowings, pay and personnel policies. As a first step towards
national integration, the SEBs have been grouped into five regional
systems, each coordinated by an REB. Coordination responsibilities
include overhaul and maintenance programs, generation schedules,
inter-State power transfers and concomitant tariffs. CEA was created in
1950 to develop national power policy ar,d to coordinate the various
agencies involved in supplying electricity. It is responsible for the
formulation of countrywide investment plans for approval by the Central
Government, development of integrated system operation, training of
personnel, and research and development. It maintains operations,
economic and financial data at both the Central and State levels, and
provides consulting support to SEBs. NTPC and NHPC were incorporated in
1975 by GOI to construct and operate large power stations and associatee
transmission facilities. They sell bulk power to the SEBs for
distribution. NTPC has had marked success and has grown rapidly. In
contrast, NHPC is still struggling to establish a role for itself. The
5tates own most hydro sites and are reluctant to relinquish these sources
of comparatively inexpensive energy to the Central Government. REC was
established in 1969 to coordinate rural electrification and provide
financial and technical expertise for SEB schemes. At present, REC
finances more than half of total rural electrification investment.

THIRD TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1549-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Internal Economic Rate of Return (Ex-Post)
Assumption
I.   COSTS
1.      Capital Costs of the Project, expressed in constant 1977 rupees, are
as follows:
Year         Foreign          Local       Total
78/79         62.0            114.9       176.9
79/80         29.0            158.0       187.0
80/81        175.0            411.3       586.8
81/82        304.9            425.5       730.4
82/83        208.6            394.2       602.8
83/84        130.1             67.4       197.5
2.      Local Costs were expressed in the equivalent border prices using the
following conversion factors: labor - 0.75; and material - 0.8.
3.      Annual Operating and Maintenance Costs were calculated at 2% of the
capital cost.
4.   1/ Fuel Cost.  The power plant is being operated on associated gas and
LSHS instead of coal as was originally planned. Since at the margin, small
quantities of associated gas continue to be flared and since no alternative
uses for this gas were envisaged, its opportunity cost is assumed to be zero.
It is further assumed that the power plant would continue to use this gas
until 1990 when it would be displaced by domestically produced coal from
Singrauli. The economic cost of this coal at the pithead is estimated at
about Rs 200/ton and that of delivering it to Trombay at about Rs 320/ton,
which amounts to about Rs 1,184/toe (1 ton of coal = 0.44 toe). In constant
1977 prices, the cost of coal is about Rs 750/toe.
1/ Amended in light of comments of the Borrower.

Footnote
TO MEET THEIR COMMITTMENT OF RS. 73 MILLION TO TEC IN 1983-84, TEC         Page 13

THEY DID NOT NEED THE BALANCE AMOUNT PLEDGED BY GOM SUBSEQUENTLY (*)
REQUEST THAT THE WORDINGS IN THIS PARA MAY BE AMENDED SUITABLY TO
REFLECT THIS FACT (.)
(2) PARA 9.01 ON PAGE 15 - AS ALREADY POINTED OUT BY TEC THE
EXTENSION OF LICENSE WAS MERELY COINCIDENTAL AND NOT AN INTENDED
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT (.) THE GOVERNMENT   COVENANT TO THIS

EXISTENCE OF SUCH PRIVATE COMPANIES FOR GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION        Pages iv,

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER
Dear Mr. Watanabe,
Trombay 500 MW Unit 5 Project
Loan 1549 - IN
This has reference to your letter of February 13, 1986
addressed to Mr. K.M. Chinnappa, Vice Chairman, enclosing the
Bank's draft Project Completion Report.
We find the report to be satisfactory except for some
comments which are separately listed and forwarded with this
letter.
Referring to the last para of the Highlights and
Conclusions (P. 15), we find more importance being given to          amendes
the project having been instrumental in enabling TEC to extend    Footnotes
its license thereby preserving a critical private sector element   agen iv1
in the country's power subsector. We would view this more as 14 and 15
coincidental with the other benefits listed in thesp paras viz.
transfer of technology to the country's power sector, training
facilities in operation of 500 MW Units, development of Training
Simulator etc. being more important.
With kind regards,
Ygurs sincerely,
S. P. Manaktala
Mr. Y. Watanabe,
Director,
Operations Evaluation Department,
The World Bank,
Washington D.C. 20433,

3.   Project Costs c  Pare 2 and Page 1ii  of preface, Page Iv) of
Highlights, Page 8 and Annexure 4 refer to a final project post
of S 280.4 million. We presume this has neon derived by converting
the lb. 241.2 crores indicated in P. 13 of our report into dollars
at 1 t - 8.6 Re. the exchange rate prevailing in 1978. Ve bblieve
this does not reflect the true project cost as all expenditure has
been converted to rupees by us at the exchange rate prevailing at
Aomended          the tim  of payment and takes into account the general depreciation
Footnotes         in the rupee till project completion, resulting in the final coat
-ages i, ii       of h. 241.2 crorea.

To illustrate. I S of equipment in original project cost
has been booked when incurred at 10 lb. in the final cost but the
Bank reconverts this to dollars at I S a 8.6 lb. i.e. $ 1.16 whereas
only 1 $ has been incurred. This method gives the picture that
project costs increased by 34% whereas a more fair view would be
to also present the project cost as having increased fXm S 209.3
million to $ 241.2 million i.. 15.3% as given in P. 13 of our
rport,.

6.   Pogo     s  Para 3.11 end Page 5, 3.03 refer to- 3 months' delay in
finaliestion of steam generator contract. In Page 9 of
our report what was implied was that the apptAsal
report had envisaged that contracts would be awarded
by June/July 1978. Howevor, though the loan agreement
Amended        was signed only in June 19761 TEC on their own Initiated
Footnotes      action end finelisod the steam generator contract in a
Pages 5 and 9 short period of 3 months. Therefore, the reference to
delay in finalisation of steam generator contract should
preferably be linked to the loan agroewnt being signed
in June 1978 rather then delay in contract finalisation
as such.

Para 4.01 to read 'As noted in Para 3.03 the project was
completed in January 1984, and after initial trials the
unit was first eynchronised on January 25, 1984. After
correcting manufacturing deficiencies the unit attained
full load on 27th April, 1984, i.e. 92 days after
synchronisation.
The Unit had also to be taken out for three weeks in
Amended        October 1984 to install baffles in the second pass to
Footnote       overcome the problem of duct resonance on the Steam
Page 11        Generator.  During the first year of operation in
1984-85 the unit availability was over 85% and generated
3108 MUS corresponding to an utilisation factor of 71%
which for first year of operation of a new unit is
commendable. During the year under reference the unit
was shutdown three times and tripped seventeen times;
most of these trips occured while correcting and
optimising protective and control circuits.
The Unit, however. was brought back on line within two
hours of each shutdown, because of the provision of a,
turbine bypass.
