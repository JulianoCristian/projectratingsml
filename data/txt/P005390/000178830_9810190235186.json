practices. The main\n            actions to be carried out include: (a) in the Upper Loukkos,\n            development and erosion control works on 15,000 steeply\n            sloping hectares including planting of olives, fruit trees\n            and contour strips of forage, establishment of permanent\n            pasture and small scale irrigation rehabilitation on\n            productive lands and mechanical and biological erosion\n            control measures in gullies and bad lands; (b) in the Middle\n            Loukkos, development of field crops of 17,500 hectares;\n            pasture improvement on 2,300 hectares of collectively owned\n            land, and small irrigation improvements; (c) in the Izarene\n            Forest, establishment of 3,500 hectares pine plantations,\n            and maintenance of 3,400 hectares of existing plantations;\n            (d) construction of about 180 km of all weather tertiary and\n            farm access roads, and primary schools, health centers,\n            rural water supply and village markets in the Project area;\n            and (e) execution of a cadastral survey on about 500,000\n            hectares of land."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
