cities, and about 1,000 rural communities, by\n            rehabilitation and construction works. The project provides\n            for (a) water supply construction in provincial cities;\n            technical assistance for project preparation, detailed\n            designs, supervision of construction and preparation of next\n            stage project; training of LWUA and Water District staff,\n            together with related equipment; and vehicles and equipment\n            for Water Districts; (b) water supply construction in rural\n            communities, and a pilot sanitation study for about eight\n            rural communities. Project benefits include a reduction in\n            the incidence of waterborne diseases and the possibility of\n            epidemics. Between 40% and 60% of the population served\n            would be the urban poor."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
