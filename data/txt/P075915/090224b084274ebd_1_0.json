       follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was significant, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Second\n            Phase of the Pastoral Community Development Project for\n            Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: programmatic\n            approaches that involve multiple projects over a long period\n            of time are more effective when they measure the extent to\n            which overall programmatic objectives are being met, in\n            addition to assessing project outputs. Triggers for moving\n            forward with successive phases of an adaptable program are\n            more effective when they take stock of the extent to which\n            the project is meeting its overall program aims. The Bank\n            can use the body of knowledge gained through its successive\n            project interventions to help governments develop an\n            informed sector strategy, especially in difficult and\n            uncertain areas such as pastoral development. While the Bank\n            may choose to proceed with project support, it is critical\n            that in the absence of a clear approach, Bank experience be\n            used to support the development of such a strategy through\n            dialogue and continued engagement. Support for household or\n            small rural income generating activities is more effective\n            when based on needs and capacity assessments and supported\n            by business planning, training, legal and technical\n            assistance, and the supply of affordable finance. Rural\n            savings and credit groups can be successful when there is a\n            strong sense of cohesion in the community, when they have a\n            predominant focus on women, and when they are supported with\n            adequate and sustained capacity-building support. Seed\n            capital and clear rules of the game were also found to be\n            key ingredients in helping to ensure the success of the\n            rural savings and lending groups in Ethiopia."}, "docdt": "2016-03-30T02:26:01Z"}
