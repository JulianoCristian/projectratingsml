Development\n            Project seeks to improve the livelihoods of the pastoral\n            groups of the arid, and semi-arid Ethiopian lowlands, by\n            fostering income growth, access to public services, and by\n            facilitating better institutional, social, and environmental\n            conditions. The three main project components aim to: 1)\n            establish decentralized, and participatory planning\n            procedures at the community level, and other groups that\n            operate within the regional government structure.\n            Communities will identify, design, and implement\n            micro-projects, reflecting their development priorities,\n            supported by capacity building, and required training, while\n            the Community Investment Fund will provide investment to\n            support infrastructure, and public service delivery; 2)\n            build a community-based early warning system to establish a\n            communal collection, and analysis of basic household welfare\n            data, focusing on sub-groups to design pastoral production\n            systems. A disaster contingency planning subcomponent will\n            build capacity at regional levels for disaster preparedness\n            - mitigation and rapid response - for drought management and\n            recovery activities, providing grants to finance activities\n            identified in contingency plans; and, 3) support\n            operational, and training resources for the federal, and\n            regional project coordination units, to ensure fiduciary\n            obligations, policy analysis and liaison with stakeholder\n            groups, and a multi-sectoral coordination."}, "docdt": "2003-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
