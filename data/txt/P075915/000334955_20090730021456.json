Some lessons learned\n            included: do not shy away from formally restructuring a\n            project. Rather than hoping for the best when repeatedly\n            confronting implementation problems, Bank teams should be\n            proactive in proposing changes (such as in the results\n            framework and indicators), which will result in greater\n            clarity and a more substantive definition of project\n            outcomes. Certain projects require closer supervision.\n            Projects such as Community-Driven Development (CDD)\n            projects, with new and unfamiliar processes, projects spread\n            across large geographical areas where local procurement is\n            required, projects covering different ethnic and/or\n            religious groups where decision-makers often tend to bias\n            allocations, in situations where very few or no projects\n            have ever been implemented, and projects that include zones\n            with known political tensions and civil unrest, require\n            intensive supervision. A consistent results framework, with\n            outcome indicators that are clearly linked to the project\n            development objective (PDO) and differentiated from\n            input/output indicators is very important.
