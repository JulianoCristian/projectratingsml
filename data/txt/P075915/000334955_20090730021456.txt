         1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. About 93 percent of Ethiopia's pastoral area population depends directly on livestock for
subsistence. Pastoralists earn an annual per capita GDP of about US$100 and are among the
poorest.1 They inhabit the peripheral lowlands, which are drought prone and classified as
marginally arable and non-arable lands that cover 500,000 km2, or roughly 61 percent of the land
surface. Pastoralism is extensively practiced in the Afar and Somali Regions, and in some zones of
the Oromia Region, and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). These
lowlands include over seven million people and eleven million animals--the largest livestock
population in Africa.

2. Pastoral livelihood systems were under increasing stress. Pastoralists not only lived in an
ecologically hostile environment, but also had meager social services and physical infrastructure,
and were poorly connected to the more developed areas of Ethiopia. Many factors impeded
pastoral livelihoods: nonexistent or poorly planned stock routes and watering points for livestock;
animal health services that rarely extended beyond lowland woreda (district) boundaries; poor
human health services; educational services that reached less than one-fifth of pastoralists, limiting
prospects for livelihood diversification; and virtually non-existent agricultural advisory services,
especially for helping agro-pastoralists. Ethiopia's lowland pastoralists had often faced the
challenge of periodic drought. However, as rangeland degradation worsened, driven by mounting
human and livestock population pressure and an apparent increase in the frequency of drought, the
capacity to cope with drought had declined to a point where the survival of viable pastoral
productions systems was under threat.

3. The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) acknowledged the need to redress the national
development balance that had traditionally favored the highland areas. GoE also recognized
that past experience in pastoral areas, which emphasized livestock and rangeland management had
been largely unsuccessful, and that a new approach consistent with a more holistic view of lowland
communities was needed. GoE reiterated its strategy for pastoral development in several programs
including in the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (2002).

4. The World Bank assisted GoE in preparing the Pastoral Community Development
Program (PCDP)--a 15-year, three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL). PCDP related to
the central features of GOE's Rural Development Strategy for pastoral areas by promoting an
integrated and holistic approach that focuses on people, not merely their animals or the rangeland
that they inhabit. Phase I of PCDP (2003-08) aimed to: (i) help pastoral livelihoods through
economic and social development investments owned and managed by communities and local
governments; (ii) protect these livelihoods and reduce risks faced by pastoralists by improving the
knowledge of pastoral economies and coping mechanisms; and (iii) strengthen policies that
promote pastoral area development. PCDP I, (financed with an IDA grant of US$30 million
equivalent and co-financed by IFAD with a loan of US$20 million) was approved on May 20, 2003
and became effective on September 30, 2003.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5. The PDO in the PAD was, for a selected set of woredas, to provide capacity-building and
establish effective models of public service delivery, investment, and disaster management in
pastoral areas that address communities' needs and reduce their vulnerability.2

6. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) -- The project was considered to be successful if in
targeted communities and woredas: (i) at least 80 percent of funds allocated to the Community
Investment Fund (CIF) are used for approved community micro-projects and inter-community sub-
projects; (ii) at least 80 percent of funds allocated to the Disaster Preparedness and Contingency
Fund (DPCF) are used for approved sub-projects; (iii) at least 75 percent of community sub-
projects requiring government support receive it in a timely and adequate fashion, as measured by
beneficiary assessments; and (iv) at least 75 percent of the results of participatory M&E (PM&E)
meetings are used in decision-making for community investments, pastoral risk management plans,
and other project activities, as measured by M&E reports.3

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification. Not Applicable.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. The main beneficiaries included 450,000 rural households (where the average household
consisted of 5-12 people) in pastoral and agropastoral communities in 30 woredas of the Afar,
Somali, SNNP and Oromia Regions. This represented about one-third of pastoral and agropastoral
woredas in the four Regions.4 Beneficiaries included female-headed households (about 20 percent)
and a limited number of destitute refugees dependent on food aid, especially where traditional
social safety net mechanisms had failed. Ultimately, the program was expected to enhance the
well-being of potentially several million people living throughout the rangelands. Woreda selection
criteria stressed equitable selection across zones that had a minimum level of human resource
capacity and access, and avoidance of woredas where other donors were active. Secondary
beneficiary groups were community associations and local and regional governments.

1.5 Original Components

8. Component 1: Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement (SLE) (US$36.52 million) sought to
establish decentralized and participatory planning procedures at the kebele (sub-district) and
woreda (district) levels, operating within the regional government structure. This was to enable
pastoralists to identify, design and implement community driven micro-projects that reflected their
development priorities. Sub-components included: (i) Capacity Building, where project-supported
Mobile Support Teams (MSTs) would work with woreda administrations and their technical and
social support offices to train communities, using participatory learning and action (PLA) tools to
design local development projects; (ii) the Community Investment Fund (CIF), to provide funding
to enable quick execution of community-prepared and WDC-appraised sub-projects according to
agreed measures; and (iii) Support Services, to finance infrastructure investments and strengthen
public service delivery at regional and woreda levels, and support research activities.



2This differs from the PDO in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), which states, "...reduce their
vulnerability and contribute to overall poverty alleviation in the territory of the Recipient".
3PAD Annex 1 (Project Design Summary) lists KPIs (i)­(iii). (iv) is an indicator under Component 3.
4PCDP started in 30 woredas. Later, two of these woredas (Miyo--a part of Dirre in Oromia, and Chinaqsen-
-a part of Jijiga in Somali) attained woreda administration status, raising the number of PCDP woredas to 32.


                                                       2

9. Component 2: Pastoral Risk Management (US$16.43 million) aimed to improve drought
preparation through steps to mitigate risk and reduce vulnerability. Subcomponents included: (i)
Community-Based Early Warning System (EWS), to build on ongoing efforts of the federal
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) and NGOs to establish (at woreda
level) the collection and analysis of basic household welfare data using a pastoral production
systems survey instrument. The EWS was to provide the information to assign each participating
woreda to one of five "warning stages" (normal, alert, alarm, emergency and recovery situations)
with appropriate responses to each stage; (ii) Disaster Contingency Planning, to invest in capacity
at woreda and regional levels to prepare Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Plans (DPCPs)
including both mitigation activities and rapid response activities, monitor local disaster indicators,
and manage disaster response funds; and (iii) Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Fund (DPCF),
to provide the woredas with grants to finance activities identified in their DPCPs. An acceptable
plan, including documentation of participatory process and environmental assessment, if applicable,
was to be a condition for the release of funds.

10. Component 3: Project Support and Policy Reform (US$7.01 million) was to provide
operational and training support to the Federal Project Coordination Unit (FPCU) in Addis Ababa
and Regional Project Coordination Units (RPCUs) in the regions. Sub-components included: (i)
Project Support and Coordination, to ensure that the FPCU and RPCUs would effectively perform
the following functions: fiduciary obligations; policy analysis and liaison with stakeholders;
multisectoral coordination at the federal and regional levels; project communication; project
monitoring; and mobilization of technical backstopping; (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation, (M&E) to
finance: an aggregate-level Management Information System (MIS); and a local-level system that
combines community-derived impact assessments of sub-projects with a data base that tracks
pastoral livelihoods at the woreda and regional levels. The M&E system was to provide timely
feedback to program management on the effectiveness of interventions in reaching the intended
beneficiaries. The communication program was to disseminate program information and results
using a variety of media; and (iii) Policy Analysis and Reform, to address policy and institutional
reforms (mainly targeted studies, training and outreach) to improve pastoral livelihoods and reduce
risk. Funds were to be earmarked for strategic policy work at the regional and federal levels.

1.6 Revised Components. Not Applicable.

1.7 Other significant changes

11. Amendments to the DCA and the Reallocation of Funds. The DCA dated June 12, 2003
was amended three times. The first was on November 11, 2005, to allow an increase in the
Authorized Allocation from US$5m to US$6m, to be deposited into the Special Account. The
second amendment was on September 20, 2006, following the June 2006 mid-term review (MTR).
As rising costs of basic construction materials (cement, steel and their products) and community
demand for facilities of reasonable quality were making it difficult to stay within the initially
established budget caps for community-based development activities, the DCA was amended to: (i)
increase the budget ceilings for community sub-projects from US$15,000 to US$30,000, and for
inter-community sub-projects from US$75,000 to US$100,000 to accommodate price fluctuations
and remote sub-project sites; (ii) reallocate the grant proceeds from less active to more active
expenditure categories under Schedule 1; and (iii) lift the aggregate threshold for National or
International Shopping to encourage local and international procurement of needed items. The
third amendment was on September 18, 2007. As PDCP I was the major source of tangible
investment in these marginalized areas, beneficiary community and local government demand



                                                    3

exceeded the originally anticipated demand for micro projects. The DCA was amended to increase
Category 5 (community grants) of the SLE component by SDR 2,550,000.

12. Cancellation of IDA Grant funds. Post Procurement Reviews (PPRs) in February 2007 and
November 2007 identified two sets of misprocurement: in Somali (on four contracts); and at
federal level (on one contract, sliced into three by FPCU, inconsistent with Bank procedures), and
occurrences of fraud. Management and the Department of Institutional Integrity were informed.
On February 1, 2008, the Bank formally notified GoE of the cancellation of SDR 142,274
(US$190,858) from the IDA Grant, and requested reimbursement of the amounts disbursed against
these contracts. The Grant Agreement Schedule 1 was revised to represent the cancellation (of
SDR 73,606 from the Goods Category and SDR 68,668 from Consultant Services and Audits).

         2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13. The Bank responded promptly to GoE's request to donors to reduce the information gap
on pastoral development, and Bank staff worked closely with donor s and research programs
on rangeland management issues. In collaboration with IFAD and FAO, the Bank undertook
Economic and Sector Work (ESW) in FY01, which evolved into the FY03 operation. Project
preparation involved a strong Bank team, with IFAD participating in project design, pre-appraisal
and appraisal. FAO also played a major role during preparation. The Japan Social and
Development Fund (JSDF) approved a grant (US$1.88 million) to GoE in October 2003 as
complementary financing. DFID played a key role in promoting dialogue among pastoral
parliamentarians and other stakeholders, and AfDB committed grant funds for a pastoral study.
PCDP also consulted with the International Livestock Research Institute to seek help on
disseminating new technologies and drought preparedness strategies.

14. The Bank discussed project proposals in workshops with key stakeholders at preparation,
pre-appraisal, and appraisal, and consulted with pastoral communities in Somali and Afar, the
Borana Zone of Oromia and South Omo in the SNNPR. During preparation, PCDP also undertook
several NGO-facilitated meetings with community leaders in the planned project areas.

15. PCDP's general design reflected innovative responses to lessons from pastoral
development experience, mainly by embracing an integrated and holistic approach. First, in
incorporating a CDD approach the project emphasized the importance of decentralization and
community empowerment. This was the first time a CDD approach was attempted in Ethiopia and
was a considerable innovation for the GoE. Second, through flexible funding mechanisms to
finance community identified and implemented interventions, it sought to promote ownership and
sustainability of the development process. Third, the program's multi-phase design recognized the
lengthy process of pastoral area development, and that better integration of pastoral communities
into the national economy would be more likely through a longer-term approach.

16. PCDP's expenditure-linked KPIs, however, were a fundamental shortcoming in design,
and appear to have focused implementation efforts on maximizing the speed of fund
disbursement at the expense of quality and efficiency. This is particularly so given the
commitment to a CDD approach that was new and needed time and effort to take root in such
traditional and disadvantaged communities. Sufficient time for training and analysis to precede
decision making and implementation would be major concerns given this design element. The first
two KPIs did not particularly encourage giving time to communities to prioritize, plan, implement
and monitor their development activities in a learning-by-doing manner. Rather, they seem to have


                                                   4

reinforced the reported "tendency for a strong push from the top to disburse funds quickly", and the
FPCU's enthusiasm to show sub-projects on the ground to win the confidence of communities,
without regard to the speed with which pastoralists could cope, nor the sufficiency of funds to
complete and operationalize approved sub-projects.5

17. PCDP's design should have paid more attention to sustainability of its activities. This
concern is applicable to all three components. Under the SLE component, the design did not
sufficiently address how the CDD process might be institutionalized, through continuous training
and capacity building for communities and other stakeholders, rather than a one-off Participatory
Rural Appraisal and PLA exercise (MTR Aide Memoire, July 2006, and GoE ICR, p. 35-37).
Under the second component, the DPCF manual with rules and procedures to manage the fund
should have been stressed as an important project startup activity. Under the third component,
studies to guide public policy in pastoral communities should also have been undertaken at the start
of project with the remainder of implementation contingent on their findings. The relevance of
these studies to change livelihoods remains under question (M&E Report, MOFA, April 2006).

18. Late changes (at appraisal) of the anticipated project executing agency from the Ministry
of Agriculture (MoA) to the Ministry of Federal Affairs (MoFA) undermined readiness for
implementation. This introduced administrative and technical concerns related to project
execution. MoA was more decentralized and experienced on pastoral development issues, and was
committed to participatory efforts. MoFA was new, and, by its own admission, was more "an
agency that pulls federal resources to states" than a project implementing agency (Sixth Quality at
Entry Assessment, QAE6, July 2003). MoFA's management also seemed to favor the settlement of
pastoralists (ICR Mission interviews, June-July 2008, QAE6). This sudden change in the
executing ministry disrupted the momentum of building implementation capacity and getting staff
in place. It also may have made the project more susceptible to political influences not fully
reflected in the risk ratings in the PAD.

19. Baseline study results and the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) should have been
key tools for successfully launching the project, especially given the new CDD approach. The
PIM (finalized only as an effectiveness condition) should have been associated with a baseline
survey that facilitated targeting, measuring and evaluating implementation activities and results.
This was even more important given the expenditure-oriented KPIs. Essentially, the lack of impact
indicators being central to the design affected both the process of the project (CDD planning and
involvement of communities themselves in identifying meaningful impact indicators, which may
differ across regions and districts) and evaluation of its performance.

20. Quality Assurance Group Ratings: (detailed in Section 5.1.) Quality at Entry (Stage 1)
rating = 4 (Moderately Unsatisfactory, on the revised 6-point rating scale); July 23, 2003.

2.2 Implementation

21. Overall implementation of PCDP was mixed, and varied by region and by component.
Oromia (78 percent) and SNNPR (85 percent) performed better in completing executed projects
(Annex 2, Table 3). In Somali, the equivalent number was 69 percent. From a component
standpoint, there was a vast difference between the amount and effectiveness of activities carried
out under Component 1, which was relatively well done, compared to Components 2 and 3. Under
Component 2, interventions were not sequenced as they should have been, and under Component 3,



5Aide Memoire, November 2004. See Aide Memoire, Nov. 2007 and ISRs of November 2007, March 2008.


                                                  5

M&E was very weak and policy studies were generally not completed. Several activities under
these two components seem to have been implemented in a rushed and ineffective manner between
the MTR and project closing in order to satisfy the Phase 1 triggers.

22. Despite limitations, MoFA and the FPCU made good efforts to implement a demanding
project. The CDD approach was generally unfamiliar in Ethiopia and to a new Federal Ministry.
Nevertheless, reasonable coordination among project units (from federal to woreda) resulted in
benefits that were clearly valued by pastoralists. The management and implementation structures
that are now in place should serve as a foundation for continued efforts to overcome the challenges
faced by pastoral communities, especially the lack of income earning opportunities.

23. PCDP conducted useful community capacity building in the first year, but attention to its
institutionalization and sustainability was insufficient. Some communities learned how to be
responsible for their development processes through participatory methods. This was a major
change from past, less decentralized efforts to promote area development. However, continuous
training, responsive to community needs identified during implementation, was not sufficiently
addressed, and as a result the introduction of CDD processes fell short of the high expectations set.
One fact that demonstrates this is that, as proposed in the PIM, MSTs were not camping with
pastoralists for 10-15 days to provide the consultation and training activities. This would have
enabled even greater changes in attitude and practice, and better quality and value of outcomes.6

24. Hasty project approvals resulted in increased rates of disbursement in 2004-06, which
introduced fiduciary challenges and difficulties for sectoral actors to provide staff/equipment
resources necessary to ensure service delivery.7 The previous PCDP management, concerned
with low disbursement rates in the first year, launched an aggressive campaign among communities
to use project resources. In this push for rapid disbursement, the perception developed that all
projects would be financed as long as they met the defined set of criteria. No consideration was
given to the balance available in the CIF when approving sub-project requests. Furthermore, no
indicative annual budget ceilings were defined and provided for the RPCUs and woredas. By the
end of PCDP's fourth year, about 91 percent of the available budget had been spent. This issue
was not picked up until the MTR. Some 25 percent of the sub-projects could not be completed due
to lack of funds--a major efficiency loss. It also reduced the confidence in PCDP among
beneficiaries and contractors who were waiting for their payment (IFAD Country Programme
Evaluation, June 2008, p. 29). Regions were advised to abandon projects that were at a low level
of performance, and, in Oromia and SNNPR, construction of several ongoing projects was
discontinued. Although Regional Bureaus were to give priority to projects that were in the
completion stage, this could not be realized as the disbursed finances were used to settle payments
on the already implemented projects. The anticipated implementation improvements were
insignificant (2007/2008 2nd Quarter Progress Report of PCDP Activities, January 2008, p. 18).8




6Community training on how to be inclusive in planning, drawing up proposals, and evaluating their
activities have been too short. MSTs and MOTs have spent little time with the communities to begin the
CDD process. At least in Oromia and SNNPR they have not followed the PIM procedures of camping for
10-15 days to work with a community (MTR, Aide Memoire, Annex 6.1).
7See ISR write-up and Country Director's comments in ISR, March 26, 2008.
8Also see, "...the push to expand within three years to 516 kebeles in 32 woredas and to increase
disbursement of project funds, combined with constraints on MST field allowances in some regions, appears
to have compromised the quality and inclusiveness of planning and approval procedures in some cases, and
stretched the capacity of MSTs to train WDC and community stakeholders, as well as to supervise CIF
implementation adequately" (Aide Memoire, November 20, 2007, p. 16).


                                                      6

25. Weak procurement supervision, (i.e. limited transparency in fund allocation, lack of
accountability at woreda level) affected implementation (see paras. 43 and 44 on Fiduciary
Compliance). In Somali, the mandate of the communities to participate, negotiate, control and use
resources for their needs was violated by woreda administration officials.9 This issue raised
significant concerns about the appropriate (transparent) use of resources towards the agreed PDOs.

26. Repeated delays in moving forward on the Japan Social Development Fund set back
efficient and effective implementation of capacity-building activities in civil society oversight,
and training of NGOs, CBOs and local governments in using PM&E as a tool in development
planning. The JSDF grant was to secure the participation of NGOs to help build capacity among
the PCDP communities to better place them to take advantage of the opportunities offered through
PCDP. Pastoral Forum Ethiopia, an NGO, was the recipient of the Grant. The agreement was
signed in November 2004 after a 13-month wait, but further delays in opening the special account
and in agreeing on signatories and management modalities of the grant led to JSDF activities
commencing only in September 2006, after PCDP had almost exhausted its resources.

27. Lack of clear leadership and policy coherence in GoE affected the Risk Management
component. Following GoE reorganization in 2005, the DPPC was renamed the DPPA and placed
under the auspices of the MoA. The restructuring changed the mandate of the former DPPC to lead
this task as specified in the PAD and PIM. The new DPPA was reluctant to assume its
responsibilities. The absence of a clear mandate to host the component, and poor coordination
between DPPA and PCDP at all levels delayed the establishment of the EWS and the woreda-level
Disaster Contingency Plans. The DPCF utilization manual was never prepared. The DPCF,
however, was utilized (contrary to the principles outlined in the PIM) to finance shelf projects on
ad-hoc basis in both PCDP and non-PCDP woredas. The Bank halted this investment until
ongoing projects were evaluated. Later, the MoFA and the FPCU in cooperation with Regional
Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Bureaus took the lead to proceed with this task.

28. High turnover of staff at the federal and regional levels contributed to delayed and/or
partial implementation. The turnover compromised the efficiency of training investments and
hampered institutional learning: FPCU's Project Coordinator departed in March 2007 and was
replaced only in January 2008; long vacancies in the Coordinator positions in SNNPR and Afar
undermined implementation momentum; the departure of two FPCU M&E specialists left PCDP
with no specialist for some time; and frequent staff changes at woreda level slowed project
activities and necessitated re-training, which was difficult to arrange (MTR Aide Memoire, Annex
6.1). Moreover, other regular assignments for MOT members affected their attention to PCDP-
related work. Overall, the institutionalization of CDD processes and the spread of this practical
approach throughout and beyond PCDP could have been greater without this limitation. It also led
to inadequate follow-up and technical support on fiduciary aspects of the project.

29. Profitability, growth and sustainability of income generating activities (IGAs) were not
sufficiently emphasized during implementation. As a result a number of IGAs were established
that were not economically viable, not being able to consistently cover costs of operation and
maintenance. In some instances there has been inadequate attention to markets and especially
market prices, resulting in IGAs charging of lower prices than reasonable on the market. There has
also been almost no follow-up business management assistance as might be related to how to
distribute and reinvest earnings (Assessment of IGAs, May 2008).

                                                   7

30. The lack of a systematic communication strategy with the government structure and
among staff of project coordination units limited implementation. Attempts to develop an MIS
to enable FPCU, RPCU and woredas to exchange information were not successful (GoE ICR, p.
39). This affected participation in program activities and sharing of training materials with relevant
stakeholders as planned. Information about the strategy was not available in a form that could be
easily shared and understood, for example, in local languages.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31. Design and staffing failures undermined the creation and use of an effective M&E system.
The KPIs were not well linked to the PDO. The first two KPIs measured fund disbursement, when
the PDO was to provide capacity building and establish effective models of public service delivery,
investment and disaster management. The fourth KPI focused on capacity building and the extent
of use of PM&E methods in decision-making. However, the PM&E system that was intended to be
responsive to the realities on the ground, and required involvement of relevant stakeholders, was
not implemented, and the intended objectives were not achieved. (GoE ICR, p. 39).

32. The lack of baseline indicators to provide insights and structure to the project's M&E
system further weakened M&E implementation. Baseline surveys (without control groups) of
25 woredas were conducted in the third year of PCDP; however, their use was limited in the
absence of follow-up surveys of these communities for comparison.

33. In August 2005 it became evident that the M&E system was too output focused and that
the delay in developing and using outcome indicators was affecting implementation. Twelve
outcome indicators were suggested during the MTR, but despite discussions with regional M&E
officers, the data were not compiled. Staffing issues did not help this situation.

34. PCDP was not able to use PM&E feedback to identify and take suitable remedial
measures, as there were no standard reporting formats, especially at woreda level to be aggregated
at regional level (except Community Action Plans and annual plans for office purposes), and the
PM&E systems were not included in the decision-making process. At woreda level, although the
WDC was responsible for project monitoring, the system relied on MSTs and MOTs, and regional
M&E officers. As a result, data collection of community projects was weak. Had the PM&E
system been operational, issues in Somali, where WDCs approved turnkey projects to capture CIF
resources rather than following the CDD approach, may have been identified and addressed earlier.

35. Furthermore, progress reports assessed outcomes by using national norms rather than
actual data. Thus, reports estimated that 50 children (the norm) benefited from a project-built
classroom. Yet, enrolment in the schools visited by the project diverged widely from this norm
(MTR Aide Memoire, July 2006, Annex 14, p. 2). There were also inaccuracies in sub-project data.
With regard to IGAs, M&E has been minimal, as there are no government offices and PCDP
mechanisms to monitor IGA performance.

36. In the absence of an M&E system, efficiency and performance indicators in the reporting
format could have helped to evaluate and improve implementation. Data collected was limited
to reports on disbursement, project activities and their current status (on ongoing, completed and
operational sub-projects) by sector and region, with lack of attention to any higher-level outcome
indicators. Effectiveness of interventions could have been interpreted by linking the type of
interventions (wells, ponds), with their costs and reach (numbers benefiting). Overall, PCDP failed



                                                   8

to have an adequately designed, implemented and utilized outcome-based M&E system, especially
one that included community participation in the evaluation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards
37. PCDP was assigned the environmental category "B". The PAD showed OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment, OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, and OP 4.09 Pest Management as triggered.
To ensure compliance with these policies, the Environmental Assessment and Management
Framework (EAMF, dated January 10, 2003) was prepared. The EAMF included provisions for
identifying natural habitats and recommended that PCDP establish, with help from the
Environmental Protection Authority, a working definition to identify natural habitats and thus
ensure that its interventions would not impact them negatively. Similarly, the EAMF provided
measures in the screening process to identify the potential for impacts, and, if triggered, specified
the requirement of an Integrated Pest Management Plan to ensure compliance with OP 4.09.10

38. The above policies did not contribute to improved environmental management as: (i) the
sub-projects were not screened for potential adverse environmental and social impacts as per OP
4.01; (ii) a pest management plan for sub-projects was not developed for small-scale irrigation sub-
projects as per OP 4.09; and (iii) a working definition for the identification of natural habitats was
not developed, and, therefore, the revised environmental and social screening process for sub-
projects excluded funding of sub-projects that could have negative impacts on natural habitats.

39. Although PCDP took some steps in the right direction in 2005-2006, efforts to strengthen
environmental management capacity under the micro-projects were unsuccessful, mainly due
to a lack of commitment by the Bank and the FPCU to implement an efficient environmental and
social screening process for micro-projects, and an insufficient number of two environmental
supervision missions. The Bank did not clearly state the importance of effective environmental
management in the Aide Memoires.11 GoE failed to share with IDA Environmental Assessment
Reports prepared in 2005 for the Kelafo Inter-Community River Diversion, the Lasaret Inter-
Community Water Supply System in Somali; and community ponds, small-scale irrigation and
inter-community roads projects in Afar and SNNPR, as agreed by January 31, 2005. Similarly, a
Regional EA for the Afar Region was to be completed by December 31, 2005. These EAs could
have provided guidance for sub-projects in these regions.

40. The DCA did not include the EAMF along with the requirement that it be implemented
to IDA's satisfaction, further complicating the situation. Consequently, there was no legal basis
for requiring that FPCU implement the institutional arrangements for strengthening environmental


10The PAD should also have shown OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways as triggered given that
Ethiopia's riparian neighbors Kenya and Somalia were notified on March 25, 2003. OP 4.10 Indigenous
Peoples was marked as triggered in the ISRs even though it had been decided at appraisal that this policy was
not triggered as PCDP was to be implemented by and with pastoral people who formed the dominant society
in the project areas, and were to be beneficiaries of the project investments. Therefore, they could not be
regarded as "indigenous peoples" in World Bank terms; i.e. social groups distinct from the dominant society
that are vulnerable to being disadvantaged by the project. Recommendation for revising the safeguard
policies showing as triggered in the ISRs was forwarded to the TTL on July 18, 2006.
11For example, the 2005 Aide Memoire stated that the FPCU should review the revised draft environmental
and social screening process and "prepare a comprehensive action plan on how to make it functional", and a
revised version was to be forwarded to IDA for endorsement on October 28, 2005; the 2006 Aide Memoire
stated that the FPCU should support the environmental training program.

management capacity outlined in the EAMF, i.e. recruitment of : (i) an Environmental Coordinator
at the level of the FPCU; (ii) Environmental Focal Points at the regional levels to ensure that in
each region (Somali, Afar, Oromia) there is a focal point to support the kebeles in implementing
the Environmental Management Plan and in screening and approving sub-projects; and (iii)
Environmental Focal Points be recruited at the kebele levels. None of these steps were taken.
Instead, the project hired four water engineers.

41. "In most cases the Environmental and Social Screening List is not applied and the budget
allocation for community sub-projects do not include budget for mitigating impacts on both
environment and society. The List has never been used in woreda sub-project approval processes
depicting that there is no sign of allocating budget for mitigation measures along with funds for
implementing community sub-projects. During the field assessment, the team observed that most of
the "birkas" (water points) are exposed to animal dung, people are swimming, there is no fencing,
and drinking slots are not formed and that they are becoming a breeding ground for water borne
diseases..." (Participatory Assessment Report, MoFA, 2007, p. 19). Thus, it was not surprising
that the ICR team observed poor environmental conditions at a number of water points.

42. On the positive side, PCDP's promotion of improved management of pasture
development and grazing areas, and soil erosion control projects has contributed to an
improved environment. For example, experience with communal pasture improvements in
Tulunga had shown that environmental conditions improve substantially once access to pastures is
strictly limited and the rules are enforced by the community elders. Communities are able to
maintain the improved pastures. The site was selected by the community on the basis of the quality
of the grass and the even level of the land, which is owned by the community. The key to the
success and sustainability of pasture improvements is: (i) for the kebele committee for pastoral
affairs to train the community as to the rationale for enclosures, and the application of rules and
possible punishment for ignoring the rules; and (ii) the assignment of guards in strategic locations.

Procurement
43. The PAD anticipated that capacity constraints would be the main procurement issue. PCDP
provided several remedies to limit misprocurement and misallocation of funds: (i) investment to
proceed at a pace consistent with beneficiaries' implementation capacities; (ii) random audits to
review the use of funds; (iii) ex-post review of 20 percent of micro projects by independent
consultants; (iv) the FPCU to set up a roster of consultants to assist RPCUs and woredas with
procurement; and (v) if the woreda is weak and there are no capable sponsoring agencies, tendering
to be done by the RPCU for projects costing less than US$100,000. None of these remedies appear
to have been applied, either by the FPCU or the RPCU. Unfamiliarity with supporting project
documents (PAD and PIM, Financial, and Procurement Manuals) was a contributing factor to this
outcome, particularly at the RPCU and WDC levels. Despite concerns, the MTR rated
procurement activities and procurement plan implementation at the FPCU level as satisfactory.
Clearly the hoped for levels of procurement capacity were not achieved.

Financial Management (FM)
44. Inadequate forward financial planning, insufficient management oversight and weak
accountability systems led to failure in following expenditure guidelines. While this was clearly
the case in Somali, it was present to a lesser degree in other regions. The RPCU, WDCs and
woreda administrations did not follow the qualification criteria and guidelines in the PAD, PIM and
the FM and Procurement manuals, committed more funds than available, and exceeded expenditure
caps. The lack of adequate expenditure oversight undermined the principles of PCDP, as
investment funds were allocated without following the CDD approach. The March 2007 and the
February 2008 missions concluded that (with the exception of Somali), there was reasonable


                                                   10

assurance that Bank and IFAD proceeds were being used for the intended purposes. The FM rating
remained moderately unsatisfactory. Thus, as determined during project preparation, the project
continued to face a substantial risk in the area of financial management.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45. Communities and local government have demonstrated their desire for capacity to implement
sub-projects beyond initial expectations. As PCDP was initially planned as an APL to support
long-term processes and learning and this remains valid, a follow-on second APL was prepared to
continue these activities. The Board approved PCDP II (US$80 million) on May 29, 2008. IFAD
will continue to co-finance Phase II with US$33.5 million.

46. Lessons learned in Phase I have informed the design PCDP II, which will expand its activities
to 57 woredas covering about 600,000 rural households, institutionalize many activities and
strengthen pastoral risk management.

47. PCDP II has built robust results and M&E frameworks with clearer objectives, measurable
indicators, and provisions for M&E. Detailed operational guidelines have been developed for all
components. For the CIF, the approach includes annual budget and work plans for beneficiary
communities and woredas, sustained capacity building of communities, MSTs and WDCs, and the
strengthening of social analysis and accountability aspects. IGAs will be undertaken by the Federal
Cooperative Agency, which is responsible for developing rural micro-finance, and PCDP will
strengthen the capacity of this agency to adapt and extend its services to pastoral communities.
The execution of the Pastoral Risk Management component has been delegated to the Early
Warning and Response Directorate of MoARD, and implementation plans have been built on the
needs of this agency. Key challenges during Phase II will be to instill greater ownership by
regional governments, strengthen participatory approaches, provide timely social and technical
support services to a dispersed set of communities, improve compliance of communities and local
government officials with project rules and procedures, and ensure more effective M&E.

                                3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48. PCDP's objectives remain relevant to the key elements of the pastoral development
program in GoE's Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP, 2004/5 ­ 2009/10), which are to improve pastoral livelihoods and asset bases, improve
basic services in pastoral areas, and address institutional issues related to pastoralists. Pastoralists
constitute a large proportion of the poorest communities in Ethiopia, and thus considerable
assistance is still needed to reduce poverty and vulnerability of their communities.

49. The central element in the project's design--the CDD approach, was very valid. The pace
and sequencing of activities, and, in particular, how the outcome indicators themselves were
defined could have been better. The indicators, which emphasized delivery targets (outputs) rather
than outcomes, did not sufficiently capture or prioritize the institutional and organizational
dimensions despite their importance for ensuring sustainability of the achievements. This design
weakness inevitably carried over to supervision in a project where a focus on process and quality of
interventions should have been as important as amounts disbursed and/or products.

50. The three-phase APL with flexibility to support a long-term development strategy was
important given the country context, pastoral traditions, and limited existing capacity of local


                                                   11

government and communities. This allows time and actions to reinforce first period activities
and raises the likelihood of sustainable outcomes, as later projects can be designed based on
lessons learned and results achieved from the earlier phases.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

51. Insufficient and conflicting data12 and the fact that several outcome indicators do not
necessarily reflect the PDO make it a challenge to accurately evaluate if PCDP achieved its
objectives. GoE's ICR states that, "adequate and reliable quantitative information from project
woredas and regions was not available to analyze the outcomes of project interventions" (GoE ICR,
p. 26). This ICR attempts to assess if PCDP realized the PDO by looking at the PDO in two parts:
(i) providing capacity building and establishing effective models of public service delivery and
investment; and (ii) establishing effective models of disaster management in pastoral areas that
address communities' needs and reduce their vulnerability. This is achieved by assessing the
performance of the different activities that sought to achieve each part of the PDO.13

52. PDO Part (i). The project has been satisfactory in providing capacity building training at
community and public service provider levels. In the Beneficiary Assessment (May 2007) and
the Assessment of Income Generating Activities (May 2008), there is clear endorsement that the
CDD approach has built capacity, created empowerment and fostered a sense of ownership of
project activities by pastoral communities (Table 1).

53. The successful introduction of this local development process has enabled access to a
wider range of public services, i.e. health, education, and communication, and demonstrated the
high receptivity and commitment of communities to assume responsibility in playing the role as
key stakeholders in pastoral development (in partnership with other key stakeholders).
Communities identified health and education, water supply, and social infrastructure programs as



12The "Participatory Assessment Report on Implementation Arrangements by Working Team submitted to
State Minister, MOFA, 2007, and "Windows of Progress enlightened in the Implementation of Phase I"
submitted by MOFA & FPCU to MoFED, 2007 provide opposing data. The MTR M&E Report, April 2006,
and the IGA Assessment, May 2008 are consistent with the first. Project reports are in sharp contrast to the
results of an independent review on CIF and DPCF implementation in four woredas in Somali.

their investment priorities; these were the outputs most mentioned as beneficial to improving
livelihoods under PCDP.

    "The CDD approach had a positive impact on the local stakeholders and development
    agencies' (WDC, MOT, sector office experts, etc.) attitude to communities and their ability
    to initiate, implement effectively and ensure the development sustainability of community-
    based projects that are initiated, implemented, owned, managed and operated by the
    beneficiaries themselves" (Beneficiary Assessment, May 2007, p. 19).

54. Ninety eight percent of those interviewed indicated their "satisfaction" with PCDP's
community-centered approach and process, and desire to continue.14 Beneficiaries attribute
satisfaction to their ability to participate in identifying their needs, and in implementing sub-
projects through committee members they elected. Eighty two percent indicate that capacity
building training has also been "relevant" to solving their development problems, as training
messages are usable under their context and easier to disseminate to others. Focal groups indicate
that communities are now more committed to improving their livelihoods.

55. Local governments are now better able to plan and manage development activities than
in the pre-PCDP period, and delegation of authority to the local level has increased. PCDP
has trained 674 Woreda Development Committee (WDC) members, and there are now 32
functional WDCs who manage project resources and supervise sub-project activities at woreda
level (Annex 2, Tables 1& 10). In turn, PCDP seems to also have better recognition and respect
from the pastoral communities than any other institution in the lowlands (MTR, April 2006).

56. Empowerment and capacity have improved compared to what it was before PCDP.
Overall, benefits obtained in terms of "before" versus "after" the training indicate that apart from
the capacity building training and orientation, key informants value the significant impact on
empowerment of the entire beneficiary from the PLA exercise and the experience gained during
implementation of the sub-projects.

57. A total of 1,025 micro-projects were completed and 332 are ongoing. Of the completed
projects, 80 percent are operational. The largest percentage of the completed projects is in IGAs
(22.7), education (20.3), and water (20.2), followed by human health (12.6 percent), local level
support (10 percent), animal health (7.5 percent), irrigation (3.3 percent), community road (2.9
percent), natural resources (0.5 percent) and rural energy (0.1 percent) (Table 3).

58. PCDP has enhanced the capacity of grass roots institutions to provide basic services by
training over 10,000 people including 3,174 community-based workers (Annex 2, Table 10).


14"Satisfaction" refers to qualitative measures such as relevancy or usefulness, applicability to local situation
and suitability to solve local development problems.

Though the quality of services provided by these para-professionals is not high, their contribution
in areas where neither these basic services were available or adequately staffed is important.

59. Beneficiaries identify veterinary service as the most satisfactory intervention by PCDP.
Over 200,000 people have benefited from animal health subprojects. Due to difficulties in
attracting the required technical personnel to these harsh areas, PCDP has recruited enlightened
pastoralists and trained them to become community animal health workers to serve the community
within their locality. Adequate animal drugs have been provided; the vaccination programs carried
out are relatively better than before PCDP; and overall veterinary service has improved.

60. Beneficiaries value the creation of educational facilities, which has contributed to
improving school participation of boys and girls. Alternative Basic Education (ABE) sites, and
first and second cycle schools at one or different place(s), Junior and Senior high schools, and
teachers' resident houses have been constructed within the pastoral communities. Most schools are
built in areas where there were no schools previously, and these have also reduced distances to
schools. There is now one PCDP constructed and maintained school per 620 km2 and one school
per two kebeles (MTR M&E Evaluation, p. 43). More than 20,000 students are expected to benefit
from the 180 operational education sub-projects.

61. Better health services, water supply, rural/feeder roads and range management have
helped to enhance livelihoods. For example, Argoba woreda in Afar, with 13 administrative
kebeles and a population of 15,000, was previously inaccessible, and had no road connecting the
kebeles to the woreda capital. Since the community prioritized access roads, 74 kilometers of
access roads have been built. Consequently other social services like schools and health posts are
being constructed. Expectant mothers are now able to access the health center. Although some of
the health posts constructed have not yet begun providing the intended services, the PCDP
interventions in human health have brought about general awareness among the beneficiary
communities in relation to environmental sanitation, family planning, and child care, among others.

62. PCDP has built capacity by equipping government institutions in the four regions, at
woreda and community levels, to access previously inaccessible communities. Almost all
woredas have communication and transport equipment, and other office and agricultural tools.
These institutions are now better able to manage development activities and provide necessary
services. Generally, the impact of capacity building activities has been fundamental to
sustainability and enhanced development in the lowlands.

63. Beneficiaries characterize IGAs, a new area introduced by PCDP, as being relevant to
addressing their needs, and as having improved their livelihoods. Jobless youth and women's
groups in particular indicate that IGAs are relevant to improving their livelihoods in terms of
generating additional income, creating self-employment, and strengthening their social ties. Youth
groups have developed brick-making skills and supply bricks to contractors for building schools
and health posts, generating income. The social benefits seem remarkable, as IGA groups have
been formed on a voluntary basis and support each other during emergencies. 35 percent of the
IGAs sampled say they are saving. Groups repeatedly say that the new activities (other than
livestock rearing) have assisted them in acquiring additional skills that improve their lives.

64. Despite these encouraging signs, beneficiaries indicate that capacity building activity at
community level remains weak as they still lack confidence to undertake procurement and
financial management, and most communities and local governments feel that they still have to rely
on external support to propose and execute projects. In most areas, it is the MOTs who have been
conducting needs assessments, proposing and supervising projects consistent with regular



                                                    15

government planning procedures and planning periods. MOTs indicate that sustainability will
depend on the commitment of GoE and/or other organizations to undertake similar activities and
procedures once PCDP is no more. Thus, more capacity building, frequent training, onsite
experience sharing and learning, and frequent monitoring are needed to further empower the
community and ensure sustainability of PCDP's outputs (Performance M&E Report, April 2006).

65. PCDP has been moderately satisfactory in establishing an effective model of public
service delivery and investment. This relates to the procedures and principles of the CIF, and
support services to strengthen public services (under the SLE Component). PCDP's planned model
can be summarized as follows: (a) training of MSTs and other stakeholders; (b) MSTs use PLA
tools and help communities to plan sub-projects based on Community Development Plans. Such
capacity building is to be eventually taken up by MOTs; (c) prior to acceptance for CIF financing,
WDCs appraise plans against transparent criteria including nature and type, environmental
screening and guidelines, technical standards, and woreda development priorities; (d) the woreda
administrator (in case of a community micro-projects) and the woreda council (in case of
intercommunity sub-projects) approve funding; (e) the woreda finance office disburses funds; and
(f) the community implements the sub-projects.

66. The above mechanism has been set up, with some limitations. With respect to (a) and (b),
the frequent MST and MOT visits to sub-projects in the first year (2-3 times a week) declined with
the rapid increase in project woredas and kebeles. Dissatisfied beneficiaries point to the limited
amount, duration and types of training and the high turnover of staff in the project development
offices. The timing and sequencing of capacity building could also have been better. Training for
elected CDC members differed from woreda to woreda, and some CDC members were trained
quite late after sub-project construction commenced (i.e. in Kebribeya woreda in Somali, where
there was also misunderstanding between the WDC and the RPCU). More effective capacity
building at the local level could have provided a check on several issues PCDP faced, such as the
top-down execution of some activities, limited accountability and opportunities for fraud.
Especially, combined with weak M&E, these shortcomings led to elite capture by some woreda
administrations.15 On (c) above, WDC screening processes are unclear, and varied by woreda.
WDCs do not seem to have carefully assessed woreda needs with respect to CBWs (Annex 2), and
environmental screening was poor. Of those interviewed, 97 percent stated that the designs for
infrastructure built (schools, flourmills, milk collection units etc.) in their respective locality
corresponded to GoE standards, and were prepared/came from relevant sectoral offices/Regional
Bureaus (except in Somali, where construction quality was not based on government standards).
Site observations confirmed that infrastructure designs and quality conformed to GoE standards.
The construction quality in some cases was better than that of similar infrastructure built in
neighboring kebeles by government and NGOs. On (d) and (e), although WDCs approved
proposals submitted by a large number of communities, RPCUs did not release funds, as budget
requirements of approved sub-project proposals in some woredas far exceeded the available project
budget. In some cases, communities could not complete sub-projects and obtain services.

67. Despite these limitations, PCDP has contributed to enhancing the asset bases and lives of
pastoralists. Overall, the IGA evaluation concluded that despite all the challenges with lack of
continuous PCDP support, the sub-projects resulted in "tremendous work load reduction, saving
time and energy of women, assisting members to develop entrepreneurship skills, enhancing youth
participation and strengthening social bondage and cultivating the culture of self support during
emergencies. In some instances, it demonstrated that the poor can save".

68. PDO Part (ii). PCDP has been marginally unsatisfactory in achieving the second part of
the PDO. The reorganization of DPPC made it almost impossible to stick to the conditions and
sequencing set out in the PIM. As a result, completion of disaster preparedness and contingency
plans was only achieved shortly before project closing (Annex 2). Drought struck many areas
during the DPPC-DPPA stalemate. As DPCF resources were available, regions used the fund
(based on local and traditional knowledge of communities to reduce vulnerability) to intervene in
drought-affected areas both inside and outside project woredas. The procedures followed differed
by region. In some areas the project financed drought emergency response using shelf projects on
an ad-hoc basis. The efficiency and sustainability of such interventions was questionable, and
these practices were suspended by MTR in 2006. US$12.9 million of DPCF resources were
transferred to the CIF and the rest was to be utilized once preconditions for fund use were met.

69. As the planned institutional framework was not in place, the component was executed by
the regions in an ad hoc manner. DPCF sub-projects in different regions are at various stages of
implementation. Some are not functional, especially in Somali, where only 73 percent of project
completed are operating. In Afar, the region decided to use the DPCF outside PCDP woredas.

3.3 Efficiency

70. The PCDP PAD indicated that given the demand-driven nature of the sub-projects,
conventional calculations of net present values and economic rates of return would have little
meaning, as: benefits of the capacity-building components (support to communities and local
governance) cannot easily be quantified in monetary terms; the investment component cannot be
known ex ante, since it is demand-driven and defined in the course of the project; and many
benefits from anticipated investments similarly defy quantification.

71. The project did not collect any comprehensive quantitative input/output/revenue data that
would enable the ICR to carry out conventional analyses. Activity reviews, however, show that in
general, communities chose investments that mattered most to them. The construction costs of
health posts and schools compared favorably with those of NGOs following similar construction
methods, probably due to community involvement and contribution. However, many incomplete
structures have contributed to losses in efficiency (IFAD, June 2008).

72. PCDP II conducted an analysis that examined: (i) disaster early warning and response; (ii)
IGAs; and (iii) the introduction of a process to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness of all
project-supported investments. This analysis is presented in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73. PCDP partially achieved its PDO. As shown above, the project's main activities and
achievements were under Part (i) of the PDO (and in component 1, which accounted for 66 percent
of total project costs). Through the CDD approach, PCDP did create genuine participation and
empowerment of pastoral communities and grass root institutions including government,
community-based organizations and individuals. Almost four million people have benefited from
micro-projects (Annex 2 Table 9). The project, however, did not establish an effective model of
disaster management in pastoral areas due to the restructuring and subsequent lack of uptake by the
institution that was to carry out the component. The activities were therefore badly sequenced with
the planning mechanisms being completed only shortly before project closing.



                                                   17

74. PCDP's impact on the local stakeholders and development agencies' attitudes to
communities and their ability to implement projects has been positive, and project
investments have improved pastoral livelihoods and reduced their vulnerability. This is
sufficient to give PCDP a Moderately Satisfactory rating.

75. The `MS' rating reflects: (i) the relevance of the project's design and interventions; (ii) the
evidence that most social infrastructure construction costs compared favorably with those of NGOs
following similar methods, and the quality of most subprojects was consistent with GoE standards;
(iii) the satisfaction by stakeholders with the gains derived and their satisfaction with the CDD
process; and (iv) the evidence that increased capacity and effective mechanisms are place to
provide continuity and the possibility of sustainability in the future.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
76. PCDP contributed significantly to fostering local involvement of both men and women in
planning and implementing community sub-projects, and to making them more confident that they
can take on local development, and can demand service delivery from government agencies.

77. According to PCDP data, women make up 67 percent of the beneficiaries from IGAs in
SNNPR, 71 percent in Somali Region and 88 percent in Oromia Region. Gender-disaggregated
data on the IGA's were not available for Afar Region. Women were also reported as the major
beneficiaries of micro-projects and social investments (40 percent of the Grade 1-4 pupils in a
PCDP-financed school were girls, and women benefitted disproportionately from increased access
to water, health posts/infant care, and grain mills).

78. The IGAs also contributed to livelihood diversification and employment, and addressed
poverty through increased/stable incomes. In many instances, the most vulnerable members of the
community were identified as micro-project beneficiaries, for example through participatory wealth
ranking/classification and decision-making processes. In addition to community-based targeting,
self-targeting was also practiced. Use of bottom-up targeting mechanisms combined with adapted
CDD approaches that limit entry barriers to participation has enhanced the likelihood of reaching
those most in poverty, and reinforced ownership and sustainability of interventions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
79. PCDP contributed to some longer-term capacity and institutional development by progressively
strengthening the decentralization process (through training woreda and kebele officers) and
mainstreaming institutional change through building and demonstrating CDD models. There is now
broader access to essential public services, including trained local staff and equipment at health
posts, schools, and kebele administrative offices in beneficiary woredas. There is also increased
awareness and improved action among government sector staff to harmonize interventions through
joint planning in order to respond to community needs in a demand-driven and integrated manner.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
80. One unintended negative outcome was the over-commitment to sub-projects and shortage of
funds towards the end of PCDP. Lack of sufficient consideration of budget balances, indicative
budget ceilings per region, and clear annual budgeting systems contributed to a race for funds
under the CIF that led to overreach in some cases, incomplete sub-projects, and a shortfall in
resources to complete all approved sub-projects. This could lead to a loss of confidence among
beneficiaries if agreed activities are not completed. GoE has confirmed that incomplete Phase I
projects will be completed using phase II funds.


                                                   18

81. Two positive outcomes are: (i) the increased demand for service delivery and community
development approaches in woredas neighboring PCDP target woredas. This is increasing the
pressure on GoE to invest in these areas based on the priorities of residents; and (ii) GoE's robust
response to the misuse of project funds in Somali has clearly signaled that it will not tolerate use of
investment funds for unintended purposes or in a manner inconsistent with its procedures. The
subsequent willingness to identify and remedy fiduciary weaknesses has strengthened the fiduciary
management framework for PCDP II.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

82. Some of the key observations in the Beneficiary Assessment (May 2007) summarized in
Annex 5 include: (i) increasing the ratio of MSTs and MOTs to the number of sub-projects on
which they work, given the success of projects that MSTs and MOTs visited more frequently and
in a timely manner (as in the first year sub-projects that match the supervision capacity of the
available MST/MOT); (ii) institutionalizing the CDD approach requires continuous training for
capacity building and also the inclusion of more literate individuals in the selection of training
participants; (iii) the importance of taking into consideration the availability of budget in advance
so that beneficiaries are not dissatisfied; and (iv) the need to consider a `minimum package' that
includes the required services and other inputs when planning sub-projects.

                 4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

83. Overall, the risk to development outcomes is evaluated as moderate. The risk is low in
some areas, given: (i) GoE's commitment to pastoral development; (ii) the high ownership of
PCDP I by local government and by beneficiaries through the CDD process; and (iii) the relatively
low to modest financial risks linked to sustainability of most micro-investments. There are
substantial risks, however, in other areas (as mentioned in the PCDP II PAD), including: the risk of
political and bureaucratic interference with attempts at elite capture; disruptions due to conflict,
mainly in the Somali Region; failure of GoE to develop a comprehensive framework for risk
management in pastoral areas, and to improve relations with NGOs; and livelihood gains being
undermined by natural disasters, in particular, a severe drought.

84. The institutional risk to development outcome is low. PCDP has contributed to longer-term
institutional development as evidenced by the gradual shifts in attitudes and practice. GoE's
commitment to support decentralized processes should further strengthen the linkages and
efficiency between different levels of government, and the gains to be derived from PCDP.

85. The economic and financial risk to development outcome is low. Economic infrastructure
strengthened and funded by PCDP is on a relatively modest operational and financial scale and can
be maintained by the regional and community level committees. Similarly, the private sector
interventions for IGA's are not in areas of high cost infrastructure and operating capital, and can be
maintained by the community groups who prioritized them as a need.

86. The social risk to development outcome is low. The CDD approach has created social capital.
As communities increase their management capacities, assets and income, they should be in a more
equitable position with other rural actors, and able to partner more effectively with other key
stakeholders. Meeting these aims would increase the communities overall development trajectory
and resilience to risks. PCDP has also started to mainstream gender and social equity in the local


                                                    19

development agenda. More needs to be done to enhance involvement of women on decision-
making groups, which is still hampered by traditional social structures.

87. The environmental risk to development outcome is substantial given that PCDP failed to
develop environmental and social management capacity through the: (i) appointment of qualified
Regional Environmental Specialists to oversee the implementation of the EAMP; and (ii)
implementation of an environmental training program to strengthen capacity at the kebele level.
PCDP II will need to focus immediately on strengthening environmental and social management
capacity, and to making a commitment to frequent environmental supervision missions.

              5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88. The Bank conducted relevant ESW, collaborated with other donors, and discussed the project
proposals with stakeholders to develop a relevant project. The Bank should have performed much
better in several aspects: paying sufficient attention at the outset to establishing baselines for each
region linked to an M&E system; setting out clear procedures in the PIM on assessing the
efficiency and sustainability of sub-projects selected and managed; and sequencing of project
activities. Earlier preparation of the PIM, which was left for effectiveness, might have also helped
in ensuring earlier buy-in to the process of PCDP. The design also underestimated the time and
effort (in terms of training, MSTs etc.) needed to graduate the woredas, undermining the CDD
facilitation process and implementation. Finally, the project's KPIs mostly emphasized delivery
targets rather than clear measurable outcome indicators of capacity and improvements in
livelihoods. This negatively influenced implementation and supervision in a project where a focus
on delivery, i.e. amounts disbursed, was prioritized in detriment to measuring and analyzing quality
of community development processes and sustainability of outcomes.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Marginally Unsatisfactory

89. There were long gaps in Bank supervision missions (despite QAG's suggestion for intense
supervision).16 This is also confirmed in the low supervision costs incurred in FY05 (see Annex 4).

90. Supervision missions also failed to act on signs of weaknesses in a timely manner,
including follow-up on recommendations made during supervision visits. These failures
included institutional issues (M&E systems not in place), operational issues (work plan approval
procedures not followed in some regions and supply driven allocations being made), and financial
management issues (slow actions on signs of non-compliance and misprocurement). The
Supervision Mission of November 2007 itself points to previous unheeded recommendations.

91. Although the Bank pointed to the lack of outcome indicators affecting implementation,
the team did not remedy this, and supervision efforts continued to focus on fund expenditure
and disbursement triggers as opposed to development impact. The MTR Aide Memoire notes



16There was a gap of eight months between the second (November 2004) and third supervision missions
(July/August 05), and one year between the third and the MTR in June/July 2006.


                                                    20

the concern that no DPCPs or baseline studies had been initiated to launch the disaster contingency
planning process. The next sentence states, "This delay is particularly disconcerting with respect to
a trigger for the initiation of Phase II of PCDP".

92. The Bank team failed to act on the high disbursement rates from 2004-06 (that also
coincides with infrequent supervision), and allowed the project to run out of funds, despite
noting these issues in the November 2004 Aide Memoire, as: (i) the speed with which community
infrastructure projects were being constructed and the large numbers that were not yet ready to
provide the required services; (ii) the "push from the top to disburse funds quickly" (Aide Memoire,
Nov. 15-30, 2004); and (iii) the unsustainable situation of MSTs as the project scaled up.

93. ISRs were not candid in the ratings, and, in some cases, were inconsistent with the
corresponding Aide Memoires.17 At MTR, two of the three components were not progressing
well (see Cover Letter to the State Minister and Aide Memoire of July 2006). Yet, the Bank rated
progress towards achieving the PDO and implementation as satisfactory. Ratings on safeguard
compliance were also inconsistent. Overall, supervision reports were not substantiated by data.

94. The Bank undertook only two environmental supervision missions, and paid little
attention to environmental management capacity building. Although the MTR noted concern
that sub-projects implemented prior to December 2005 might lack apt mitigation measures, the
ISRs continued to rate `Environmental Assessment' as "satisfactory', through the MTR. Ratings
on Environment and Pest Management were finally downgraded to `MS' in the ISR of March 27,
2007, although correspondence from the Project's Environmental Specialist on March 27, 2007
states that, "the rating for environment is to be Unsatisfactory since the environmental training as
agreed was not carried out; and the OPs showing as triggered are not correct." (Project files).

95. Although supervision efforts improved from 2007 until project closing, these efforts
focused on satisfying the Phase I triggers. The Bank took actions on some identified problems
and gave more candid (downgraded) ratings, including appropriate action on the findings of the
audit and PPR. A positive change in the Project Coordinator at FPCU also contributed to better
Bank supervision. PCDP Phase II was discussed as early as during the Phase I MTR, when a
PM&E system had yet to be established and several sub-components were not performing
satisfactorily (MTR Aide Memoire, July 2006). The Aide Memoire of March 23, 2007 states that
it was premature to formally initiate the preparation of an APL II due to: (i) fiduciary concerns; (ii)
the need for improvement of implementation modalities in Somali region; and (iii) the status of
implementation of trigger studies not allowing adequate assessment of performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

96. Overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory despite the overall outcome
rating of `MS', as the ICR team concludes that the poor supervision quality outweighs the `MS'




17 See Country Director's comment on the rejection of the ISR of May 23, 2005; upgrading of the Risk
Management component in same ISR; inconsistency between the MTR Aide Memoire and the ISR of August
25, 2006, i.e. the unsatisfactory performance under Component 3 described in the Aide Memoire and the MS
rating in the ISR.

rating for quality of entry.18 Supervision was ineffective, with significant lapses in terms of the
failure to act on the rapid disbursements for sub-projects over a two-year period that left about 25
percent of the approved sub-projects incomplete, the lack of action in light of the failure of PCDP
to implement M&E, and weak procurement supervision, including the absence of follow up on the
project's remedies to limit misprocurement and misallocation of funds. These issues raised
considerable concerns about the appropriate (transparent) use of resources towards the agreed
PDOs (ISR, March 26, 2008). The Bank also did not adequately follow-up on several
shortcomings in design, i.e. the poor choice of expenditure-related KPIs and the lack of outcome
indicators, no useful baseline studies, and sequencing issues, especially under the risk management
component, which was considered critical to safeguarding the vulnerability of pastoralists .

97. Quality Assurance Group ratings. The Stage One rating in the Sixth Quality at Entry
Assessment (QAE6) was Moderately Unsatisfactory based on: (i) the low importance given to
structural and sector policy reforms in a project of this nature, where decentralization and
institutional development are critical to successfully implementing an APL program; (ii) the
serious capacity constraints for implementation, particularly at the woreda level needed to be
addressed with urgency, and the fact that the project had not yet worked out the operational details
of these actions; (iii) the considerable risks of elite capture; and (iv) the government not having the
instruments or the experience to guarantee success in decentralization of decision-making. The
QAG Panel believed that given the many uncertainties surrounding the infant CDD approach itself
and the risks of this project; a more gradual smaller-scale approach would have been preferable.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

98. Despite the fact that GoE has demonstrated a commitment to pastoral communities and to
decentralization, there were sufficient shortcomings before and during project implementation to
rate borrower performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory. First, the switch of Ministries at
appraisal without notice to the Bank undermined readiness for implementation. This change also
introduced more risks of political influence (evidenced through the performance of the
implementing agency below) as MoFA was more an administrative Ministry while MoA was a
more technical-oriented Ministry. There also appeared to be different visions of pastoral
development between the two Ministries, with MoFA accepting more than MoA that settlement
was a characteristic of future development of pastoral areas. Second, the protracted process of the
restructuring of DPPA and the subsequent failure to resolve institutional responsibilities
jeopardized the risk management component. Third, poor cooperation between and across
Government administrative units led to inaction and delays in appointing adequate numbers and
levels of personnel to staff. For example, some of the social infrastructure (schools, human and
animal health posts) built by the project remain poorly staffed. Further, shortage of government
workers and budget limited the effectiveness of MOTs at woreda levels and impacted negatively on
joint planning and operations. Finally, the PAD identified GoE relations with NGOs as a risk,
mentioning NGO involvement as invaluable to project success. Overall, collaboration with NGOs
was not as strong as foreseen during PCDP design (MTR, Annex 6.1), and remained weak. GoE




18The ICR Guidelines suggest that if one on the two dimensions (Quality at Entry and Supervision) is in the
satisfactory range and the other is in the unsatisfactory range, the overall performance rating would normally
depend on the Outcome rating, unless Bank performance did not significantly affect the particular outcome.

inaction on the JSDF delayed activities that required the capacity of existing NGOs, and would
have likely resulted in enhanced project outcomes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

99. The FPCU was carrying out a project using an approach that was intensive in its use of
personnel and complex in its myriad and nature of relationships required for successful
implementation. As the project became better known and activity increased across 32 woredas in
the four regions, the FPCU did not maintain systematic procedures for operations as outlined in the
PAD/PIM and other manuals. Thus, the sequencing and selection criteria for sub-project selection
were not enforced, staff was not adequately trained, and sufficient linkages with partner
organizations were not maintained as initially envisaged. These weaknesses were compounded by
the long distances and difficult terrain to be covered and shortage of required qualified staff in the
areas. M&E was also very poor; there was limited data collection, analysis, and reporting of
lessons learned. There were also clear failures in the management and delivery of funds, leading to
cases of misprocurement. This resulted in hasty decisions, in some cases influenced by political
pressure, and financial commitments beyond the funds available for the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

100. The overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is based largely on the failures related to
coordination (between and across governmental entities), implementation (not following
procedures for selection of sub-projects, misprocurement and over-commitment), and failure to
make progress on the policy aspects of PCDP that are seen to be critical to longer-term
sustainability. While supervision reports did point to many of the weaknesses, they were not
adequately addressed during implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

101. Do not shy away from formally restructuring a project. Rather than hoping for the best
when repeatedly confronting implementation problems, Bank teams should be proactive in
proposing changes (such as in the results framework and indicators), which would result in greater
clarity and a more substantive definition of project outcomes.

102. Certain projects require closer supervision. Projects such as CDD projects, with new and
unfamiliar processes, projects spread across large geographical areas where local procurement is
required, projects covering different ethnic and/or religious groups where decision-makers often
tend to bias allocations, in situations where very few or no projects have ever been implemented,
and projects that include zones with known political tensions and civil unrest, require intensive
supervision.19 Thus, regular joint supervision visits by World Bank teams, partner agencies and
external consultants should be budgeted to allow for higher frequency.

103. When sub-projects are designed, all inputs, including human resource capacity, which
are required to operate the facilities, should be considered up front. (See Annex 5, Beneficiary



19 For example, in two Bank projects in FY09 for US$30 ­ 40 million in fairly compact and accessible
countries--Serbia and Croatia, the supervision budget was US$90,000 each plus modest GEF funds,
compared to PCDP's US$70,000.

Assessment recommendations on a "minimum package" for implementing projects). For example,
adequate attention should be given to the number and types of CBOs trained vis-à-vis the facilities
built to ensure no major disparities. Also, when sub-projects in health, veterinary posts and/or
schools are considered, assurances that the technical equipment and materials needed for these
facilities to function should be sought. Several project-funded schools lack water accessibility and
accommodation for teachers; some grinding mills have no water in the vicinity. Sector
coordination at local government level is required to ensure that service delivery can commence
soon after sub-projects are completed.

104. A consistent results framework, with outcome indicators that are clearly linked to the
PDO and differentiated from input/output indicators is very important. Closer attention
should be paid to the relationship between meeting indicators of performance and how these very
indicators might influence the implementation process. This is especially so in a project where
process (both in terms of participation and sequencing) is critical to usefulness and sustainability of
the interventions. Given the Ethiopian national context and current stage of decentralization, CDD
as the major design characteristic needed to have indicators and targets that were less expenditure
and more process and outcome oriented. Due to the focus on meeting project targets and triggers
linked to expenditure, the required "moderate" pacing and sensitization, close monitoring and
supervision, lessons learning and reflection were compromised. Getting the right links and balance
between inputs, outputs and outcomes, and product and process in the design and implementation
framework is vital.

105. Institutional and community capacity building should be stressed more when there are
new approaches and institutions. PCDP tried a new approach in Ethiopia (CDD) and involved
MoFA, which was new to implementing such a project. In such cases, much greater priority needs
to be given to training at the start of the project and recognizing the need for this training
throughout the project, and especially when there are changes in personnel. Further, training
should be extended to collaborating partners beyond the project staff. One major shortcoming in
PCDP was not providing sufficient capacity building for government staff and elected community
officials (WDCs) as opposed to project staff. Further, a flexible capacity building program needs
to be established throughout the implementation period, and this should be extended, repeated and
adapted to needs that might arise. This continuous information, training and capacity building
support are also needed for both social and private investment activities.

                        ANNEX 2: OUTPUTS BY COMPONENTS20

Component 1: Sustainable Livelihood Enhancement (SLE, US$36.52 million)

Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

This is a key component that accounts for about 66 percent of total project financing. It aimed to
establish decentralized and participatory planning procedures at the kebele and woreda levels,
operating within the regional government structure. It had three sub-components: (i) Capacity
Building; (ii) Community Investment Fund (CIF); and (iii) Support Services.

Sub-component 1: Capacity Building
Achievements under this sub-component are rated satisfactory as the project successfully
undertook skills training in key areas and built local community capacities to develop their own
community development plans (CDPs), and met all indicator targets.

Three key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
        (i) increased delegation of authority to woredas, kebeles and communities;
        (ii) existence and use of transparent, accountable, demand-driven, and decision-making
        processes at community level; and
        (iii) broader representation of hitherto marginalized groups in local affairs.

All three indicators have been met (except in the Somali region, where under (ii) above,
transparent decision-making processes were not always used).

Indicator (i): PCDP has established 32 woreda development committees (WDCs) that are
functional, manage project resources and supervise sub-project activities at the woreda level. In
addition, 592 kebele-level community project management committees (CPMCs) have been
established and are operational. In the Beneficiary Assessment, 97 percent of the key informants
interviewed (including community elders, traditional/clan leaders, CDC, NGO and MOT members,
school headmasters, veterinary post officers and health extension workers) confirmed that
community development committees (CDCs) were established. The CDCs mobilized and
coordinated beneficiaries' participation, and managed and operated community sub-projects.

Indicator (ii): According to the Beneficiary Assessment, the project successfully empowered
beneficiary communities, with 90 percent of them indicating that capacity building has enhanced
their empowerment and decision making, and have developed a feeling of ownership of sub-

 projects. The satisfaction with PCDP is associated with the creation of grassroots institutions that
 mobilize beneficiaries to organize themselves, initiate, manage and operate projects that facilitate
 the achievement of a common goal, and allow them to check/control any action that was against
 their interests (for example in avoiding corrupt practices in bid processing, purchases, etc.). The
 trainings have enabled beneficiary communities to articulate their local development plan.

 Indicator (iii): In the Beneficiary Assessment, 97 percent of the respondents indicated that all
 beneficiaries were participating in implementing and managing micro-projects. They also
 recognized that the project's approaches emphasized the participation of marginalized groups in
 local affairs through greater involvement of women and youth in community activities including
 the identification and selection of sub-projects. Nevertheless, women have had a relatively passive
 role in the decision-making of pastoral communities, despite the orientation awareness. Women's
 participation in training and capacity building has been limited compared to men, partly due to
 religious or customary rules of traditional societies. Men have benefited most from the training.

 Through the JSDF grant, PCDP has also secured the involvement Civil Society Organizations
 (CSOs) to implement complementary capacity building activities in the project areas, although
 these activities started late. Eleven CSOs supported community-based capacity building processes.
 Achievements of the CSOs include: (i) 14 community development plans (CDPs) prepared and
 completed in 16 woredas; (ii) over 80 community project management committees established and
 strengthened; (iii) about 20 community service management committees established; (iv) 20
 business management committees established and reorganized; (v) 14 new women's groups
 organized; and (vi) 33 women's business management committees established and reorganized.

 Sub-component 2: Community Investment Fund (CIF)
 Achievements under this sub-component are rated satisfactory. The CIF aimed to provide funds to
 implement community/inter-community-prepared and WDC-appraised sub-projects.

 Two key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
          (i) Number of community development plans (CDPs)developed and approved.
          (ii) Number of micro-investments and inter-community sub-projects executed.

 Both indicators have been met.




                                                    27

Indicator (i): A total of 500 CDPs were prepared at the kebele level. The training provided to
WDCs and MSTs in Participatory Rural Appraisal and Participatory Learning and Action tools has
facilitated community consultations, awareness creation and preparation of CDPs. However, the
CDPs have not always been used; a top down approach was more frequently used in Somali.

Indicator (ii): A total of 1,025 micro-projects and inter-community micro-projects were completed
and 332 are in the process of implementation. Of the completed projects, 823 are operational. The
largest percentage of the completed projects is in IGAs (22.7), education (20.3), and water (20.2).
The share of other activities is in human health (12.6 percent), local level support (10 percent),
animal health (7.5 percent), irrigation (3.3 percent), community road (2.9 percent), natural
resources (0.5 percent) and rural energy (0.1 percent).

Income Generating Activities (IGAs). Beneficiaries characterize IGAs as having improved their
livelihoods. Pastoral women did not have experience in IGAs. PCDP activities have increased
their capacity and skill in entrepreneurship development through training, and many women are
engaged in petty trade and micro-business activities either on an individual and/or a group basis.

Oromia accounts for 70 percent of the IGAs (Table 7). The most common IGAs are livestock
marketing/raring, grinding mills, services, and petty trade. In all sampled IGAs, the selection of
business type is not based on a feasibility study of the business, but rather on beneficiaries' past
experience. About 92.5 percent of the IGA surveyed are organized groups. Seventy percent of the
sampled IGAs are illiterate.

The profitability of IGAs could not be measured as financial documents and statements are either
not available or limited to fragmented records. However, most of the interviewed IGAs members
reported that they are making a profit from their business, and that the social benefits are important.
The sustainability of some of the IGAs is a major issue. In addition, the financial management of
IGAs is weak as there are no financial guidelines in all surveyed IGAs and little or no technical
assistance has been received in this area. The grant application, processing and disbursement are
generally not transparent and exposed to manipulation even by MOT members. Most of the
interviewed IGA groups expressed that they do not know the amount of the grant that they received
from the project. There are also some serious risks due to the fact that management members are
bank signatories and at same time approve the payments.

Sub-component 3: Support Services

Achievements under this sub-component are rated moderately satisfactory. Support services aim
to finance strategic infrastructure investments and strengthen public service delivery at regional
and woreda levels, and targeted research into rain-fed and irrigated cropping, range management,
livestock production and non-agricultural issues relevant to pastoralists.

Six key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
        (i) New technologies developed and existing technologies adapted to local conditions;
        (ii) Technology adoption rate;
        (iii) Literacy rates;
        (iv) Access and use of mobile and stationary health and education services;
        (v) Training programs completed; and
        (vi) Research contract granted

The project met two it the six indicators and partially met the third.
        Indicator (i): The project developed 6 new crop and forage varieties. The new varieties
        were introduced to 780 agro-pastoral communities.
        Indicator (ii): The technology adoption rate was not measured.
        Indicator (iii): Literacy rates were not measured.
        Indicator (iv): The indicator was not met. Access to stationary health and education
        services were not measured and no mobile services were supported during Phase I.
        Nevertheless, the project successfully constructed and rehabilitated 203 schools, 214
        human health and animal health posts.




                                                    30

         Indicator (v): Over 10,000 people including 3,174 community-based workers (CBWs) in
         animal and human health, teaching, and traditional birth attendance have been trained.
         Indicator (vi): The indicator was not met. No research contracts were granted.

In addition to the improvements in veterinary services, education, health and rural roads (discussed
in the ICR text Section 3.2), beneficiaries mention their appreciation of improvements made with
regard to the participation of women. PCDP activities have raised awareness of women to attend
meetings with men, participate in micro-project identification, prioritization, selection,
implementation with their labor, to be organized into women groups for special economic activities
of their own interest, decision-making at all levels (at home and in public meetings).

There are several issues under the sub-component. These include: disparities between the
composition of CBWs and the facilities executed through PCDP support (Beneficiary Assessment,
May 2007, p. 32-33); and delays in completed sub-projects providing the intended services. From
Tables 5 and 10, we see that Oromia accounts for 1130 of the 1502 (75 percent) of the community
animal health workers trained across all regions. The Beneficiary Assessment reports that this is
too much for a total of 26 animal health facilities executed (including the ongoing sub-projects) in
the region. The Tables show that, taking ratios of trained workers to facilities built, there would be
about 2.4 community teachers trained per school across all regions. Similarly, there are about 1.3
workers for each health facility executed. On the contrary, there are about 12.5 animal health
workers trained for each animal health facility. In Oromia, this ratio is 43 workers per animal
health facility built, and only 5 human health workers trained for 30 human health facilities
executed with 15 of them already completed. Although the case of Oromia is taken as an example,
this discrepancy between trained CBWs vis-a-vis the facilities executed is also observed in the
other regions.

According to the FPCU, the incompatibility of manpower capacity and sub-project construction is
due to inadequate assessment of CBW needs by woredas, who should be making the requests, and
PCDP providing the training only on the bias of the training needs of woredas. Focal groups and
key informants note that the number of sub-projects constructed in many woredas exceed the
available human resources capacity. Thus, there are sub-projects that were completed including
schools that are not providing services. The delays in the delivery of services have had a negative
impact on the attitude change and the confidence developed as beneficiaries are disappointed.

Component 2: Pastoral Risk Management (US$16.43)

Achievements under this component are rated marginally unsatisfactory. The protracted
restructuring of DPPC led to unclear institutional arrangements and lack of leadership for the
implementation of the component, impairing the overall effectiveness of the component.

This component aimed to address pastoral risk management through: (i) the creation of a credible
early warning system (EWS); (ii) the definition of `warning stages' summing up different levels of
threat; (iii) the preparation, in advance of a drought, of a woreda disaster preparedness contingency
plan (DPCP) containing long-term activities to mitigate risk and reduce vulnerability, as well as
`shelf projects' to be rapidly implemented in response to specific warning stages; (iv) the
preparation of a woreda disaster preparedness and prevention manual; and (v) a woreda disaster
preparedness and contingency fund (DPCF).

Sub-component 1: Community-based Early Warning System (EWS)

Achievements are rated marginally unsatisfactory because of its late and generally ineffective
implementation, resulting in the partial completion of its indicator targets. The EWS was to build
on ongoing efforts by the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission and some NGOs to
establish, at the woreda level, systems for collecting and analyzing basic household welfare and
natural resource, economic and conflict-related data, using a survey instrument designed for
pastoral production systems.

Two key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
         (i) Timely delivery of remote sensed information to woredas.
         (ii) Food security assessment applied in threatened areas.

PCDP did not achieve the two indicator targets but made some progress in PCDP's last year.
         Indicator (i): The project established a pastoral EWS in 23 woredas and the EWS
         implementation manual was prepared in January 2008, ready for use.
         Indicator (ii): The EWS in Somali region was expanded to project woredas in Oromia and
         SNNPR and the livelihood baseline data were collected for all woredas.

Sub-component 2: Disaster Contingency Planning

Achievements under this sub-component are rated marginally unsatisfactory. This subcomponent
aimed to build capacity at woreda, zonal and regional levels to prepare DPCPs and manuals,
monitor local disaster indicators, and manage funds.

Two key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
         (i) Disaster plans implemented as necessary.
         (ii) Cereal stocks used when necessary.

The project made some progress towards one indicator target and did not meet the other.
Indicator (i): The indicator was partially met. All 23 DPCPs were prepared and are ready to be
used, but were too late to influence decisions made under the DPCF.
Indicator (ii): The indicator was not met.




                                                   32

Sub-component 3: Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Fund (DPCF)

Achievements are rated marginally unsatisfactory. The DPCF was to finance activities identified
in the woreda DPCP in the project woredas. However, in the absence of woreda DPCPs and the
manual of procedures for Fund use, the Fund was implemented in an ad hoc manner. The project
then decided to use the fund for projects based on local and traditional knowledge of communities
to reduce vulnerability to disaster and rapid reaction to crises in these areas. Project activities were
financed, but without following the procedures set out in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).

This sub-component aimed to provide the initial 30 woredas with development and rapid reaction
grants to finance activities identified in their DPCPs.

Two key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
        (i) Number of regional plans developed and approved.
        (ii) Number of investments executed (i.e. feeder roads, ponds, markets built, etc.).

Indicators have been met (but out of sequence).
Indicator (i): 23 DPCPs have been prepared. Nine woredas are delayed due to security reasons.
Indicator (ii): The DPCF financed 447 community-based sub-projects and emergency responses.
The majority of these projects were implemented without community DPCPs. At MTR, no DPCPs
were completed; yet the project reported that 422 sub-projects were identified, prioritized and
implemented. The DPCF manual was not prepared as the money was already allocated.

Component 3: Project Support and Policy Reforms (US$7.01)

Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

This component aimed to provide operational support and training resources to the FPCU in Addis
Ababa and implementation units in the four regions, and funding for the M&E system and studies,
and training on policy issues and institutional reform.

Seven key indicators were specified under this sub-component:
         (i) Frequency of reports.
         (ii) Accuracy of reports.
         (iii) Number of policies promulgated and effectively implemented.
         (iv) Effective advocacy for pastoralists at all levels of government.
         (v) Clear vision and strategy for pastoral area development.
         (vi) Adoption of transparent and inclusive planning and development activities in regions.
         (vii) At least 75 percent of results of participatory M&E meetings are used in decision-
         making for community investments, pastoral risk management plans, and other project
         activities, as measured by M&E reports.

The project achieved very limited results in terms of having an effective M&E system, but
provided analytical support for pastoral policies and strategy development.

The project met 4 out of the 7 indicators and partially met two others.
Indicator (i): The project prepared quarterly progress reports on the financial and technical
activities of the sub-projects.
Indicator (ii): The indicator was only partially met, as reliable quantitative information from
project woredas and regions was not readily available to analyze the outcome of project
interventions.
Indicator (iii): This indicator has been achieved by the GoE outside of project resources.
The Pastoral Policy Gap Analysis (2007) served as a basis for GoE to prepare and implement
pastoral policies.



                                                    34

Indicator (iv): The Ethiopian Pastoralist Development and Governance Network was established to
provide a forum for policy discussion on various issues of pastoral development. The network
includes government agencies, international development partners, civil society organizations,
think tanks, and researchers. The project contributed to the preparation of National Ethiopian
Pastoralist Day, which is a national high-level advocacy event for pastoralists.
Indicator (v): The project finalized several studies including a Pastoral Policy Gap Analysis, a
Participatory Research and Social Analysis with special emphasis to Gender, "Role of Micro
Finance for household food security in Dolo Woreda of Somali region", and a social analysis,
which served as a basis for the government to prepare its Pastoral Area Development Strategy.
However, as stated in the MoFA Project Performance M&E Report, April 2006, most of these
studies are more appropriate to the sedentary agriculturalists and all of them were researched and
studied in the last 30 years in most of the pastoral areas. The effectiveness of these studies to
influence positively the livelihoods of the majority of pastoralists is debatable.
Indicator (vi): This indicator was partly achieved. Coordination was acceptable, but there were
several issues with transparency of funds allocation (as discussed in the ICR text, Section 2.2).
Indicator (vii): This indicator was not achieved. A participatory M&E system was developed, but it
was not implemented. In addition, there was no uniform reporting format and some of the regions
did not report project performance as they were expected to. The MIS was not utilized.

     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

The PAD listed four KPIs for the achievement of the PDO. Although these KPIs were not clearly
linked to the PDO, achievements under each are described below.

(i)      At least 80 percent of funds allocated to the Community Investment Fund (CIF) were
         used for approved community micro-projects and inter-community sub-projects.

The IDA allocation under the CIF has been fully committed and disbursed to about 1,357
micro projects. Eighty percent of the completed sub-projects were reported as functional. In
several reports, including the MTR and a final report concerning IGA performance conducted in
May 2008, concerns were raised regarding the sustainability of groups formed and projects
selected: 50 percent of the groups were formed by the project and in substantial need of more
training in organizational and business/financial skills (68 percent were reported with no training
and many deprived of technical support); some groups did not know the amount of their grant as
MSTs were managing their investment, and criteria for selecting the project was reported as
unclear; many groups did not have management or business plans, with profitability reported as
questionable or low; M&E was absent in groups' activities. These assessments highlight that while
the "funds allocated" target was reached, the degree to which all the sub-projects were "approved"
by community participants is at best unclear. Thus, more work in the next phase is needed to ensure
long-term group viability, a more demand-driven project selection process and ownership, and
sustainability of investments.

(ii)     At least 80 percent of funds allocated to the Disaster Preparedness and Contingency
         Fund were used for approved sub-projects.

According to the final report of the "Review and Evaluation of CIF and DPCF Implementation of
the PCDP" and financial records of the Project, by the end of 2007 about 86 percent of DPCF
resources had been disbursed for approved sub-projects. This figure was reported to be 95 percent
at the end of September 2008. However, community engagement in the DPCF design has been
assessed as inadequate (as noted in the November 2007 Implementation Support Mission Aide
Memoire and MTR June 2006), reflecting top-down approaches in pursuit of accelerating
disbursement and meeting triggers. Most of the disbursements were made in response to
emergency needs and not based on DPCPs as agreed in the PAD and PIM. This lack of a DPCP
link compromises the envisaged objective of this sub-component that aims to strengthen
community capacity to reduce vulnerability to emergencies. The absence of DPCPs caused
confusion between the DPCF and CIF, partly resulting in the use of DPCF for CIF investments.
Component 2 was largely about building community capacity on disaster risk management and the
results suggest that from a community participation standpoint the process was not well done.

(iii)    At least 75 percent of community sub-projects requiring government support received it
         in a timely and adequate fashion, as measured by beneficiary assessments.

The Beneficiary Assessment report of May 2007 verified that 82 percent of surveyed beneficiary
communities targeted in the first phase have received capacity-building support and have formally
articulated their Community Development Plans using participatory approaches with facilitation of
PCDP. On the basis of these plans there was direct project support to increase community
management capacity and reduce community vulnerability to disasters (drought). In fact, the

Beneficiary Assessment report used a variety of methodologies to reach stakeholders and
triangulated results before concluding that over 90 percent of the communities and local
stakeholders were satisfied with the PCDP approach and felt that the support was beneficial. It was
clear from the project reports and field assessment that PCDP activities assisted/supported
vulnerable and more marginalized communities, notably women, youth, and the poorest. However,
it was noted in reports that follow-up and supervision could improve and that more sensitization
and clarification of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders was needed.

(iv)     At least 75 percent of results of participatory M&E meetings are used in decision-
         making for community investments, pastoral risk management plans, and other Project
         activities, as measured by M&E reports.

It was not found that results of participatory M&E meetings, as measured by M&E reports, were
used in a manner that meets this KPI. First, the project's M&E system was never effectively
established. Second, this was even less so at the community level. However, there were community
consultations that led to about 500 community development plans being prepared at the kebele
level. These led to over 1,350 micro projects being approved and executed. Further, in most
instances, after at least three years of the CDD approach being implemented in 23 project woredas
(72 percent), DPCPs were developed. Thus, while on a strict interpretation of the KPI it might not
have been met; there is evidence of community input influencing decision making for investments,
risk management plans and other activities. This is so despite the fact that it is known that the
DPCPs were completed with considerable assistance from individual consultants in a short period
of time.

Performance suggests that PCDP has partially met the KPIs and expected outputs. This is
importantly so given that the targeted areas were generally not being served by other development
institutions. However, it is recognized that the achievement of higher level objectives and
significant improvements in livelihood systems and human development are more likely during the
next phases of the Program. This is dependent on enhanced project focus on institutional and
organizational dimensions that are critical to economic viability and sustainability.

PCDP 1 identified seven performance triggers related to the satisfactory implementation of the
project's activities and the readiness of the project and national capacity to expand geographically.
As discussed in the Phase II PAD, all these triggers have been met (see Annex 2 Appendix 3).

                  ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION

1. The Project addresses improvements in rural livelihoods in the Ethiopian lowlands in a holistic
way through an integrated set of interventions with individual components and activities being
mutually reinforcing and producing a diverse range of benefits. Pastoral Risk Management (PRM)
measures, for example, increase the potential for profitable bio-off-take (i.e. meat, fiber, milk) and
mitigate the effects of animal losses on society and the economy (e.g. disruption of schooling and
other social services and reduced government exposure to post-disaster recovery costs). One also
needs to estimate the intervening factors which may impede or enhance the effects of the Project
components, such as external (climatic, epidemic or macro-economic) shocks, interventions from
other national projects and overall changes in the macro-environment.

2. Given the complementarities of components, a calculation of economic benefits by component
is of limited value as it does not illustrate the multiple anticipated spillover effects between the
Project's activities. The analysis, therefore, focuses on: (i) disaster early warning and response; (ii)
IGAs; and (iii) the introduction of a process ensuring sustainability and cost-effectiveness of all
project-supported investments. This annex presents steps that would need to be taken to ensure
adherence to these principles.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

A. Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement

    (i)      Community Investment Fund

3. The SLE component aims to improve access to and provision of basic public facilities and
social services by establishing effective, transparent and socially inclusive mechanisms that
facilitate pastoralists' participation in prioritization and selection of investments in PCDP II
woredas and kebeles. These investments in terms of sub-projects are characterized by: (i) their
relatively small size in monetary terms; (ii) the demand-driven nature with an open menu to choose
from; (iii) their multi-sectoral composition; and (iv) designs based on GoE standards. This makes
conventional economic evaluation techniques not fully relevant. Poor communities often value a
minimum level of social services and the associated building of human and social capital well
above their actual economic value. Furthermore, the synergy of the development of a range of
social services sub-projects across a woreda is difficult to capture. At the same time, the CIF's
objective also targets the institutionalization of mechanisms that facilitate citizens' participation in
the prioritization and selection of investments in local public facilities throughout lowland Ethiopia
and the establishment of systems of social accountability to ensure transparent use of resources.
The component is, therefore, seen as establishing the conditions and mechanisms for a delivery
system of public facilities and social services provided by local woreda governments throughout
lowland Ethiopia. The analysis of the CIF investments in Phase I revealed that most of the 1357
civil works implemented by community groups through sub-projects were cost-effective and timely
relative to the alternative of government contracting their construction to private contractors.

    (ii)     Income-Generating Activities

4. The most important IGAs implemented during PCDP I in the kebeles and woredas in all four
regions included: (i) grain milling; sheep and goat rearing, fattening and marketing; (ii) milk
processing and marketing; (iii) grain purchase and reselling; and (iv) petty trading. IGAs under

Phase I, however, were poorly managed and monitored by the project, with minimum attention to
counterpart contribution and little or no attempt to revolve funds. A PCDP I ­ financed study is
currently evaluating their financial impact. The examples cited below are representative of the
types of investment made by pastoral groups under Phase I.

5. Sheep were fattened by pastoral women in Afar Region for a period of up to four months for
sale to upland markets during festive periods (Christmas, Meskel, Ramadan etc). The concentrate
supplementation of grazing sheep by Group 2 resulted in higher daily growth rates than Group 1
and a 40% higher return on initial investment.

B. Pastoral Risk Management

6. In eastern Africa, disaster early warning and response interventions are very recent, and little
empirical data are available to quantify the linkage between ex ante adaptation and mitigation
measures. However, experience indicates that preventive measures are more effective than post-
disaster arrangements. In this analysis, livestock mortality is used as a measure of pastoral risk,
although the declines in health and productivity preceding livestock death (e.g. milk production,
weight, conception rate) are likely to be equally important sources of risk. Since livestock account
for most of the wealth of Ethiopian pastoralists, mortality provides a reasonable proxy for project-
related PRM benefits throughout the Ethiopian lowlands. The direct economic benefits of
managing pastoral risks consist of a reduction in livestock mortality and retention of livestock
productive value, while wider economic and social benefits include, for example, the cost of post-
disaster recovery including the social and financial cost of the urbanization of destitute pastoralists.
The direct economic benefits of the PRM component can therefore be estimated as a share of the
sum of the replacement value of adult livestock (including camels, cattle, sheep and goats) over
project years.

7. Livestock mortality in "normal years" is estimated at 2% of total livestock per annum across
livestock species. Livestock mortality during drought, which typically occurs one in five years,
frequently exceeds 30% of the total herd. Early response measures (vaccination, subsidized
transportation, water and fodder carting, early herd movement to unaffected areas) are estimated to
allow for the commercial off-take of up to 10% of the herd and a reduction in losses of the
remainder of 10­20%.

8. Assuming the incidence of drought every five years, a modest impact of 25% losses for 25% of
the total lowland herd, the average annual cost is estimated at US$70 million. Assuming that the
PRM is able to prevent just 15% of those deaths through drought-mitigation measures, the annual
cost of the PRM component would be economic. This estimate is conservative, given that the
analysis does not include the future productivity of breeding livestock or the impact of productivity
losses due to morbidity. The main assumptions for the economic analysis are that: (i) the livestock



                                                  43

  base stays constant over the life of the project, including relative distribution between animal
  species; and (ii) the average replacement value per adult animal (February 2007) is constant
  throughout the project at US$400 per camel, US$320 per cow, US$30 per sheep and US$20 per
  goat.

  C. Sustainability and Cost Effectiveness

  9. Sustainability and cost effectiveness are two key requirements for every investment funded by
  the Project. The sustainability requirement for IGAs also includes the demand that the investment
  should provide a decent long-term financial income for the owner whereas, for pure public goods,
  maintenance and management are more important aspects. The following definitions of
  sustainability and cost effectiveness will guide IGA and social investments under PCDP II.
  Sustainability would require that:

  (i)     The investment is profitable, namely that:
        operational profits be positive: i.e. sales revenues minus (input cost + maintenance charge);
        financial profits be positive: i.e. operational profits minus depreciation I savings charge;
        financial profits per day of family labor should be high enough to offset alternative labor
          opportunities;
        adequate savings are made to replace the investment good or an equivalent good at the end
          of the expected life-time of the investment good.

  (ii)    A maintenance plan for assets is established, including:
        a description of planned periodical maintenance; and estimated cost of spare parts and
          servicing needed.

  (iii)   A risk analysis and mitigation plan is established, including:
        a description of the three main risks to profitability; and
        a description of mitigation measures to avoid these risks.

  (iv)    An agreed management structure and plan is established, including:




                                                     44

     a simple worksheet addressing the requirements described above has been developed and
        will be included in the Project Implementation Plan, for use:
             a. during the CDD capacity-building efforts as part of the curriculum;
             b. during the PRA exercises to assess sustainability with the communities;
             c. as the baseline for PM&E; and
             d. during the Community Action Plan (CAP) decision meetings of the WDC.

10. The WDCs will approve funding for CAPs only when sustainability criteria are met. This
worksheet would be used only for "public" or "social safety net" activities of the CDD component.
Credit cooperatives, which will be the primary financiers of private IGAs, will use credit manuals
established under the IFAD-supported RUSACCOs movement.

11. Cost effectiveness would require that the least-costly assets be purchased that fulfill certain
requirements which, bearing in mind the isolation, climatic and physical conditions in the project
area, could be quite stringent and might exclude the cheapest available solutions (it is the cost-
effectiveness of the investment over the entire required lifespan that matters). Public buildings will
be built to government construction standards. The community procurement system that will be
employed under PCDP II will facilitate the cost effectiveness of the CDD projects. A provision in
the budget has been made to review and enhance the community procurement system and to
develop manuals for the MSTs and community partners. The MSTs and woreda procurement
assistants will receive training in the use of the community procurement system.

D. Fiscal Impact

12. In the short run, PCDP II's fiscal impact was expected to be relatively neutral, given that only
around 15% of the total project cost would be financed by the Government, primarily in the form
of deferred taxes. In the long run, it is expected that the fiscal impact of the proposed project would
be highly positive, owing to the increased tax base with the rise in economic activities and the
savings of public expenditure on climate-related relief efforts as a result of improved pastoral risk
management. The Project's recurrent cost implications would include the staffing and operation
and maintenance of public facilities such as schools and public health and veterinary clinics
together with the supporting equipment. These recurrent costs, which will be partially met through
service charges to users, are already factored into the Government's long-term budget plan, which
aims to provide universal education and health services to lowland communities.

                      ANNEX 5: BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

1. Beneficiaries' Assessment

The scope of the beneficiaries' assessment was limited to 93 kebeles randomly selected (i.e., 20%
of the total 465 PCDP intervention kebeles) and proportionally distributed among the four project
regions - Somali, Afar, Oromia and the SNNP Regional States. The kebele included includes:
     35 kebeles in four woredas of the Somali National Regional State,
     20 kebeles in five woredas of the Afar National Regional State,
     27 kebeles in four woredas of the Oromia National Regional State, and
     11 kebeles in two woredas of the SNNPR State

The selection of sample woredas within each region was been purpose oriented. Hence, a scheme
that ensured meaningful representation of the PCDP woredas both spatially and in terms of year of
entry, with relatively more emphasis on year one and year two entries (except for those in the
SNNPR, where access has been a limiting factor). Therefore, to be more practical, in SNNPR,
woredas that were anticipated to be difficult in terms of access (at the time of planning of the
study) were excluded from the sampling process. Besides, adjustments were made to ensure that
socio-cultural diversity was taken into consideration and also regions that had a minimum number
of PCDP woredas were reasonably represented in the study. On the bases of this scheme, the
following woredas were considered for the study in each region:
     Jijiga, Ayisha, Shinile, and Qebrebeyah Woredas of the Somali National Regional State;
     Gulina, Afambo, Dubti and Gewane Woredas, and Argoba special Woreda of the Afar
     National Regional State;
     Fentale, Sawena, Arero and Dirre Woredas of the Oromia National Regional State; and
     Hamer and Benatsemay Woredas of the SNNPR State.

For each selected sample woreda, the list of all PCDP intervention kebeles/ communities were
prepared in consultation with concerned woreda officers from the pastoral development office
(PDO), in such a way to allow grouping of kebeles by pastoral/ agro-pastoral and then by type of
intervention, micro project and sub-project. The required sample kebeles/ communities were then
selected from this sample frame, using the linear systematic sampling procedure while also
considering accessibility issues. Within each selected kebele/ community, the ultimate units of
observation, i.e., both key informants and Focal Discussion Groups (FGDs) participants were
sourced with similar procedure as those followed in the selection of sample kebeles/ communities.

The methodologies followed in the study included a desk review, consultation with stakeholders,
in-depth interviews of key informants/ resource persons, focus group discussions and general
observation.

General observations were made with the view to assessing the PCDP supported project
interventions on the ground vis-a-vis beneficiaries' opinion while visiting kebeles/ communities
selected within the study woredas.

In-depth interviews were carried out with 17 regional level and 64 woreda level key-informants/
resource persons. The main resource persons included project coordination officers and mobile
support team (MST) members of the respective regions. At woreda level, the main key-informants
included members of the woreda development committee (WDC) and mobile outreach teams
(MOT) members, and officers from relevant sector offices and NGOs/ CBOs. Key informants also
included resource persons such as CDC members, elders/ community leaders and women



                                                  48

beneficiaries, and officers from sectoral offices (such as the DAs and representatives of schools,
health posts, veterinary posts, water) and CBOs. 191 key informants from members of the
beneficiary communities (including CDC members), and 53 kebele/ community level stakeholders
were selected for the in-depth interviews based on a pre-designed questionnaire.

The community/ kebele level FGDs formed one of the principal data/information collection
methods. The purpose of the FGDs was to generate data/ information through a participatory
technique to complement secondary and primary data collected in the survey. Based on a pre-
prepared questionnaire, a total of 214 FGDs were conducted for the whole study in the four project
regions:
     31 focus groups from CDCs;
     71 focus groups from Women; and
     112 focus groups from Men and Youth.

Each focus group involved 5 to 7 discussants. This was formed, as stated above, separately from
CDCs including members of the different sub-committees, i.e., community project management,
procurement and control sub-committees; as well as other segments of the community, i.e. women,
Men and youth and the disadvantaged beneficiaries represented in the respective FGDs.

Conclusions

Progress made by PCDP towards achieving its development objectives has been encouraging. The
CDD approaches used in relation to investment of micro-projects/ sub-projects identification and
implementation has improved access to services and reduced vulnerability. Project implementation
has contributed to community empowerment and effective decentralization of development project
preparation and decision-makings. The CDD approach related to empowerment of women and the
disadvantaged in decision-making and development project preparation has increased. The
approach has made them the direct implementers and owners of their projects. The CDD approach
has contributed to community empowerment in project planning and implementation, asset
increase, self-confidence and decision-making abilities. In this regard, the resource persons/ key
informants and FGDs believe that the beneficiary communities and local stakeholders are satisfied
and wish to continue with the CDD approach.

The capacity building, participatory method used has empowered the beneficiary communities
including women. Local Authorities, woreda and kebele level institutions and the beneficiaries
themselves selected all development projects, and implemented, and managed them. The
participation of women in project selection and in development-oriented meetings has increased.
Women's participation in project identification, prioritization and implementation has been
increased from time to time. Women were working as members of CDCs procurement workers,
cashiers and others.

The PCDP projects were the first community developed projects, implemented and managed and
used according to community needs. The beneficiaries have developed confidence in project
preparation, implementation and management after the CDD approach.

The key informants' interviews and FGDs participants, all confirmed that communities were able to
prepare their development projects, and implement and manage them. In the case of the project
identification and implementation/construction of physical assets/ the project went as intended.
But, furnishing with equipment and furniture, and assigning trained workers in the areas of human
and animal health are needed for the completed projects to become operational.



                                                  49

There was no problem with the CDD approach. If any, there were project implementation problems,
like ignoring beneficiaries' long-years of experience, for example in water pond development areas,
bypassing their advice, and delaying completion of projects.

These problems were a reflection of frequent personality changes at woreda levels. The WDC
members change, and woreda technical expert turnover was reported to be high. This condition has
resulted in the conducting of training and orientations for the new comers on the CDD approach,
project objectives and implementation methods. This took time and resources, and created delays in
the project implementation and service delivery. Besides, the prolonged delay in commencing the
intended services of some projects, following the formal transfer to the concerned sector offices, is
also attributed to the delays in recruitment of the necessary staff and or lack of financial capacity
on the part of the sector offices, which are the recipient institutions.

Generally, the number and quality of projects proposed by the community have improved over the
years. Approval of projects and their execution improved as experience was gained through time.
The beneficiary communities have increased their capacity in project development and
implementation. But they need the constructed projects to start providing services as intended. As
stated above, because of limited capacity, mainly in terms of finance, stakeholders could not
furnish and equip some of the projects completed to start service delivery.

Community members particularly in the project management sub-communities were reasonably
well informed about the project objectives and implementation arrangements. The orientation and
or introductory meetings and PLA training facilitated by the MSTs and MOTs have rendered many
community members the ability to analyze their most immediate development needs and prioritize
and develop related development projects.

Recommendations

Beneficiaries are satisfied with the CDD approach and also the capacity building and
empowerment that enabled them to identify, select and implement projects according to their
priorities and to manage their own development. However, there are cases in which sub-projects
failed because they were selected and implemented without the consent of beneficiaries. Apart
from the need to create adequate awareness in all beneficiaries in order to develop a clear
understanding of the role, proper attention should be given to the training and capacity building of
the CDC members. As a result, beneficiaries will be more empowered to resist any intervention
against their interest during the selection and implementation of sub-projects and also to avoid the
misuse and/or mismanagement of project funds by local authorities.

Women and marginalized groups have had a relatively passive role in the decision making of
pastoral community activities. Therefore, these groups have to be given the chance to voice and
select projects without being dictated by other members. Despite the orientation and awareness
creation provided by the PCDP staff, the priorities of these groups have been overlooked during the
identification and selection of PCDP financed sub-projects. For example, it was noted from the key
informants and FGD that men often dictated discussion and prioritization of sub-projects. As the
priorities of men and women could differ, the selection/financing of sub-projects should take into
account the extent to which priorities of the poor and women have been targeted, and they are able
to select projects of their own choices.

In some of the sub-project implementation arrangements (bid processing, procurement and
supervision, and construction contract negotiation and inspection), the role of beneficiaries and also
the CDC members was passive. These weaknesses were partly due to the vested interest of local


                                                   50

authorities to engage in corrupt practices, and partly due to the apparent limitation of skill/capacity
of the CDC members. Therefore, proper attention should be given to the training of the CDCs to
enable them to undertake the job and also to strengthen beneficiary communities' capacity building
and empowerment so that they would have more awareness and a clear understanding about their
decision making role.

As noted from key informants and also the participants in the FGD, the duration of the capacity
building training was too short to grasp the messages of the trainings. This was particularly a
problem for the illiterates who were unable to write/record and read what they learned during the
training. Therefore, while training programs should be given adequate duration including the
provision of refreshment courses, the inclusion of literate individuals in the selection of training
participants will be useful since they can take notes/record the subjects during the training, and
help illiterate participants to grasp the subject in joint discussion sessions.

Apart from the orientation and training, the extent of community capacity built and the
empowerment achieved would depend on the technical support of the MSTs and MOTs, which in
turn depends on the timing and frequency of visits to sub-projects. Thus, the proper timing and
increased frequency of their visits would be crucial in order to supplement the training skill and
further strengthen community capacity through the PLA during the sub-project implementation.

Provision of training/ orientation once or twice should not be taken as a sufficient condition for
capacity building & empowerment to enable pastoral communities to implement CDD approach.
Institutionalizing the CDD approach would require continuous training for capacity building that
suits the categories of stakeholders (ordinary beneficiaries, the CDC members that undertake
management, procurement, control sub-committees, and women IGA group leaders), WDC
members, MOTs, development agents, teachers/school directors and health extension workers.
Along with this, adult literacy training should be focused to enable the pastoral communities to
read and write, which would increase the impact of PCDP implementation.

Due to the fact that PCDP interventions are demand-driven, the number of sub-projects that
beneficiaries identified, selected and proposed for funding far exceeded the available project
resources. In some cases, beneficiaries pressurized WDCs to make credit arrangement with
contractors for project constructions. As a result of too many projects that were implemented
simultaneously, follow up and supervision of sub-projects by MSTs/MOTs was unthinkable, and
hence implementation often deviated from the planned course of action. Therefore, PCDP coverage
and project financing should be planned taking into account the available project resources (finance,
manpower capacity, time, etc.) required to implement sub-projects efficiently and effectively.

Micro-projects initiated, identified and prioritized and approved for implementation should take
into consideration the availability of budget in advance, otherwise delays in implementation of
micro-projects due to the shortage of cash flow may dissatisfy beneficiary communities and lead to
a loss of hope in PCDP. In this regard, project construction and training of workers to be assigned,
equipment provision, and furnishing of completed projects should be accomplished side by side to
enable them to commence operation without delays.

Coordinated and integrated efforts have to be made at local government level to fulfill/assign
qualified staff for community and inter-community micro-projects, which are completed but are not
yet providing services. Prior to construction of facilities (such as human health post, animal health
post, school) which require staff assignments, they should be equipped and furnished, and sector
offices should be consulted so that they be able to plan in advance to incorporate the sub-project
operation in their programs.


                                                    51

Awareness and skill upgrading of communities should be given adequate attention to enable them
to operate, manage, use and take care of and maintain micro-projects like water points, schools,
health posts, feeder roads, rangelands etc., to ensure their sustainable functioning as a result of the
ownership feeling and confidence of the micro-projects that develop within the community.

WDCs chaired by Chief Woreda Administrators have long lists of duties and responsibilities in the
process of PCDP implementation as identified in the Project Implementation Manual. Such duties
and responsibilities would not be accomplished without adequate time, commitment and dedication.
WDC members and particularly the Chief Administrators are occupied with other administrative
and political issues, and the time they have allocated to PCDP implementation has not been
adequate. PCDP implementation processes also require a responsible person for the project, and it
would be advisable to appoint a person as a Deputy Administrator to a PCDP intervention woredas
and to chair the WDC with the full responsibility for PCDP.

Income generation schemes were major interventions to diversify pastoral livelihoods and improve
income and employment. These schemes must be built on the basis of viability and profitability,
with better capacity building and training of members, consistent with best working modalities and
strategies that can boost employment and income of the poor pastoral and agro pastoral
communities. Local market demand and resources availability should be appraised before
implementing the projects.

PCDP is not represented in woreda project implementation, and the structure ends at the regional
level. The woredas experts, including woreda council members were looking at PCDP activities as
their second duty. The MOTs were assigned from other departments and have other assignments
from their parent organization. They may be sent to other areas for some type of work, including
out of the region, for long periods of time. Most MOTs left or changed their working place and
were replaced by new ones, who also needed training. These issues need close attention; otherwise
the project would not be implemented as intended.

In some areas, the woredas facilitators of the CDD approach tend to implement procurement and
financial management for the communities. There is a tendency for woreda level facilitators to
procure contractors on behalf of the communities. This takes away from community capacity to
manage their finances and procurements. Also, the procurement guidelines to be used by
communities are beyond community capacity, and do not consider the remoteness of the
communities, and the availability of contractors in the areas. Hence, the procurement procedures
need to be revisited.

In almost all of the study regions, the woredas have a great interest to include more kebeles more
quickly in the PCDP. T he case of Argoba special Woreda is a typical one and appears over
ambitious. In order to include more kebeles to benefit from the project, enough MSTs, MOTs and
other technical staff such as construction supervisors capable of following the progress of the
approach should be in place beforehand. The PCDP has been designed to strengthen development
planning and implementation at both the community/kebele and woreda Level. However, means of
transportation and per diem to field works including WDC members and MOTs should have been
known and set aside for this purpose and used. Otherwise this will contribute to delays in project
implementation. The experts employed and assigned to woredas by PCDP were not
working/obeying and or gave little attention to woredas. Most of them were not on their duties and
not going to the office. Their offices were closed most of the time. The woreda
council/administrators had no means of keeping them in the office. The coordination between the
woreda-assigned PCDP staff and woredas staff needs to be revisited.


                                                  52

PCDP sub-projects have neither an independent primary owner nor are they integrated into the
regular local government/sectoral offices' activities upon completion, and yet formal transfer of the
projects has been made to the concerned sectoral offices. As a result, there is a loss of momentum
over time, thereby challenging the original hopes, expectations, and motivations of the beneficiary
communities. Moreover, hidden motives of competition over resources were observed among the
various government sectoral offices that constituted the WDC, mainly due to unequal access to
actual decision-making on project resources. Thus, this may need to be improved through the
implementation of PCDP activities, and should be led by an independent institution for which the
project is a primary and priority responsibility.

Monopoly of decision-making over project resources by the PDO has adversely disabled other
equally important sectoral offices from active involvement and participation in the project's
implementation and management. The PCDP may, therefore, consider financial disbursement to
line offices that are most relevant for each project component (for instance, money for health post
construction through the health offices).

In line with the findings and recommendations of the mid-term review mission, a zone level task
force is being established in some of the zones, especially in Oromia. The task force is expected to
provide supervisory and technical backstopping support to woredas. In two zones (Bale and
Borana), the project has already provided financial and equipment support to the respective
Agriculture and Rural Development Departments to coordinate the process. The plan was that each
zone would begin formal participation as of the third quarter of 2007. There is a need to speed up
the process for establishment of the task force in all zones of Oromia and other regions where the
zonal structure is still operational.

Other recommendations include:
 the need for a clearly defined organizational structure and a study-based benefit package for
    PCDP staff;
 The CDD approach needs some adjustments in project approval and funding, and the budget
    ceiling for sub-projects;
 PCDP should be strengthened with capable and dedicated staff who receive motivating
    remunerations;
 The powers of the CDCs should not be allowed to be taken over by government administrative
    bodies. CDCs should only be responsible to the electorate;
 Some arrangements need to be made to have projects implemented in the form of "a minimum
    package", so to say. In other words, when one thinks of a school, for example, one should also
    think about the availability of water in the vicinity or whether there is a need to propose a water
    supply project as well. The same needs to be done about the availability of acceptable
    accommodation for the school staff and health workers as these will invariably have to come
    from outside;
 Women, men, and youth have been requesting to be organized in income generating activities.
    They should be assisted to organize themselves and given the necessary training; and
 To gain further benefits from the training for beneficiary communities, CDC members or a few
    selected community members need to be trained as Trainers to ensure that training is done on a
    continuous basis and that beneficiaries assume greater responsibility in this regard.

INTRODUCTION

The Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) is an integrated and comprehensive
development project signed between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
to improve the livelihoods and reduce their vulnerability to both manmade and natural disasters of
the pastoral and agro pastoral communities inhabited in the arid and semi arid lowlands of Ethiopia.
The project was the first phase of the first fifteen year program that has been implemented from
2003 up to 2008. The project has been declared effective since 30th September 2003 commencing
with ten woredas and gradually expanded to 3021 woredas.

The project is financed by a grant and credit obtained from IDA and IFAD respectively, and the
contributions of the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and the beneficiary communities. The total
project cost was 60 million USD, of which 50 per cent was from IDA, 34 per cent from IFAD and
the remaining 16 per cent from GoE sources

The first phase of the project was completed in 2008 and thus an attempt has been made to develop
this implementation completion report. Accordingly, project achievements, implementation
problems encountered at the time of project implementation, lessons learned that will be used as an
input for future interventions and other pertinent issues are presented below in greater details.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

As clearly stipulated in the PAD and the PIM, project interventions are designed to empower
communities, woredas and Regional governments to better manage local development in pastoral
areas, with the aim of increasing, stabilizing and diversifying incomes, improving infrastructure
and increasing access to public services. This was envisaged to be achieved through a community-
based development planning process linked to a community investment fund, which flows through
local government. The Project also aimed at supporting a participatory disaster management
program to reduce the risk of pastoral communities to drought and other natural threats to
livelihoods. These efforts were also planned to be supported through policy reform, investment in
health, education and veterinary services, and applied research into dry land agriculture and natural
resource management. While recognizing the central role that animal production plays and will
continue to play in pastoral life, the PCDP had no plan to place exclusive emphasis on increasing
incomes and productivity from livestock. The Project also planned to identify and develop
alternative sources of income, including sedentary agriculture and non-agricultural activities by
both men and women in pastoral communities, with a view to more sustainable use of resources
and improved livelihoods in the lowlands of Ethiopia.

PROJECT WOREDAS

All project woredas were covered within three years in a phasing manner, whereby in year one,
year two, and year three the project was operational in 10, 22 and 32 woredas, respectively. Out of
these 32 woredas, Somali, Afar, Oromiya and SNNPR had a share of 14, 9, 7 and 2 woredas,
respectively. In the selected 32 woredas, the project was operational in 516 Kebeles.



21Due to the split of project woredas the total number of woredas increased to 32.

 PROJECT PERFORMANCE BY COMPONENT

 Sustainable Livelihood Enhancement
 Activities under this component include but not limited to water development; construction and
 rehabilitation of schools, animal & human health institutions; supporting of income generating
 schemes; development of local support services; road construction; and small scale irrigation
 construction and rehabilitation works. Accordingly, in the reporting period, 1,357 different sub-
 projects have been executed by the respective project woredas. Of the total executed 1,357 sub-
 projects; 1,025 (76%) sub-projects are completed, out of which 80% (823) are operational.

 Pastoral Risk Management
 The Pastoral Risk Management component comprises three inter-linked sub-components namely,
 the Community Based Pastoral Early Warning System (PEWS), Disaster Preparedness and
 Contingency Planning (DPCP) and Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Fund (DPCF).
 While the community based PEWS is very helpful to monitor the vulnerability of pastoral
 population to different disasters so as to give early warning about the impeding threats and trigger
 appropriate actions, DPCP and DPCF are meant for preparation and financing of risk management
 related activities to reduce the vulnerability of pastoral population in the project areas.

 Pastoral Early Warning System (PEWS)
 The objective of Pastoral Early Warning System is to monitor the vulnerability of pastoral
 population so as to give early warning about the impeding threats and trigger action to reduce and
 manage those threats. PCDP has planned to extend the scope of PEWS model developed in Somali
 region by Save the Children UK to include early and rapid woreda level reactions to developing
 crises, especially non-food responses, in order to build a comprehensive disaster management
 system initially in the PCDP Woredas in four Regions that will then be extended to all Woredas in
 the lowland areas of the country.

 Accordingly, the following major activities were performed:
 Preparation of PEWS implementation manual
 Recruitment of woreda early warning and training officers to support the Woreda EW activities
 Expansion of the experience of PEWS of the Somali Region to project Woredas in Oromia, Afar
 and SNNP regions
 Participation in PEWS establishment in Afar region
 Participation in baseline data updating in Somali region

 Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Plan (DPCP)
 In order to reduce the vulnerability of rural population in the pastoral areas to droughts and other
 disasters and to prepare, in advance of crisis for rapid reactions and reduce its impact, disaster
 preparedness and contingency planning has been taken as an important element in the risk
 management component of PCDP. The mechanism by which this can be achieved is by preparing
 local disaster preparedness and contingency plans designed through participatory planning at
 woreda level with the capacity building and technical support from PCDP.
 Under this sub-component the major activities performed are:
 Preparation of disaster preparedness and contingency planning manual
 Preparation of woreda level DPCPs for 23 out of the 32 project Woredas
 As this sub-component highly depends on the establishment of the pastoral early warning system
 for getting information on the food security situation of the area, it has not been implemented as
 per its intended plan. But currently 23 Woredas' DPCP are prepared and distributed to relevant
 stakeholders at least to serve as a good starting point and learning area.



                                                    56

Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Fund (DPCF)
With the objective of financing mechanism to enable projects in the woreda disaster preparedness
and contingency plan (both long term and rapid reaction shelf projects) to be under taken in a
timely manner, Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Fund is one of the sub component in the
risk management component of PCDP. In the reporting period, 447 DPCF projects executed, 387
(87%) completed and 363 (94%) projects became operational. Activities supported under this fund
include water development, rangeland management, community road construction, animal
restocking and natural resource development.

Project Support and Policy Reform
This component had three linked subcomponents, Project Management and coordination;
Participatory Monitoring and evaluation; and Policy analysis and reform.

Project support and coordination
PCDP I have been coordinated and catalyzed by a semi-autonomous coordination unit (PCU)
based in and managed by the Ministry of Federal Affairs (MoFA) at federal level and Pastoral
areas Development Coordination Bureaus/Commission at regional level. The Federal Inter-
Ministerial Board (IMFB) was expected, amongst its other duties, to act as the Steering Committee
to the PCDP. Despite this, the Steering Committee, have been met at least biannually and was
responsible for Project policy and strategy formulation, inter-ministerial and interregional
coordination of Borrower's governmental actions, and the oversight of implementation activities
under the Project. All PCDP I regions were also expected to oversee the project implementation in
their respective region through formally established steering committees under the pastoral areas
development bureaus/commissions. Though, not as expected, efforts were made in the first phase
to undertake various coordination activities at various levels in supporting project activities.

The project had effective management and administrative structure at the federal and regional level
who were seeing the routine day to day project activities and management that has been undertaken
at woreda and community levels .At all levels the project staffed with skilled professionals and
other supporting staff equipped with the necessary office materials and equipments, transport and
communication facilities. At woreda level, the project employed assistant procurement officers,
assistant finance officers and early warning officers, who were responsible for the routine
management of procurements and financial transactions at woreda and community level. In
addition to this, regions had Mobile Support Teams (MST) that served the woredas and
communities, though their number was not in accordance with the number of woredas they were
expected to facilitate. Otherwise, the project implementation was directly embedded into woredas
local government structure through the Woreda Development Committee (WDC) for community



                                                   57

 sub-projects approval and technical support from the Mobile Outreach Team (MOT) composed of
 experts from each sectoral desk. At community level, project management committees were
 organized to plan, manage and implement community sub projects. The project management
 committee and procurement committees have got the required training before they start their duties.

 Policy Reform and knowledge building on pastoral development
 Policy reform and analysis subcomponent acknowledged the existence of knowledge gap amongst
 national policy planners concerning the dynamics of pastoralism, regularly leading to poor policy
 choices and envisaged to address current policy constraints by:

 Empowering pastoralist leaders to understand the dynamics of their livelihood strategies in relation
 to the broader policy environment and to articulate this at grassroots and national political levels;
 Funding a series of policy studies that accurately inform policy decision making of the dynamics
 and diversity of Ethiopian pastoral systems; and
 Investment in the knowledge system that will ensure that lessons learned in pastoralist development,
 past and present, would be retained, internalized and reflected in policy reform.

Accordingly, FPCU commissioned various policy studies for different consultants. This includes
Participatory Research and Social Analysis with special reference to gender issues, Participatory
Monitoring & Evaluation Manual, Pastoral Early Warning System, Disaster Preparedness and
Contingency Plan Preparation Manuals, and Community Procurement Manuals. The documents
produced by these consultants have great contribution in bridging the existing knowledge gaps
 concerning pastoralist and their development issues.

 OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT

 Adequate and reliable quantitative information from project woredas and regions was not available
 to analyze the outcomes of project interventions. Discussion on this section will, therefore, be by
 and large based on qualitative indicators. The analysis is made based on the major sub components
 which are believed to have significant and immediate outcome.

 Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement (SLE)
 Projects executed under this sub component obviously built and strengthened the livelihoods of the
 intended beneficiaries directly or indirectly. Outcomes in terms of enrolment, reduction in drop out,
 changes in patterns of diseases, reduced workloads, and improved income & employment are direct
 indicators of changing livelihoods of target beneficiaries from worse to better.

 The schools so far constructed and completed in the last five years are now functioning and
 contributing to the increased enrolment of children and access to education in those pastoral areas.
 In total, about 20,000 school aged children of both girls and boys have got access of education in
 their vicinity in the four project regions of Somali, Afar, Oromiya and SNNPR. Similarly, with
 increasing number of schools in the project areas, the distance to schools reduced particularly for
 girls. There is now at least one primary school per project kebele as a result of PCDP intervention.
 The integration of schools with other basic infrastructure sub projects such as potable water supply,
 human and animal health facilities further strengthened access to education which resulted in
 gradual growth in enrolments, and strengthen permanent settlement. Such package infrastructure
 has contribution to permanent settlement of the pastoral families particularly children and women
 as water and health services are now available around temporary settlement areas. Mobility of
 children will reduce and this have already proved to improve enrolments. Women also start to
 engage in non-farm activities like grinding mill, milk collection & marketing, vegetable production,
 animal production and marketing (mainly cattle fattening), petty trading and hand crafts, which add


                                                   58

assets and income to the household economy. In some areas the location of the basic services
particularly schools encouraged most of the households to send their children to schools. The
infrastructures implemented with the support of PCDP were located around and within the
settlement areas of most of the pastoral households settled temporarily or permanently.

The water supply points developed so far undoubtedly contributed for the reduction of workload of
women and frequent mobility and waterborne diseases. So far about 200,000 people have been
benefited from the constructed water supply schemes. In some cases reduction in morbidity rates
could be the outcome in most of the areas. Integration of potable water supply with construction of
human health posts and schools further improves livelihoods, health, income and employment of
the beneficiaries. Besides, in most of the project areas, mobility period is now reduced to
significant level due to availability of water. For example, in some areas of the Somali region, most
of the households used to move every three months in search of water points, which means four
times a year. However, due to improved availability of water points since 2005, the frequency of
mobility was now reduced to thrice a year. Besides, the number of family members moving with
their livestock also reduced to a certain extent. In most cases those able bodied especially adult
male are moving with their livestock as compared to the pre-project period. As a result, children
and women who remain behind in their settlement areas are now able to attend schools and engage
in non-farm activities, respectively.

Poor households in the pastoral areas suffer from lack of diversification of income, employment
and food insecurity. Consequently, over 90% of the households depend mainly on livestock
production and related activities with no other alternative income and livelihood sources. Income
generating schemes, therefore, are best alternative strategies to improve income, employment and
food security status of the community. Besides, the contribution of income generating schemes in
building resilient pastoral economy, proved to reduce women dependency on their husbands and
food insecurity. The number of IG activities financed by PCDP is now increasing over wide areas
of the project areas. Current ongoing and completed projects will contribute to improved income
and employment for more than 5,000 households (more than 25,000 people). On the other hand, the
installation and expansion of grinding mills, petty trading and handicrafts, vegetable production,
milk collection and product marketing IGS purely serve the destitute and poor pastoral women not
only to improve their access to alternative income and employment but also to improved health,
food and nutrition status of the beneficiaries.

Access road construction and rehabilitation is another aspect of the livelihood improvement with
considerable impact on transaction of goods and services, stabilizing markets, opening access of
the community to basic services, disaster mitigation and emergency humanitarian supports. The
construction and expansion of road networks has a multipurpose advantage in these areas and its
benefit covers the whole population and even the adjacent and neighboring communities and
woredas. The completion of the currently executed sub-projects believed to benefit over 100,000
populations. Beyond the project kebeles, a number of communities could also benefit from the
multiplier effect of road network and access. Improved road networks also have a positive impact
for improved health and adoption of livelihood transforming technologies, linkages with the
highlands that might approve the marketability of produces of pastoralists. Disaster is almost part
of the livelihood of pastoral communities, not only due to vulnerability of pastoral livelihood and
fragile ecology but also as a result of lack of access of most of the pastoral areas. These areas suffer
from the grave consequences of recurrent drought and famine due to delayed humanitarian support
attributed to lack of access roads to the pastoral areas.




                                                   59

Pastoral Risk Management
 Like the SLE component, sub-projects implemented under the pastoral risk management
 component have also positive potential impact on the livelihoods of the pastoralists. Pastoral risk
 management sub-projects are drought proofing sustainable and durable socio-economic
 infrastructure with the objective of sustainable prevention of severe negative consequences of
 natural risks and disasters.

 Water resources development in these areas were meant to reduce human and animal sufferings,
 frequent mobility and distress as well as forced migrations, food insecurity and malnutrition as well
 as epidemics and diseases occurring due to lack of access to water and food during drought periods.
 Water points constructed under this component improved the availability and adequacy of water in
 critical drought periods. The indirect impacts and outcomes of this intervention definitely reduced
 the rates of human and animal morbidity and mortality, reduced the workload of pastoral women,
 improved access to other alternative income and employment opportunities.

 Small scale irrigation development and expansion is another community sub project with long term
 impact on coping up risks and livelihood stresses. These sub projects are planned and implemented
 with active and direct participation of communities who already started permanent settlement and
 crop farming system in the lowland areas. Apparently, they contributed for improved food security,
 nutrition, employment and income.

 The small scale irrigation development, expansion of access roads and other drought proofing
 infrastructures have significant impact both to mitigate and control drought risk effects and
 improve livelihoods.

 In general, the impact and possible outcomes of PCDP supported projects could be rated as very
 encouraging. It is believed that of the total 1,182 community and inter-community operational
 projects a total of over one million people in the target areas benefited directly or indirectly from
 the multi dimensional and integrated projects supported by PCDP since 2003.

 CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES

 A CDD approach has been applied to empower communities to articulate local priorities and to
 manage development resources. Empowerment is the expansion of assets and capabilities of poor
 people to participate, negotiate, influence, control and hold accountable institutions that affect their
 lives as CDD will help ensure local ownership and sustainability of project interventions. The
 CDD approach entails genuine participation and empowerment of the communities and grass root
 institutions including government, NGOs, community based organizations and individuals.

 The pastoral areas, on the other hand, are characterized by lack of efficient institutions, and most of
 them are with weak implementation capacities. Most of these areas have no adequacies even to
 rudimentary development initiatives and marginal to participation, decision making and
 management of their development priorities. Such critical gaps are one of the reasons for PCDP to
 focus on capacity building activities. For the last five years, the project has provided intensive
 technical capacity building trainings for the local level government agencies and community
 management committees and other traditional institutions, in building their social capital.

 A number of community members and leaders were trained in various disciplines including need
 assessment, project identification, proposal preparation, project implementation & management,
 finance, and community procurement procedures. Awareness creation through such trainings,
 successive workshops, frequent support visits, and onsite supervision greatly improved capacities


                                                   60

        of community in sustainable management of community based projects. Local governments now
        have better capacity to plan and manage development activities than the pre-project period.
     PCDP also focuses on training and capacity building activities for institutions at the grassroots to
        ensure efficient service delivery. Training of teachers, animal & human health workers, and
        traditional birth attendants proved effective means in improving the existing poor service delivery
        consistent with the circumstances of the pastoral areas (see the details in Annex IX-X)
     Government institutions are better equipped with communication and transportation facilities, and
        other essentials, to better manage their development activities and to provide necessary services to
        the public. Most of the institutions are able to reach remote communities and areas, which were
        once inaccessible and unreachable.
     To sum up, the impact of capacity building activities is significant and fundamental to
        sustainability and enhanced development in the lowland areas.

        FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE

        Financial Management. The project has developed a financial management manual, which was
        accepted and approved by the World Bank. Disbursement is made in accordance with the
        procedures and policies set out in the World Bank's disbursement hand book. So far, the project
        follows transaction-based disbursement (SOEs) method, instead of report based disbursement
        method. Eligible project disbursement has been made in accordance with the six categories of
        goods, consultancy/audit, training, community grant, risk management and operating costs.

        Fund Utilization. For the last five years, a total of USD 53,331,933.68 has been utilized (99 % of
        the total project fund). Of this, the shares of Somali, Afar, Oromiya and Southern region is 39%,
        29%, 22% and 10%, respectively..

MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT PERFORMANCE

Despite the successes and remarkable achievements, the project faces a range of serious constraints
and challenges in the process of implementation for the last five project years. The challenges and
constraints faced the project are summarized and presented below.

Sustainable livelihoods Enhancement (SLE)
The core principles of Sustainable Livelihood Enhancement Approach are it is (1) people centered;
(2) multi-sectoral; (3) conducted in partnership ;(4) responsive and participatory; (5) flexible and
recognizing dynamic nature of livelihoods; (6) sustainable and ensures community ownership.
Successful introduction of CDD principles require a substantive change in attitude and way of
operating within government services. This means there is a need for greater vertical integration of
information flow and decision-making within government agencies.

In terms of addressing the above principles, interventions were undertaken in a smooth way in the
first year 10 woredas, the MST operations were more facilitating and backed-up with intensive
field visits to target beneficiaries. Later on, in the second year and more in the third years of the
project, competition for resources intensified among the existing and newly selected woredas,
which was the result of misunderstanding of CDD approach which ultimately led to a certain extent
to violation of the principles and shortfall of project fund.

In fact, the fund transfer and utilization rates were proving that the project's approach and
principles were getting acceptance. Despite this, the absence of physical and financial planning of
PCDP resources in the local government plans by aggregating the CAPs and violation of the CDD
procedures, elite capturing, dictatorial decision making, creation of turnkey projects in conjunction
with lack of capacity on PM&E and poor M&E of the project, resulted in many of the community
sub-projects to remain uncompleted and PCDP to be subjected to shortage of fund.

The Community Investment Fund (CIF) has been channeled through the woreda to the kebeles
and is intended to fund sub-projects generated by teams within the community, together with risk
mitigation strategies, agreed through wide community consultation. This being the case, there are
some community sub-projects designed, without the wide facilitations and consultations of the
targeted communities and proposals were started to be generated by the woreda administrators and
above all the designs and implementations were concentrated on construction of basic social
infrastructures with jeopardized and limited interventions on Income Generation Schemes (IGS)
with almost insignificant efforts of facilitating communities to create demands on livestock
production, marketing and conservation of natural resources and rangeland development.




                                                     62

Moreover, the little efforts exhibited to initiate IG schemes were not based on concrete application
procedures and most of the IG groups lack appropriate individual saving & credit mechanisms
among the beneficiary members and there was no clear mechanism for sharing dividends. In
addition to this, most of the grants allocated to communities are not supported by mandated sectors
at all levels and never been communicated with respective regional Micro Finance Institutions,
Cooperative Promotion Agencies at different levels as well as Small and Micro Enterprise
Development Enterprises, which make their sustainability in question.

The capacity building trainings for both woreda staff and community in some regions were not
need based especially in terms of training Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA), Community Animal
Health Workers (CAHW), Pastoral Community teachers (PCT), Artisans, range technicians, grain
mill operators, repair and maintenance of pumps, carpentry, masonry, with support from the project
for rendering the services, etc at Kebeles Development Center (KDC). In fact, the prerequisite of
establishing KDCs for housing Community Workers was overlooked and most efforts were not
systematic based on the PIM but it can be safely said that it was almost spontaneous.

And hence, the creation of skilled manpower for operationalizing the infrastructures was very
minimal. The involvement of regional sector bureaus in applying their mandates for the
functionality of completed basic social structures was negligible. Consequently, out of the
completed some of them are not functional. Moreover, there was a big misunderstandings among
the project staff ranging from federal down to woreda level that, the implementation of SLH
component was almost dominated by CIF without due consideration of the other sub-components -
staff and community capacity building, support services-showing once again the absence of bottom
up physical and financial planning aggregation prior to fund release.

It is obvious that, community and woreda staff trainings are so important for the successful
implementation and sustainability of projects. Previously, woreda staff and community based
service trainings were considered the mandates of RPCUs whereas staffs trainings and TOTs were
centralized at FPCU. However, RPCUs are complaining that both trainings were centralized and as
a result of this it was so difficult to deliver community trainings independently, a misunderstanding
was created as the result of poor project communication.

Many efforts were made to implement the support services that many equipment supplies (vehicles,
motorbikes, radio, tractors, balers, etc) and construction of offices. There were in some instances
complaints in the selection of the established KDCs locations from the centrality point of view.
Moreover, the little efforts made by some regions to create the nucleus of public service delivery
through the community workers with required services as the KDC was not properly established.

This also hindered the contribution of these pastoral development coordination bodies to
undermine CDD principles and working modalities that in turn created absence of sense of
ownership by each sector agencies. As the result, the PDOs (Commissions) made little efforts to
coordinate the other sector bureaus to actively integrate their efforts and resources with PCDP and
the pastoral communities. Also no logistic support was given to these organizations in order to
strengthen their role in monitoring and evaluation activities as well as oversee project performances.
In fact, PCDP had made little effort to institutionalize and create capacity of Monitoring and
Evaluation in a participatory way with government sectors at all levels.

Pastoral Risk Management
The risk management component has been lagged behind achieving its expected plans during the
last project life due to restructuring of Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Commission (DPPC)
into Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Agency (DPPA) which brought changes in the mandate


                                                    63

 of the former Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Commission to lead the role of this task as
 stipulated in the PCDP PIM.

 Later on, the Ministry of Federal Affairs and the Federal Project Coordination Unit in cooperation
 with Regional Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Bureaus took the lead to accomplish the task.
 Though promising changes are being currently registered in bringing this component to its right
 direction, the major problems related to this component were:
 Absence of clear mandate and responsibility to host the component as well as smooth
 communication between DPPA and the project;
 Absence/Delay of well established pastoral early warning system;
 Delay of woreda level Disaster Preparedness and Contingency Plans preparation;
 Absence of DPCF utilization manual and lack of clear demarcation between CIF and PRM sub-
 projects;
 Implementation of DPCF in the absence of its implementation manual;
 Confusion on institutional arrangements of early warning system and DPCP implementation;
 Very poor attention given to the component against its great importance for the pastoral
 community;
 Unbalanced project diversification and focus as well as concentration on capital investment
 projects through CIF sub-component and capacity building;
 Absence of awareness creation and capacity building trainings for both PCDP Pastoral Risk
 Management (PRM) staffs and stakeholders; and
 Above all, restructuring of DPPC into DPPA and lack of coordination with DPPA and regional
 Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Bureaus.

 Project Support and Coordination

 a) Communication Strategy
 Communication is an all-embracing activity that defines all aspects of relationship between PCDP
 and its internal and external stakeholders. Communication ensures transparency and accountability.
 The way the project office reports, evaluates, communicates and promotes its activity, objectives as
 well as achievements and failures are important for its success.

 It has been observed that the communication strategy of the project was unsystematic and weak,
 not only externally with government structure but also amongst the staff of the project coordination
 units. Moreover, PCDP was not able to benefit from the latest information technology for most of
 its five years time. Even the attempt made to develop Management Information System (MIS) to
 enable FPCU, RPCU and project woredas to have exchange of information was not successful.

 b) Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (PM&E)
 A participatory monitoring and evaluation system was developed for the project with the help of
 local consultants. The PM&E system was expected to play a central role in PCDP and to be
 responsive to the end users and their realities on the ground. The system requires the involvement
 of all relevant stakeholders (primarily community members, their leaders, government staffs,
 NGOs and private sectors representatives). However, it was not properly implemented as expected,
 and as a result the intended objectives were not achieved as required. On top of that, there was no
 uniform reporting format, and hence regions were not reporting project performance as they are
 expected to do so. There was an attempt at the later time to develop a Management Information
 System (MIS) that can facilitate a smooth information flow between regions, and with FPCU, but
 not implemented as planned.




                                                   64

 c) Policy Reform and knowledge building on pastoral development
 The following two problems can be drawn from last phase performance of the sub component:
 The activities were improperly centralized and there was a weak linkage between FPCU as well as
 RPCU with Federal and Regional research institutions; and
 There was lack of quality in some studies sponsored by the sub component

 d) Financial Management
 PCDP follow decentralized financial management. It supports the regional governments to
 decentralize by financing at woreda and kebeles levels. During the last five years PCDP follows
 this principle.

 However, there was poor coordination and limited transparency on fund allocation, delay in fund
 allocation and release, as well as lack of accountability at woreda level. There was also absence of
 mechanisms for cross-checking on SoEs sent to FPCU for replenishment, weak or absence of
 internal auditing, lack of integration between the financial and physical reporting mechanisms,
 leading to poor control on fund utilization.

 e) Procurement and Resource Management
 Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) interventions are designed to empower pastoral
 communities to administer development in their areas. To this end, PCDP is going through the
 process of decentralization by channeling substantial resources directly to Woreda administrations.
 These types of self-management of own resources, through CDD approaches, created an
 opportunity in terms of community participation and enhancement of local decision on utilization
 of development resource for pastoral Communities in Afar, Somali, Oromia and SNNP Region at
 woreda and kebele level during the last Five years.

However the CDD approach, as accompanied by Participatory Learning and Action, has been
misunderstood and implemented in some woredas of Somali Region whereby the woreda
administration officials erroneously used their power by violating the mandate of the community to
participate, negotiate, control and use resources for community's best interest. In this regard, few
remote and insecure woredas in Somali region left uncontrolled under the existing fiduciary system
which eventually resulted in declaration of misprocurement.

The unbalanced implementation status of the two main components CIF versus DPCF tilted in
favor of CIF during the four years of the project period, which created backlog of triggered
activities on the DPCF component. FPCU, during its endeavor to fulfill the component's trigger,
carried out urgent recruitment of consultants to develop disaster preparedness and contingency plan
at least in two third project woredas, by overlooking standard procurement procedures for selection
of consultants. However, during post procurement review, rationales for deviation from the
procurement procedures in the selection of consultant was found un-acceptable by the World Bank
and declared mis-procurement which resulted in the cancellation of that portion of contract from
the grant and reimbursement of payment executed to IDA.

The respective government body on behalf of the project has taken appropriate action.
Accordingly: For misprocurement findings of the World Bank from four woredas of Somali
Region, appropriate legal actions have been taken up on wrongdoers. Following the World Bank's
misprocurement declaration on four woredas of Somali Region, FPCU has also written a letter to
the Regional State to suspend ongoing activities until mitigation plan being in place. Regarding
misprocurement declared at FPCU level, appropriate legal action is on process. And the
government is taking action to reimburse the amount request by the World Bank.



                                                  65

 Insufficiency in capacity building efforts at woreda & regional level has aggravated the harmful
 consequences that ended up in cancellation of about 190,000 USD from grant and reimbursement
 of expenditure due to misprocurement. During various procurement capacity assessment made by
 World Bank's Supervision Mission and annual post procurement reviews, capacity building in
 procurement areas has been frequently recommended to minimize a highly rated procurement risks
 in implementing PCDP II.

 LESSONS LEARNED

 The following pertinent issues can be cited as a learning ground for future interventions.

 The project follows a challenging approach, Community Driven Development Approach. It has
 been observed that the approach is well working and adopted the circumstances of pastoral
 communities and hence ensures efficiency and sustainability of the project. It created self reliance
 and built confidence among the community to undertake their own development initiatives.
 Nevertheless, more decentralization and developing decision making power to the community best
 works with CDD approach. On top of that, a continuous capacity building activities needs to be
 undertaken for the respective community to ensure the adoption and sustainability of grass roots
 development.
 It has been also found out that the Community Driven Development Approach (CDD) required a
 clear and committed share of responsibilities among the different stakeholders of the project. In this
 regard, much effort is expected to be accomplished in the future.
 Provision of basic social and physical infrastructures and services contribute for reducing the
 problems in the pastoral areas. Availability of water, school, human & animal health services have
 proved to show positive impact on the development and creation of permanent settlement areas
 around these schemes. The development of such kind of schemes could be still a priority area for
 the project up on the will and interests of the community.
 Income Generating Schemes supported by the project brought a concrete out come for the intended
 beneficiaries in the first phase of the project. Still these activities are valid in the future but with
 certain modification on their institutional setups. They need to be more formal to properly
 addressed, supervised, monitored, as well as to make them more effective in line with the intended
 objectives.
 One problem in the first phase of the project was mix up of community and inter-community
 projects, and between CIF and DPCF sub projects. As a result, some regions have got a problem to
 clearly indicate sub-projects supported by CIF and those supported with DPCF. There is therefore,
 a need to clearly isolate activities supported by each of these two funds.
