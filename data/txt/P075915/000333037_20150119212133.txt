Pastoral Community Development Project                                                                         June 10, 2004
The Pastoral Community Development Project seeks to improve the livelihoods of the pastoral groups
of the arid, and semi-arid Ethiopian lowlands, by fostering income growth, access to public services,
and by facilitating better institutional, social, and environmental conditions. The three main project
components aim to: 1) establish decentralized, and participatory planning procedures at the community
level, and other groups that operate within the regional government structure.



Communities will identify, design, and implement micro-projects, reflecting their development priorities, supported by capacity
building, and required training, while the Community Investment Fund will provide investment to support infrastructure, and
public service delivery; 2) build a community-based early warning system to establish a communal collection, and analysis of
basic household welfare data, focusing on sub-groups to design pastoral production systems. A disaster contingency
planning subcomponent will build capacity at regional levels for disaster preparedness - mitigation and rapid response - for
drought management and recovery activities, providing grants to finance activities identified in contingency plans; and, 3)
support operational, and training resources for the federal, and regional project coordination units, to ensure fiduciary
obligations, policy analysis and liaison with stakeholder groups, and a multi-sectoral coordination.
