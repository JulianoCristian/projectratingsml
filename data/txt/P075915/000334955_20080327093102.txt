1. Introduction 
 
The Pastoral Community Development Program is targeted at the pressing 
development needs of pastoralists in Ethiopia.  It is composed of three overlapping 
five-year projects.  The first Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP I) 
began in 2003 and is now being superseded by PCDP II.   
 
Like PCDP I, PCDP II has major components 
–
1. Sustainable Livelihoods 
Enhancement, and 2. Pastoral Risk Management – that, among other things, will 
finance small-scale sub-projects in pastoral areas of Ethiopia that may have adverse 
environmental or social impacts.  PCDP II has three funds that will finance these sub-
projects -- Component 1 includes a Community Investment Fund (CIF) and a Rural 
Livelihoods Fund (RLF), and Component 2 includes a Disaster Preparedness Strategy 
and Investment Program (DPSIP).  Sub-project types that are ineligible for PCDP II 
funding include road construction with a greater specification than RR10, activities 
that involve resettlement and investments that could lead to environmental 
degradation.  Typical
 
subprojects include: 
 
CIF RLF DPSIP 
·
Schools  
·
Health posts 
·
Veterinary Posts 
·
Small-scale water supply 
(ponds, shallow wells, 
cisterns, water pipe line 
extension, spring 
development) 
·
Small-scale irrigation 
·
Small feeder roads 
 
·
Grain mills 
·
Milk collection & 
marketing 
·
Rental houses 
·
Petty trade 
·
Livestock fattening 
·
Grain store and milling 
·
Services shops and milk 
collection centers 
·
Public shower and toilet 
service 
·
Workshops 
·
Small-scale water supply  
·
Catchment management 
·
Small feeder roads 
·
Boreholes: new & 
rehabilitation 
·

Small dams/ponds and 
reservoirs 
·
River dikes 
 
During the preparation of the PCDP I, an environmental and social screening process, 
entitled “Environmental Assessment Management Framework for the Pastoral 
Community Development Project”, (January 10, 2003) was developed. This screening 
process was designed as part of the appraisal of sub-projects such as livestock 
production, agricultural extension services, water supply and sanitation, small-scale 
irrigation, health care, social infrastructure and rangeland management. Potential 
negative environmental and social impacts may include loss of vegetation, soil and 
water pollution, increase in malaria, and soil erosion.  
 
This Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) builds on the PCDP 
I
screening process.  Its purpose is to provide guidance to PCDP staff, communities, 
districts (woredas) and others participating in PCDP II regarding the sustainable 
environmental and social management of sub-projects where the exact locations and 
potentially negative localized impacts were not known prior to project appraisal. 
 
Page  4

Implementation Arrangements 
 
The requirements of this ESMF will be implemented through the normal 
implementation arrangements for PCDP II. As during PCDP I, overall project 
management will be carried out by the Federal Project Coordination Unit (FPCU) in 
the Ministry of Federal Affairs.  The FPCUs will continue to be responsible for 
overall annual planning, fiduciary management, liaison with stakeholder groups at 
the federal level, project communication, overall project monitoring and evaluation, 
strategic staff capacity-building and mobilization of technical backstopping.   
 
Given the decentralized structure of the PCDP, the project will be managed more 
substantially at the regional and district (woreda) levels. At the regional level, 
Regional Project Coordination Units (RPCUs) in the Pastoral Bureaus will be 
responsible for the planning, management and coordination of project activities, and 
for facilitating capacity-building activities at the woreda and community levels to 
improve planning and provision of support services.  The RPCUs will be supported 
by project-financed Mobile Support Teams
 
(MSTs), which will provide capacity-
building to both communities and woredas, assist woredas to appraise and approve 
community subo-projects, and monitor project implementation.  
 
Thus, the RPCUs and MSTs will be directly responsible for ensuring that woreda 
staff are trained in the use of this ESMF, and are fully supported in implementing it.  
The FPCU will be responsible for ensuring that annual performance reviews of 
ESMF implementation are carried out in all PCDP II regions and woredas. 
 
Component 1:  Sustainable Livelihoods Enhancement
Pastoral communities will identify, prioritize, design, and implement sub-projects 
that reflect their development priorities identified in integrated community action 
plans (CAPs).  Using simple sub-project application forms, communities will clearly 
define their objectives, propose activities and budgets, while taking into 
consideration the environmental implications of their projects.  Proposed community 
investments will be forwarded to woredas for funding through the Community 
Investment Fund
 
(CIF).  A Woreda Development Committee (WDC), comprising 
representatives of the woreda administration, civil society and the private sector, 
will appraise the CIF requests and approve them.  Approval of CIF proposals will be 
judged at the woreda level against transparent criteria known in advance to all 
stakeholders, and evaluated according to technical standards from line ministries.  
The development plans, which will require at least a 15 percent community cash or 
in-kind contribution to demonstrate commitment, will be implemented directly by 
communities to build capacity, ensure correspondence of investments to needs, and 
guarantee accountability to the community. 
 
The Rural Livelihoods Fund (RLF) will finance rural livelihoods activities identified 
by beneficiary community groups through the Rural Savings and Credit Cooperatives 
(RUSACCOs).  Capacity-building will be extended to existing income-generating 
groups established during PCDP I as well as to new groups.  PCDP II will also 
support the formation and establishment of RUSACCOs in beneficiary communities 
and at woreda level, as required.

Component 2: Pastoral Risk Management
A
Disaster Preparedness Strategy and Investment Program (DPSIP) will identify 
community and woreda perceived needs for long-term regional disaster preparedness 
and mitigation, many of which are anticipated to be cross-woreda in their 
application.  These proposals will be aggregated at zonal and regional levels and, 
under the management of the regional pastoral development commission or bureaus, 
integrated into a long-term disaster preparedness strategy and prioritized investment 
plans.  PSNP catchment management proposals under the Bank-financed Productive 
Safety Nets Program (PSNP) will be integrated into these plans.  The disaster 
preparedness strategy will be approved by the regional PCDP/PSNP steering 
committee and implemented in accordance with available funding by the pastoral 
development commission or bureaus, supported by PCDP financial and procurement 
staff.  The Project will provide technical assistance, staff capacity building and an 
operational manual to support the development of the regional disaster preparedness 
strategies and prioritized investment plans.  
 
The DPSIP will be coordinated by the regional Pastoral Development commission or 
bureaus, based on information collected from Woreda Disaster Preparedness 
Contingency Plans and a wider analysis of the natural resource base and its 
traditional use.  Prioritized disaster preparedness investments will be financed and 
procured under standard World Bank procurement procedures. 
 
2. The 
Environmental 
and 
Social 
Management 
Framework 
 
The ESMF consists of (i) seven steps involved in the approval of sub-projects; (ii) an 
environmental and social screening form; (iii) an environmental and social checklist 
to be completed by qualified personnel; (iv) proposed mitigation measures that could 
be implemented by qualified staff at the community and Wereda levels; (v) and 
necessary annexes for practical reference. 
 
This ESMF will be part and parcel of the PCDP II Implementation Manual for use by 
PCDP staff for sub-project proposals to ensure that the environmental and social 
assessment and management requirements of sub-projects are met effectively.  
 
3. 
Steps in the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework  
 
·
Step 1:  Environmental and Social Screening of Sub-Projects 
 
The initial environmental and social screening will be carried out through 
the use of the Environmental and Social Screening Form (Annex 1) and the 
use of the Land Acquisition Assessment Tool (Annex 8). These forms will 
be completed by a qualified member of Mobile Support Team (MST) for the 
purposes of identifying the potential environmental and social impacts, 
determining their significance, and making recommendations as to the 
Page  6
5
required environmental and social works. To be qualified for this task, the 
member of the Mobile Extension Team (MST) will receive relevant 
environmental and social training. 
 
·
Step 2: Assigning the Appropriate Environmental Categories 
 
Based on the environmental and social screening results, the appropriate 
environmental category 
–
“C” or “B” – for the proposed sub-project will be 
determined. This step will be carried out by a qualified member of the Mobile 
Support Team (MST), with assistance from a qualified Water Engineer, or 
regional or woreda staff – all have received, or will receive, appropriate 
training to carry out their tasks effectively.  
 
The assignment of the appropriate environmental category will be consistent 
with the provisions of the World Bank’s OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. 
Consistent with this operational policy, some sub-project activities such as 
construction, rehabilitation, irrigation, or/and livestock activities are likely to 
have some negative environmental and social impacts that might require 
mitigations. While Ethiopia has sector-specific EIA procedures and guidelines, 
there are currently no guidelines or procedures that would allow for the 
identification and mitigation of potential localized negative environmental and 
social impacts of small-scale projects such as PCDP’s sub-projects. Therefore, 
the project will apply this ESMF which is consistent with Ethiopia’s accepted 
standard to the extent that it requires the screening of all proposed 
investments. 
 
With regard to PCDP, it is likely that most sub-projects will be categorized as 
“C” if the environmental and social screening results indicate that the sub-
projects will have no significant environmental and social impacts and 
therefore do not require additional environmental work 
 
Some sub-projects might be categorized as “B” meaning that the potential 
adverse environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally 
important areas – including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural 
habitats – are site-specific, few if any of the impacts are irreversible, and they 
can be mitigated. 
 
The category of a sub-project will be defined during the screening step.  If the 
screening form has ONLY “No” entries, the sub-project will be a “C” and will 
not require further environmental work.  The qualified member of the Wereda 
Development Committee (WDC) will recommend approval of this sub-project 
and implementation can proceed.  If there are ANY “no” entries, the sub-
project will be a “B” and will require further preparation work (Step 3 below). 
 
·
Step 3: Carrying Out Environmental Work 
 
After reviewing the results of the environmental and social screening process, 
and having determined the appropriate environmental category, and hence, the 
scope of the required environmental work, the qualified Water Engineers, 
working with the respective qualified members of the Mobile Support Team 
(MST) at the community level, will determine the extent of environmental 
Page  7
6
work required, that is, whether (a) the application of mitigation measures 
outlined in the Environmental and Social Checklist will suffice; (b) a separate 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) needs to be carried out, using the 
EIA guidance. Depending on the screening results, the following 
environmental work can be carried out: 
 
Environmental and Social Checklist
 
This Environmental and Social Checklist (Annex 2) will outline simple 
mitigation measures for environmental and social impacts that do not require 
EIA. It will be completed by a qualified member of the Mobile Support Team 
(MST) at the community level, with assistance from qualified sector staff at 
the regional sector offices, and a qualified Water Engineer, as necessary. This 
checklist will be completed in consultations with the relevant local 
communities and authorities as well as potentially affected persons.  
 
If there are already existing standard designs, the qualified sector staff at the 
regional sector office, in coordination with the qualified Water Engineer and 
the Mobile Support Team (MST)/ Mobile Outreach Team (MOTs) at the 
community level, will assess them for impacts on the chosen land site and 
modify the design to include appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
Once the qualified sector staff of the regional sector office, the qualified Water 
Engineer and the qualified member of the Mobile Support Team/ Mobile 
Outreach Team (MOT) at the community level are satisfied that the 
designs/sub-project proposals are environmentally and socially compliant, the 
qualified member of the Mobile Support Team will then submit the sub-
project proposal/designs to the Wereda Development Committee (WDC) at 
the Wereda level: The sub-project documentation must be accompanied by the 
completed environmental and social screening forms. 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
 
In some cases, the results of the environmental and social screening process 
may indicate the need to carry out an EIA (Annex 3). In this case, the more 
complex environmental procedures (from registration, to preparation of EMPs, 
to issuing of an EIA certificate) as provided for in the National EIA guidelines 
will be carried-out by PCDP qualified personnel in collaboration with  
Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). 
 
·
Step 4: Review and Approval 
 
Review
:
Upon receipt of all the relevant sub-project documentation, a 
qualified member of the Wereda Development Committee (WDC), at the 
Wereda level will review the environmental and social screening results, 
including the Land Acquisition Assessment, as well as the environmental 
checklists that were completed in the course of sub-project preparation to 
ensure that all environmental and social impacts have been identified and 
successfully mitigated. That is, if the screenin
g
form has any “Yes” entries, or 
evidently unjustified “No” entries, the application would need to adequately 
explain and demonstrate from its design that the issues raised earlier have been 
Page  8
7
addressed appropriately. The WDC must also ensure that the sub-project 
designs include monitoring and institutional measures to be taken during their 
implementation and operation. Based on the review of the sub-project 
documentation, the Wereda Development Committee, upon advice of its 
qualified members, will recommend to the Wereda Government approval or 
disapproval of the sub-project. 
 
The review of separate EIA reports will be the responsibility of the regional 
EPA offices.  
 
Approval/Disapproval:
 
If the sub-project application has satisfactorily 
addressed all environmental and social issues and the Wereda Government is 
in agreement with the recommendations made by the Wereda Development 
Committee, the Wereda Government will then clear the sub-project at the 
Wereda level.  
 
If the Wereda Government finds that the submitted design is not consistent 
with the requirements of the environmental screening based on the 
environmental checklist, then the sub-project implementer would be requested 
to re-design (e.g. make additional modifications and/or choose other sites) and 
re-screen the project until it is consistent with this environmental and social 
screening requirements.  
 
The qualified member of the Wereda Development Committee will then 
review again the revised application, if now acceptable, will recommend for 
consideration for approval. If it is not acceptable for the second time, it would 
be referred back to the implementer for more work e.g. carry out a sub-project 
EIA in cases where one was not done before or denied clearance altogether. 
 
Any proposed sub-projects that do not comply with the requirements of 
Ethiopian policies and regulations and the World Bank Safeguards policies 
will not be cleared for approval. A summary of the World Bank’s safeguard 
policies is attached herewith (Annex 9).   
 
·
Step 5:  Public Consultation and Disclosure 
 
Public consultations as part of the environmental screening and environmental 
assessment process are critical in preparing an effective and sustainable sub-
project. This requirement is complemented by the participatory planning 
process that is followed by PCDP at the community level when sub projects 
are being identified as part of the development and implementation of local 
development plans for the area. PCDP being a participatory project, 
beneficiaries are expected to be directly involved in the whole project cycle 
right from the design, to implementation and monitoring. 
 
The first step in this regard is to hold public consultations with the local 
communities and all other stakeholders during the screening process and in the 
course of conducting the EIA. These consultations should identify key issues 
and determine how the concerns of all parties will be addressed. To facilitate 
meaningful consultations, the sub-project planners will provide all relevant 
Page  9
8
material and information concerning the sub projects in a timely manner prior 
to the consultation, in a form and language that are understandable and 
accessible to the groups being consulted.  
 
Once the sub-project has been reviewed by the qualified member of the 
Wereda Development Committee and approved by the Wereda Government, 
the Wereda Development Committee will inform the public about the results 
of the review. For all sub-projects that will be implemented at the community 
level, the Wereda Development Committee will be responsible for disclosing 
the findings and recommendations of the environmental and social screening 
process to the communities, assisted by the qualified members of the Mobile 
Support Team (MST) and the qualified Water Engineers. The MST will be 
responsible for taking the minutes of the public disclosure meetings. The 
office of the Wereda Development Committee will produce and distribute 
copies of the minutes to offices at the community and Wereda levels. A 
summary of the outcome of this public disclosure meeting will be posted at 
appropriate places in kebeles and communities. 
 
Any affected or interested individual or group has the right of appeal, if 
dissatisfied with the decision reached at any stage in the EIA process. The 
appeals process will follow the procedures outlined in the National 
Environment Act. 
 
To ensure that an appropriate public consultation mechanism is developed: 
 
i.  The environmental and social screening process includes such a 
requirement; 
ii.  Development of individual sub-project EMP (if required) include 
such a requirement; 
iii.  Once the sub-project activities have been cleared by the Wereda 
Governments, the Wereda Development Committee will inform the 
communities about the results of the review; 
iv.  In the context of the PCDP Monitoring Program, the communities 
will undertake both compliance monitoring and effects monitoring 
throughout the sub-project cycle. 
 
·
Step 6: Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
Environmental monitoring needs to be carried out during the construction as 
well as operation and maintenance of the sub-projects in order to measure the 
success of the mitigation measures implemented. The responsibilities for 
monitoring and evaluation of the mitigation measures adopted under the sub-
projects would be assigned as follows: 
 
Mobile Support Teams (MSTs) and Mobile Outreach Teams (MOTs)
 
will 
be responsible for the day to day monitoring and reporting of feedback 
throughout the life of the sub-project, specifically the monitoring of :- 
 
i. 
The environmental and social assessment work to be carried out;  
ii.   Monitoring of environmental issues and the supervision of the 
civil works contractor during the construction process 
Page  10
9
iii.  
Monitoring of environmental issues during operations and 
maintenance of the infrastructure and facilities when handed over 
to the communities after construction;  
iv.  Submission of monitoring reports to the Wereda Governments for 
eventual submission to the regional offices of the Environmental 
Protection Authority (EPA). 
 
The monitoring and reporting will be done by the members of the MOT 
member representing the respective sector at the Wereda level who will be 
adequately trained.  
 
Members of the Community
1
:
Communities,
 through their 
representatives assigned in the Community Based Organizations, will 
undertake - after training - both compliance monitoring and effects 
monitoring. This will be done throughout the sub-project cycle namely:  
(i) During the planning phase, the communities will participate in the 
identification of indicators for monitoring the mitigating measures;  
(ii) During implementation (construction) phase, monitoring the execution 
of works with respect to environmental aspects, e.g. verify the 
compliances of the Contractors with their obligations;  
(iii)During operation and maintenance phase, the overall environmental 
monitoring and alerting on any emerging environmental hazards in 
conjunction with the ongoing sub-project activities. The 
communities will be enabled to pass on their observations and 
concerns through the MSTs/ MOTs. 
 
The National Environmental Protection Authority (EPA
 
will perform 
an enforcement monitoring role supported by the qualified Infrastructural 
Water Engineers and regional EPA offices based on submissions and 
recommendations from the WDC.  
 
The EPA will support the monitoring plan for the overall monitoring of the 
entire PCDP requirements is implemented with particular focus on monitoring 
cumulative impacts of the sub-projects on a national level and to ensure that 
individual sub-project mitigation measures are effective at the cumulative and 
national level. EPA would primarily achieve this objective through periodic 
field visits, coordinating and implementing the Training Program and through 
technical assistance and backup services to the WDC. 
 
Federal EPA finally will be responsible for evaluating cumulative 
environmental impacts of PCDP by summing up the evaluations of potential 
localized negative impacts of each sub-project in wider area scale. 
 
Performance Reviews
 will be undertaken by an independent local 
environmental consultant
 
contracted to visit each participating Wereda at least 
once a year.  The purpose of these reviews is to support compliance with 
ESMP objectives and procedures; to determine lessons learnt during project 
implementation; to provide recommendations to the FPCU for improving 
1
Communities will be represented by elected representatives to run the respective CBO in their sub-project. 
Page  11
10
future performance; and to provide an early warning to the FPCU about 
potential cumulative impacts. This will be stated at the end of the first two 
years of  PCDP II and will be subjected for review in the MTR. 
 
·
Step 7: Monitoring indicators 
 
The objectives for monitoring are: (i) to alert project authorities and to provide 
timely information about the success or otherwise of the ESMP  process as 
outlined in such a manner that changes to the system can be made, if required; 
(ii) to make a final evaluation in order to determine whether the mitigation 
measures designed into the sub-projects have been successful in such a way 
that the pre-sub-project environmental and social condition has been restored, 
improved upon or worst than before. 
 
Generally speaking PCDP is also developing indicators for potential untended 
environmental and social negative impacts in its Participatory Monitoring and 
Evaluation System.  Generally, environmental and social impacts will be 
monitored and mitigated in situ upon design, approval and mitigation measure 
implementation. Details will be seen in the PM&E Manual. 
 
Moreover, PCDP’s current interventions that are expected to result in 
unintended but potential negative impacts. Will be designed the screening 
process to closely look into the appraisal of sub-projects such as livestock 
production, agricultural extension services, water supply and sanitation, small-
scale irrigation, river diversions, health care, social infrastructure and 
rangeland management.

 Capacity Building Plan 
 
The following training program was completed in all participating Woredas during 
PCDP I.  During PCDP II, it will be carried out in all Wordeas new to PCDP.  As the 
need is indicated by the Performance Reviews or M&E activities, refresher courses 
will be also be prepared and delivered during PCDP II.

landscape. 
 
29.  Minimize erosion by wind and water both during and after the process of reinstatement. 
 
30. Compacted surfaces shall be deep ripped to relieve compaction unless subsurface conditions      
dictate otherwise. 
 
31.  Re-vegetate with plant species that will control erosion, provide vegetative diversity and, through      
succession, contributes to a resilient ecosystem.  The choice of plant species for rehabilitation shall      
be done in consultation with local research institutions, forest department and the local people. 
 
Water Resources Management 
32.  The Contractor shall at all costs avoid conflicting with water demands of local communities. 
 
33.  Abstraction of both surface and underground water shall only be done with the consultation of the       
local community and after obtaining a permit from the relevant Water Authority. 
 
34. Abstraction of water from wetlands shall be avoided. Where necessary, authority has to be       
obtained from relevant authorities. 
 
35. Temporary damming of streams and rivers shall be done in such a way avoids disrupting water       
supplies to communities down stream, and maintains the ecological balance of the river system. 
 
36.  No construction water containing spoils or site effluent, especially cement and oil, shall be allowed 
to flow into natural water drainage courses. 
 
37. Wash water from washing out of equipment shall not be discharged into watercourses or road

run off shall be directed away from stockpiles to prevent erosion. 
 
Cost of Compliance 
39
.
It is expected that compliance with these conditions is already part of standard good 
workmanship and state of art as generally required under this Contract.  The item 
“Compliance with Environmental Management Conditions” in the Bill of Quantities covers 
these costs.  No other payments will be made to the Contractor for compliance with any 
request to avoid and/or mitigate an avoidable EHS impact.

¾\03
Adopt standards for waste water reuse; 
4
Blankwaardt, Bob, “Hand drilled wells. A manual on siting, design, construction, and maintenance”, Rwegarulila Water Resources Institute, 
1984 – Note: These criteria are partly based on the rate of movement of bacteria and viruses through soils and on their survival period. Although 
bacteria and viruses are largely retained by the first Meter of soil around the sanitary and other installations listed, there have been actual 
recordings of them traveling the distances mentioned as a minimum. In cases of doubt, the responsible water or health authorities will have to 
decide whether an intake should be abandonned. 
5
1-2 square Meters for simple pit latrines; more than 12 square Meters plus access space for twin pour-flush latrines 
6
These range from 50 litres/m2/day for gravel/coarse and medium sand to 8 litres/m2/day for silty clay loam, and clay loam; clay is considered 
unsuitable for soak pits. Most soils will dispose of human wastes safely when water consumption levels are low. As water use rises, however, 
infiltration rates increase and many soils, particularly those with a high clay and silt content will block up. 
Page  49
48
¾
As appropriate, consult EPA guidelines for reclaimed water treatment processes and 
water quality limits for both, non-potable water and indirect potable reuse applications
7
.
Environmental monitoring indicators:
 
¾
Microbiological indicators such as E. coli, the single most important indicator of faecal 
contamination of water by humans or animals. It can be tested in the field (using field test 
kits with portable incubators) or in the laboratory
8
;
¾
Physical-chemical indicators such as fluoride, nitrate/nitrite, pH, turbidity, chlorine 
residual; 
¾
If necessary, identify sources of secondary information that allows for the monitoring of 
health impacts (i.e. decline in the number of cases of diarrhea; increase in the number of 
latrines used); 
¾
Consult the publication “Environmental Performance Indicators” for guidance in the 
development of environmental monitoring indicators. 
 
Community participation:
 
Factors that seem to favor community management across 
organizational types include
9
:
¾
Timely educational and training inputs; 
¾
Building on the country’s social and cultural traditions; 
¾
Continuity of staffing; 
¾
Giving more attention to training in administration for projects that depend upon 
community management; 
¾
Systematic encouragement of inter-visitation between villages; 
¾
The use of project champions; 
¾
Providing organizations with computers; 
¾
Associate local ownership of infrastructure with the stronger local organizations
.

Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) 
Mini-Pest Management Plan for Agriculture Sub-Projects
 
Draft 
 
Small-scale agricultural sub-projects may involve strengthening existing practices, 
introducing, diversifying or the intensification of crop production. Support for the 
development of small-scale agriculture and certain livestock activities (i.e. tick dips) may lead 
to the introduction or increased use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals such as 
herbicides and fertilizers. Pests are organisms that compete with humans, domestic animals, 
or crops for nutritional resources. They include species of insects, mites, nematodes, 
mollusks, plant pathogens, vertebrates and weeds. Fertilizers are used to promote crop 
growth. 
 
It is critical that appropriate planning, design and management be adopted for the handling, 
use, and management of all agricultural chemicals to avoid potential negative environmental 
impacts. If appropriate for small-scale agriculture projects funded under PCDP, a mini-pest 
management plan for agriculture sub-projects should address the following issues: 
 
1. 
Proper use of agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers to avoid reduction in soil and 
groundwater quality. 
 
2.  
Prevent fertilizer run-off into surface water sources to avoid negative impacts on 
aquatic environments. 
 
3.  
Proper use of pesticides and herbicides to avoid contamination of crops, soils and 
water. 
 
4.  
Proper use, handling and storage of all agricultural chemicals to avoid adverse health 
impacts on the rural population. 
 
5.  
Ensure that banned or unauthorized agricultural chemicals are not used. 
 
6.  
Proper handling and disposal of unused agricultural chemicals and packaging 
materials (i.e. sacks, plastic containers, etc.).

Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) 
Land Acquisition Assessment 
 
The Land Acquisition Assessment serves as a screening tool to determine any potential issues 
that might emerge in relation to land acquisition for sub-projects such as schools, health posts, 
food processing facilities, guest rooms, water management structures etc. 
 
Based on the screening results, the qualified member of the Mobile Extension Team (MST) in 
consultation with potentially affected persons and relevant regional sector staff, will discuss 
whether to (a) redesign the sub-project to avoid the need for land acquisition; or (b) retain the 
original sub-project location and compensate affected persons in accordance with OP 4.12 
Involuntary Resettlement. 
 
Thus, as part of the environmental and social screening process, a qualified member of the 
Mobile Extension Team (MST) will address the points below using the land acquisition 
assessment tool; the latter will be used to collect the following information: 
 
1. 
Location of the site 
 
2. 
Size of the site 
 
3. 
Status of the site: Is the land owned privately, publicly, collectively? Does someone 
hold a title to the land? Who is the legal owner of the land? 
 
4. 
Present use of the land: Is it used for agricultural purposes? Is the land not used by 
anybody? 
 
5. 
Who currently benefits from the use of the land in question: Are the current 
beneficiaries legal owners, renters, squatters, or do they hold legal contracts? 
 
6. 
What is the value of the land, the structures that have been built on this land? 
 
7. 
Who is donating/selling the site, and how is the donation/sales process to take place? 
In the event that private land will be donated/sold, the qualified member of the MST will 
ensure that this transaction is documented to show that the land was donated/sold willingly; 
the document is signed and notarized by the donor/seller and counter-signed by the local 
administrator and the relevant project staff; and a copy of this document is placed in the files 
of the local administrator for future reference. 
 
Comment: At the end of the process, the qualified member of the MST will summarize the 
proceedings, and add observations as appropriate.

Annex 9 
Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) 
Summary of the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies 
 
OP 4.01 
Environmental 
Assessment  
The objective of this policy is to ensure that 
Bank-financed projects are environmentally 
sound and sustainable, and that decision-
making is improved through appropriate 
analysis of actions and of their likely 
environmental impacts. This policy is 
triggered if a project is likely to have potential 
(adverse) environmental risks and impacts on 
its area of influence. OP 4.01 covers impacts 
on the natural environment (air, water and 
land); human health and safety; physical 
cultural resources; and transboundary and 
global environment concerns. 
Depending on the project and nature of impacts, 
a
range of instruments can be used: EA, 
environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment 
and environmental management plan (EMP). 
When a project is likely to have sectoral or 
regional impacts, sectoral or regional EA is 
required. The Borrower is responsible for 
carrying out the EA. 
 
Investments under PCDP will be subject to 
environmental and social screening during 
the planning stage, and appropriate steps will 
be taken based on the results of the 
environmental and social screening process 
outlined in this document. 
OP 4.04 Natural 
Habitats  
This policy recognizes that the conservation 
of natural habitats is essential to safeguard 
their unique biodiversity and to maintain 
environmental services and products for 
human society and for long-term sustainable 
development. The Bank therefore supports the 
protection, management, and restoration of 
natural habitats in its project financing, as 
well as policy dialogue and economic and 
sector work. The Bank supports, and expects 
borrowers to apply, a precautionary approach 
to natural resource management to ensure 
opportunities for environmentally sustainable 
development. Natural habitats are land and 
water areas where most of the original native 
plant and animal species are still present. 
Natural habitats comprise many types of 
terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine 
ecosystems. They include areas lightly 
modified by human activities, but retaining 
their ecological functions and most native 
species. 
This policy is triggered by any project 
(including any sub-project under a sector 
investment or financial intermediary) with the 
potential to cause significant conversion (loss) 
or degradation of natural habitats, whether 
directly (through construction) or indirectly 
(through human activities induced by the 
project). 
 
PCDP will not fund any sub-projects that 
will have negative effects on natural habitats 
and/or critical natural habitats. 
 
OP 4.36 Forests  
The objective of this policy is to assist 
borrowers to harness the potential of forests to 
reduce poverty in a sustainable manner, 
integrate forests effectively into sustainable 
economic development and protect the vital 
local and global environmental services and 
values of forests. Where forest restoration and 
plantation development are necessary to meet 
This policy is triggered whenever any Bank-
financed investment project (i) has the potential 
to have impacts on the health and quality of 
forests or the rights and welfare of people and 
their level of dependence upon or interaction 
with forests; or (ii) aims to bring about changes 
in the management, protection or utilization of 
natural forests or plantations. 
Page  53
52
these objectives, the Bank assists borrowers 
with forest restoration activities that maintain 
or enhance biodiversity and ecosystem 
functionality. The Bank assists borrowers 
with the establishment of environmentally 
appropriate, socially beneficial and 
economically viable forest plantations to help 
meet growing demands for forest goods and 
services. 
 
PCDP will not fund any sub-projects that 
might negatively affect the health and quality 
of forests or will bring about changes in their 
management.
 
OP 4.09 Pest 
Management  
The objective of this policy is to (i) promote 
the use of biological or environmental control 
and reduce reliance on synthetic chemical 
pesticides; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of 
the country’s regulatory framework and 
institutions to promote and support safe, 
effective and environmentally sound pest 
management. More specifically, the policy 
aims to (a) Ascertain that pest management 
activities in Bank-financed operations are 
based on integrated approaches and seek to 
reduce reliance on synthetic chemical 
pesticides (Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) in agricultural projects and Integrated 
Vector Management (IVM) in public health 
projects. (b) Ensure that health and 
environmental hazards associated with pest 
management, especially the use of pesticides 
are minimized and can be properly managed 
by the user. (c) As necessary, support policy 
reform and institutional capacity development 
to (i) enhance implementation of IPM-based 
pest management and (ii) regulate and 
monitor the distribution and use of pesticides. 
The policy is triggered if : (i) procurement of 
pesticides or pesticide application equipment is 
envisaged (either directly through the project, or 
indirectly through on-lending, co-financing, or 
government counterpart funding); (ii) the 
project may affect pest management in a way 
that harm could be done, even though the 
project is not envisaged to procure pesticides. 
This includes projects that may (i) lead to 
substantially increased pesticide use and 
subsequent increase in health and environmental 
risk; (ii) maintain or expand present pest 
management practices that are unsustainable, 
not based on an IPM approach, and/or pose 
significant health or environmental risks. 
 
PCDP will adopt safe practices regarding 
pest management in its agricultural sub-
projects, and vector management in its health 
sub-projects to ensure that these investments 
are environmentally and socially sustainable. 
OP 4.11 
Cultural 
Property  
The objective of this policy is to assist 
countries to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts 
of development projects on physical cultural 
resources. For purposes of this policy, 
“physical cultural resources” are defined as 
movable or immovable objects, sites, 
structures, groups of structures, natural 
features and landscapes that have 
archaeological, paleontological, historical, 
architectural, religious, aesthetic, or other 
cultural significance. Physical cultural 
resources may be located in urban or rural 
settings, and may be above ground, 
underground, or underwater. 
This policy applies to all projects requiring a 
Category A or B Environmental Assessment 
under OP 4.01. 
 
PCDP will not fund any sub-projects that 
might have negative impacts on cultural

OP 4.10 
Indigenous 
Peoples  
The objective of this policy is to (i) ensure 
that the development process fosters full 
respect for the dignity, human rights, and 
cultural uniqueness of indigenous peoples; (ii) 
ensure that they do not suffer adverse effects 
during the development process; and (iii) 
ensure that indigenous peoples receive 
culturally compatible social and economic 
benefits. 
The policy is triggered when the project affects 
the indigenous peoples (with characteristics 
described in ODP 4.10 para 4) in the project 
area. 
 
PCDP, will not support any sub-projects that 
might have negative impacts on indigenous 
peoples. 
 
TO BE REVISITED IN LIGHT OF 
REVISED POLICY 
OP 4.12 
Involuntary 
Resettlement  
The objective of this policy is to (i) avoid or 
minimize involuntary resettlement where 
feasible, exploring all viable alternative 
project designs; (ii) assist displaced persons in 
improving their former living standards, 
income earning capacity, and production 
levels, or at least in restoring them; (iii) 
encourage community participation in 
planning and implementing resettlement; and 
(iv) provide assistance to affected people 
regardless of the legality of land tenure. 
This policy covers not only physical relocation, 
but also any loss of land or other assets resulting 
in: (i) relocation or loss of shelter; (ii) loss of 
assets or access to assets; (iii) loss of income 
sources or means of livelihood, whether or not 
the affected people must move to another 
location. This policy also applies to the 
involuntary restriction of access to legally 
designated parks and protected areas resulting in 
adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the 
displaced persons. 
 
Given that all sub-projects are planned and 
implemented based on decisions made by the 
communities in this regard, it is not expected 
that OP 4.12 will be triggered.
 
OP 4.37 Safety 
of Dams  
The objectives of this policy are as follows: 
For new dams, to ensure that experienced and 
competent professionals design and supervise 
construction; the borrower adopts and 
implements dam safety measures for the dam 
and associated works. For existing dams, to 
ensure that any dam that can influence the 
performance of the project is identified, a dam 
safety assessment is carried out, and necessary 
additional dam safety measures and remedial 
work are implemented. 
This policy is triggered when the Bank finances: 
(i) a project involving construction of a large 
dam (15 m or higher) or a high hazard dam; and 
(ii) a project which is dependent on an existing 
dam. For small dams, generic dam safety 
measures designed by qualified engineers are 
usually adequate. 
 
PCDP will not finance any large dams as 
described in this policy. However, given that 
90% of problems occur with regard to small 
dams, PCDP will 
–
if necessary - carry out 
generic dam safety analyses of small dams to 
ensure that sub-projects are not damaged 
due to the malfunction of such structures..
 
OP 7.50 
Projects in 
International 
Waters  
The objective of this policy is to ensure that 
Bank-financed projects affecting international 
waterways would not affect: (i) relations 
between the Bank and its borrowers and 
between states (whether members of the Bank 
or not); and (ii) the efficient utilization and 
protection of international waterways. 
 
This policy is triggered if (a) any river, canal, 
lake or similar body of water that forms a 
boundary between, or any river or body of 
surface water that flows through two or more 
states, whether Bank members or not; (b) 
any tributary or other body of surface water 
that is a component of any waterway 
described under (a); and (c) any bay, gulf 
Page  55
54
The policy applies to the following types of 
projects: (a) Hydroelectric, irrigation, flood 
control, navigation, drainage, water and 
sewerage, industrial and similar projects that 
involve the use or potential pollution of 
international waterways; and (b) Detailed 
design and engineering studies of projects 
under (a) above, include those carried out by 
the Bank as executing agency or in any other 
capacity. 
strait, or channel 
bounded by two or more 
states, or if within one state recognized as a 
necessary channel of communication between 
the open sea and other states, and any river 
flowing into such waters. 
 
PCDP has complied with this policy, and 
therefore, future sub-projects involving the 
use of water can proceed. 
OP 7.60 
Projects in 
Disputed Areas 
The objective of this policy is to ensure that 
projects in disputed areas are dealt with at the 
earliest possible stage: (a) so as not to affect 
relations between the Bank and its member 
countries; (b) so as not to affect relations 
between the borrower and neighboring 
countries; and (c) so as not to prejudice the 
position of either the Bank or the countries 
concerned. 
This policy will be triggered if the proposed 
project will be in a “disputed area”. Questions to 
be answered include: Is the borrower involved 
in any disputes over an area with any of its 
neighbors? Is the project situated in a disputed 
area? Could any component financed or likely 
to be financed as part of the project situated in a 
disputed area? 
 
PCDP will not fund any sub-projects in 
disputed areas.

Annex 10 
 
Guidance for  
Malaria prevention and vector management 
and 
Medical waste management at Public health and 
Veterinary posts 
During environmental and social screening of PCDP sub-projects 
 
As per the recommendation, PCDP contacted the respective ministries and collected the 
necessary documents. Since the documents are bulky and need the work of shortening and 
adapting to the PCDP situations, they are not attached in this list.  
 
However, they will be used in the training program and distributed to the trainees and 
PCDP/sector staffs, accordingly for application. 
 
For further reading and Application, Please contact Ministries of Agriculture 
health and rural development and respective Bureaus of Agriculture and Health 
in your region.
