the Pastoral Community Development Project\n            (PCDP). Positive and negative impacts are expected to arise.\n            Long-term poverty reduction in pastoral areas of Ethiopia is\n            closely associated with environmental sustainability, and\n            with minimizing potentially negative environmental impacts\n            of development and humanitarian aid. Disaster preparedness\n            and sustainable livelihoods among Ethiopia pastorals depend\n            directly on environmental resources: water, forage\n            resources, and their interaction with livestock. There may\n            be induced environmental impacts that occur as a result of\n            the project on local economies and society. The effects of a\n            large number of small developments may have significant\n            environmental impacts. The project will adopt mitigation\n            measures such as protection and management of natural\n            resources and drought contingency planning; training for\n            community leaders, and regional officers on the use of the\n            environmental screening and reporting system; training for\n            regional bureau officials on environmental impact\n            assessment, and the use of environmental guidelines in\n            identifying and costing mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2003-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
