The project components will: 1)\n            support the transfer of non-basic public service functions\n            to autonomous private entities, by divesting/sharing\n            activities between public and private operators, such as\n            veterinary services, commercialization of improved seeds,\n            management of slaughter houses, and/or provision of\n            technical and management services to cooperatives. A new\n            decentralized organizational structure of the MDR will be\n            designed, to realign internal policies, and management\n            systems, strengthen the regulatory framework, and, provide\n            special rural training programs; 2) strengthen the National\n            Agricultural Research System's (NARS) institutional\n            capacity, and, upgrade its scientific research capacity.\n            Applied agricultural research sub-projects will be financed,\n            and/or co-financed with other donors, while demand-driven\n            agricultural research/development subprojects will be\n            competitively funded; 3) improve sustainability of the\n            National Agricultural Extension system, through a\n            progressive decentralization to the regions, to support\n            research and development, training, and human resources\n            management activities, and, pilot extension contracting to\n            private providers; and, 4) support producer organizations,\n            by providing training, technical assistance and management\n            advice, as well as communication programs to disseminate\n            relevant technical, economic, and organizational information."}, "docdt": "2001-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
