Some lessons learned\n            included: in financing ambitious, far reaching institutional\n            reforms of ministerial departments for which political\n            commitment is paramount, a clear distinction should be made\n            between the preparation phase and the implementation phase.\n            As part of the preparation phase there is need to pay due\n            attention to political commitment and associated risks. As\n            far as implementation is concerned, there is need for a\n            clear road-map that details the operational arrangements and\n            sequencing of reforms. If the Government and donors\n            collaborate in this field, as was the case under this\n            project, transformational achievements are possible. For\n            agricultural services projects, special attention needs to\n            be given to introduce and/or strengthen a permanent in house\n            economic analysis capacity inside the research and extension\n            organizations. This capacity building support should enable\n            these organizations to carry out prospective impact studies\n            of different specific research and extension activities that\n            can guide their efforts towards the ones that are likely to\n            have the highest economic returns and social payoff. The\n            privatization of agricultural extension and the public\n            funding for private agricultural service delivery based on\n            contracts is a long term process and needs to be conceived\n            as such. Including an emergency fund for natural calamities\n            is sensible, as the risk of occurrence of such events is\n            high, and as it allows International Development Association\n            (IDA) to be of assistance immediately when the need is highest."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
