The Project would expand its\n            activities in the field of technology transfer to achieve\n            more tangible results and increase its impact on the ground.\n            No change is proposed to the Project development objective\n            or implementation modalities.

The\n            objective of the Project is to establish an institutional\n            framework conducive to efficient agricultural service\n            delivery to producers through the provision of support to\n            core public service decentralization, promotion of private\n            sector participation and empowerment of producer\n            organizations.
