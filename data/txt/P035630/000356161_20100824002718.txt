1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Poverty situation in Mali. According to a study carried out in 1998, 72 percent of
Mali's population lived below the poverty line and the incidence of poverty was three
times higher in rural than in urban areas. Ac celerated grow th of the agricultural sector
was considered a priority to reduce poverty.    Consequently, Mali's poverty reduction
strategy (2002-2006) was based on the develo pment of hum an capital and broad based
economic growth that needed to accelerate from 5-6 percent a year in 2002 to 7 percent in
2006.

2.       Constraints to rural development. In Mali, the sector with the highest potential for
growth in employment and income is the agricultural sector. 80 percent of the population
is rural and the sector employs about 80 percen t of the total labor fo rce, contributes 45
percent to GDP, and accounts for 75 percent           of export earnings. Principal causes of
poverty in rural areas are: (i ) low agricultural pr oductivity and producti on due to natural
resources constraints; (ii) di fficult a ccess to loc al and in ternational m arkets; ( iii) weak
agricultural serv ices (agricultura l res earch and ex tension) and weak producer
organizations; ( iv) wea k public in stitutions an d polic ies that discr iminate ag ainst the
sector; and (v) limited access to social services and physical and social infrastructure.

3.       Government actions to address these constraints.           In October 2000, the
Government revised its long-term          rural developm ent plan ( Schéma Directeur du
Développement Rural) and developed a new Action Plan for the ne             xt decade, which
emphasized the f ollowing priorities: (i) improving the m anagement and conservation of
natural resources to promote sustainable gr owth ; (ii) im proving the provision of basic
rural inf rastructure: (iii) ref ocusing the Mi nistry of Rural Developm ent (MDR) on core
public service functions; (iv) strengthening MDR's capacity to deliver its core functions;
(v) str engthening the e fficiency and sustainab ility of agricultu ral se rvices; and (vi)
strengthening the capacity of producer organizations (POs).

4.      Rationale for Bank ass istance. The Bank playe d a ca talytic role in he lping the
Government throughout the preparation of        the PASAOP by: (a) assisting it in the
development of an overall coherent rural development policy and strategy, (b) associating
intensively all other donors; and (c) involving systematic      ally and proactively the
beneficiaries in the preparation process. It was expected that this would augur well for
program implementation and would help MD R to regain control ove r externally funded
projects. IDA particip ation in this long-term institu tion building effort through an
adaptable lending program was al so considered needed gi ven that other donors had
difficulties to comm it their resources for long term purposes. Through the project, the
Bank also expected to assist the Borrower to create synergy through a m ore effe ctive
coordination of all donors intervening in the ru ral sector. L ast, but not least, given its
involvement and experience in m any sim ilar operations in W est-Africa, IDA was
expected to be well placed to prov ide and mobilize the needed technical, managerial, and
policy advice.

5.     The overall objective of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY09- 01
for Mali was the reduction of poverty. It   was structured around two m ajor axes: (i)
sustainable human development; and (ii) stab le economic growth through private sector

                                               1
development. The CAS put particular em phasis on supporting com petitive, broad-based
growth in the rural sector because of the overwhelming prevalence of extreme poverty in
rural areas, but also because the rural econom y was considered to rem ain the country's
main engine for broad-based growth. Key ar eas of focus in the CAS included capacity
building, decentralization, protection of the environment, and gender issues.

6.      In the agricultural sector, the Bank sought to support m ajor institutional reforms
and investments in social capital. It realized that this agenda required long-term support.
Therefore, the Agricultural Serv ices and Produ cer Organization Project (Projet d'Appui
aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations Paysannes ­ PASAOP) was designed as the
first phase of an 11-year Adaptable Program Loan (APL) consisting of three phases (3, 4
and 4-year period) and bringing together ag      ricultural se rvices (ag ricultural res earch,
extension and support to farmers' organizations).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.       The original PDO, as specified in the PAD, was        "to establish an institutional
framework conducive to the efficient delivery of agricultural services to producers." To
achieve this PDO, the project had four interdependent sub-objectives to be pursued under
four components: (a) MDR Refor m: Rationalization and Modernization (Com ponent A);
(b) Im proving the efficiency, relevance and su stainability of the Natio nal Agricu ltural
Research System (Component B); (c) Im             proving the efficiency, relevance and
sustainability of the Nationa l Agric ultural Exte nsion Serv ices Com ponent C); an d (d)
Support to Producer Organizatio ns ability to provide se          rvices to their m embers
(Component D). The Development Credit Agreement indicated that "the objective of the
Project is to assist the Borro wer in alleviating rural poverty through m easures designed
to: (a) sustain productivity in creases in agricultural and no n-agricultural activities; and
(b) strengthen the institutional framework to carry out the Borrower's agricultural reform
program including: (i) capacity building in MDR and public agricultural service agencies;
(ii) pilo ting the tr ansfer of extension activ ities to the pr ivate s ector in f ive of the
Borrower's regions; and (iii) improving the           effectiveness of private agricultural
producer's associations."

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.      The project was granted an Additional Financing (AF) a mounting to SDR 13.3
million (US$20 m illion equivalen t). This AF a pproved on April 30, 2007, intended to
allow for th e scaling-up of institutional reforms undertaken successfully during project
implementation so f ar, particula rly in te rms of i mprovement of agronom ic research
performance, prom otion of dem and-driven extension services, and empowerm ent of
producer organizations. Project design rem ained basically the same and the original four
components were not changed. However, the AF put m ore emphasis on the introduction
of scaled-up technology transfer initiatives to increase the impact of Project activities on
the ground. The underlying rationale for this w as to dem onstrate how the collaboration
developed between research, extension and PO s as developed under the original Project
could be translated into tangible improvement of productivity and farmers' incomes

9.      The PDO was neither revised during the m id-term review in January 2005 nor at
the tim e when the AF was put in place     in April 2007. However, key perform ance

                                              2
indicators were revised at midterm review; they were narrowed down and m ade more
specific and results-oriented. Before the AF was approved, the originally agreed triggers
for phase 2 of the APL were evaluated to       assess whether they had been achieved and
targets were revised to reflect the additional results and effects expected from the AF. A
new set of indicators was added to specifically monitor and capture the additional outputs
and outcomes expected through the proposed         scaled-up activities under the AF (see
Annex 2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     Through the introduction and diffusion of improved agricultural technologies over
the whole country, the Project, as stated in th e Project Appraisal Docum ent (PAD), was
expected to benefit directly about 450,000 rural families, including vulnerable groups and
women far mers. In addition, 2,500 producer organizations with 50,000 m embers at the
national, regional and local level were expect ed to benefit from proj ect interventions.
Furthermore, the country's agricultural resear chers and extension agents as well as civil
servants of the Min istries dealing with agri culture were targeted to receive degrees an d
in-service training under the Project. Fina      lly, input suppliers,   local traders and
transporters were expected to indirectly benefit from increased agricultural production
and trade.

1.5 Original Components

11.      The project had four components at the appraisal stage:

      A. MDR ­Reform: Rationalization and Modernization (US$15.5 million ­ additional
         financing: US$4.9 million). This com ponent had several sub-com ponents: (i)
         sharing and/or transfer of non-basic publ       ic service functions to autonom ous
         and/or private entities; (i i) de centralization and st rengthening of MDR's basic
         public services; (iii) strengthening      of MDR's policy formulation, planning,
         statistics, and m onitoring and evaluation functions; (iv) stre ngthening of MDR' s
         Direction of Administration and F inance; (v) special programs: the rural train ing
         program, the rural com munication program , the AIDS prevention program and
         provisions for a rural disaster preventi on and em ergency assistance program ; and
         (vi) project coordination unit.
      B. Improving the efficiency, relevance, and sustainability of the National
         Agricultural Research System - NARS (US$8.7 m illion ­ additional financing :
         US$6.4 million). This com ponent had four sub-components: (i) strength ening of
         NARS research m anagement capacity; (i i) upgrading and maintaining the NARS
         research scientific capacity ; (iii) funding of strategic and applied research sub-
         projects; and (iv) competitive funding of demand-driven Agricultural research and
         development sub-projects.
      C. Improving the efficiency, relevance, and sustainability of the National
         Agricultural Extension System (US$18.0 m illion ­ addition al financing : US$3.1
         million). This com ponent had th ree s ub-components: (i) streng thening and
         regionalization of extension services; (ii) pilot extension prog ram for contracting
         extension to private providers of exte       nsion servic es; an d (iii) con tracts for
         agricultural support services in cotton areas.
      D. Support to producer organizations (US$9.2 m illion ­ addition al financing:
         US$5.6 m illion) This com ponent had thr ee su b-components: (i) s trengthening

                                                3
       national associations and     regional unions capabilitie s; (ii) prom otion and
       strengthening of private advi sory services prov iders; and (iii) strengthening local
       and regional POs through demand-driven agricultural advisory service grants.

1.6 Revised Components (after restructuring)

12.    There was no restructuring

1.7 Other significant changes

13.     In 2004, to respond to the Government's re quest to support the fight against the
desert locus t outbreak, a rea llocation of the Credit p roceeds was appro ved to allocate
US$2 million equivalent for the purchase of aerial treatments, equipment and vehicles.

14.     The project has not be form ally restructured, but, although the project had been
conceived as the first phase of an 11-year APL, during CAS discussions in October 2006
it was decided not to continue the APL route and not to initiate the second phase but
rather to consolidate the Bank's agricultural and rural development projects in Mali. No
changes were m ade to the project deve       lopment objective, project com ponents or
implementation m odalities. The p roject resu lts f ramework was revised to ref lect the
increased development benefits expected from the AF (see Annex 2).

15.      In 2005 and 2006, the closing date of        the project was extended. T he first
extension in 2005 was justified by delays that occurred in commencing and implementing
institutional reforms, mainly due to the fact that in 2004 the MDR was split into five new
entities: the Ministry o f Agricultu re (MA) , t he M inistry of Li vestock and Fisheries
(MLF), the Ministry of Environment and         Sanitation ( MES), the Min istry of W omen
Affairs, and the Food Security Comm issariat. This happened as a result of the June 2002
elections of a new Pre sident and Parliam ent. A period of institution al instab ility and
frequent personnel changes ensued. As             a consequence, the subcomponent
"decentralization and strengthen ing of MDR' s basic public services'' was delayed , as
public f unctions had to be re-ana lyzed and re-as sessed in light of the new institu tional
framework and applied to five entities. The second extension in 2006 (until December 31,
2007) was granted because in IDA's view           chances of successfully achieving the
institutional reforms sought by the project had greatly improved, as responsibility for this
component was transferred from the Institu tional Reform Support Unit inside the new
Ministry of Agriculture (MA) to th e Inst itutional Developm ent Comm issariat (CDI) , a
unit under the direct supervision of the Ministère de la Fonction Publique. Also, this
second extension was m eant to gi ve addition al tim e to project stak eholders to draw
lessons from the innovative approaches prom           oted a mongst research institutions,
extension providers and POs, and to allow tim e for puttin g in place the AF. A final
extension was granted during the im plementation phase of t he AF from June 30, 2009 t o
December 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.    Referring to the ICR Guidelines (p p. 31; OPCS, August 2006 and updated on
2/9/2007), the analysis includes lessons  learned, project objec tives and com ponents
organization, government's commitment. The project as designed sought to support the
                                             4
implement of the reform s adopted by the government in 1996 aim ing at m odernizing
most of the institutions in th e agricultural sector allowing a new distribution of roles and
responsibilities between the public and private sector.

17.     As stated earlier, the proliferation of small, uncoordinated donor-financed projects
has in the past overtaxed MDR'        s sector management capacity, leading to parallel
implementation arrangem ents (Rur al Developm ent Agencies), insufficient coun terpart
funds, and contradictory philosophies and appr oaches to developm ent. The Government
organized a Donor Coordination Committee to ensure coherence and com plementarities
in the vario us programs in the rur al secto r. Also, institu tion building objectiv es and
sustainability were usually not obtained given the short duration of t ypical projects. This
approach has been replaced in the prepara tion of this program and pr oject, th rough a
more consolidated approach with a much longer time horizon. The main lessons from the
ongoing or recently completed IDA-financed rela ted projects, i.e. the National Research
Project, and the Agricultural Services Project are as follows:

       National Agricultural Research Program (PNRA): Although som                        e
       improvements have been made in the piloting of user participation at national and
       regional lev els through the creatio n of the National Committee of Users of
       Research Results (CNU) and Na tional Comm ittee of Use rs of Researc h Results
       (CRUs), the impact of research on agricultural development remained insufficient
       because of: (i) th e still lim ited particip atory process for research d esign and
       testing; and , (ii) poo r accountab ility to p roducers. In ad dition, a nu mber of
       organizational and management issues remain unresolved under that project: (i) a
       civil service attitude and lack of a p erformance review and reward system based
       on resul ts; ( ii) lack of com petition for resear ch program proposals a nd am ong
       research in stitutions; a nd (iii) an overex tended networ k of inf rastructures
       (experimental stations and laboratories) that cannot be maintained adequately; and
       (iv) weak performance for financial and accounting management.

       National Agricultural Extension Program (PNVA): The fundamental weakness
       of the Agricultu ral Ser vices Proje ct was its institutional set-up: (i) lack of
       accountability of extension agents to         producers and insufficient use of
       participatory diagnosis, programm ing a nd evaluation m ethods; (ii) insufficient
       supervision and technical back-up of        front-line extension workers by subject
       matter spec ialists and nation al a nd region al extens ion m anagers; and ( iii)
       insufficient attention to vulnerable groups and in particular wom en producers'
       needs. In addition, the beneficiary       assessment done for the Im plementation
       Completion and Results Report ( ICR) of this projec t em phasized th at the way
       extension agents established and worked with "contact groups" was problem atic.
       One major weakness was that extension ag ents were not paying enough attention
       to the already existing comm unity associations or producer organizations and not
       working through them in setting up their con tact groups. A review of the Bank' s
       experience in agricultural technology generation and tr ansfer, as documented by
       Operations Evaluation Departm ent (O ED) evalu ations, ind icates that th e
       following elem ents are im portant for success: (i) ) user ownership and
       participation for priority settings, planning and monitoring, as well as financing, is
       crucial; (ii) a single m odel cannot be de signed for global application, pluralism
       and com petition am ong services pro viders (pub lic, private, nonprofit, and non-
       governmental sectors) im prove the effici ency of the system ; (iii) g eneration,

                                             5
       transfer and adoption of technologies is a continuum (the -9- linear model of
       technology generation and transfer found        in a large percentage of national
       research an d tran sfer system s, has show n its lim itations in particular vis- à-vis
       farmer participation in pl anning and priority setting, and research-extension
       linkages) w ithin an in tegrated Knowle dge and Inform ation System ; and (iv)
       success and sustainability of development programs require commitment for long-
       term endeavor towards social capita       l building through     organizational and
       technical training of user groups and       community-based organizations. These
       lessons from previous projects have been incorporated into the project design.

18.      Nevertheless, there were three b asic wea knesses in the project preparation and
design. First, the project was prepared as if it was a sector investm ent program where
there is no need to prepare and define proj ect components in detail. Consequently, Annex
2 ("Detailed Project Description") in the PAD is very general and includes dozens of
important activities that are s tated in the f orm of a headline and hardly any subsequent
elaboration of their con tent. Secon d, the PAD assum ed that the institution al cha nges
introduced in the MDR in the late 1990s ha d broad support within the Governm ent and
that there w as a strong comm itment to syst ematically pursue their im plementation. It
considered the r isk of institution al sustai nability as m oderate. Unfortunately, this
assumption was incorrect. Although the broa          d thrust of the administrative refor   m
(redefinition of roles for the pub lic and priv ate secto r and decentraliza tion) was ne ver
challenged, after the presid ential elections in 2002, the         MDR was split into five
Ministries and achievem ent of the key orig inal objec tives of : (a) dec entralizing M DRs
core activities, and (b ) redeploying and reduc ing staff becam e more difficult, esp ecially
with regard to the country's extension service. No longer was there a unified extension
service for crops, livestock and forestry, but rather separate extension services m anaged
independently by each newly created Ministry. In hindsight, it is clear that the difficulties
involved in im plementing institutional reform s seem to have been underestim ated. This
reorganization was to h appen with in the cons traints of a civil se rvice h iring freeze and
within the lim its of civil service pay restrictions.        At the sam e tim e governm ent
commitment was not fully assured and Mini sterial staff was oppos ing a reorganization
that would have m eant a potential staff re trenchment and redeploym ent from the capital
to the regions. Third, the PDO wa s defined in very broad and vaguely worded term s
while the corresponding key perform ance indicat ors lacked sufficient detail. W hile the
lack of precision in the PDO probably re         flected the project's overall em phasis on
institutional change, it precludes a m eaningful evaluation o f project achievem ents based
the wording of the PDO that was adopted during the preparation stage. Likewise, the key
performance indicators in the PAD were very general, overly numerous and parts of them
were too vaguely f ormulated, not s ufficiently r esults-oriented or too institu tional to be
easily measured.

2.2 Implementation

19.     The project can be separated into three dist inct phases. The first phase covers the
period from effectiveness to the mid-term review in January 2005 during which the
project suffered significant star t-up delays and slow disbur sements. The locust invasion
of 2004 significantly affected project im plementation as all governm ent resources had to
be used to fight this calam ity. During th is period the im plementation of com ponent A
was under the responsibility of C ARI inside MDR as in stitutional refor m, especially
decentralization of government services, was not yet a preoccupation of the Govern ment

                                             6
as a whole. W hen the Governm ent in 2004 started to s plit MDR into 5 Min istries, a
special Bank m ission visited the country to analyze the consequences. This m ission,
backed up by Bank managem ent, cam e to the c onclusion that it would be unwise to
suspend disbursements under this com ponent or to eliminate it as, (a) this would have a
negative im pact on the pace of im plementation of the other com ponents, and (b ) there
was no fundam ental change in the reform ag enda per se (decen tralization of service
provision and redefinition of roles of MDR vi s-à-vis the private sector). The second
phase covers the period from m id-term review to the tim e the AF was put in plac e in
April 2007. The m id-term review was used to modify the legal docum ents in or der to
account for the changed institutional set-up as a result of the Governm ents' decision to
split MDR into f ive separate Ministries. By tha t time the new Governm ent had decided
on a far reaching institutional developm ent program for the whole of th e administration
(all Ministries) and the Bank team judged that the transfer of res ponsibility from CARI
inside MDR to CDI under the Ministère de la Fonction Publique would give new impetus
to reform . CDI was m andated to carry ou t an overall reform of all governm ent
departments and the ongoing reorganization of the Ministries dealing with agricu lture
was to serve as an example. During this period, performance under components B and C,
and especially Com ponent D continuously im proved, as farm ers and their organizations
deepened their collaboration with re gional and n ational agricultural chambers. The th ird
phase of implem entation corre sponds with the AF from April 2007 onwards to project
closing. During this period, the effort was de voted to technology transf er and adoption
and the empower ment of POs. This im           proved greatly technol ogy transfer and
achievements of results on the ground.

20.    During project im plementation, several prob lems were reiterated in the Bank's
Implementation and Status Results Reports (ISRs): (a) serious delays in obtaining project
counterpart funds, especially from 2006 onw ards, (b) weak m onitoring and evaluation
system, and (c) absence of som e key studies to evaluate projec t achievem ents and to
formulate a National Agricultural Extension System (NAES).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

21.     In the PAD, the design of the m onitoring and evaluation (M&E) system probably
was not sufficiently adjusted for this kind of pr oject that is exp ected to produce many
outputs and outcomes, including those that are relatively hard to measure and to quantify.
The project design summary is rather          complex with too m any vaguely defined
performance indicators. The PDO itself, as sp ecified in the PAD, is too vaguely wo rded
to allow for meaningful evaluation. Triggers for the initially planned second phase of the
APL should have been used as the key pe         rformance indicators; however they were
reformulated and added to a long list of perfor      mance indicators. The PAD did not
systematically specify b aseline and target values f or s elected pe rformance indicators.
Also the ex isting hum an and institu tional c apacity f or M&E in the d ifferent ex ecuting
agencies and the Project Coordination Un it (PCU) was not adequately assessed and
consequently insufficient capacity building measures for implem entation were included
at the outset.

22.    However, during project im plementation, the M&E system was i mproved. In
preparation of the m id-term review, through a series of technical assistance missions, the
M&E system was revised and a m ore clearly defined results fram ework with baseline
data and measurable impact indicators was drawn up. In preparation of the AF, a new set

                                             7
of indicators was added to specifically m onitor and capture the additional outputs and
outcomes expected th rough the scaled-up activ ities. W hile the M&E system during the
last project im plementation support m ission was judged as satisfactory, it nevertheless
still faced som e challen ges in the areas of the analysis of adoption and diffusion of
agricultural technologies promoted by the project and the analysis of social impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23.      Environmental safeguard policies. The project was classif ied as environm ental
category B which requ ired a p artial ass essment. Several m easures were included to
ensure a system atic environm ental screeni ng of far m activities and to m ake producers
aware of the environmental consequences and opportunities associated with their farming
operations. Extension agents were trained on topics such as integrated pest m anagement,
soil fertility, water m anagement, soil erosion, and overgrazing. The monitoring of the
environmental im pact w as carried o ut by the Ministry in charge of the Environm ent,
whose rep resentative was a m ember of the St eering Comm ittee of the project. Several
field missions were carried out to verify a dherence to sound environm ental management
practices. A plan to deal with the stock of obsolete pesticides has also been developed
and is being implemented.

24.     Vulnerable Groups Special Initiative. A specific gender assessm ent study was
carried out during project preparatio n. It iden tified women's lack of access to exten sion
advice, and m ore specifically to technica l recomm endations for products like fruits,
vegetables, fish m arketing, and s mall livesto ck, which are m ainly the responsibility of
women, as a critical issue. During project execution, the gender dimension was taken into
account, but no fe male extension agents could be hired since there was a hiring freeze in
the public sector. Under com ponent D, depending on the regions, between 17-66 percent
of micro-projects belonged to women.

25.    Procurement is rated satisfactory in the final ISR. Apart from weaknesses in
procurement planning, procurem ent plans we re regularly updated and discussed with
IDA, and IDA procurement guidelines were strictly followed.

26.     Financial management is rated moderately satisfactory in the final ISR. With
exception of the 2008 audit report, project a udits were alw ays on tim e and unqualified.
During 2008 there was a sm all amount of in eligible expenditures and bottlenecks still
exist in justifying advance accounts to executing agencies at the regional level and delays
in releasing counterpart funds, especially after 2006. Alth ough counterpart funds in the
end were always contributed, they cam e with significant delays (up to 15 m onths) and
slowed down project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

27.     This pro ject (PASAOP) will be f ollowed up by the: "Fostering Agricultural
Productivity Project: FAPP" which was approve d in FY10. This new operation has the
objective to increase the produc tivity of sm allholder produ cers in targeted production
systems and project areas of intervention. It builds on the legacy of PASAOP a nd its
achievements, namely: (i) stronger POs; (ii) a better technology generation m echanism;
and (iii) m ore efficien t advisory services . Following PASAOP, the emphasis of FAPP
remains on using com petitive research f unding and on expanding and strengthening the

                                             8
network of private service providers, and on helping POs develop their own expertise and
service networks. FAPP also includes funding for defining the framework for a national
extension system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

28.     In line with ICR Guidelines (pp. 31; OPCS, August 2006 and updated on
2/9/2007), the project's objectiv es were and rem ain highly relevant. T he developm ent
objectives of PASAOP (to establish an institutional framework conducive to the efficient
delivery of agricultural services to producer s) are re levant with Ma li's Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy Fram ework (GPR SF) for 2007-2011 that prioritizes food
security and raising the incom es of rura l p roducers throu gh increas ing, securing and
diversifying food production. In 2006, thanks to the support of the project, the G oM
adopted the Loi d'Orientation Agricole (LOA) intended to spearhead modernization of
the sector and increased value addition. PA        SAOP's past objectives are also very
consistent with the Bank's current Country A ssistance Strategy (CAS; 2007-11) that
places ag riculture as one of the three key sectors to drive econom     ic growth and the
GoM's overall development priority which emphasize high priority on agriculture.

29.     The strateg ic shift tow ards decentralizat ion of the departm ents dealing with
agriculture and their focus on regulatory, policy-making and monitoring functions and the
concomitant streng thening of the private secto r through s upport to P Os constitu tes a
paradigm shif t. This str ategic shif t rem ains equally high ly relev ant as it rem ains f ully
consistent with the country's current developm ent priorities and the Bank's country
assistance s trategy. Thes e orientatio ns will continue to be supported un der the recently
approved FAPP.

30.      The project design brought together the necessary elements for m odernizing the
agricultural sector and f or promoting a science based agricu lture. The multi-s takeholder
financing m echanisms for com petitive rese arch grants, for contracting of private
extension services, and for grants for m icro-projects of POs were effi cient in alloca ting
funds to activities that were relevant and consistent with the needs of producers and their
interests. These m echanisms fost ered di alogue, partnership a nd collaboration among
institutions and ensured stronger coordi     nation in the field. Through the Bank's
implementation assistance, the financing mechanisms became more and more refined and
allowed a greater focus on strateg ic activ ities that have a high payoff. Finally, the
emphasis on strengthening POs as a way to im prove the responsiveness of the extension
and research system to farmers' needs and expectations was right on target.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

31.     The orig inal PDO as s pecified in the PAD was to       establish an ins titutional
framework conducive to the efficient delivery     of agricultural serv ices to producers.
Considering that the PDO is so vaguely word ed as to preclude a meaningful evaluation,
and in line with ICR Guidelines (pp. 31; OPCS, August 2006 and updated on 2/9/2007)
the assessment of PDO achievem ent in this c ase is inf erred from key associa te outcome
targets as defined at the com ponent level. To achieve its overall PDO, the project (see
PAD, table on pages 5 and 6) had four m        ain interdependent project developm ent

                                               9
objectives to be pursued under four com ponents: a) MDR restructured and strengthened
(Component A); b) i mproved relevance and effectiveness of the National Agricultural
Research S ystem (Component B); c) im proved the relevance and e ffectiveness of the
National Agricultural E xtension Services (Com ponent C); and d) strengthening of POs'
ability to provide serv ices to their m embers (Component D). It is noted that the project
description in the Credit Agreem ent largely reflects these four di mensions of the PDO as
stated above. Also, the project had a set of triggers to be ac hieved in order to pass fro m
the first phase of the AP L to the second phase , which provide additi onal detail about the
achievement of Project Development Objectiv es. Ach ievement of these triggers is
presented in Annex 211a and the full set of       detailed project developm ent outcome
indicators are given in Annex 211b.

Achievement of the four main project development objectives is as follows:

32.     Objective 1: reorient/restructure/decentralize and strengthen MDR
(Component A). Achievement of this objective is rated moderately unsatisfactory. MA's
focus has been reoriented towards functions that only the public sector can provide.
Several services previously provided by the MA were transf erred to the private s ector:
veterinary services and arti ficial insemination; the produc tion and com mercialization of
improved seeds and seedlings; the m anagement of slaughter houses/areas. Other services
such as agricultural extension advisory se rvices have becom e a joint responsibility
between the public and private sector; and the management of natural resources is in the
process of being transferred to local communities. The rationalization and modernization
of public services, the strengthe ning of technical capacity, the formulation of agricultural
policies and investm ent programs and the restru cturing of the cotton sector were carried
out as planned.

33.      Also, the project m ade progress toward th e restructuring and decentralization of
first the MDR and later on the f ive ministerial departments that resulted from the spit up
of MDR in 2004 (MA, MLF MES, Ministry               of Wom en Affairs, and Food Sec urity
Secretary). All the ne cessary studies concerning personne l needs and staff availability,
job descriptions, organizational charts, and training needs assessm ents were carried out.
However, due to the political decision in 2004 to create five Ministries to deal with the
agricultural sector rath er th an one and due to the lengthy approval process for such
governmental reorganizations that involves th e Presidency and Parliam ent, the a ctual
transfer of staff to their new positio ns and the training for their new po sts after 8 y ears
has not yet started. This was a trigge r that was not fulfilled at the time of the approval of
the AF and at the clos ing of the projec t is still outstand ing. Neverth eless, th e MDR
reorganization is the most advanced a nd the m ethodology and process developed are
utilized by the other m inistries. T he legal texts have been adjus ted and foresee that
implementation of th is reform will take pl ace, thereby indic ating the commitment of the
Government of Mali (G oM) to this. The GoM has started preparing a t riennial plan for
the decen tralization of m inistries. Also, PO s, which have beneficiated from         strong
institutional support under the Project, contin ue to make strong demands that GoM move
forward on this agenda. It is because of its unfinished nature and the lon g delays in the
modernization and decentralization process       that the com ponent is rated m oderately
unsatisfactory. For m ore detailed outputs, see Annex 2, Table 212 (Original Credit) and
IOI-1 and 2 in Table 2.2.2. (AF).



                                             10
34.     Objective 2: improve the relevance and effectiveness of the National
Agricultural Research System (Component B). Achievement of this o bjective is rated
satisfactory.
For more details on outputs, see Annex 2, Table12 (Original Credit) and IOI-4 to IOI-8 in
Table 222 (AF). Throughout project im plementation, the NARS and its com ponents
(Rural Econom y Institute ­ IER; Centra        l Ve terinary La boratory ­ LC V, Rural
Polytechnic Institu te of Katibougo u and NGOs) and research comm ittees th at include
representatives of extension and far mers, have been w orking properly and in full
concordance with their m andates and rules. The research system is now orien ted to meet
the techno logy needs of producers (see IOI-4 and IOI-7 in Annex 222). A com petitive
research fund to finance (see IOI-6 to IOI-8 in Annex 222) all research projects has been
put in place and is financed by all donors     supporting agricultural research. The sam e
mechanism for financing the dem and-driven re search and extens ion is utilized by th e
West Africa Agricultural Productivity Pr ogram (W AAPP). The quality and output of
research has i mproved to the point where the Government has increased its financing of
the core functions of IER. Thanks to the p erformance c ontract signed with IER, the
Government allocates yearly CFA 1.5 billion to IER. In addition, a long term financing
plan for IER is under preparation at the request of the Prime Minister. A long-term vision
and im plementation strategy for agricultural re search in M ali is has been prepared and
adopted. Where there is scope for improvem ent is in the area of economic analysis. The
NARS as well as the N AES needs to integ rate ex-ante economic analysis in the research
and extension process in order to appraise th e sustainability and oppor tunities of specific
agricultural research and extension programs.

35.     Objective 3: improve the relevance and effectiveness of the National
Agricultural Extension Services (Component C). Achie vement of this objectiv e is
rated moderately satisfactory. A m ajor innovation was succe ssfully introduced with the
establishment of an ef ficient, r esponsive and p artially pr ivatized agr icultural adv isory
service system through the regi onalization and decentraliza tion of extension prog rams
and budgets (see Annex 2, Table 212) with incr eased producer participation in the design
and management of extension programs. Extension programs are no longer elaborated at
the central level and dissem inated through a top-down structur e of extension agents. On
the contrary , extension needs are identif ied with communities ba sed o n participa tory
diagnoses of village po tential and constraints. Ninety percen t of public extension agents
(720 agents) during 2005-07 carrie d out their work on the basi s of performance contracts
between the agent and the m ayor of a comm unity representing the farmers. In five pilot
regions and in the cotton area, the delivery of demand-driven extension services has been
successfully im plemented under 294 contract s with 70 private extension providers.
According to the in Econom ic and Financia l Analysis Annex 3: (i) the im              pact of
extension recommendations on farmers' yields was m easured for selected technologies
and benef iciaries and ha s been generally in the 10-70 perce nt range (m illet 50 perc ent,
maize 67 percent, peanuts 30 percent, and so rghum 60 percent); (ii) yield increases for
cowpeas and goat m ilk more than doubled and incom es increased significantly. In view
of the creation of five ministerial departments dealing with agriculture instead of one, and
each trying to set-up its own extension orga nization, the available long term vision and
implementation strategy for agricultural extension in Mali n eeds to be up dated to r eflect
this change in institu tional set-up o f the sect or. Sustainab le financing of extension will
be a key issue and will have       to be addressed under the      Loi d'Orientation Agricole
(LOA)/Agricultural Framework Law of 2006. I n view of the fact that presently there are
uncertainties about the future funding and m anagement of e xtension and that there is no

                                             11
NAES and no strategy in place com parable to the one for agricu ltural res earch, the
component has been rated m oderately sati sfactory. For more details on outputs, see
Annex 2, Table 212 (Original Credit) and IOI-9 to IOI-13 in Table 222 (AF).

36.     Objective 4: strengthen POs' ability to provide services to their members
(Component D). Achie vement of this objec tive is rated satisfactory. Detailed o utputs
are provided in Annex 2, Table 212 (Original Credit) and IOI-14 to IOI-18 in Table 222
(AF). The m ain objective of this com ponent, namely to improve the ability of P Os to
provide services to their m embers and to m ake their voice heard in the decision-making
processes for for mulating and implem enting local, regional and national rural
development policies and in particular, re       search and extension activities, has been
achieved. The Cham ber of Agricu lture at the nationa l (APCAM) a nd regional level as
well as POs have become more visible and have gained in credibility with their members.
This has enabled them to develop partnerships with other a ctors, including international
donors who increasingly finance projects destin ed for farm er organi zations. It also
enabled th em to inf luence the Agricu ltural Fr amework Law that was published on
September 5, 2006. Also, the grant m          echanism to support m icro-projects of far mer
organizations is functioning well and covers the whole country. US$ 6.75 m illion were
disbursed for som e 2,500 m icro-projects be nefitting 50,000 m embers. The capacity of
APCAM and Regional Cha mbers of Agriculture (CRAs) has im proved significantly (see
IOI-16 and IOI-18 in Annex 2, Table 222). Howeve r, in order to be able to carry out
economic and technical analysis for these micro-projects, capacity of APCAM and CRAs
will ne ed to be f urther streng thened. This will r equire hir ing of bette r trained staf f and
can only be done to the extent that the AP CAM improves its capacity to generate own
resources. It is for this last reason that th e component is not rated as highly satisfactory
but as satisfactory.

37.    At the appraisal of the AF in 2007, th      e achievem ent of project triggers was
reviewed. At that time, out     of 11 triggers, 6 were comp leted and 4 were partially
completed, among which: 3 on Component A (MDR restructured and strengthened) and 1
on Com ponent B (im proved relevance and ef fectiveness o f the National Agricultural
Research Sy stem). All targets for research programs, de mand-driven extension services
and capacity building activities for producer organizations were met, or even exceeded in
some cases. See Annex 2, Table 211a for details.

3.3 Efficiency

38.     The cost-benefit analys is carried out at appraisal and at the tim e of the AF was
updated at the ICR stage. As th en, it focuses on the return s from the investm ents under
Component B ("Im proving the efficiency, rele vance and sustainability of the NARS")
and com ponent C ("Improving the efficiency,         relevance, and sustainability of the
NAES"). More spec ifically, the an alysis estimates th e re turns f rom: (i) inc reased crop
production due to the diffusion of technologies and better agronomic practices in several
regions of Mali, (ii) increased production of m ilk due to the introduction of improved
small rum inants with basic husband ry practices and, (iii) increas ed production of m eat
due to the introduction of i mproved poultry wi th basic husbandry practices. The project
also generated a number of important externalities under component A ("MDR Refor m")

institutional framework, the present analysis assesses partly the efficiency of the project.

39.    The results of the econom ic and financia l analysis are detailed in Annex 3.
Overall, the results show that the PASAOP pr oject is economically attractive, with sound
IRRs which are significantly higher than th e opportunity cost of capital, both for the
Original Financing (22.8 percent) and th e Additional Financing (38 and 39 percent for
the FRR and ERR respectively). T he sensitivity analysis also suggests that the project
appears robust against: (i) som e deterioration in yields, (ii) som e delays in the adoption
of technologies; and (i ii) unfavorable price m ovements. Returns at completion are, in the
baseline scenario, slightly less than those expected at appraisal (where a 27.3 percent IRR
was assumed in the PAD for the original credit).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

40.     Overall project ou tcomes are rated as moderately satisfactory. Since the overall
PDO is very broad and vaguely for         mulated, for evalu ation pu rposes the specific
dimensions of the PDO were used as defi        ned at the component level. These four
dimensions of the PDO that were discusse d above constitute a re levant package of
interventions to bring about     sustained technical and instit utional change in Mali's
agriculture and thereby contributing to increasing rural incomes. They are interdependent
and m utually reinforcing. They were pursued under four com ponents of sim ilar size in
terms of expenditures. Consequently, it m akes sense to give equal weight to each
objective. The result is an overall score of 3.25 or m oderately satisfactory (see Table 4
below).

  As assumed in the PAD of the Original Financing, no significant price distortions were used to calcu late
the economic rate of return of the Initial Credit; consequently, the financial rate of return (FRR) is equal to
the economic rate of return (ERR)

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

41.      The support to producer organizations from the local to the regional and national
level has enabled them to becom       e an effe ctive partner vis -à-vis governm ent and
international donor agencies in m atters related to rural development. A good example for
this in creased voice of the fa rming community was the prepar ation of the Agricultural
Orientation Law published on September 5, 2006 which was strongly influenced by the
National Chamber of Agriculture and POs it represents. In addition, thanks to the demand
of POs, a National Agriculture Day has been instituted. Furthermore, a total of 2,500 sub-
projects was financed by the project and benefited 50,000 beneficiaries of which 15,000
(30 percent) were wom en. Depe nding on the region, the l proportion of wom             en
beneficiaries from the project ranged betw een 29 and 61 percent. An im pact study
performed by Mahieu (2009) highlighted that PASAOP also benefited vulnerable groups:
53 percent of projects' be neficiaries under component D were wom en (3292 wom en),
and the youth have enjoyed new local em ployment opportunities inst ead of international
migration towards Ivory Coast or Guinea. Through its support fo r functional literacy
and work with wom en and youth, the project al so encouraged the creation of a national
women farm er organization and a national young far mers association. Increased food
security and higher revenue s due to better yields helped to reduce poverty and
malnutrition. For more details, see also paragraph 14 in annex 3.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

42.     The institu tional dev elopment impact has been substan tial on all executing
agencies thanks to PASAOP's support in term s of reorga nization, m ission redefinition
and capacity building activities, but also thanks to office equipment. Beyond logistical
inputs that have im proved working conditio ns, PASAOP's soft investm ents have
contributed to re-define the role and responsib ilities of the different stakeholders and the
building-up of social capital.



                                                      14
43.     PASAOP st rongly pushed for technology ge neration and transfer, promotion of
private delivery for advisory services to farming communities, and em powerment of
producer organizations (POs). As a result, th ree m ajor institutional impacts ne ed to be
highlighted:

   i. Producer empowerment at the local, regional and national level: POs are now
      key partners for policy dialogue at the     national level and im plementation of
      investments at the loca l level. APCAM, CRAs and loca l POs have bee n able to
      increase th eir pa rticipation in de cision-making processes and take part in
      projects/programs i mplementation. They now contribu         te to the definition,
      implementation and evaluation of research and extension programs. As mentioned
      before, they were a key player in th e for mulation of the Basic Agricu ltural Law
      issued in 200. In addition, the project has promoted the em ergence of a national
      women federation, the National         Federation of Rural Wom en ( Fédération
      Nationale des Femmes Rurales: FENAFER) and of a national youth federation,
      the National Federation of Rural Youth of Mali (Fédération Nationale des Jeunes
      Ruraux du Mali: FENAJR).

   ii. Demand-driven approach: Institutional changes brought about by PASAOP
       have strongly contributed to m ake the de livery of agricultural services evolve
       from a "top-down" and centralized a       pproach to a m ore de mand-driven and
       regionalized approach. Agricultural research institutions are now better o rganized
       and m ore responsive to producers' needs. In        creased emphasis is placed on
       dissemination of superior and sustaina ble technologies, as well as co ntinued
       investment in research. Thanks to the pr oject's support, Mali has em barked on a
       transition f rom a traditional top -down a nd state-led extension system to a m ore
       demand-driven and pluralistic network of service providers. Accountability to
       producers as clients based on contractua      l relationships is another important
       institutional innovation introduced by the project in this respect.

   iii. Partnership: the different financing m echanisms set up under the project have
        instilled the habit of regular cons      ultations among stakeholders, beyond the
        allocation o f f inancial resourc es. I n th is way, the ASAOP has contributed to
        public-private partnerships, especially be tween government officials, researchers,
        extension agents and representatives of POs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

44.     In the cam paign for locust invasion control in 2004, the PSAOP contributed
overall 50 percen t of the funds and logistics: (i) USD 2 m illion out of a total budg et of
US$4.1 m illion; (ii) 49 230 hect ares were treated with PSAOP support out of 96 ,000
hectares treated (51.3 per cent); (iii) Out of 301 825 lit     ers of pesticides, PSAOP
contributed 100,000 liters (33 per cent); (iv) PASAOP funded 100 vehicles out of a total
of 154 procured for treatm ent against locust and 10 pick-ups for m onitoring teams. This
campaign had also pos itive env ironmental extern alities, such as the inventory of 1,000
tons of obsolete pesticides and their subsequent destruction.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

45.     In 2009, a consultant of the Social Deve lopment Department of the W orld Bank
carried out a lim ited beneficiary assessm ent for com ponents D (Support to producer
organizations) and C (Improving the efficiency, relevance, and sustainability of the
National Agricultural E xtension System). For Component D som e 250 people who had
benefitted from nine selected PO projects we re interviewed in three r egions (Koulikoro,
Kayes and Ségou). For Com ponent C, 60 farmers, local offici als and staff of extension
service providers were interviewed in th ree Counties. Concerni ng Com ponent D, the
assessment found that all beneficiaries were sati sfied with the results of their projects in
terms of production increases, business turnover, higher sales and/or better sales prices.
Male and fem ale far mers benefitted in about the sam e proportion, with variations
according to the type of project financed. Concerning Com ponent C, 92 percen t of the
farmers interviewed were either highly satisfied (73 percent) or satisfied (19 percent), and
only 7 percent were little satisfied or unsatis fied (1 percent) with the economic impact of
the ex tension advice they had received.         Concerning how far mers evalu ated the
performance of extensio n service providers, the results we re as follows as indicated in
Table 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

46.     Rating: Significant. The general thrust of reform s promoted under this project is
likely to continue, especially as changes in the legal framework anchor the move towards
decentralization. The Governm ent is comm itted to a restructuring, rationalization and
decentralization of its entire ad     ministration and donors continue to support this
orientation. Equally, the Governm ent's commitment towards a new sharing of roles and
responsibilities between the pub lic and private sector is unw avering and the transf er of
non-core activities has already taken place and there is little risk of backsliding. The
competitive research grant m echanism, and the funding of exten sion on a con tractual
basis have proven their effectiveness and the key players are familiar with the procedures
and appreciate their usefulness. They are lik ely to continue these innovations. Equally,
the fund for financing of m icro-projects managed by APCAM/CRAs and its procedures
has been internalized. T he degree to which farmer organizations have been em powered
can be expected to prevent any push back of refor           ms and ensure the long-term
sustainability of dem and-driven ap proaches. Finally, the se nsitivity ana lysis has sh own
that the project was econom       ically sustaina ble. Nevertheless, su stainable financing
resources for agricultural services rem ain a key issue for the future. Although the L OA

                                             16
foresees th e establishm ent of a funding m echanism ( Fond National de Développement
Agricole: FNDA) for these purposes, it does not define the sources of funding. Resolution
of this issue is high on the agenda of APCAM and the upcom ing FAPP, in cooperation
with other donors, will equally address this issue. Given the fact that no public ex tension
agents h ave been hired for over 1 4 years, ex cept f or the las t two a nd that private
extension providers and public extension depend on governm ent fundi ng and donors,
there is a risk that agricu ltural extension will becom e the weakest link in the technology
generation and transfer triang le involving agricultural re search, extension and POs.
However, experience under the project with the contracting of extension services and the
financial contribution of beneficiaries should reduce this risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

47.       Rating: marginally unsatisfactory. The project design was based on a number of
strategic choices that were conceptually       correct and closely aligned with the
Government's rural sector strategy and CAs pr iorities, including: (i) increased em phasis
on producer participation in th e planning and delivery of agri cultural services; (ii) better
integration of agricultural technology generation (research) and transfer (extension); and
(iii) introdu ction of co mpetition among agricu ltural s ervice prov iders by separating the
financing from the execution of research and extension program s. W ith the benefit of
hindsight, those strategic choices remain highly relevant. The Bank team ensured that the
project was iden tified and de signed closely w ith government and m ajor stakeholders,
particularly producer organizations. Explicit efforts were also m ade to include the
lessons learned from r elevant predecessor pr ojects, particularly National Agricultural
Research Project and the Natural Agricult ural Extension Project as well as Bank's
experience in agricu ltural t echnology generation and transf er as docum ented by the
Operations and Evaluations Department (OED) at the time.

48.     Despite the relevant overall project de sign con cept, there were however m ajor
shortcomings in the assessm ent of risk s as well as the s pecification of opera tional
arrangements. In this c ontext it is worth mentioning that: ( i) the politic al commitment,
associated risks, and administrative capacity for carrying out the pla nned restructuring of
MDR under Com ponent A in the context of a hiring freeze and restri ctive civil service
rules for salaries were n ot adequately analy zed; (ii) the p roject di d no t present a clear
road m ap on how to go about im plementing the institutional changes sought under the
project; and (iii) insuf ficient a ttention wa s given to the monito ring and evaluation
(M&E) system; the project design summ ary was rather complex with a PDO which was
too vaguely worded and too m any (over 60) vaguely defined perform ance indicators.
Since these aspects had an im portant bear ing on the implem entation of the pr oject,
especially in the early s tages, Bank perform ance in ensur ing quality at e ntry is ther efore
rated as marginally unsatisfactory.

   (b) Quality of Supervision

49.   Rating: moderately satisfactory. Supervision was initially hands-off but
improved over time. The IP and DO ratings before MTR were probably overly optimistic.

                                              17
The Bank responded swiftly to provide support under the project fo r the Governm ent's
emergency response to the locust outbreak      in 2004. In preparation of the m id-term
review, by putting the spotligh t on M&E and th rough a series of international technical
assistance missions, IDA ensured th at the M&E system was im proved and baseline data
were established. In the Add itional Financing IDA increased its support for POs, i.e. the
private sector. The A F put the em phasis on strengthening th e research -extension-
producer collaborative m echanism led by CNRA and to the funding of selected key
technologies where m ore visible results coul d be more quickly obtained and m ore easily
monitored and evaluated. Only with regard to Component A (MDR Refor m), and more
specifically the sub-co mponent "Decentrali zation and strengtheni ng of MDR's basic
public services" did IDA i mplementation support missions have little discernible im pact.
Once the decision was taken by the new G          overnment to split up MDR into five
ministerial departments and to put the reor ganization agenda under the responsibility of
to CDI und er th e Ministère de la Fonction Publique, IDA supervision m issions should
have ass isted the Governm ent in th inking th rough the im plications for decentralization
and staffing needs more proactively.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

50.    Rating: moderately satisfactory. Based on th e assessment in paragraphs (a) and
(b) above, and given the overall m       arginally satisfactory outcom e, overall Bank
performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance

51.     Rating: moderately unsatisfactory, Com ponent A produced a num ber of legal
texts that c larified the respective roles of the public and private sector in agriculture and
that pu shed the o rganization of sectoral          ministries in the direction of greater
decentralization. Concerning decentraliza tion, the ongoing reform process in the
agricultural ministries served as an exam ple for other m inistries to follow. Nevertheless,
the dialogue between the Borrower and IDA concerning this com                 ponent and more
particularly concernin g the sub-com ponent: Decentralization and strengthen ing of
MDR's basic public services seem s to have b een less than candid a nd led to unrealistic
expectations about the speed with whic          h refor m steps could be undertaken and
subsequent frustrations. Also, the Governm ent contributed to delays in project execution
due to a lack of institutional stab ility and continuous changes in key personnel invo lved
in the project. This affected especially components A and C after MDR was split into five
Ministries which led to increased poli          tical interference in personnel decisions
(clientelism/patronage). Although in the end Go vernment always provid ed the n ecessary
counterpart funds, it only did so after long delays, at tim es up to 15 m onths. This led to
delays in project execution a nd to higher prices for proj ect inputs than would have
otherwise been the case.

   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

52.    Rating: moderately satisfactory. Despite its lim ited a uthority, th e Proje ct
Coordination Unit overall succeeded in holding the project together and in ensuring that
executing agencies at the fiel d level would follow disbursem ent procedures and provide

                                             18
justifications for funds rece ived. However, several cruc ial studies to docum ent and
evaluate project experience and resu lts concerning Component C and D were not carried
out, although they were recomm ended by successive project supervision m issions. DNA,
although it had no authority over other newly created Directorates dealing with extension,
was able to m aintain c ritical coor dination of extension staff at all levels (national,
regional an d local) de aling with a griculture. The CDI relied pr incipally on the f ocal
points within the different Ministries to     push the restructuring and decentralization
agenda but its leadership was not strong enough. APCAM, a fter initial weaknesses, and
CNRA perform ed satisfactorily. In addition, the fiduciary activ ities of the project have
been well implem ented as th e pro curement is satisfactory and financial m anagement
moderately. Audits were always on time and unqualified.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

53.    Rating: Moderately satisfactory. Based on the two ratings above, and given that
the overall project outcome rating is above the bar, overall Borrower performance is rated
as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

       Multi-stakeholder financing m echanisms (be they for com petitive research grants
       for contracting of private ex tension services or grants for micro-projects of POs)
       are efficient for allocating funds to activities that are relevant and consistent with
       the needs of producers and their interest s. These m echanisms foster dialogue,
       partnership and collaboration among institutions and ensure stronger coordination
       in the field. But there is a necessary learning phase and the whole process needs to
       be carefully m onitored. Representatives of POs need to be tr ained to play their
       role.

       In financing am bitious, far reaching        institutional ref orms of m inisterial
       departments for which political commit ment is param ount, a cle ar d istinction
       should be made between the preparation phase and the im plementation phase. As
       part of the prepara tion phase ther e is need to pay due atten     tion to politica l
       commitment and associated risks. As far as implementation is concerned, there is
       need for a clear road-m    ap that details th e operation al arrangem ents and
       sequencing of reforms.

       A com bination of capacity building m easures to strengthen POs and their
       federations, and investments in m icro-projects that are m anaged by these sam e
       organizations can be a powerful tool to modernize the agricultural sector and to
       induce greater dynam ism in the agricult ural technology genera tion and diffusion
       process. If the Government and donors co llaborate in this field, as was the case
       under this project, transformational achievements are possible.

       For agricultural services projects, special attention needs to be given to introduce
       and/or strengthen a perm anent in house econom ic analysis capacity inside the
       research and extension organizations.      This capacity building support should
       enable th ese organizatio ns to carry out prospective im pact studies of different
       specific research and extension activ ities that can guide th eir efforts towards the
       ones that are likely to have the highest ec onomic returns and social payoff. This

                                            19
       support should also enable them to carry out cost-benefit analyses and to conduct
       adoption and diffusion studies on thei r own, requiring a m ore cost-efficient
       external validation process.

       The privatization of agricultural exte nsion and the public funding for private
       agricultural service delivery based on contracts is a long term process and needs
       to be conceived as such. Supporting policy m easures as well as analytical work
       and public funding and training are necessary to m ake it sustain able. W ithout
       specific measures to upgrade the public sectors capacity in such areas as extension
       planning, monitoring of performance of extension contracts carried out by private
       providers and defining standards for pre- and in-service training of extension staff
       there is the r isk that neither the pub lic nor the private extension system will work
       satisfactorily.

       Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are tw         o distinct ac tivities with dif ferent
       objectives and m ethods. They should not be lumped together. In any event, to
       avoid problems during project execution, thes e systems have to be fully designed
       and tested at the latest before project e ffectiveness. In the special case of
       extension activities, care should be exer cised not to try to m easure the exact
       impact of advice to farm ers i mmediately. To m easure these effects w ould cos t
       more than to produce them and would be m isleading since the ultim ate success
       and benefits depend on the diffusion of th ese technologies, i.e. the adoption by a
       large num ber of farm ers over tim e which cannot be predicted. It is m           ore
       important that thousands of far mers achieve increases in th eir yields and incomes
       than that few far mers a chieve spectacula r results. Alternativ e m eans of judging
       the effectiveness of extension activities such as the willingn ess of farmers to pay
       some of the costs and carefully designed adoption and diffusion studies should be
       considered.

       Including an e mergency fund for natural calamities is sensible, as the risk of
       occurrence of such events is h igh, and as it allows IDA to be of assistance
       immediately when the need is h ighest. The P ASAOP contribu ted o verall 50
       percent of the funds and logistics for locust invasion control in 2004.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

54.     A workshop was held with Borrower's            representatives and all im plementing
agencies in December 2009. In the m eetings the following points were transm itted to the
mission: (i) problems related to the slow depreciation of the SDR against the CFA Franc,
(ii) cum bersome procurem ent and disbursem ent procedures; (iii) difficulties related to
late availability of counterpart funds; (iv) lack o f synergy between this project and other
big government programs; (v) im pact of govern ment hiring freeze on staffing; (vi) need
for IDA to have a clear policy concerning agricultural extension. For more details, see the
workshop report in Annex 7.




                                            20
(b) Co financiers

55.    The Producer Organizations contributed up to US$2,300,000              or about 4.31
percent of the total am ount, in particular in sub-projects. Parallel financing was expected
through the USAID (for abou t U S$2 m illion), the Fren ch Government (in p articular
though the AFD-financed PASE for about US$3.9 million equivalent in the cotton areas),
the Swiss Government, the Dutch Governm ent (for about US$10 m illion equivalent) and
the European Union (about US$700,000 equivalent as ad            ditional sup port for MDR
reforms, research activities and Producer        Organizations"). However, this did not
materialize during implementation.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

56.     In May 2010, a workshop was held with partners and stakeholders in order to get
their feedback on the p roject. Their reaction wa s overall very positive. For m ore details
see annex 8.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Overview

1.       This annex presents the econom ic and fi nancial analysis for the Agricultural
Services and Producer Organization Project (ASPOP, also known as " PASAOP") for the
initial credit (3583 MLI) and the additional financing (3583-1-MLI).

2.      The analysis uses cos t-benefit analysis and farm models to calculate inte rnal rate
of returns (IRR) and th eir co rresponding net present values (NPV). It focuses on the
returns from the investm ents under com ponent B ("im proving the efficiency, relevance
and sustainability of the National Agricult ural Research System ") and com ponent C
("Improving the efficiency, relevance, and su stainability of the Nation al Agricultu ral
Extension System "). More sp ecifically, the analy sis e stimates th e re turns f rom: (i)
increased crop production due to the diffusion of biotechnologies and better agronom ic
practices in several regions of Mali, (ii) increased production of m        ilk due to the
introduction of im proved sm all rum inants with basic husbandry practices and, (iii)
increased production of m eat due to the in troduction of improved poultry with basic
husbandry patterns. It w as assumed that the incr eases in yields and increases in livestock
products would directly come from the investments in research and extension5.

3.       The project also creates a num ber of im portant externalities under com ponent A
("Public Service Reform ") and component D ("Support to Producer Organizations")
which have not been ass essed in the present an alysis because of the difficulty to qu antify
the effects of institution al strengthening and capacity building. As a matter of fact, given
the dif ficulty to m odel IRR f or the estab lishment of an institutiona l f ramework, the
present analysis assesses partially the efficiency and PDO of the project6.

4.      Overall, the resu lts ind icate th at the project under th e Initi al and Additional
Financing is economically desirable. In order to compare the expected returns assumed at
the time of appraisal (PAD) to the returns ob tained at the end of the initial credit (2003-
2007), the analysis has also presented the re turns from each of the two credits. This
strategic methodology aims to compute the returns from the Additional Financing so as to
stress the gains from t he em phasized tec hnology transfer scale-up investm ents on the
ground. As m entioned in the PAD of the           Additional Financing, the m onitoring of
research an d extens ion activit ies would be refined with     key perform ance indicators,
hence allowing a better follow up and analysis of outputs.

  The analysis hence ignores the problems related to cause-and-effect attribution of impact due t o diverse
external factors whic h are outside project control ( such as weat her, i nput s upply sy stems, rural fi nance,
economic policies). However, the analysis remains highly relevant. Assumptions have been c onservative,
several dat a h ave been directly col lected o n t he field, and direct discussi ons wit h farm ers allowed
strengthening th e attribu tion of results to ASPOP activ ities. A sen sitivity an alysis is a lso propo sed at th e
end of this analysis and discusses the impact of climate change on both yields and IRR.

  Looking at the financial and economic analysis of projects' subcomponents is a very common practice in
the ex-post evaluation of projects targeting research and extension


                                                        31
5.      Under the p resented assumptions, the average internal rate of return (IR R) of the
overall project is 24.2 percent. The corres ponding financial and econom ic net present
values (NPV) are positive and in the order of USD 16.3-16.7 million for a 20-year project
lifecycle. The project's returns are neverth eless sensitive to severa l scenarios (substantial
changes in the adoption rates, decreases         in prices, decreases in the num       ber of
beneficiaries or decrease s in yields due to external shoc ks s uch as climate change), as
reflected by the sensitivity analysis presented in the last section of this study.

Lessons learnt from economic and financial analysis of agricultural research and
extension projects

6.      Many ex-post economic analyses have shown high rates of return to investm ents
in agricultu ral R&E (f rom 40 percent to 55 percent). The most powerful international
review of literature was conducted by Alston    et al. (2000) 7 and also b y Alène an d
Coulibaly (2008).

7.      Alston et al. reviewed 292 studies and performed a meta-analysis, reporting 1,858
estimates of returns on investments in agricultural research and development. The report
of Alston et al. globally found an average return of 81 percent per year. These results
confirm the global acc eptance that returns on investm ents in agricultural R&E are
relatively high. Returns aver aged 99.6 percent on investment s in research alone, 84.6
percent on extension alone, and 47.6 percent on R&E com bined. The report argues that
the lower estim ates for R&E combined m ight be because the corresponding stu dies
captured more of the total costs of the tec hnology innovation process. No evidence was
found of de clining rates of return in recent years and little consistent d ifference among
regions. However, the lite rature e stimated tha t rate s of return tended to be lower in
Africa (average return of 50 percent) than in other parts of the world.
                                                                        8
8.      The study perform ed by Alène and Coulibaly (2008)                demonstrates that
agricultural research in Sub-Saharan Africa c ould reach an aggregate IR R of 55 percent.
The elasticity of productivity with respect to agricultural research is 0.38, implying that a
1 percent increase in agricultural research expenditure s increases productivity by 0.38
percent. The elastici ty of GDP per capita with respect to productivity is estim ated at
0.95, indicating that a 1 percent increase in prod uctivity leads to an alm ost equivalent 1
percent growth in per capita incomes. Th e poverty elasticity of per capita GDP is 0.60,
implying that a 10 percent growth in per capita incom es brought about largely through
agricultural productivity growth reduces poverty by as much as 6 percent.

9.     As a m atter of facts, R&E pays-off in Afri ca, and there is n o real im pediment to
the economic efficiency of PASAOP 's investments in Mali. This ex-post economic and
financial analysis aims to verify this assumption.

Identification of PASAOP's benefits

10.  The overall quantifiable and non-quantifiabl e benefits of the program can be
summarized as follows:

11.      The key quantifiable benefits arising from both financing of PASAOP are:

         PASAOP, original credit : increased yields of agricu ltural and livestock products
         (more specifically cowpea, maize, millet, sorghum, peanuts, rice and milk) due to:
         (i) the dissemination of both strategic and demand-driven research products (such
         as improved crops varieties, new fodder cr ops, more adapted animal feeding), (ii)
         the widespread execution of performance-based, decentralized and demand-driven
         extension services based on participatory diagnoses at the community level, (iii)
         the increased execution of extension services by private operators to supplem ent
         public services, (iv) the improved accountability of extension agents, and (iv) the
         demonstration by agents of i mproved agronomic techniques, im proved technical
         itineraries, lives tock b reeding technique s, co nservation and food-process ing
         techniques.

         PASAOP, additional financing: increm ental benefits arose from increased
         production due to technology transfer scale-up initiativ       es. The accelerated
         distribution of research products and biotechnologies (cowpea seeds, maize seeds,
         improved livestock) 9 enhanced substantia l inc rease in yields of both agricultural
         and livestock products. More specifi      cally, benefits cam e from : (i) striga
         gesnerioides-resistant co wpea seeds that increas ed the p roportion of f arms with
         grain yields above 700kg/ha (from 18.4 pe rcent in 2007-2008 to 57.8 percent in
         2008-2009), (ii) the dissemination of more efficient varieties of maize, with yields
         increasing from 600kg/ha (traditional) up to 2mT/ha (im proved), both in village
         irrigation schemes of the Timbuktu Region, (iii) the increased seasonal production
         of goat milk from 0.5-1 liter per day up to 3 liter per day during 120 days, due to
         the dissem ination of improved small rum inants ( Guerra goat) and extension of
         basic husbandry practices, (iv) the    improved seasonal production of poultry
         products and meat, due to the introduction of Wassachie units (roosters and hens)
         that can produce up to 100 a dditional eggs per year in comparison to traditional
         species, and also the introduction of   Wassachie roaste rs in tradition al poultry
         farms.




9
  The additional financing of PASAOP targetted 7 strategic technologies/activities to increase agricultural
production in Mali, n amely (i) co wpea seeds, (ii) improved m aize seed s, (iii) po tatoes v alue chain
rehabilitation, (iv) bananas, (v) horticulture and market gardening, (vi) improved small ruminants and (vii)
improved poul try. However, because data were not yet available at the tim e of com pletion, the be nefits
arising fro m activ ities su ch as po tatoes, banana and plantain banana, horticulture and m arket g ardening
were not computed in the economic and financial analysis.



                                                    33
12.     Regarding the original financing of PASAOP ( 2003-2006), the identification of
benefits and underlying assum ptions are co mparable with those of the econom ic and
financial analysis performed at the appraisal stage (PAD, 2001).

13.      As far as the Additional Financing of PASAOP is concerned (2007-2009), the
identification of benefit s are not necessar ily analogous with those of the econom ic and
financial analysis performed at the appraisal level due to the demand-driven nature of the
project.10 Indeed, the ex-ante econom ic and financial analys is appraised benefits from
activities that were actually not developed under PASAOP auspices (such as the support
to the rice filière), while benefits arising from poultry activities ( Wassachie units and
roasters) were not anticipated at appraisal.

14.   More indirect and non-quantified benefits in the analysis are expected to com e
from:

         Welfare at the household level, due to    increased food secur ity and revenues,
         helping to reduce poverty and malnutrition.

         Economic e xternalities such as instituti onal benefits, im proved efficiency and
         effectiveness of public serv ices through capacity buildi ng support to the Ministry
         of Agriculture, the Ministry of Live       stock and Fisheries, the Min     istry of
         Environment and Sanitation, and the Food Security Commissariat.

         Positive so cial exte rnalities, such as : (i) the em      powerment of grassroo ts
         producers' organizations (632 producers representatives have received training on
         their roles and responsibilitie s), that improved PO's legitim acy and credibility in
         the agricultural policy dialogue and strategy formulation, (ii) the capacity building
         of 800 extensionis ts, (iii) im proved lite racy o f far mers and, (iv) HIV/AIDS
         prevention, through the actions of th       e special programs carried out under
         component 1 (7,500 agents were trained to diffuse prevention message, more than
         200,000 condoms were distributed, and 2,900 ad hoc emissions were diffused on
         the radio). An im pact study performed by Mahieu (2009) 11 highlighted that
         PASAOP also benefited vulnerable groups: 53 percent of projec ts' beneficiaries
         under component D were women (3292 women), and the youth have enjoyed new
         local employment opportunities instead of international m igration towards Ivory
         Coast or Guinea.

         Positive en vironmental externalities, su ch as the inven tory of 1,000 tons of
         obsolete pesticides and their subsequent destruction.

   Though not figuring in the PAD of the Additional Financing, an ex-ante economic and financial analysis
was performed in 2007 by an external consultant. Results are presented hereinafter in the "results" section.

Methodology and Assumptions

15.     The analysis focuses on components B and C of the project and was carried out in
constant 2009 prices. T he overall project's disbursements for com ponents B and C were
disaggregated on a yearly basis (4 years for the first credit and 3 yea rs for the additional
financing 12 ). The Im plementation Com pletion Report (IC R) prepared by the Project
Coordination valued the recurrent costs at CFAF 923 million13. The investment costs and
recurrent costs were computed together with the expected overall incremental benefits of
the project.

16.      The methodology and key assumptions are explained below:

         Beneficiaries (original credit): at com pletion o f the f irst c redit of PASAOP in
         2006, extension agents had signed more th an 10,000 performance-based contracts
         benefiting more than 25,000 producers and 17,000 farm units for the delivery of
         extension activities. From the inventor y of perform ance-based contracts, the
         National Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture (DNA) reported that contracts
         were signed in the diffe rent regions of Mali as follows: 2.25 percent in Kayes, 6
         percent in S ikasso, 1 percent in Kou likoro, 23 percent in S égou, 19 percent in
         Timbuktu, 46 percent in Gao-Tim buktu, 8 percent in the Bam ako district and 20
         percent in Mopti. For the representative fa rm models in each region, the benefits
         arising from a far m household were valued at the total nu mber of beneficiaries
         targeted by the extension activities. Over a 20 years' time horizon, it was assumed
         the total number of beneficiary households would rise to 105,000, with 5,000 new
         beneficiaries per year (f rom 2006-2023). The financial and econom ic analysis
         subsequently com puted net cash -flows and average increm ental inco mes at the
         farm level.

         Adoption rates (phasing of benefits): the evaluation of adoption rates 14 at the end
         of PASAOP in all the regions of Ma li showed a very good average of 40-60
         percent. As a matter of fact, the calculation of the average benefit stream assumes
         a step-wise realization of average project benefits shown below. Although the
         total incremental net benefit from the agricultural improvements is about USD 1.5
         million for a cluster of about 6,000 producers, it is conservatively assumed that 60
         percent of this (or USD 912,000) is actually achieved (or attributed to the project)
         by the fourth year.


12
   As discussed above, only the ben efits ar ising from i mproved co wpea an d m aize, sm all r uminants an d
poultry were considered. As a matter of fact, only the R&E costs of these technologies were computed with
project's net benefits. The disaggregation of costs was pe rformed by the Financial Management Specialist
of the Coordination Unit.
13
   The recurrent costs can be disaggregated as follows: (i) CFAF 150 million for operation and maintenance
on eq uipments, (ii) CFAF 280 m illion fo r p erformance b ased-contracts, (iii) CFAF 220 m illion fo r
contracts with private providers, (iv) CFAF 93 million for "la journée du paysan", (iv) CFAF 188 million
for agricultural exhibitions.

        Agricultural production (original credit): the f arm models used in the analysis
        represent the typical sm allholder's farm budget in the proj ect areas (Kayes,
        Koulikoro, Sikasso, Ségou, Mopti, Timbuktu and Gao Regions). The construction
        of far ming s ystems greatly benefi ted from field and background data 15 collected
        during a mission in Mali in March 2010          and also from the Econom ic and
        Financial analysis 16 performed for the appraisa l (PAD) of the F          ostering
        Agricultural Production Projec t (F APP, also known as " PAPAM"). T hose data
        allowed to build the average farm models: (i) producing rice, wheat, shallot and
        cowpea in Ségou, (ii) producing m illet, f odder, m ilk and m eat in Mopti; (iii)
        producing sorghum , corn and m ilk in Si kasso, (iv) producing cowpea, fodder,
        milk and poultry in Koulikoro, (v) producin g sorghum, mil, maize and goat m ilk
        in Kayes, and (vi) producing livestoc k products in Tim buktu and Gao Regions.
        From the average b enefit in each region due to the yield increases (see table
        below with increases recorded under PAS AOP auspices), an average increm ental
        benefit per beneficiary was valued at CFAF 173,700 (USD 243).

         total of 20 farmers adopted improved varieties of maize18, (iii) 60 units of Guerra
         goats were distributed to 60 farmers, (iv) 563 improved Wassache roosters were
         distributed to 477 beneficiaries, (v) 8 units of Wassachie were distributed to 8
         beneficiaries. Over a 20 years horizon, it was assumed that, on a yearly basis: (i)
         500 new be neficiaries would use improved cowpea varieties, (ii) 30 farm s would
         benefit from 30 units of Guerra goats, (iii) 100 far ms would benefit from 100
         improved Wassache roosters, (iv) 10 im proved Wassache units would be
         distributed to 10 farms, (v) 100 new beneficiaries would use improved varieties of
         maize.

         Agricultural production (Additional Financing): the in cremental benef its aros e
         from: (i) the use of im proved seeds of cowpea, (ii) th e use of im proved varieties
         of maize, (iii) the breeding of Guerra goats and (iv) The breeding of Wassachie
         hens. These benefits were com puted thanks to farm models' b udgets in the "with
         project" and "without project" situations . The fa rm m odels were built b ased on
         reports carried out under PASAOP ausp         ices and interviews with producers,
         researchers and IER's ( Institut d'Economie Rurale) key infor mants during the
         field m ission. For the representative fa rm models for each technology, the
         incremental benefits arising from a farm household adopting technology were
         valued at the total number of beneficiarie s. The net benefits em anating from all
         the activitie s were aggregated to o btain a global benefit, com puted on a yearly
         basis. Yea rly aggrega ted net b enefits we re r elated to th e tota l annu al pro ject
         expenditures (research and extension) re garding cowpea, maize, milk and poultry
         products. As discussed above, some resear ch and extension activities (banana,
         potatoes seeds) were not valued in th     e analysis becaus e their eco nomic and
         financial effects were not yet important at the time of project completion.




concerned, i t was ass umed that al l t he beneficiaries would benefit f rom the f ull im pact o f t echnology

18
  This low number of beneficiaries using this technology is explained by a slow start in the dissemination
of the improved varieties of maize on the ground.

17.     Prices: the colle ction o f rural price data benef ited f rom the ex-ante econom ic
analysis of the FAPP project. The calcu lations also us ed average pric e data collected
during field surveys and internet tr ade inf ormation platf orms19. Price data has not been
disaggregated around the agricultural cropping cycle (therefore ignoring the som etimes
significant price fluctuations dur ing the cropping cycle) but effo rts were made to retrieve
regional prices. All prices were given in constant 2009 prices.

18.      Price conversion.20 A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was used to calculate the
economic prices of the m ain outputs (im proved cowpea and m aize) and inputs (m ineral
fertilizer an d pesticid es). This conv ersion f actor is typ ically used when data are s carce.
Similarly, the prevailin g wage rate was adju sted by a factor of 0.9 to arrive at the
opportunity cost of labor at the farm level. For planting materials, locally made materials,
local seed and non-traded output s (which is generally the case under the first credit of
PASAOP), a conversio n factor of one was ch osen, becau se the m arket price typ ically
reflects opportunity costs.

Baseline Results

19.     As assumed in the PAD of the initial credit, IRRs were computed for an assumed
project life cycle of 20 years. A standard 12 percent opportunity cost of capital was used
to compute NPVs. The resulting econom ic (ERR) and financial rates (FRR) of retu rn for
PASAOP, together with their corresponding NPVs, are presented below.

  In spite of efforts to compute conversion factors to derive economic prices from financial prices, the lack
of price data available at completion--such as t he Cost/Insurance/Freight (CIF) price of imports (cowpea,
maize and inputs), the handling/distribution/transport costs from the point of import to the domestic market,
and so on--prevented accurate import parity prices from being computed.

20.    The results show that the PASAOP projec t is economically desirable, with sound
IRRs which are significantly higher than th e opportunity cost of capital, both for the
Original Financing (22.8 percent) and the Additional Financing (38 and 39 percent for the
FRR and ERR). Returns at completion are, however, slightly less l than those expected at
appraisal (where a 27.3 percent IRR was assumed).

21.      As assum ed in the PAD (2001) of the Or iginal Financing, no significant price
distortions were used to calculate the econom ic rate of return of the Initial Credit 22. The
Additional Financing, however, en hances the use of tradable inputs (pesticides, NPK
fertilizer) in some technical itiner aries (such as improved cowpea) and generates outputs
that can be traded tow ards neighboring c ountries. Hence, pric e distortions (shadow
prices) were considered using conversi on factors (see above). The ERR and FRR,
however, are not signif icantly different (38 and 39 percent), showing that the project
mainly generated (internationally) non-traded outputs.

22.    The profitability of four key technologies diffused under the additional financing
(cowpea, maize, Guerra goats, Wassachie units and hens) was also assessed. The table
below shows that the Guerra goat activity is not econom ically justified unde r the results
at com pletion and for the num ber of bene ficiaries assum ed over the 2010-2027 period.
The Wassachie activity, however, has shown excellent returns.




21
     The returns of the Additional Financing assumed at appraisal were computed over a 10 years life cycle.
22
     Consequently, the financial rate of return (FRR) is equal to the economic rate of return (ERR)

23.      Furthermore, the project is potentially se nsitive to som e var iables. The analys is
developed hereinafter aim s to test the      robustness of returns when PASAOP's key
variables (prices, yields and adoption rates) are stressed by a weakening of agricultural
extension efforts or external shocks (clim ate change, erratic rainfalls, locust invasions) or
crisis (food prices bubbles).

Sensitivity Analysis

24.     A basic sensitivity analysis was performed using three key variables affecting the
project: (i) output prices, (ii) yields and (iii) num ber of beneficiaries (adoption rates).
The evolution of returns through the project's life was also analyzed.

25.     The im pact of food pr ice inflation during 2008 has been high for Mali. The
weighted average costs of the food basket (food CPI- Consumer Price Index) rose by 15
percent between 2007 and 2008 accord ing to LABORSTATA 23 statistics. Thus, the
sensitivity analysis tested the im pact of 15 and 20 percent decrease s of food prices on
PASAOP's retu rns. T he sens itivity analysis found that retu rns to the p roject were
particularly sensitive to output price changes (see table below). Of course, price declines
would also discourage farm ers from adopti ng new technologies and thereby could be
expected to lead to further reduce the economic benefits of the project.

26.     Over the last 30 years, rainfalls in Mali have declined by about 30 percent (FAPP,
2009). In addition, th e natural res ource base has been degraded th        rough increased
population pressure and depletion of soil and fore sts. The sensitivity analysis aims to test
the impact of a potential aggravation of the rainfall profile and soil degradation on yields.
The findings of W orld Bank's 2010 World Developm ent Report (WDR) 24 on climate
change sho w that a 15 percent decreas e of yields is a reasonable as sumption for the
sensitivity analysis over a 20 year s horizon: Müller and others (2009) 25, cited in the 2010
WDR, showed that climate change will depress agricultural yields by 20 to 30 p ercent in
some Sahelian countries, with an average impact of 15 to 20 percent in Mali.

27.    Regarding adoption rates during the Orig inal F inancing (2003-2006), the above
baseline results depend on assumptions of a fairly quick response by groups of farmers to
the opportunities presented by the Project   (15, 30, 45 and 60 percent). A sensitivity

of use of agricultural technologies in the future (10, 25, 35 and 50 percent).

28.     Regarding the Addition al Financing (2007-2009), the baseline resu lts depend on
the num ber of benefic iaries adopting: (i) the new varieties of cowpea (500 new
beneficiaries per year from 2007-2027), (ii) the new varieties of m       aize (100 new
beneficiaries per year from 2007-2027), (iii ) the im proved sm all rum inants (30 new
beneficiaries per year fr om 2007-2027) and (iv) the Wassachie poultry (100 hens and 10
units per year from 2007-2027). The sensitivity analysis has been considering a 10
percent and a 20 percent decrease in the number of beneficiaries adopting the technology.

29.      The projec t is also se nsitive to the sustain ability of research and extens ion
 activities. According to the f igure below, if the projected level of the projec t's benefits
 does not persist three years after PASAOP's closure (if the project's life cycle is less than
 10 years), the IRR would fall below the        12 percent m inimum threshold, suggesting
 significant r isks to m aintaining the developm ent outcom e. However, given that there is
 already seven years of i mplementation of PASAOP unde r the Initial and Additional
 Financing, there is a low probabi lity that the level of proj ect's benefits could not be
 sustained over the next 3 years.

  The internal rate of return is equal to the economic rate of return. FRR and ERR only vary by 1-2 percent
point.

Final remarks

30.     The analysis only focused on com ponents B and C because extern alities are hard
to captu re and m odel. Positive e xternalities can substan tially inc rease the ov erall
efficiency of the project (this affirmation refers to the f indings of the meta- analysis that
shows very high ERR for research and extension projects in Africa). Even if the results of
the meta-analysis are considered as a benchmark, the results of PASAOP's economic and
financial an alysis are n ot necessarily confli cting, as ex ternalities and som e project's
components were ignored in the analysis.

31.      The financial returns arising from producer s' organizations (P O's) sub-projects
(returns from com ponent D) could have b een appraised if one single interm             ediate
outcome indicator was chosen to m easure the m icro-economic impact of the 1850 sub-
projects on the 6212 beneficiaries (such as, for example, the increase in yields for the
productive activities). The APCAM (Assemblée Permanente des Chambres d'Agriculture
du Mali) database of sub-projects, however, qua ntifies the sub-proj ects' effects through
numerous indicators such as: (i) the increase in revenues, (ii) the increase in productivity,
(iii) the inc rease in m arket pr ice or (iv ) the increase in households ' revenues. Some of
these indicators are not exploitable to appraise incremental benefits and calculate returns,
and prevent the analysis from assessing the benefits of capacity building investments.

32.    Focusing on specific activities (biotec hnology, livestock and poultry production),
together with a new set of indicators that    allo wed to m onitor and capture additional
outputs, have significantly im proved the ca rrying out, quality and relevance of the
economic and financial analysis of the Additional Financing.

Main findings

In 2009, a staff m ember of the S ocial Deve lopment Departm ent of the W orld Bank
carried out a lim ited beneficiary assessm ent for com ponents D (Support to producer
organizations) and C (Improving the efficiency, relevance, and sustainability of the
National Agricultural E xtension System). For Component D som e 250 people who had
benefitted f rom 9 sele cted PO projects we re interv iewed in th ree reg ions (Koulikoro,
Kayes and Ségou). For Com ponent C, 60 farmers, local offici als and staff of extension
service providers were interviewed in th ree Counties. Concerni ng Com ponent D, the
assessment found that all beneficiaries were sati sfied with the results of their projects in
terms of production increases, business turnover, higher sales and/or better sales prices.
Male and fem ale far mers benefitted in about the sam e proportion, with variations
according to the type of project financed. Concerning Component C, 92 percent of the
farmers interviewed were either highly satisfied (73 percent) or satisfied (19 percent), and
only 7 percent were little satisfied or unsatis fied (1 percent) with the economic impact of
the ex tension advice they had received.         Concerning how far mers evalu ated the
performance of extension service providers, the results were as follows:

                                             Highly   Satisfied       Little    Unsatisfied

I. Introduction

Le PASAOP est l'un des neuf programm es du schém a directeur du Développem ent
Rural e t s 'inscrit pa rfaitement dans le cadre stratégique de lutte con tre la pauv reté ;Ce
programme a été conçu pour réduire la pauvreté en milieu rural à travers le renforcement
des capacités et de la productivité des acteurs du secteu r rural, par l'am élioration du
savoir faire en agriculture, la génération et la diffusion des technologies, la gouvernance
et la pleine participation des organisations de producteurs à la croissance économique.

La prem ière phase du programm e, avait pour ob jectif d'établir un cadre institutionnel
propice à une plus grande efficacité dans         la prestation d es serv ices agrico les aux
producteurs et à leurs orga        nisations. A cet effet, il s'agissait d'Appuyer la
décentralisation de fonctions essentielles du Ministère du D éveloppement Rural (MDR),
encourager l'ém ergence d'acteurs privés d ans l'ex écution des services d 'appui à
l'agriculture, et renforcer le pouvoir des organisations de producteurs.
          Etablir un système national de recherche agricole, qui soit à la fois efficace et
             viable, et capable d'       élaborer des programm es de développem            ent
             technologique à moyen et long terme.
          Etablir un système de services de conseil technique efficace, partagé avec des
             prestataires privés, réponda nt à la dem ande et viable, au travers de la
             régionalisation et d e la décen tralisation des programm es et budg ets d e
             vulgarisation, et avec une participation accrue des producteurs et des
             communes dans la conception et la gestion des programmes de vulgarisation ;
          Rendre les organisations de producteurs (OP) capable de f ournir des services
             (accès aux intran ts agricoles, au crédit, au m arché, aux tech nologies) à leurs
             membres avec efficacité et transparence; et aussi de participer activement aux
             instances de définition et de suivi de s politiques agricoles et des projets et
             programmes sous sectoriels; et de pa rticiper aux instances de gouvernance
             des institutions de recherche et        de vulgarisation agricole, ainsi que
             d'alphabétisation fonctionnelle.

Cette évaluation a été conduite par les respon sables de composantes et par une équipe
technique interministérielle regroupant les représentants du Minis tère de l'Elevage e t de
la Pêche, du Ministère de l'Environnem ent e t de l'Assainissem ent, du Ministère de
l'Economie et des Finances, du Ministère du P lan et de l'Aménagement du Territoire, du
Ministère de la Fonction Publique, des Reform es de l'Etat et d es Relations avec les
Institutions, du Ministère de l'Education Nationale, du Mi nistère de l'Adm inistration
Territoriale et des Collectivité s Locales, du Ministère du Dé veloppement Social de la
Solidarité et des Personnes Agées, du Ministèr e de l'Agriculture, du Comm issariat à la
Sécurité Alim entaire, des Cham bres d'Agri culture, des Organisations P aysannes et des
Organisations non gouvernementales.
Sur le terrain, elle a été m enée de façon part icipative en associant les cadres chargés du
Conseil agricole, de la recherche et de l' animation des chambres d'Agriculture et des
Organisations Paysann es, les exp loitants bé néficiaires, les autorités c ommunales, les


                                             48
Offices, ONG et autres prestataires privés         offrant des services d'appui conseil aux
producteurs et productrices.

II. Objectifs du Projet

Le Mali venait d'achever la restructuration du secteur rural entamé depuis 1996 qui avait
aboutit à la mise ne place de trois Direction Nationales à savoir la Direction Nationale de
l'Appui au Monde Rural(DNAMR), de l'A             ménagement et de l'Equipem ent Rural
(DNAER), de la réglem entation et contrôle (DGR C). Il s'ag issait de consolider les
nouvelles structures issues de cette restructuration.

En outre, le Programm e a pour objet de cont ribuer à la réduction la pauvreté dans les
zones rurales en prenant des mesures conçues de manière à : a) maintenir l'accroissement
de la productivité des activité s agricoles et non agricoles        et b) renforcer le cadre
institutionnel aux fins de l'exécution du programme de réforme agricole, notamment pour
: (i) renforcer les capacités     du Ministère du Développem ent Rural (MDR) et des
organismes publics d es services ag ricoles ; (i i) procéder, dans le cadre d'une opération
pilote, au transfert des activités de vulgarisation au secteur privé dans cinq (5) des régions
du Mali et (iii) accroître l'efficacité des associations de producteurs agricoles.

A ces objectifs s'ajoute celui du «Supplém ental» à savoir : am éliorer la diffusion et
l'application des résultats de la rech erche agricole. Ila été d écidé de mettre en p lace un
programme de diffusi on de technologies ép rouvées pendant la prem ière phase du
programme en m ilieu paysan en renforçant not amment les liens entr e les producteurs, la
vulgarisation et la recherche.

III. Couverture des bénéficiaires

IV. Résultats atteints
        Par composante / sous composante (Coût total prévu, réalisé, % décaissement)
 Principales       réalisations et changements induits

Résultats atteints

Les bases institutionnelles sont solides au niveau des organisations de producteu rs avec
des concertations désorm ais f onctionnelles entre les OPA et les Cham bres d' agriculture
aux niveaux national et régional, un m odule st andardisé de for mation sur les rôles et
responsabilité des élus, élabor é et dispensé dans l' ensemble du pays. Des Chambres
d'Agriculture sont fonctionnelles , plus visibles, plus crédible s et assum ent correctement
leurs fonctions de représentation avec des        capacités d' analyse, de négociation, de
plaidoyer et de formulation des projets et politiques :

   Les bases institutionnelles sont en place au niveau de la re cherche agricole av ec un
   Système national de la recherche agrico le (SNVA) fonctionnel, ouvert à tous les
   instituts de recherche (actuellem ent 3), or ienté par la dem ande des utilisateurs des
   résultats de recherche et avec la m     ise en place d' un fonds com pétitif pour le
   financement de tous les projets de recher che (le nom bre de proj ets de recherch e en
   cours chaque année est passé de 37 à 92, dont 43 projets de recherche stratégique et
   appliqué, et 49 projets de R&D à la dem ande des producteurs et gérés au niveau
   régional).

   Des avancées sign ificatives et ap préciées pa r l' ensemble des acteurs de terrain
   (producteurs, communes, agents publics et prestataires privés) sont perceptibles au
   niveau du service conseil notamment (i) avec la contractualisation des services offerts
   par 55 privés em ployant 162 agents qui s' ajoutent aux 720 agents de base des
   services publics et (ii) au niveau de la participation de plus de 25,200 producteurs à
   la gestion de ces services à travers leur     commune et des diagnostics participatif s
   villageois. La participa tion f inancière des producteurs au test de tr ansfert a é té de
   l'ordre de 208 m illions de FCFA (20 pe rcent du m ontant total d e contrats d es
   prestataires privés ) Ce montant re présente 2,8 m illions de FCFA en moyenne par
   commune. L'engouem ent des producteurs pour la poursuite du programme dans les
   communes déjà couvertes et son extension à d' autres est indicateur du succès de cette
   nouvelle approche.

   Dans le dom aine de la rationalisation des se rvices publics, le program me a per mis le
   développement et à l'application d'outils et mécanismes de formulation des politiques
   et de programmation des investissements dans le secteur rural.

Ces outils et m écanismes ont permis aux s tructures techniq ues, aux co llectivités et aux
organisations des producteurs d'avoir une meilleure maîtrise des recettes et des dépenses,
l'insertion du volet agricole dans les PDSE C des communes, une orientation stratégique
du développement du secteur ;

                                            50
   a) La réorg anisation des services avec la          ré alisation e n cours d e l' audit
      organisationnel, le recensem ent des agents , l'introduction des logiciels de gestion
      des ressou rces hum aines (PROFIL) et des ressources financières (PRED) et
      l'adoption de tous les textes statutai     res qui donneront leurs plein effet le
      redéploiement effectif des agents.
   b) Le développ ement d' outils e t m écanismes de formulation d es politiqu es et de
      programmation des investissem ents (CDMT, PDCARPE, r éférentiels techniques
      et statistiques tels que les bases de données sur les ressources am énageables, le
      recensement général de l'agriculture). Les LOA et LPDSC ont été par en outre été
      élaborés au cours de cette phase.
   c) L'efficacité dans la m ise en oeuvr e des p rogrammes sp éciaux (VIH/SIDA,
      Pesticides obsolètes, interventions d'urgence), Le PASAOP a conduit avec succès
      les programmes spécifiques de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA avant la m ise en oeuvre
      du PNLS, le Program me Africain relatif au stock de Pesticides obsolètes, la
      gestion efficace du la lutte anti acridienne, Grippe aviaire.
   d) Des capacités techniques renf orcées notamm ent dans le s dom aines d'évaluation
      d'impact environnem ental, de la réglem entation et du contrôle, de la gestion
      financière, du S&E.
   e) La déconcentration des ressources budgétair es, m atérielles et équipem ents qui a
      amélioré le cadre de travail des agents.
   f) Le transfert vers les colle ctivités et les services privés, notamm ent pour les
      services v étérinaires e t l' insémination artif icielle, la ge stion d es abatto irs
      régionaux, la production des semences et des plants forestiers et fruitiers

V. Facteurs ayant affecté la mise en oeuvre du projet

Facteurs exogènes

L'invasion acridienne de 2004 a affecté le programm e de 2007, tous les acteurs et les
moyens logistiques du programme étaient mobilisés pour faire face à cette crise.

La perte de valeurs du dollar sur marché international a affecté le DTS donc les couts.

L'instabilité du personnel du coté de la Banque. Les ch angements de TTL et autres
consultants de la Banque (S         pécialiste institutionnel, agents des services de
décaissements) ont entrainé des difficulté     s de clôture du crédit 3     583MLI et des
changements de vision dans la conduite du pr ogramme et, les changem ents de cadres de
l'Etat à différents niveaux de re sponsabilité dans les structures chargées de la m ise en
oeuvre du projet (national, régional, local)    , les élections au niveau des chambres
d'agricultures qui ont abouti au renouvellement des élus à 70 percent ont occasionné la
reprise de certaines formation déjà exécutées. La régularité et l'efficacité des missions de
supervision sanctionnées par des aides m        émoires ont perm is suivi rapproché du
programme




                                            51
Facteurs endogènes ­facteurs positifs et négatifs

Au cours de la m ise en oeuvre du PASAOP, un remaniement Ministériel est intervenu en
2004 qui a eu pour conséquence l'éclatem ent du Ministère du Développem ent Rural en
exacerbant les problèmes de coordination notamment au niveau des composante AZ et C.
La revue à m i parcours a instruit de travai ller avec les quatre départem ents ce qui a eu
pour conséquence une dispersion des ressources ; la disparition de la DGRC qui avait
déjà atteint la quasi-totalité de ses objectifs. Les changements intervenus dans la durée de
vie du prog ramme initialement prévu en 3 phases de 3, 4 et 4 ans il a é té ramené à une
phase et un supplémental.

Performance des structures

Le PASAOP a permis aux différentes structures de l'état de remplir leur rôle respectifs en
les dotant d' équipem ents véhicule et ordinate urs et en réalisant une série de for mations.
Tous les services agricoles ont été redynamisés par ce programme.

IX. Performance de la Banque et du Gouvernement

Suivi du programme au niveau du Ministère de tutelle et des composantes

La qualité des relations entre la Banque m ondiale et le Gouvernem ent du Mali est jugée
satisfaisante tout au long de l'exécution du programm e. Les m issions de supervisions
conjointes, régulièrement organisées, ainsi que les revues annu elles du po rtefeuille de la
Banque m ondiale ont perm is aux deux parties de partager les inform ations utiles et de
trouver un consensus sur les grandes difficultés constatées durant la m ise en oeuvre du
programme.
Les formations continues dans les domaines clé ont été d'un grand a pport à la réussite du
programme.

XI. Perspectives, enjeux, recommandations

L'objectif global assigné au PA SAOP (initialement prévu pour une durée de 11 ans) était
de contribuer à réduire la pauvreté en milieu rural à travers le renforcement des capacités
et de la p roductivité des acteu rs du secteu r rural, par l'am élioration du savoir faire en
Agriculture, la diffusion des technologies, la gouvernance et la pl eine participation des
organisations de producteurs à la croissance économique.

La m ise en oeuvre du programm e a perm is d'avoir de nom breux acquis et d'ouvrir de
nouvelles pistes qui m éritent d'être poursuivies et consolidée s à travers les programm es
futurs, notamment le P rogramme National d'I nvestissement dans le Secteur Agricole
(PNISA) et le West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP).

Il s'agit de :

         renforcer la synergie entre les différents cadres de concertation pour une meilleure
         prise en compte des besoins des producteurs et des questions environnementales
         fusionner le SIAGRI et la SRAMA en une seule manifestation ;
         renforcer le lien recherche-vulgarisatio     n-producteur dans le transfert des
         technologies et la remontée des besoins de recherche agricole ;
         poursuivre l'implication du secteur privé, des collectivités territoriales, des OP et
         des ONG dans le financement de la recherche et de la vulgarisation Agricole ;
         recruter du personnel et re nforcer les capacité s des ressources hum aines à travers
         la formation ;
         mettre en place un m        écanisme pérenne de financem ent de l'agricu lture,
         notamment la recherche, la vu lgarisation, le crédit renforcer l'approche filière
         dans la mise en oeuvre des programmes ;
         maintenir et renforcer les CRRVA avec une pl us forte implication des services de
         vulgarisation agricole ;
         pérenniser l'approche du « supplémental » dans la diffusion des technologies et
         poursuivre sur le W AAPP certaines activit és en cours de ré alisation notamment
         celles relatives à la chèvre Guerra, au Jardin Potager Af ricain, à la Pomme de
         terre.



                                              53
Au titre de l'amélioration de la d iffusion et de l'application des résultats de la recherche.
Sur l'ensemble des technologies développées, se pt (7 ) on t été d iffusées dans toutes les
régions. Il s 'agit des variétés am éliorées d e niébé, des v ariétés am éliorées de m aïs, du
jardin potager africain, des micros plantules et mini tubercules de semences de pomme de
terre, des vitro plants de bananier, de la    volaille am éliorée wassachie et de la ch èvre
Guerra pour la production de lait. Les activités ont été exécutées de façon collégiale entre
la recherche, la vulgarisation.

Au titre du renforcem ent des capacités des ressources hum aines. Les form ations ont
concerné les agents des services de vulga risation, les chercheurs, les producteurs et
productrices. Celles-ci se résument comme suit :
    - formations de longue durée : 46 chercheurs de l'IER, du CNRA et du LCV
    - formations de courte durée du personnel de la recherche : 74 agents de l'IER, du
         CNRA et du LCV
    - les formations des agents des services de vulgarisation : 147 agents formés
    - formations des producteurs et produc trices : 164 personnes for mées dont 74
         productrices.
    - La form ation de deux cadres de la DNACPN en DESS en sciences de
         l'environnement

Ces for mations ont perm is aux structures concernées de m ieux re mplir leurs m issions
respectives et d'acqu érir un certain niveau de performance à trave rs l'amélioration de la
qualité des rapports et des propos itions des thèm es de recherch e. Ceci s'est traduit par
une réduction du taux de rejet des projets par la commission scientifique.

XII. Evaluation économique et financière

Analyse du coût total

        Situation des prévisions de départ et   des coûts réels pour les différentes
        composantes et catégories de dépenses du programme

En référence à l'accord de crédit N° 3583 MLI du 12 décembre 2001, le m ontant total du
crédit initial est de 32,2 00 millions DTS, soit 32,5 m illiards de FC FA environ (1D TS =
950FCFA). A cela s'ajoute le crédit n° 3583-1 ­MLI du 5 juin 2007 d'un m ontant de
13,300 m illions DTS, soit environ 10 m illiards de FCFA ( 1DTS = 752 FCFA). Ce qui
porte le coût total prévu (initial et additionnel) du programme à 45,500 millions DTS, soit
42,5 milliards de FCFA (voir annexe 4).

Les réalisations financières dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre du programme se chiffrent
à la somm e totale de 40, 325 milliards de Fr ancs CFA (décais sés), ce qu i donne un taux
d'exécution global de 94,90 percent à la date du 31 décembre 2009.
La situ ation f inancière par com posante s e pr ésente a insi q ue suit (en m illiers d e f rancs

        Situation du m ontant et du niveau de         recouvrement de la contrepartie du
        gouvernement.

En ce qui concerne la contrepartie malienne (annexe 5), sur les 7, 551 m illiards de francs
CFA notifiés, 6,748 m illiards de francs CFA ont été décais sés à la date d u 30 septem bre
2009, soit un taux d'exécution de 89,36 percent. Cependant, la m ise à disposition de la
contrepartie malienne a souffert de grands retards, (allant à plus d'un an souvent), qui ont
affecté la mise en oeuvre régulière des activités du programme à partir de 2006.

Conséquences prévisibles de la fin du programme sur les structures institutionnelles mises
en place dans le cadre du programme

Principaux enseignements

En l'absence d'études économiques spécifiques sur les résultats à la fin du programme, il
faut noter que la m ise en oeuvre du PASAOP a contribué d'une part à la cr oissance de
l'économie du Mali à travers l'accroissem ent des productions et de la productivité
agricole, d'autre part à l'am élioration de s revenus des producteurs consécutive aux
changements et à l'innovation ag ricole dans les dom aines des récoltes, de l'élevage et de
la comm ercialisation prim aire. En outre , le PASAOP a a morcé un véritable élan
d'implication du secteu r privé dans les ac tivités agrico les e t renf orcé le s capac ités des
organisations des producteurs dans la gouvernance du secteur et la four niture de services
aux producteurs (Cf. résultats Composantes B, C, D).

       Annex 8. Comments of Co financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Introduction

Dans le cadre de la finalisation du rappor t d'achèvement du PASAOP, le Gouvernement
du Mali a organisé un      atelier à l'intention d e bénéf iciaires afin d e recueillir leurs
appréciations, avis et témoignages sur la mise en oeuvre du Programm e. Cet atelier a été
placé sous la haute prés idence d e Monsieur Moussa Léo S idibé, Secrétaire Général du
Ministère de l'Agriculture.

L'atelier a enregistré la participation de plus de 20 personnes représentant les producteurs,
les organisations des producteur s, les prestataires de serv ices d'appui conseil et les
services techniques (voir liste des participants en annexe).

Après le mot d'ouverture du Secrétaire Général, il a été procédé à un tour de table afin de
permettre à chaque participant de se présen ter. La phase active de l' atelier a commenc é
avec la présentation du Rapport d'achèvem       ent du PASAOP en PowerPoint par le
facilitateur et la traduction simultanée en langue nationale bamanankan pour en faciliter
la compréhension par les producteurs.

Suite à cette présentation, la pa role a été donnée à chaque participant à tour de rôle sur la
mise en oeuvre du Programme.

Ainsi, les témoignages recueillis auprès de s bénéficiaires sont présentés ci-après par
catégorie socioprofessionnelle.

LES PRODUCTEURS ET LEURS ORGANISATIONS

   -   Ibrahima DIAKITE Président CRU Sotuba-Planteur maraîcher. Avant le
       PASAOP les producteurs n'acco rdaient beaucoup d'importance à l'adhésion au x
       chambres d'Agriculture. Pendant les vot es les producteurs intéressés étaient
       obligés de chercher les autres à ven ir voter. Avec l'avènement du PASAOP, on a
       eu des renforcem ents de capacités qui nous ont perm is de financer nos réunions,
       d'effectuer des voyages d'échange avec de s paysans qui n'avaient jam ais vu un
       aéroport à fortiori rentrer dans un avion. Les associations de Ba mako qui étaient
       au nom bre de 30 sont aujourd'hu i au nom bre de 1000. Grâce au PASAOP, les
       problèmes de m ortalités des pinta deaux ont été résolus rapidem ent à travers le
       mécanisme de recherch e à la dem ande. No tre association paie sur fon ds propre
       depuis deux ans les frais de connexion Inte rnet de la Cha mbre d'Agriculture de
       Bamako.

   -   Daouda TANGARA producteur de Bla. Grâce aux for mations sur la gestion
       coopérative et l'approche ch aîne de valeurs et la fa brication du com post, nous
       avons créé notre association des       producteurs de pastèque (ZÉ        RÉTON).
       Aujourd'hui, notre association est m ieux organisée, leadeur et tire meilleur profit
       de la culture de pastèque.
        


                                              56
-   Abdou TOURE producteur de banane à Kayes. Nous avons bénéficié des
    formations en gestion et de nouvelles       variétés de bananes dans le cadre du
    supplémental sous forme de vitro plants. A ce jour il y a un grand engouem ent
    autour de notre association dont le      nombre est passé de 40 à plus de 100
    producteurs. Ces variétés ont perm is d' améliorer notre productivité et notre
    revenu. A titre d'exem ple, le poids est passé de 18kg à 30kg par régime, pour un
    prix m oyen qui passe de 125FCFA/Kg à         200FCFA/Kg. Ces variétés (Grande
    Naine, FHIA 23 et Populo ) ont produit 83 rejets qui ont été distribués à d'autres
    producteurs.

-   Bréhima DEMBELE Producteur de niébé en culture associée. Avec le PASAOP
    avons abandonné la culture associée au profit de la culture pure du Niébé. Cette
    pratique nous a perm is de faire la double culture d'hivernage du Niébé et
    d'étendre nos superficies de 2500m² à        1Ha. Cela a fortem ent a mélioré nos
    productions et nos revenus. Actuellem ent, je gagne trois fois plus sur seulem ent
    un quart par rapport à la production totale en culture associée (180kg contre 50kg).
    Dans le village, tout le m     onde a a dopté la culture pure du Niébé (variété
    Korobalen). Le programme nous é galement formé sur la bonne la conservation
    du Niébé et la préparation du compost. C'est grâce au PASAOP que j'ai vu pour
    la première, à 55 ans, la ville de Bamako.
     

-   Issa CISSE : Éleveur, emboucheur à Sirakorola ­ Région de Koulikoro :
    initialement nous vendions les animaux à 50 000FCFA. Après les formations du
    PASAOP sur les techniques d'em bouche, nos anim aux e mbouchés sont vendus
    entre 148 000 ET 150 000FCFA. L'état de mes anim aux a suscité un grands
    engouement auprès de autres éleveurs à te l point que je suis devenu le f ormateur
    dans le village. Mainten ant je gagne bi en ma vie grâce aux revenus tirés de m es
    activités d'embouche.
     

-   Demba DIA, éleveur, président de la Délégation Locale d'Agriculture de Kéniéba
    (Région de Kayes : J'ai connu le PASAOP à tr          avers une m ission de notre
    coopérative à Kayes. Le formations que j'ai reçues dans le cadre de ce programme
    m'ont permis de com prendre le fonctionne ment des chambres d'agriculture et
    surtout le m ode d'organisation des élections . A la date d'aujourd'hui, je prends
    moi-même les procès verbaux (PV) des ré unions en peulh. J'ai pris conscience
    que je suis m aintenant très im portant, car je participe à toutes les rencontres
    organisées par le Préfet au niveau du cer cle. A ce titre j'ai sollicité et o btenu un
    local pour servir de siège à la DLCA qui fut équipé par le Programme. Autre fois,
    c'est l'anim ateur qui signait m es ordr es de m ission m ais, quand j'ai com pris
    l'importance de m a fonction à travers les form ations du PASAOP, je signe
    désormais les ordres de missions de l'animateur et les miens le sont par le Préfet.
    Je souhaite que les p rogrammes futurs pren nent en charge les frais de restitu tion
    des réunions à la base.




                                         57
-   Kadiatou KANTE, maraichère, Présidente de la coopérative des femmes
    productrices des semences de pomme de terre à Niono, région de Ségou : Grâce
    aux actions que j'ai m enées au sein du CLCE pour la défense des m icroprojets
    soumis au financement du PASAOP, j'ai acquis une grande popularité auprès des
    associations et groupem ents féminins qui m'a prévalu d'être él ue au poste de 1 er
    adjoint au m aire de la co mmune urbaine de Niono. Aujourd'hui avec les revenus
    tirés de la production des sem ences de pomme de terre, j'ai pu payer un véhicule
    et une autre fe mme de ma coopérative a payé deux bovins. Nous avons pu forger
    une place de choix dans l'interprofessi    on de la pomme de terre. J'ai aussi
    bénéficié de formation, de voyages d'études et une unité de Wassashie. Je suggère
    de prendre en com pte dans les programmes futurs le recyclage des membres et la
    gestion des calamités (sècheresse, inondations, etc.).

-   Mamadou DIARRE : Producteur, Président de la Délégation Locale de la
    Chambre d'Agriculture de Baraouéli, région de Ségou, Médaillé du Mérite
    Agricole :
    Grâce au programme, j'ai pu bénéficié de formations et de voyages d'études qui
    m'ont per mis de développer des relations avec d'autres partenaires (PA CR, S G
    2000) pour le financem ent des activ ités d'embouche à hau teur de 20 m illions de
    FCFA.

-   Aissata DIALLO, Productrice, éleveur de Chèvre Guerra à Baraouéli, région de
    Ségou:Dans le cadre du PASAOP, j'ai bénéficié d'une         unité de chèvre Guerra
    dont la production a attein t 3 litres de lait par chèvre et par jour contre
    0,5litre/Jour pour la race locale. Mon un ité a perm is de doter 10 fam illes en
    métisses. Actuellement, on peut affirmer que dans notre village, la chèvre Guerra
    est largement adoptée.

-   RENE ALPHONSE, éleveur, Président de la Fédération des Groupements
    Interprofessionnels de la filière Bétail/Viande FEBEVIM, Président de la CRA du
    District de Bamako : C'est grâce au programme que nos bureaux sont désorm ais
    fonctionnels et équipés d'Internet. Les      actions de renforcem ent des capacités
    financées par le programme nous ont permis d'avoir les compétences pour faire le
    plaidoyer, trouver des financem ents, renouv eler trois f ois nos instances et
    développer des partenariats avec notamment Cl ermont Ferrand qui a assuré la
    formation des bouchers de la région de Mopti. Ces bouchers sont aujourd'hui
    utilisés comme formateurs sur les technique s de découpe de la viande en France.
    Dans le cadre de l'élevage de la ch èvre Guerra, mon parc, à pa rtir de deux unités
    (10 chèvres), malgré la perte de 4 sujets, enregistre à ce jour un effectif de 15 têtes
    soit une amélioration de plus 150 percent en deux ans.
    Ce programm e a per mis l'ém ancipation des éleveurs à travers les voyages
    d'études et d'échanges d'expériences partout dans le monde, amélioré les revenus
    et fait reculer la pauvreté dans le monde des éleveurs. De nos jours, la m ise en
    oeuvre de la stra tégie de transf ert des inf rastructures p roductives s'e st tr aduite
    pars l'acquisition des abattoirs par les privés.
    Je suggère de supprim er les fonds de contre partie de l'Ét at et de trouver une
    formule plus adaptée, de m ettre en place des fonds de roulem ent pour les
    producteurs et assurer le financement de leurs activités par les banques classiques.

                                          58
LES PRESTATAIRES DE SERVICES D'APPUI CONSEIL

   -   Amadou GUINDO, Prestataire Conseil Sahélien d'Appui à l'autopromotion et le
       Développement (COSADEV) à Cinzana, région de Ségou : grâce aux
       financements du PASAOP la fourniture de l'appui conseil aux producteurs a pu
       être transférée dans certaines zones aux prestataires privés. C'est ains i que m on
       ONG, qui a uparavant intervenait dans 30 villages, a pu élargir son appui à 55
       villages de la Commune rura le de Cinza na. Cette interven tion a perm is
       d'amélioration du rendement du mil qui est passé de 600kg/ha à 1000kg/ha. Mon
       ONG a renforcé la couverture en personne l d'appui conseil de 8 à 10agents. Le
       Maire de Cinzana continue d'utiliser nos services après la clôture du PASAOP.
       Dans le dom aine de l'élevage, les boeuf s de labour ont été m ieux traités. Enfin,
       l'intervention de m on ONG a per mis l'e mpoissonnement de 4 m ares et le
       reboisement d'un quart d'ha.

   -   Mme Koné Astan K Traoré de l'ONG ACFR (Banamba, Dioïla) : La formation
       PASAOP a perm is d'as surer l'alev inage des mares et bancôtières, la facilitation
       de l'exhaure de l'eau, la diffusion des se mences a méliorées de m il, sorgho, etc.
       Les producteurs ont bénéficié de form ation en a mélioration de la production
       laitière qui est passée de 0,5litre à 3litres par vache. Le P ASAOP a égalem ent
       permis la réduction de l'exode des f illes grâce au développ ement des activ ités
       génératrices de revenus (AGR). Les revenus tirés du maraîchage ont accru de 20 à
       40 percent chez les femmes.

       Comme insuffisance on peut not er le déficit d'infor mation des acteurs autour du
       paiement de la contribution des bénéficiaires estimée à 20 percent selon les termes
       du contrat de prestation.

   -   Diabirou MAIGA, Prestataire, ONG CARD, Dioïla, région de Koulikoro : la
       perception que j'ai du Programm e, est qu'il a perm is le renforcem ent des liens
       entre les s ervices tec hniques e t les p restataires, l'am élioration du niveau
       d'adoption des technologies par effet «        tâche d'huile », l'am élioration de la
       production de m iel, la m ise en place des activités génératrices de revenus des
       femmes, l' empoissonnement des m are. Comme faiblesses on peut noter                  :
       l'insuffisance des ressources mises à la dis position des prestataires, le retard dans
       la reprise des activités, la faible mobilisation des fonds des collectivités.

CLÔTURE DE L'ATELIER

A la fin des tém oignages, le Coordinateur du P ASAOP a rem ercié, au nom du Ministre
de l'Agriculture, l'ensemble des participants pour avoir exprimé leurs sentiments sincères
sur la mise en oeuvre du PASAOP et formulé des suggestions pour les programmes futurs.
Le Coordinateur a ensuite dem andé à l'équipe de facilitation d'intégrer fidèlem ent ces
témoignages au rapport final d'achèvement du PASAOP dans les meilleurs délais.
