This report examines\n            the negative environmental impacts anticipated from the\n            project and suggests mitigations. Indiscriminate expansion\n            into the arid lands should be cautiously held in check, and\n            intensification of agriculture in the high potential areas,\n            must be associated with appropriate land use practices. Soil\n            erosion and degradation is already a serious problem and\n            sustainability of the natural resource base must be\n            apriority in the strategy. While the increased use of\n            inorganic fertilizers and pesticides are important to\n            increase productivity and output, this must be associated\n            with an integrated \"agro-ecological\" approach to\n            agricultural research and extension which stress\n            conservation measures such as maintaining vegetative cover\n            and retention of soil organic matter as well as integrated\n            pest management. During negotiation assurances were obtained\n            that the Government would have applied standards and\n            procedures for using agricultural chemicals in connection\n            with agricultural extension activities; and includes a\n            Safeguard Policy with a specific provision for co-financing\n            the removal of obsolete pesticide stock throughout the country."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
