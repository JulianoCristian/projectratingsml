would assist in alleviating\n            some critical weaknesses in road planning, design,\n            construction, and maintenance activities of the federal\n            highway authorities. It would consist of strengthening about\n            520 km of federal roads, and carrying out economic and\n            engineering studies of a major North-South road and a survey\n            to establish improvement priorities for the federal trunk\n            road network. Consultants would be engaged to continue and\n            expand a program for the training of road maintenance\n            technicians, and experts recruited to fill critical\n            positions in the Federal Ministry of Works. The project\n            would also assist in constructing 14 staff housing units,\n            and in providing road safety and pavement testing equipment.\n            There are no unusual risks for this type of project."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
