environmental\n            sustainability, including climate change considerations, in\n            key sectoral policies and programs; and c) improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of environmental management\n            processes. The program supported by this ongoing DPL series\n            has a focus on the energy sector and greenhouse gas\n            emissions. There are four main risks to the program's\n            outcomes: 1) economic risks; 2) political risks; 3)\n            implementation and social risks in the energy sector; and 4)\n            program and implementation risks in the climate change and\n            environmental management areas."}, "docdt": "2012-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
