7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it expands to
include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport infrastructure and by strengthening the city's
decision support system on land development and management. Specifically, the project supports peri-
urban development in Nantai Island with: (a) investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and
public transport); and (b) TA that would help the city to strengthen the manner in which the development is
planned (to encourage development patterns that promote public transport while integrating environmental
concerns upstream in the planning process), and the manner in which the development is implemented (to
improve urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods, and to increase the city's
capacity to phase and stage development in a market environment while increasing the quality and
competitiveness of public transport).
