Dear Ms. Zou,
Re: Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban Development Project
(Loan No. 4812-CHA)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Agreement) between the People's Republic of China (the
"Borrower") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the "Bank") dated
November 21, 2006, as amended (the "Loan Agreement"), to assist in the financing of the above-
captioned Project (the "Project"). We also refer to our discussions with Fuzhou Municipality (the
"Project Implementing Entity") during the implementation support mission held from October 17 to
October 19, 2012, and the letter from Mr. Yang Yingming, Deputy Director-General, International
Department, dated on February 6, 2013, on behalf of the Borrower, requesting the Bank to amend a
number of provisions of the Loan Agreement.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, agrees with your request,
and accordingly, proposes the following amendments to the Loan Agreement:
I.     The Bank acknowledges the Borrower cancels, as of February 6, 2013, the amount of US$6.33
million from the Loan Account, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from
February 6, 2013. Schedule 3, the Amortization Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a result of the
cancellation, and the revised figures will be sent to you shortly.
2.     We refer to the Project Implementing Entity's letter of request. The US$6.33 million
cancellation consists of US$4.16 million under Category (2), originally for ITS system procurement; and
US$2.17 million under Category (3), which contains US$0.32 million for a constrction supervision fee
for Jinshan Bus Depot and US$1.85 million for Technical Assistance expenditures.
3.     Paragraph I of the Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to read as set out in the
Attachment to this letter.
4.     The Closing Date of the Loan in section 2.03 of the Article I to the Loan Agreement is amended
to read "May 31, 2013".
5.    In accordance with the current practice of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the Bank), further disbursements from the loan will be made for withdrawal applications
received by the Bank by close of business on September 30, 2013 in respect of eligible expenditures
made before the closing date of May 31, 2013. (i.e. payments made or payments due for goods, works
and services that have been provided prior to the Closing Date). Proceeds of the Loan remaining
unwithdrawn after disbursements have been made in respect of these withdrawal applications will be
canceled.
