7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it
expands to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport infrastructure and by
strengthening the city's decision support system on land development and management.


                                               3
Specifically, the project supports peri-urban development in Nantai Island with: (a)
investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and public transport); and (b) TA that
would help the city to strengthen the manner in which the development is planned (to
encourage development patterns that promote public transport while integrating environmental
concerns upstream in the planning process), and the manner in which the development is
implemented (to improve urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods,
and to increase the city's capacity to phase and stage development in a market environment
while increasing the quality and competitiveness of public transport).
7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes [if applicable]



     B. Project Implementation Status and Reasons for Restructuring
 Despite delays, implementation of the project is currently progressing towards
 achievement of the project development objectives. As of May 30, 2011, 75.3% of the
 Loan has been disbursed. The major investment which has been long delayed is the
 construction of Jinshan Bus Depot, which is critical to achievement of the project
 development objective. The delay was mainly caused by land acquisition and
 resettlement, and also recent institutional reforms in the urban transport sector.

 To complete remaining project activities, particularly the construction of Jinshan Bus
 Depot, and therefore fully achieve the project development objective, Fuzhou Municipal
 Government has requested for an extension of the Loan for 21 months till March 31,
 2013. The 21-months extension is calculated based on the time required to complete the
 construction of the Jinshan Bus Depot. The proposed extension would also allow full
 completion of other remaining project activities, such as the remaining works of Kuiqi
 Bridge and the Third Ring Road and remaining technical assistance activities. The PMO
 has developed an implementation plan which sets up milestones for monitoring
 completion of all remaining activities.

    CHINA — FUZHOU NANTAI ISLAND PERI-URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                       P070519 {LOAN NO.48120}1

                          Restructuring Paper for Extension of the Loan

1.      The closing date for China, Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban Development
Project, [Loan No 48120], P070519 will be extended from June 30, 2011 till March 31,
2013.
2.      The Loan became effective on February 16, 2007, and disbursement of the Loan
experienced significant delays during the early stage of project implementation, primarily
related to resettlement. However, the project implementation started progressing well
after mid-2009. As of May 30, 2011, more than 75% of the Loan has been disbursed.
3.      Implementation Status of Major Project Activities. All investments under the
Strategic Road Infrastructure Component are either completed or close to completion.
Remaining civil works of Kuiqi Bridge and the Third Ring Road will be completed by
end of December 2012.
4.      Construction of Jinshan Bus Depot under the Public Transport Component was
long delayed mainly because of the following two factors: (i) very difficult and slow land
acquisition process;2 and (ii) very recent reforms in public transport operations and
management, which took place in late 2010 and early 2011 and led to changes in detailed
designs and bid documents. The bids for civil works and equipment contracts are to be
invited by end of June 2011, and all civil works and installation of equipment are
expected to be completed by end of March 2013.
5.      Additionally, technical assistance (TA) activities under the institutional
development component are being modified to better address the needs of newly
established Fuzhou Urban Transport Commission. The proposed loan extension will
ensure sufficient time for preparing and implementing these TA activities.
6.      Justification for 21 Months of Extension. The proposed extension is necessary
to ensure completion of all remaining project activities, particularly construction of
Jinshan Bus Depot, which is critical to achieving the development objectives of the
Project.
7.      The PMO has prepared an implementation plan which sets up milestones for
monitoring completion of all remaining project activities within the extension. The task
team reviewed the action plan and found it acceptable.
8.      This will be the first extension of the project.

  It should be noted that the slow land acquisition process has, to a certain extent, demonstrated the willingness of
Fuzhou Municipal Government and relevant District Governments to listen to complaints and concerns of affected
villages and families and their commitment to working with the affected to find mutually agreeable solutions. Both the
municipal and district government officials have been reluctant to exercise enforcement actions on those villagers who
stayed on site and asked for additional compensation, despite they knew further consultation with these people would
cause delays in the project implementation and thus affect performance evaluation of government officials involved.
Almost all resettlement activities currently have been completed. Not only has no single violent case been reported, but
also a number of good practices in resettlement have emerged from the implementation of this project, including
relocating and renovating a hundred years old Church with very minor damage (refer to MTR Aide Memoire) and a
smooth participatory resettlement process for a large number of displaced families.
