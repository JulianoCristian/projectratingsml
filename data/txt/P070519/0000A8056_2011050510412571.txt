                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it expands to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic
                         transport infrastructure and by strengthening the city's decision support system on land development and management.

                          Specifically, the project supports peri-urban development in Nantai Island with: (a) investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and public transport);
                         and (b) TA that would help the city to strengthen the manner in which the development is planned (to encourage development patterns that promote public
                         transport while integrating environmental concerns upstream in the planning process), and the manner in which the development is implemented (to improve
                         urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods, and to increase the city's capacity to phase and stage development in a market
                         environment while increasing the quality and competitiveness of public transport).
