Comments:         Substantially achieved. All major works for all three road investments have
                  been completed, and all three are now fully operational.

                  At the FMG’s request, Section III of Nanjiangbin Road (16% of the original
                  project extension) was dropped due to changes in planned road network
                  needs. Functionality of Nanjiangbin Road was not compromised by this
                  change. Bank financing for this section was reallocated to other elements of
                  the road component.

                  The non-motorized transport access ramps to the Kuiqi Bridge have not been
                  completed, due to delays in carrying out necessary resettlement activities

Comments:       Procurement of dispatching equipment and other ITS was dropped from the
                Bank-financed project as part of the second restructuring conducted in March
                2013. However, FMG kept this initiative, and expanded it in scope, in line
                with the Bank’s suggestions. The equipment will be deployed and operational
                in early 2014.

                                        viii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Context

1.       At the time of appraisal (July 2005) China continued to experience high levels of
economic growth and its cities had become vibrant economic engines. China’s achievements in
terms of economic growth and poverty reduction in the preceding 25 years had been impressive,
quadrupling per capita Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and lifting over 400 million people from
absolute poverty. The 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2006), aiming to achieve annual GDP growth
rates of at minimum 7 percent, had been characterized as one of transition from a rural to an
urban economy, and the ongoing structural changes were evident. From 1995 to 2002, Chinese
cities had increased their population by 150 million residents, and, by 2005, they were attracting
more than 50 percent of all foreign direct investment in the country.

2.      At the local level, cities, particularly those in the fast growing coastal regions, were
grappling with rapid transformations. Their growing population required fast production of new
housing units, be it by the redevelopment of the existing city or its expansion to undeveloped
areas. The expansion of most cities to agricultural or mixed-use lands in their periphery was
imminent, and, thus, strategic investments in infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure,
were necessary to support that process and ensure good accessibility moving forward.

3.      Most Chinese cities, however, lacked the institutional capacity, as it pertained to decision
support tools and implementation systems, to manage their growth strategically towards agreed-
upon economic development and sustainability goals. Global experience indicates that urban
development is path-dependent, meaning that once strategic investments are made and trends take
hold, development patterns are ‘locked in’ along a particular path that is exceptionally hard to
reverse. As such, if growing cities continued their peri-urban expansion in an unplanned manner,
the consequences could be very costly for the millions of Chinese urban dwellers and future
generations to come.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

4.       In relation to the ongoing process of urban expansion and peri-urban development, there
were two areas for Bank involvement. First, the Bank could offer cities technical and financial
support to conduct strategic transport infrastructure investments that facilitated the expansion in
efficient and sustainable patterns. Second, the Bank could work alongside city governments to
help put in place the requisite structure of institutions, policies and mechanisms that would guide
city expansion within those same lines of efficiency and sustainability.

5.       Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, was a rapidly growing city where Bank’s
involvement could have an impact. Local GDP growth had averaged 13-16 percent in the
preceding decade and pressures for rapid urban expansion were accelerating. The city projected
that its population would grow from 1.58 million in 2002 to over 2.4 million in 2020, with a
parallel increase in per capita income from US$1,070 to US$10,000.

6.      The Fuzhou Municipal Government (FMG) requested the Bank to support the
construction of three major road projects and a bus depot in Nantai Island, one of its designated
areas for urban expansion. Located south of Fuzhou’s city center within the bordering Min River,
Fuzhou’s Master Plan dictated that Nantai Island, which has a surface of 142 km2, should


                                                 1
increase its urbanized area from 12 km2 (8.5 percent) in 1999 to 121 km2 (85 percent) in 2020 to
accommodate the expected population growth from 344,000 to 800,000 residents in that period.
The proposed road investments constituted the core transport infrastructure investments devised
to set off the urbanization of Nantai Island. Bank involvement would see that these investments
were made in ways that supported public transport use and encouraged the use of non-motorized
modes, thus providing quality services for lower-income populations and offering alternatives to
help reduce overall dependence on private vehicle use.

7.       The FMG also asked for additional Bank support to strengthen its ability to manage the
city’s growth and peri-urban expansion processes, through two strategic lines of work. First, the
FMG requested the Bank’s contribution to review and update the city’s Urban Transport and
Urban Development Master Plans (official revisions to the then active 1995-2010 Plans were due
in 2006), particularly, in relation to the expansion of public transport services in the city. Second,
the FMG requested the Bank’s help to strengthen the local institutions, systems and processes to
carry out the necessary infrastructure investments (transport, energy, water and sanitation, etc.) to
carry out the city’s peri-urban expansion agenda effectively.

8.      More generally, the rationale was that through a Bank investment project, the FMG
would have the opportunity to learn from the Bank’s experience in institutional development,
procurement and financial management, both globally and throughout China. This would be the
first Bank project prepared and implemented by the FMG. At the appraisal stage, the Bank Task
Team was already reporting signs of the positive impact of the Bank’s rigor in project preparation
on local agencies’ staff. Moving forward to implementation, the Bank’s involvement was also
expected to contribute better procurement under Bank guidelines, and improved project
management and construction quality.

Contribution to Higher Level Objectives

9.       With China entering the ranks of middle-income developing countries in 2000, the
Bank’s 2003-2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sought to support the country through a
period of crucial transitions. In particular, the CAS aimed to aid the country in: (i) the transition
from a rural, agricultural society to an urban, industrial society; and (ii) the transition from a
centrally-planned economy to a more globally integrated market-based economy. The project
looked to assist Fuzhou through such transitions by offering technical and financial assistance in
support of the city’s peri-urban expansion. The project’s potential demonstrational effects could
also prove to have positive impact in other cities in the country going through a similar process.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

PDO

10.     Project Development Objective is to support sustainable peri-urban development in
Fuzhou (as it expands to include Nantai Island) by providing strategic transport infrastructure and
by strengthening the City’s decision support system on land development and management.

Key Indicators

11.     The key project outcome indicators selected (detailed in Data Sheet, Section F, above)
were indicators measuring the urban development activity in Nantai Island (population, and size
of manufacturing industry), reduction in travel times between locations in Nantai Island and
central Fuzhou, and the adoption of the recommendations of the TA component leading to


                                                  2
outcomes such as more effective transit-oriented development and more effective public transport
service. In turn, the key project output indicators monitored the implementation of selected
priority investments, and the successful completion of the TA activities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

12.     The PDO and key indicators were not changed throughout the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.     The proposed project beneficiaries were, in general, the population of Fuzhou, as the
development of Nantai Island would allow efficient and sustainable urban growth to
accommodate the city’s growing population and expanding industries, thus preventing
overcrowding and congestion. The primary target group was comprised of those residing,
commuting or traveling to Nantai Island at the time, and those projected to do so in the
foreseeable future. Another target group included the municipal institutions responsible for land
use planning and management that would be strengthened through TA and institutional
development activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.     The project was structured in three different components:

15.     A strategic road infrastructure component (US$248.64 million, US$88.22 Bank
financing) comprising the construction of three road projects to facilitate the urbanization of
Nantai Island: (i) Nanjiangbin Road, a 4.1 km riverside road along the south bank of the Min
River, coupled with a 1.1 km southern approach road to the Qianheng Bridge and the local road
network of Nantai Island; (ii) the southern section of the Third Ring Road (hereon simplified as
Third Ring Road), an 11.6 km segment of a six-lane expressway providing expedient mobility
across Nantai Island and opening up new areas for urban development; and (iii) the Kuiqi Bridge,
a double-pylon, double-plane, cable-stayed structure across the Min River, serving as the
connecting link in the road network between Nantai Island and Fuzhou’s urban core.

16.     A public transport component (US$20.50 million, US$8.87 Bank financing) aiming to
improve the efficiency and quality of service of public transport in Nantai Island through the
construction of the Jinshan Bus Depot, a facility to integrate overnight parking and a maintenance
depot for buses, a dispatch center, and a passenger interchange. In addition, the component
included the enhancement of on-street operations through the introduction of different
technologies and on-street priority for public transport services in one key corridor.

17.     An institutional development and TA component (US$2.90 million, US$2.90 Bank
financing) to maximize the benefits and sustainability of the investment components, and to
support capacity-building efforts to strengthen the FMG’s agencies. Specifically, areas of focus
included the development of public transport plans, capacity building for regulation, planning and
operations of public transport, and capacity building to support urban development management.




                                                3
1.6 Revised Components

18.      The scope of the project components remained unchanged until the completion of the
project. The only major revision was the cancelation of Nanjiangbin Road Section III, due to
changes in the planned road network that made this section unnecessary.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.     At the request of the FMG and China’s Ministry of Finance, the project was restructured
twice. The first loan restructuring took place in June 2011, extending the loan closing date from
June 30, 2011 to March 31, 2013 (i.e., 21 months). The objective of this restructuring was to
ensure the completion of all project activities, and therefore fully achieve the project development
objective. The second loan restructuring took place in March 2013, canceling US$6.33 million of
the loan total earmarked for the construction of Jinshan Bus Depot, support ITS procurement, and
related TA activities. It also extended the loan closing date to May 31, 2013. As such, the final
Bank loan totaled US$93.67 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Adequacy of the Project Concept

20.      The project’s concept, combining road investments of different levels of hierarchy, and
strategic public transport investments and TA activities, represented a good practice in terms of
putting in place basic transport infrastructure elements to promote the development of Nantai
Island. In turn, additional activities under the proposed institutional development and TA
component were devised to facilitate pursuing sustainability goals in the medium term, once key
infrastructural investments had been completed and the local authorities had developed the
necessary capacities to work on such issues.

Adequacy of Government Commitment

21.      The Task Team was able to develop a strong working relationship with the FMG during
preparation, an issue of special importance in Fuzhou where the local leadership played a more
direct ‘hands-on’ role in transport planning decisions. The strength of this relationship allowed
Cathedral candid discussions on various project implementation issues and agreements on
appropriate solutions between the Bank team and the implementing agencies during the project
implementation. The FMG also decided to go beyond the local resettlement policy and carry out
an extensive consultation process regarding the relocation of the administration building of
Fanchuanpu Cathedral, a local cultural heritage site that obstructed the optimal alignment of
Nanjiangbin Road, notwithstanding the longer implementation period and additional costs that
such approach would entail.

Adequacy of Risk Assessment

22.     The risk assessment carried out as part of project preparation identified some of the
project’s most critical risks and put in place adequate mitigation measures to enhance project
implementation. In relation to the investment components, the two main risks identified were
procurement issues and quality of construction. In response, project design incorporated: (i) a



                                                 4
detailed action plan to strengthen the procurement capacity of the implementing agencies, and a
project-specific procurement manual; and (ii) a number of TA activities related to construction
supervision to ensure high construction quality. For the TA component, the main risk identified
was a potential lack of government ownership and acceptance of the policy recommendations and
other outcomes, thus, project design incorporated special flexibility to ensure that the activities
carried out would respond to government priorities during implementation. However, risks
related to the implementation of social and environmental safeguards were underestimated.
Although the required safeguard instruments were put in place, the time to implement them was
not properly assessed.

Overall Quality at Entry

23.      At appraisal, the Task Team had completed the preparation of a sound project, addressing
directly the client’s need to expand to Nantai Island, while demonstrating the Bank’s value added
through the inclusion of investments and TA activities promoting public transport use, and the
adoption of special provisions pertaining to environmental and social safeguards. All technical
designs and analyses had been prepared by well recognized and experienced Chinese design
institutes, and reviewed by the Task Team. The project also displayed a clear client orientation.
The FMG urgently needed to start the works on Nanjiangbin Road, thus, during preparation the
Task Team supported the local agencies in the bidding of a first section of the project to be
financed retroactively by the Bank’s loan under the advanced works modality.

2.2 Implementation

Progress at Mid-Term Review

24.      During the first two years of implementation, the project faced delays primarily related to
resettlement issues. By the project’s Mid-Term Review (November 30, 2009), US$20.562 million
out of the loan of US$100 million had been disbursed, versus a disbursement of US$50 million
expected by that date. Implementation results were, nevertheless, already evident. The pilot bus
priority lane had been completed, and civil works for Nanjiangbin Road were almost finished.
Overall, the three project components were showing progress, and it was considered likely that
the project development objective would be met by project closing. Moreover, the project had
achieved some notable outcomes, including: (i) the administration building of Fanchuanpu
Church had been successfully relocated to great satisfaction of the local community and the local
authorities, and positive media coverage; (ii) the FMG had adopted a new progressive
resettlement policy, incorporating special provisions to ensure that sufficient care and attention
were paid to potentially displaced people; and (iii) the FMG had established a Regional Wetlands
Protection Plan to preserve this valued local ecosystem along the Min River.

25.      The main resettlement issues remaining were two. First, the construction of Jinshan Bus
Depot had not yet started due to continuous delays in completing the required land acquisition
process. Second, as civil works on Kuiqi Bridge progressed, the land for building resettlement
houses for affected populations by its northern section remained unavailable. As part of the Mid-
Term Review, it was agreed that the FMG would give special priority to the resolution of both of
these issues.

26.     Overall, progress on resettlement was slow, but consultations with all the displaced
populations and villagers affected by the project revealed that most people were satisfied with
their new situations. Local authorities demonstrated a commitment to listening to complaints and
concerns of affected villagers and families, and to work with them to find mutually agreeable


                                                 5
solutions. While project delays were a concern, the Task Team supported the extensive
consultations followed by the local authorities.

Project Restructuring

27.      As noted in Section 1.7, the project was restructured twice during its lifespan. In June
2011, the first loan restructuring extended the loan for a period of twenty-one (21) months,
pushing the project closing date from June 30, 2011 to March 31, 2013. The extension was
needed to complete delayed investment activities, including the Kuiqi Bridge, the Third Ring
Road and Jinshan Bus Depot. In March 2013, the second loan restructuring extended the loan for
two (2) more months, setting the final closing date of May 31, 2013. The extension aimed to
allow for the completion of a few remaining minor works under the Kuiqi Bridge and the Third
Ring Road. The second restructuring also included the cancelation of US$6.33 million of the loan
allocated for Jinshan Bus Depot, ITS equipment and TA activities that were not going to be spent
by the loan closing.

Progress by Project Closing Date

28.      All major investments under the strategic road infrastructure component were completed
by the closing date of the project. Sections I and II of Nanjiangbin Road were completed
successfully following the Mid-Term Review, while Section III (a 1.1 km approach to the
Qianheng Bridge) was dropped from the Bank-financed project shortly thereafter at the FMG’s
request. The planned functionality of Nanjiangbin Road at appraisal was not compromised by this
change. The main works for the Third Ring Road and the Kuiqi Bridge were completed by
project closing, after some delays in implementation due to resettlement issues. The resettlement
delays stemmed from lengthy negotiations with affected populations (see Paras 25, 26). Minor
works remained to be completed for both projects at project closing, including a series of linking
ramps at the Third Ring Road – Fuquan Expressway intersection and four non-motorized
transport access ramps to the Kuiqi Bridge. At the time of writing this ICR, the FMG reported
that the Third Ring Road’s linking ramps would be completed in November 2013, while it could
not offer a definitive estimation of when the Kuiqi Bridge’s non-motorized transport access
ramps would be completed, since necessary resettlements (minor in scope) were delayed.

29.      The main investment under the public transport component, Jinshan Bus Depot, had only
completed 35 percent of its construction targets at project closing. The primary sources of delays
were two. First, a slow and very difficult land acquisition process, which caused almost two years
delay (though in the end, land acquisitions were completed satisfactorily and without major
complaints). Second, a series of local government reforms in 2010 and 2011 affecting public
transport operations and management that led to delays in the completion of Jinshan Bus Depot’s
final designs and the procurement of its civil works contractor for another two years. The reform
process started just when the land acquisition had been completed, so the overall impact of these
two delays was compounded. At the time of writing this ICR, the FMG reported that civil works
at Jinshan Bus Depot had made substantial progress since project closing (having met 80 percent
of construction targets), and estimated that they would completed by March 2014. Procurement of
ITS equipment in support of operations at Jinshan Bus Depot should also be completed by March
2014 (in fact, the city is planning to extend its ITS deployment throughout the city in 2014).
Accordingly, the FMG expects that Jinshan Bus Depot will be fully operational by June 2014.
The public transport component also included the implementation of a pilot bus priority lane in
central Fuzhou, which was completed in 2007. Building on this experience, and studies carried
out as part of the Public Transport TA, seven additional bus priority lanes have been implemented



                                                6
throughout the city. Currently, there are eight bus priority corridors for a total of 40 km in
operation. The city plans to expand its bus priority network to a total of 120 km by 2018.

30.      The institutional development and TA component was substantially implemented by the
project closing date, albeit with some modifications in scope and implementation delays. The
Public Transport TA, aimed to support the improvement of public transport services in Fuzhou,
was fully implemented as originally planned. The Public Transport Master Plan approved by the
local government adopted key recommendations from the Public Transport TA in relation to
public transport route increases and the development of bus priority corridors. In addition, sector
reforms to improve quality of service and overall sector performance were also adopted following
the Public Transport TA’s recommendations, including the establishment of a public transport
regulator and an independent bus terminal and depot management company, and the formation of
new public transport operators.

31.      The Strategic Planning TA, aiming to address strategic planning issues and support the
effective implementation of urban development plans, was also implemented with some
modifications in its original scope, to reflect rapid changes in the urban development context and
the FMG’s policy priorities. During the early part of the project implementation, Fuzhou
underwent a process of rapid economic growth and population increase that exceeded all previous
projections. In response, the FMG carried out a number of large size planning projects with their
own funds, and through those projects, implemented all those strategic planning initiatives with
its own funds. As such, that were included to the Project, in a larger scale and faster speed. Those
initiatives originally included under the Strategic Planning TA were implemented in reasonably
good quality through those locally-funded projects, including: (i)included the development of
GIS-based systems for land use monitoring and the development of analytical techniques to
support the city planning department; (ii), the development of a Strategic Impact Assessment
framework; (iii), the development of a short-term strategy for urban heritage management; and
(iv) the development of urban design guidelines that promote transit-oriented development. The
planning initiatives were implemented in reasonably good quality under those domestic-funded
projects. Consequently the FMG and the Task Team agreed to modify the scope of the Strategic
Planning TA (funded with the loan) to focus on the preparation of detailed strategies for the
redevelopment of the port areas in Nantai Island, which are considered of vital importance to the
economic growth of, not only Nantai Island, but Fuzhou as a whole. Key recommendations
generated from this work were largely adopted by the local authorities as part of the port’s
strategy and Nantai Island’s Master Plan. Additionally, this work adopted a rigorous planning
process including stakeholder consultations and quantified spatial economic analyses, which
demonstrated the value of international best practices to local planners.

Cost Increases

32.       Project costs increased from US$324 million at appraisal to US$526 million at
completion, with all additional funding provided by the client. The main factors contributing to
these increases were: (i) US dollar depreciation relative to the RMB (about 26 percent);
(ii) increased construction material prices and inflation; and (iii) increased resettlement costs for
the Third Ring Road, the Kuiqi Bridge and Jinshan Bus Depot.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     The M&E framework devised in project preparation established a series of outcome
indicators to follow progress in achieving the project development objective (namely, travel times
by car and public transport, public transport coverage and ridership, and the adoption of


                                                 7
recommendations from the TA component) and a series of output indicators to follow progress in
completing the project’s main investment and activities (see Data Sheet, Section F). These
indicators were selected adequately and comprehensively from a technical, institutional and
operational standpoint. The M&E framework proposed that outcome indicators were only to be
reported to the Bank at project start, Mid-Term Review and completion, granted the inherent
complication in measurement. Intermediate indicators were reported to the Bank in semi-annual
progress reports on project implementation throughout the project’s life, serving this purpose
appropriately.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards

34.      The project was classified as Category A under OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment due
to the environmental impact caused by the construction of new roads in an urban setting.
Consequently, a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental
Monitoring Plan (EMP) were developed as part of project preparation, and implemented with the
support of a sound environmental management system put in place by the client (in terms of
staffing, supervision and reporting). As such, project performance on environmental safeguards is
considered satisfactory.

35.      Notably, the project’s achievements in environmental preservation went beyond the
original project goals. The FMG’s initial proposal included a section of Nanjiangbin Road
running through a wetlands island located along the Min River. Partly the intent of that section
was the promotion of land development in the wetlands, which comprised a potential source of
important revenues for the city. Due diligence during preparation identified that this type of
development would have a considerable adverse environmental impact for Fuzhou and its
surrounding region due to the loss of the wetlands’ vast ecological, hydrological and aesthetic
values. It was agreed between the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), the local
authorities and the Bank to postpone the immediate reclamation of the wetlands for development,
and instead carry out a more thorough impact and alternatives analysis. Subsequently, the local
authorities and the Bank agreed to modify the scope of the project, cancelling the section of
Nanjiangbin Road that ran through the wetlands. Moreover, a detailed study on the wetlands was
eventually completed, prompting the government to adopt a Regional Wetlands Protection Plan
for all wetlands identified, and appointing the local Forest Service for its implementation. Though
a small development with minor impact was still allowed in the main wetlands island, this was
much more limited than the original proposal that would have destroyed the entire ecological
system. In addition, the scope of the Regional Wetlands Protection Plan, which goes well beyond
the project’s direct areas of impact to cover a much wider area, entails environmental
preservation of even more significant proportions.

Social Safeguards

36.     A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared during project preparation for
Nanjiangbin Road and the Third Ring Road, while a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was
prepared for the project to guide the preparation of a RAP for the Kuiqi Bridge and Jinshan Bus
Depot, since the details regarding the alignment and location of these two investments had not
been finalized by appraisal. Both the RAP and RPF were developed in accordance with local laws
and the Bank’s OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, building on consultations with different
groups of affected people. Both the RAP and RPF were successfully carried out without any
major complaints. Ex-post interviews with resettled people indicate a high level of satisfaction.


                                                8
Although the outcome was satisfactory, the considerable delays and additional costs in
resettlement lead to a moderately satisfactory rating for social safeguards.

37.      One of the project’s flagship accomplishments on social safeguards is the successful
relocation of the administration building of Fanchuanpu Cathedral, a provincial cultural heritage
site that obstructed the optimal alignment for Nanjiangbin Road. With the Bank’s support, the
local authorities carried out a long and exhaustive public consultation process to agree on the best
alternative to deal with the situation. The resulting relocation strategy had the building (a 1,500
ton structure originally erected in 1929) lifted, moved in parallel 89 meters, rotated 90 degrees,
and moved again another 30 meters. This impressive effort captured the attention of the national
media. Moreover, today the Fanchuanpu Cathedral and its administration building work in unison,
providing great services to the local community and visitors. Both in its community consultation
process, and in the engineering feat itself of relocating such a large building, this project
demonstrated best practice for cultural preservation, and is a reference for the rest of the country.

38.      It is also worth noting that the social safeguards efforts carried out during implementation
went beyond the original scope of actions devised during project preparation. The alignment of
Nanjiangbin Road went through a slum area of 3,000 households (10,000 habitants), yet only 480
households were directly affected by the alignment. After multiple consultations, the FMG
decided to resettle the slum’s population (all 3,000 households), with the aim of improving living
conditions for this low-income community. The development and eventual impact to the
community of this resettlement process were so positive that the FMG decided to adopt the
general framework, principles and practices utilized under a new local resettlement policy. Given
its provisions to ensure that local government agencies can offer a range of quality resettlement
alternatives and potentially displaced populations are properly empowered to decide between
those alternatives, this policy stands as a benchmark in terms of resettlement practices to be
referenced and adopted by other cities in China.

Financial Management

39.     Project performance in financial management was satisfactory. Through its lifetime, the
project maintained an adequate project financial management system that provided, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the project progress and use of the
Bank loan proceeds. In some instances there were significant delays in the local internal approval
of disbursements, prompting the Bank to promote better communication among the different
government agencies involved. Another source of delays in disbursement was that, initially, the
loan balance on the designated account was insufficient for the size of different expenditure
disbursement requests. This led to the Bank working with local authorities on improving their
financial management practices, and an eventual increase in the authorized allocation to the
designated account.

Procurement

40.     Project performance in procurement was generally satisfactory. In total, 16 procurement
contracts were awarded, including: (i) 12 civil works contracts through international competitive
bidding and national competitive bidding based on the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines; and (ii) 4
consulting service contracts under Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) and Quality Based
Selection (QBS) based on Bank’s Guidelines on Consultant Recruitment. Most procurement
delays can be attributed to limited local capacity for the evaluation of bids and proper due
diligence, partly in the case of Jinshan Bus Depot. Additional delays were incurred due to



                                                 9
complaints made in relation to a few bidding processes, which were elevated to the corresponding
higher authorities and adequately resolved.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Finalization of Project Investments

41.      At project closing, all major investments under the strategic roads component were
completed, and were fully operational and providing high levels of service. Nanjiangbin Road
opened to traffic in April 2010, bringing to fruition an important element of Nantai Island’s road
network and improving access to neglected lands adjacent to the Min River. The Third Ring Road
opened in January 2012, relieving congestion for movements in, out and through Nantai Island,
and constituting the main development spine in the south of Nantai Island. Finally, the Kuiqi
Bridge opened in December 2011, offering an improved connection between the central city and
Nantai Island, and the corresponding adjacent areas. Only two minor civil works had not been
completed at project completion: the linking ramps at the Third Ring Road – Fuquan Expressway
intersection and the non-motorized transport ramps to the Kuiqi Bridge. At the time of writing
this ICR, the FMG reported that the Third Ring Road’s linking ramps would be completed in
November 2013, while it could not offer a definitive estimation of when the Kuiqi Bridge’s non-
motorized transport access ramps would be completed, since necessary resettlements (minor in
scope) were delayed.

42.      At project closing, completed works at Jinshan Bus Depot comprised site preparation and
foundations, or 35 percent of construction targets. Following the second project restructuring, the
FMG sent a letter to the Bank asserting its commitment to complete Jinshan Bus depot with local
funds. At the time of writing this ICR, the FMG reported that civil works at Jinshan Bus Depot
had made substantial progress since project closing (having completed 80 percent of construction
targets) and estimated that they would complete construction by March 2014. Procurement of ITS
equipment in support of operations at Jinshan Bus Depot is also expected to be completed by
March 2014, in line with the Bank’s suggestions. Accordingly, the FMG expects that Jinshan
Bus Depot will be fully operational by June 2014. The pilot bus priority lane was implemented in
2007. Building on this experience, and studies carried out as part of the Public Transport TA,
seven additional bus priority lanes have been implemented throughout the city. Currently, there
are eight bus priority corridors for a total of 40 km in operation. The city plans to expand its bus
priority network to a total of 120 km by 2018.

Operation & Maintenance Arrangements

43.     All the facilities completed under the project are now operated and maintained by
experienced government agencies, funded through annual budgetary allocations from the
municipal government. The sustainability of these facilities over the years is very likely, on the
basis of the fact the works were done on a sound design and construction quality without any
defects. In addition, the FMG has confirmed to the Bank that all project facilities have been
adopted by the relevant departments, which have appropriate budgets for the facilities’ operations
and maintenance. Finally, the city has adequate knowledgeable and skilled personnel to operate
and maintain the infrastructure.

Sustainability of Reforms and Institutional Capacity

44.   As a byproduct of project preparation and the implementation of the TA component, the
FMG carried out a series of institutional reforms in the public transport sector aiming to improve


                                                10
quality of service and overall sector performance. These reforms included: (i) provisions
promoting the formation of new public transport service operators, incentivized to compete
among themselves ‘for the market’; (ii) the establishment of a public transport services regulator,
tasked with ensuring good overall sector performance, the individual supervision of operators’
performance, and the bidding of new routes; and (iii) the establishment of a bus terminal and
depot management company, independent from any of the operators. These reforms have helped
to improve public transport services in Fuzhou, as well as the rapid expansion of services into
Nantai Island. Given the strong momentum, the sustainability of the reforms supported under the
project is assured.

45.      As described earlier, two significant reforms were also implemented in environmental
and social safeguards issues. In the field of environmental conservation, the adoption of a
Regional Wetlands Protection Plan stands as the final outcome of a larger process of raising
awareness and building local capacities in identifying and preserving the vast ecological,
hydrological and aesthetic values of this important local ecosystem. Important elements of this
plan have already been implemented, and it is expected that both government and the public will
be champions for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Regional Wetlands Protection Plan.
On social safeguards, the FMG adopted a new resettlement policy incorporating a series of
special provisions to protect the rights and needs of potentially displaced populations, while
ensuring the efficient implementation of resettlements. The sustainability of the reform is also
ensured by the successful resettlement processes carried out for the project, by means of the
strong trust and buy-in that they generated from both local authorities and the public in this type
of approach to resettlement.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

46.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation is rated Satisfactory, primarily in
light of an appropriate, yet modest project design focused heavily on major urban roads as a
means to promote sustainable peri-urban development.

Objective

47.     The project’s overarching objective of supporting sustainable peri-urban development in
Fuzhou through strategic investments in transport infrastructure continues to be a relevant issue in
most Chinese cities today. Current official estimations indicate that China’s economy will
continue growing at a fast pace for the next two decades (2011-15: 8.6 % annual GDP growth,
2016-20: 7.0%, 2021-25: 5.9%, 2026-30: 5.0%). Accordingly, as Chinese cities consolidate
themselves as central engines of economic growth and employment, urban populations will
continue rising rapidly. Today, China’s urban population comprises roughly half of the country,
and by 2030, the urban share of the population is expected to reach two-thirds (i.e. adding about
13 million more urban dwellers to Chinese cities every year). The Bank’s China Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2013-16, is aligned with China’s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-
2015), emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainable urban development. In particular, the
CPS designates “supporting greener growth” as one of two strategic themes of action, with “the
promotion of low carbon urban transport” chosen as a specific outcome to pursue under it.




                                                11
Design

48.      The project’s design, combining roads of different levels of hierarchy, strategic public
transport investment and TA activities, and supporting institutional development activities, is
considered to be an appropriate approach to address the FMG’s goal of promoting Fuzhou’s peri-
urban expansion. The Bank’s influence is evidenced in the cancelation of the proposed dyke and
the section of Nanjiangbin Road that affected the main wetlands island, and in the inclusion of the
public transport component and strategic TA activities. Perhaps project design could have
incorporated additional public transport investments to further enhance the sustainability profile
of urban development in Nantai Island. However, TA activities and Bank sector dialogue with
FMG were instrumental in expanding public transport services and increasing public transport
ridership in Nantai Island.

Implementation

49.     The project’s implementation relevance is supported by the achievement of the project
development objective, as target levels for all outcome indicators have been met, including travel
time reductions, increased public transport coverage and ridership, the adoption of recommended
planning initiatives to strengthen urban planning capacity, and the adoption of key
recommendations to improve public transport. All major investments under the road component
have been completed in good quality and were fully operational at project closing, while Jinshan
Bus Depot, the main investment under the public transport component, is expected to be
completed by March 2014 and operational by June 2014. Additional high-impact outcomes
achieved through project implementation comprised the establishment of the Regional Wetlands
Protection Plan, the successful relocation of the administration building of Fanchuanpu Cathedral,
the improvement of living conditions for roughly 10,000 slum dwellers, and the establishment of
a new local resettlement policy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

Rating: Satisfactory

50.      Achievement of Project Development Objective is rated Satisfactory, because the intent
of the project development objective has been fully realized. Target values for the outcome
indicators associated with the strategic road infrastructure component and the public transport
component have been met, and target values for the outcome indicators associated with the
institutional development and TA component have also been met.

51.     The project development objective, “to support sustainable peri-urban development in
Fuzhou (as it expands to include Nantai Island) by providing strategic transport infrastructure
and by strengthening the City’s decision support system on land development and management”,
has been realized. Urban development in Nantai Island has become a reality, exceeding all
projections made at project appraisal. From 2005 to 2013, the population of Nantai Island almost
doubled, increasing from 480,000 to 786,900 habitants (the projection at appraisal was 800,000
habitants in 2020). In that same period, the annual size (in product value) of Nantai Island’s
secondary industry increased at an even faster rate, from RMB 209.3 billion to RMB 559.7 billion.
The project’s road investments opened different areas of Nantai Island for residential and
industrial development (specifically, the north in the case of Nanjiangbin Road, and the south in
the case of the Third Ring Road), and improved general access from Nantai Island to central
Fuzhou (particularly, Nanjiangbin Road and the Kuiqi Bridge). The balanced growth of both



                                                12
population and industry in Nantai Island entails a more sustainable development pattern for
Fuzhou, as: (i) at a larger city level, the growth of new origins and destinations in Nantai Island
decongests areas in central Fuzhou, and allows for more balanced bidirectional traffic flows
between central Fuzhou and Nantai Island; and (ii) within Nantai Island, this balanced growth
facilitates proximity between jobs and residential locations, leading to shorter commute distances
more easily done in public transport and non-motorized transport. With its expansion to Nantai
Island, Fuzhou boasts today a modal share profile that supports sustainable urban development
with high modal shares for walking (23.54 percent), cycles/e-cycles (36.57 percent) and buses
(18.14 percent). Fuzhou’s urban development process is now supported by a strengthened
decision support system for land development and management. The city’s master plan was
updated during project implementation, incorporating different recommendations by the Task
Team on the development of public transport priority corridors, integrated transport and land use
planning, strategic zoning, and environmental protection. Fuzhou also adopted a strategy for land
redevelopment and expansion of the port areas in Nantai Island based on quantified spatial
economic analyses (and local staff were trained to implement this approach in the future).

52.      All the target values for the outcome indicators associated with the strategic road
infrastructure component and the public transport component have been met (see Data Sheet,
Section F for details). First, travel times have been reduced in all the four selected corridors from
Nantai Island to central Fuzhou for both private vehicles and public transport, either meeting the
proposed target value or exceeding it (one target was not reached by 1 minute, so it is still
considered met). On average, there was a 32 percent reduction in travel times for private vehicle
trips and a 21 percent reduction for public transport trips. Second, public transport development
in Nantai Island is evidenced by significant increases in public transport services and demand.
Public transport coverage increased in the total number of routes (from 53 in 2005 to 114 in
2013) and in route-km (from 327.5 to 912), surpassing the target values set at appraisal. Public
transport ridership increased considerably from 85.8 million trips in 2005 to 739.6 passenger trips
in 2013, also exceeding the target set at appraisal.

53.      All the target values for the outcome indicators associated with the institutional
development and TA component are considered to have been met. The first indicator was the
incorporation of a mechanism to coordinate land use and transport planning in the Master Plan
update. Its target value is met as recommendations from the Public Transport TA, such as the
implementation of a series of public transport priority corridors and specific measures to promote
transit-oriented development in Fuzhou were adopted as part of the Public Transport Master Plan
and led to better land use and transport planning coordination in the general Master Plan update.
The second indicator was the adoption of a GIS-based tool to monitor land use and land values.
The target value is considered met, as; (i) the FMG, through a parallel city-wide initiative to
strengthen the planning capacity of its agencies, established a GIS-based land use planning and
management system during project implementation; and (ii) the FMG’s period. The city’s
planning department and land resource management department have adopted GIS-based tools to
monitor land use and land values. The third and final indicator was the adoption of initiatives to
improve planning and built environment in Nantai Island from TA activities, such as the
development of strategic environmental impact assessment framework, the adoption of new urban
design guidelines, actions to preserve historic areas, or zoning regulations based on specific
functional specifications. The target value is considered met as those initiatives have been
developed, in reasonably good quality as assessed by the Bank Task Team, and adopted by the
FMG through several city-wide strategic planning projects which were funded with domestic
funds. The strategic planning tools developed under these initiatives have significantly
strengthened the FMG’s planning capacity not only for the development in Nantai Island, but also
for the entire city.


                                                 13
3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory

54.     Efficiency is rated Satisfactory, as an ex-post economic evaluation of the project yields
economic rate of return of is 18.7 percent, exceeding the World Bank recommended discount rate
of 12 percent for transport infrastructure projects.

55.     At appraisal, an economic evaluation was carried out for the road component alone,
determining that its three investments (Nanjiangbin Road, the Third Ring Road and the Kuiqi
Bridge) combined had an economic rate of return of 15.5 percent (2005 prices, project life of 20
years) and a net present value of RMB 489.3 million (12 percent discount rate). A new economic
evaluation was prepared for this ICR using a similar methodology as that used at appraisal, but
with updated information on project costs and socio economic data. The new economic
evaluation yields an economic rate of return of is 18.7 percent and a net present value of
RMB 2,067 million. In spite of important cost increases for the three investments, a higher EIRR
is achieved mainly due to higher traffic levels and higher passenger time cost.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

56.       Overall Outcome is rated Satisfactory. The assessment is that an appropriate project
design was implemented successfully to realize the project development objective in an efficient
manner, though one significant project investment is still to be completed. At the time of writing
this ICR: (i) all major investments under the strategic roads component had been completed;
(ii) the pilot bus priority lane had been implemented and civil works for Jinshan Bus Depot were
progressing on schedule towards completion in March 2014; and (iii) a breadth of TA activities
had been successfully implemented, responding to the FMG’s priorities. Moreover,
implementation was leveraged to achieve additional outcomes of great significance such as the
institutional reforms in public transport sector, the establishment of the Regional Wetlands
Protection Plan, the successful preservation of the administration building of Fanchuanpu
Cathedral, the improvement of living conditions for roughly 10,000 slum dwellers, and the
establishment of a new local resettlement policy.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

57.      Although the project was not a poverty-targeted project, the project as a whole supported
poverty reduction goals by improving transport infrastructure and services, which in turn
improved the efficiency and productivity of individuals and firms, leading to economic growth
and general increase in levels of income. Moreover, the implementation of the resettlement action
plan had a positive impact on improving living conditions of specific groups of poor urban
dwellers in Fuzhou. The resettlement for Nanjiangbin Road stands as an exemplary case of this
practice. The project alignment went through a slum area of 3,000 households (10,000 habitants),
in its majority wageworkers with limited household incomes. The housing stock in the slum was
of poor quality and marginal market value –typically built with rudimentary methods and
unreliable materials, and many even lacking basic facilities for subsistence such as a kitchens or
toilets. The road alignment itself only affected 480 households, but after multiple consultations,
following the community’s request, the FMG decided to resettle the entire population. The


                                               14
original relocation site had to be expanded and redesigned, and significant new funds allocated to
provide the necessary transitional support to each household. In total, 4,642 new apartments were
built for this particular community, with few households opting instead for cash compensations or
earlier resettlement into existing apartments. Ex-post interviews revealed high levels of
satisfaction with the resettlement process. The size and quality of the new apartments represent a
significant improvement in living conditions for the community. Additionally, in contrast to their
former homes, the new apartments are household assets that can be transacted in the market
according to each household’s own interest.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.      Throughout project preparation and implementation, the Bank continuously made an
explicit effort to strengthen local capacities and help city officials build broader support networks,
by organizing a number of high-level seminars on public transport planning issues in Fuzhou, and
inviting local officials to participate in similar Bank-sponsored events around the country. One
seminar took place in Fuzhou in November 2007 at the onset of project implementation. The
thematic focus was public transport reforms, with speakers from different cities in China and
overseas sharing their experiences on bus enterprise reform and public transport development.
Another seminar held in Fuzhou took place in June 2012, at the tail end of project execution. This
seminar was the first offering in China of the World Bank’s flagship urban transport training
program Leaders in Urban Transport Planning (LUTP) – a program devised to help participants
analyze and make decisions in relation to complex urban transport issues. Fuzhou’s LUTP was
attended by senior and mid-level transport professionals from Fuzhou and other cities in the
country. In addition to these capacity building events, the Bank also invited FMG officials to
participate in the numerous activities of the Bank’s City-to-City Peer Learning Program, where
they had the opportunity share their experiences, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing
Bank-financed urban transport projects.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

61.      Risk to the Development Outcome is rated Low, as it is unlikely that any changes
compromising the realization of the project development outcome may occur during the project’s
useful life. Fuzhou and Nantai Island continue to enjoy rapid economic growth and the FMG has
a robust fiscal environment to deepen development and sustain the gains achieved under the
project. A potential threat to the benefits from travel time savings and vehicle operating cost
savings could be a deterioration of the roads due to poor maintenance practices, yet the good
economic fiscal environment, as well as local policies and procedures ensure the proper funding
of operations and maintenance. While project benefits could be threatened by a decrease in
coverage of public transport services, the current trend seems to indicate that coverage of public
transport services will only increase in response to growing ridership figures. Moreover, Fuzhou


                                                 15
recently submitted its application to the Ministry of Transport’s Transit Metropolis program,
which aims to help Chinese cities in the promotion of public transport use and integrated
transport and land use planning practices. Beyond the Ministry’s approval of that application, this
points to Fuzhou’s general aim to pursue a broader agenda that would be in line with the long-
term preservation of the project benefits.

62.      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory because, while
project design in its concept was modest, the overall quality of preparation and final design was
notable. The Task Team provided significant value by expanding the government’s proposal to
include international good practices. The project’s design addressed Fuzhou’s need to expand to
Nantai Island, primarily through the development of strategic road investments, but also pursuing
key public transport improvements. The project design also incorporated lessons learned in prior
Bank projects in China supporting urban development, avoiding a multi-sector structure that had
proven very challenging to implement. Technical analysis at entry allowed the Bank to approve
the retroactive financing of the first section of Nanjiangbin Road, having ensured its technical
quality and the upholding of the Bank’s safeguard and fiduciary policies. In relation to
environmental safeguards, at entry the Task Team had already identified the high ecological value
of the regional wetlands and agreed with the local authorities that their plan to expand
Nanjiangbin Road through the main wetlands island and build a dyke along the Min River would
be dropped. This was an unanticipated high impact outcome stemming from project preparation.
In relation to social safeguards, both a RAP and a RFP were prepared, the former already
identifying the need to relocate the administrative building of Fanchuanpu Cathedral. While both
of these safeguard instruments allowed for the completion of all resettlement successfully,
without major complaints or non-compliance issues, the Task Team may have underestimated the
risk that resettlement issues represented to the timely implementation of the project’s investments.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

63.      Quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory, as the Task Team demonstrated the ability to
adapt to major challenges during implementation, ultimately supporting the delivery of the
project development objective, and additional high-impact outcomes. All major investments and
TA activities will have been completed by March 2014, when Jinshan Bus Depot is finished. In
their implementation, the Task Team provided extensive supervision support to ensure good
quality, devising solutions to the different challenges that arose, and, when possible, providing
additional assistance and encouragement for the pursuit of strategic high-impact initiatives. This
is most evident in the case of Fanchuanpu Cathedral, where implementation confronted two major
challenges: the relocation of a local heritage site, the administrative building of Fanchuanpu
Cathedral, and the resettlement of 480 households located in a slum area. The Task Team
collaborated closely with the local authorities to overcome all these challenges, achieving the
successful relocation of the heritage site and resettlement of the slum (3,000 households in total).



                                                16
In turn, these achievements empowered the local authorities to adopt a new, progressive
resettlement policy providing special provisions to protect potentially affected populations. The
establishment of the Regional Wetlands Protection Plan was another significant outcome of
supervision activities. Having agreed during preparation with the local authorities to drop their
plan to expand Nanjiangbin Road through the main wetlands island and build a dyke along the
Min River, supervision activities supported proper studies detailing the value of the wetlands
were completed, eventually allowing the government to adopt the Regional Wetlands Protection
Plan for all wetlands identified, and appointing the local Forest Service to carry out their
safeguarding.

64.      Resettlement activities, albeit all the positive outcomes achieved in the end, represented
the main challenge during project implementation. At project entry, the local framework to
implement the RAP and RPF was limited, thus, supervision activities were used to build the
requisite local capacities and leadership support to successfully complete all the required
resettlement activities without any major complaints or non-compliance issues – and going
beyond the policy requirements in the case of Nanjiangbin Road. The fact that some of these
processes took long periods of time, years even particularly in negotiations with a few hold-out
groups, was not a reflection of poor quality implement by the government or Bank supervision.
The local government correctly refrained from exercising enforcement actions on these groups,
allowing necessary time for the negotiations to come to a satisfactory solution to all parties. This
was an important improvement vis-à-vis the prior practice in Fuzhou, and it was a sound decision
from the Bank side to encourage the government agencies to take time in negotiating with
affected households. The Task Team displayed an understanding that building local capacity
takes time and patience. Today, local government agencies in Fuzhou have a mature expertise to
carry out large resettlements and are supported by a progressive resettlement policy i.e. the
framework is now in place to implement resettlement processes in a more efficient and fair
manner. This is an important outcome of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

65.      Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory based on project quality at entry and
quality in supervision. Quality at entry was achieved by a thorough preparation process, devising
a project that addressed the client’s need to promote peri-urban expansion to Nantai Island
through strategic road investments, while demonstrating the Bank’s value added in the inclusion
of investments and TA activities promoting public transport use, and in the adoption of special
provisions pertaining environmental and social protection. Quality of supervision is evidenced by
the completion of most major investments and TA activities, and the achievement of the project
development objective. In addition to TA activities, the Task Team carried out a leadership
training program on sustainable urban transport planning for key actors in Fuzhou that
participated in the development of the Public Transport Master Plan and other important sector
initiatives. The Task Team was proactive in trying to resolve major complications during
implementation, particularly in resettlement, but also showed patience in its granting of
extensions and other provisions requested by the client to see their priorities and needs properly
addressed by the project. Overall, quality of supervision is confirmed by the project’s high-impact
achievements during implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

66.      Government performance is rated Satisfactory due to the strong ownership and
commitment demonstrated towards the achievement of the project development objective and
additional high-impact initiatives. The local leadership and the Task Team developed a strong
working relationship during project preparation. The fruits of this relationship are evident in the
final project design, which incorporated significant changes to the project originally presented by
the FMG. In the implementation stage, the merits of the local government are numerous. Broadly
speaking, it demonstrated commitment to project implementation by providing all the necessary
additional funding in the face of project cost increase. Specific political support was also offered
on critical issues. For instance, following the conclusion of the studies estimating the value of the
wetlands ecosystem, the local leadership established the Regional Wetlands Protection Plan and
modified its development for the main wetlands island from a high impact to a low impact
proposal. Similarly, on resettlement issues, the local leadership granted all the necessary support
(and patience) for negotiations with affected communities to mature at their own pace to reach
solutions satisfactory to all parties (the relocation of the administrative building of Fanchuanpu
Cathedral, and the resettlement of populations for Nanjiangbin Road and Jinshan Bus Depot are
all exemplary cases). Moreover, building on the positive experiences implementing the first
resettlement in accordance with the Bank’s resettlement policy, the local leadership went on to
adopt a new local resettlement policy incorporating special provisions to protect the rights of
potentially displaced populations. Eventually, during implementation, a new local leadership
would take office causing some delays in project execution, particularly as it moved to restructure
FMG’s administrative organization. However, the new leadership adopted many of the Bank’s
recommendations in relation to the public transport sector, which ended up constituting part of
the administrative reforms. Those reforms will bring significant benefits to the public transport
sector in the long term, although it caused some delays in project implementation as the new
organizations were weak in project execution and needed time to develop their capacity. Also, as
the extended project closing date arrived and the construction of Jinshan Bus Depot had barely
started, the new local leadership offered the Bank all assurance that it would provide its own
funding to complete the project. More recent report indicating that Jishan Bus Depot should be
completed by March 2014.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

67.      The work of the implementing agencies is rated Satisfactory because of their dedication
and commitment to the achievement of the project development objective. Being the first Bank
project ever prepared and implemented in Fuzhou, the implementing agencies (originally, Fuzhou
Urban Construction Development Company and Fuzhou Public Transport Company) lacked
experience with the Bank’s procedures and practices. However, the implementing agencies
demonstrated a willingness to improve their capacity through training, capacity building
initiatives and the general ‘day-to-day’ interactions of working with the Task Team on the project
– this diversified form of capacity building proved to be quite effective, with both implementing
agencies developing effective working units with time. As described above, officials from the
implementing agencies deserve special commendation for allowing the negotiation processes with
affected populations to take the necessary time irrespective of the effect that the ensuing delays


                                                 18
would have on their performance evaluations or other similar pressures. Moreover, it was their
groundwork, seeing that these processes came to successful resettlements, which set the stage for
the eventual resettlement policy reform. In the last few years of the project implementation, there
was significant restructuring in local government that led to a number of changes in the project
implementation arrangements, including: (i) responsibility for urban transport was shifted from
the construction commission to the transport commission; (ii) the implementation agency for the
public transport component was shifted from the bus company to the newly established bus
terminals and depots management company; (iii) the project management office was entirely
moved from the development reform commission to the newly established municipal finance and
trade office; and (iv) eventually key staff who originally worked on the project from the
beginning were moved from the project management office to other departments due to their own
career development needs. These changes cost the project some delays due to the learning curve
of the new personnel/organizations in relation to the project and the Bank’s processes, the need to
establish new communication channels, etc. However, the new teams also showed commitment to
the successful completion of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

68.     Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory, as both the local leadership and the
implementing agencies demonstrated a strong commitment to the achievement of the project
development objective, despite the different challenges that made project implementation difficult.
Project delays in resettlement and procurement can be attributed in part to the FMG’s
inexperience working with the Bank and implementing its policies. Again, delays that accrued to
ensure that resettlement negotiations were completed to the satisfaction of all parties are
considered well justified. Other delays, such as those stemming from the change in local
leadership and the government restructuring process seem to be unavoidable. Both, local
leadership members and agency staff were instrumental in bringing about all the outcomes, from
the completion of all major investments, to the adoption of seminal reforms in resettlement and
environmental protection.

6. Lessons Learned

69.      Project preparation for urban transport projects should account for lengthy land
acquisition and resettlement activities. Land acquisitions and resettlement activities constituted
the main challenge to the timely implementation of the project. Approvals of land acquisitions
and negotiations with affected communities extended for months, years even in more than one
occasion, before definitive settlements were reached. While resettlement outcomes were
ultimately positive, delays in implementation led to cost increases and delays in the realization of
project benefits. The lesson derived is simple: large land acquisition and resettlement activities in
an urban setting are complicated and extend over long periods of time. There are no shortcuts in
implementation. On the contrary, the Bank’s experience in China is that typically these processes
take more time than originally budgeted in project design. Task Teams are advised to take special
actions during project preparation and design to account for this, including: (i) work solely on the
basis of definitive information stated in official documents, such as official land use master plans,
land use and land ownership certificates, approved municipal budgets, etc.; (ii) prepare in-house a
realistic assessment of all the necessary steps to complete land acquisitions and resettlements; (iii)
use project preparation stage to advance strategic issues, such as carrying out detailed
consultations, completing approval of land use changes, or enhancing local resettlement policies;



                                                 19
(iv) schedule all land acquisitions and resettlement activities as early as possible in project
implementation if not done during project preparation; and (v) plan a back-loaded disbursement
profile.

70.      High-impact outcomes can be leveraged from the preparation and implementation of
Bank safeguards. As part of the preliminary background analysis for the preparation of the
project’s environmental safeguards, the high ecological value of the regional wetlands was
identified, and two project investments that were detrimental to this ecosystem were dropped.
Follow-up studies provided a detailed account of such value and offered recommendations for its
protection moving forward. The FMG adopted most recommendations stemming from those
studies, including the establishment of a Regional Wetlands Protection Plan and the pursuit of a
low impact development plan for the main wetlands island. Similarly, the implementation of the
project’s social safeguards yielded high-impact outcomes, such as the preservation of the
administration building of Fanchuanpu Cathedral and the improvement of living conditions
through resettlement for 3,000 households (10,000 people approx.) formerly living in a slum.
These early successes were so positive that the FMG decided to adopt the general framework,
principles and practices of the project’s social safeguards under a new local resettlement policy.

71.      The M&E framework should be designed in a way that the achievement of outcome can
be easily assessed. One of the project’s outcome indicators was the adoption of initiatives to
improve planning and built environment in Nantai Island from TA activities, such as the adoption
of new urban design guidelines, actions to preserve historic areas, or zoning regulations based on
specific functional specifications. This type of indicator is generic and unspecified, and does not
offer a clear way to assess if it was actually achieved. Good indicators lend themselves to a
straightforward assessment by the evaluator.

Component 1: Road Infrastructure Component
1   Nanjiangbin Road, a 4.1 km            The project comprised the construction of a 40-50 meter wide
    lenghth of riverside road along the   (including green area) 4.1 kilometer length of Class I urban riverside
    south bank of the Min River,          road along the south bank of the Min River between the Fourth Min
    providing access to and promoting     River Bridge and the line of the proposed Qianheng Bridge to improve
    the redevelopment of neglected        the traffic situations in Nantai Island. The works included the
    areas in Nantai Island;               constructions of road foundation, road surface, bridges & culverts,
                                          drainages, water supplies, lighting and landscape etc. The constructions
                                          were completed in April 2010. The completion of NJBL has provided
                                          access to, and enabled the redevelopment of neglected areas in Nantai
                                          Island, as well as forming an important part of the road network of
                                          Nantai Island.
2   Phase II of the Third Ring Road       This component comprised the construction of a 11.6 km long urban
    (South), an 11.6 km segment of a      expressway with the width of 50-79 meter to thoroughly mitigate traffic
    six-lane expressway providing         tensions passing in and out on Nantai Island and address traffic jam
    expedient mobility across Nantai      issue in central Fuzhou city. The works also included the constructions
    Island and opening up new areas       of two interchanges (FuQuan Express Higway interchange and Luozhou
    for urban development;                interchange), four separated interchanges (Fuxia highway interchange),
                                          nine bridges, rain drainages, water supply pipelines, communication
                                          lines, power lines, lighting, traffic control facilities and landscape etc.
                                          Except the constructions of ramps connecting to FuQuan express
                                          highway, most part of the constructions of 3RR were completed by the
                                          end of December 2011. On 1 Jan. 2012, the main way of 3RR, starting
                                          from Wenbian interchange at the north end of Wenbian bridge to the
                                          south end of Kuiqi Bridge, has been completed and the main way of
                                          whole third ring road of Fuzhou city opens for traffics. The completion
                                          of 3RR together with other projects has thoroughly mitigated traffic
                                          tensions in Nantai Island and addressed traffic jam issue in central area

                                Annex 3 Economic Analysis

1.      For re-assessing the economic viability of the Project after completion, economic
reevaluation was carried at the ICR stage by using similar methodology as that at project
appraisal. In the economic reevaluation, actual project costs and socioeconomic data were
used. The traffic forecast at appraisal was adjusted according to latest socioeconomic
development status in the project area. The economic reevaluation assumed that due to
improvement of the project roads (Nanjiangbin Road and the Third Ring Road) and
bridge (Kuiqi Bridge), the vehicles on the project roads could drive at faster speed with
lower operating cost and less travel time. Economic benefits were calculated by
comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases. Consequently, the Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was calculated and sensitivity analysis was also carried
out.

Socioeconomic Development and Traffic Forecast

2.      The traffic analysis at appraisal was based the projections of population growth
and economic development in the project area. The projections indicated that the
population of Fuzhou would grow at an annual rate of 2.9% in 2002–2010 and of 2.5% in
2011–2020, while the population of Nantai Island would grow steadily at an annual rate
of 2.9% in 2002–2020. These growth projections have been proven to be underestimated.
At actual, the population of Fuzhou grew at average 3.80% per annum while the
population of Nantai Island grew at a 4.37% per annum in the period of 2002–2010 (in
fact, the population of Nantai Island has grown at a 5.17% annual rate in the last 4 years).
In the meantime, the economic development was also much faster than what estimated at
appraisal. At appraisal, it was assumed that the average GDP of Fuzhou would grow at
average annual rates of 8–10%. At actual, the GDP grew at 10–15% in the period of
2001–2011 and reached US$8,268 in 2011. Such faster population and economic
development in the project area has generated huge traffic demand. In considering actual
socioeconomic development and traffic status, the traffic forecast at appraisal was revised
by adding 10% and the traffic forecast was also adjusted.

Project Costs

3.      At actual, the total project cost was RMB3,233.67 million ($525.80 million
equivalent at the exchange rate of $1.00 = RMB6.15). The actual project cost was much
higher than that estimated at appraisal ($324.71 million), about 61.9% higher. The civil
works costs for Nanjiangbin Road increased by about 5.0%. But the civil works costs for
both the Third Ring Road and the Kuiqi Bridge exceeded by more than 100% than their
original estimations. The actual costs of the three investments were used in the economic
reevaluation. In the reevaluation, the operation costs for the public buses using the project
roads were considered at (i) 60 buses; (ii) 20 trips a day per bus; and (iii) operation cost
of RMB8.79 per 100 km. It was also assumed that the operation cost would increase by
2% per year considering the traffic increase and service improvement. The maintenance
cost for the public buses were estimated at RMB30,000 per bus per year. The
maintenance costs for the project roads and bridge were estimated at RMB200,000 per
kilometer for the roads and RMB400,000 per kilometer for the bridge. The periodical
maintenances were estimated at (i) the buses would be replaced every 10 years at
RMB500,000 per bus; and (ii) the roads and bridge would be rehabilitated every 5 years
at RMB2.00 million per km. All of these costs were converted into economic costs using
an average factor of 0.90.

Project Benefits

4.      By comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases, the main sources of
the economic benefits were (i) the savings in vehicle operation cost (VOC); and (ii) the
savings in passenger travel time cost. The VOC savings in RMB per vehicle-kilometer
were estimated at RMB0.36 for car and RMB1.09 for bus respectively, which were
adopted from other similar cities in China. Due to improvements of the project roads and
bridge, the vehicle speeds would increase from 25–30 kilometer per hour for the
“without-project” case to 30–40 kilometers per hour for the “with-project” case. The
passenger time cost was estimated to be average RMB24.25 per hour according to the
actual GDP per capita ($8,268) of the project area in 2011. It was also assumed that the
passenger time cost would increase along the economic development by 8% per year in
2011–2015, 6% in 2016–2020, and 3% onward. In the calculation of the passenger
traveling time cost savings, number of passengers per vehicle and percentage of business
trips were also considered. The economic benefits were calculated to be total RMB304.9
million in 2013 (the first fully operation year). The results of the economic benefit
calculation also show that the total benefits were 34% from the VOC savings and 66%
from the passenger time cost savings in the early stage of the project operation. However,
the benefits from the passenger time cost savings increased significantly along with the
economic development, reached 77% in 2030.

Economic Reevaluation

5.     Based on above assumptions and calculations, the EIRR was recalculated at
18.7% for the project, which is higher than that estimated at appraisal (15.5%). The
higher EIRR was mainly due to higher traffic level and higher passenger time cost. The



                                             25
recalculated EIRR shows that the project is considered economically viable and has a
relatively high level of efficiency. The details of the EIRR calculation for the Project are
in Tables A3.3. The EIRR was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test different scenarios
of costs and benefits. The sensitivity analysis results in Table A3.2 showed that the
project continues to be economically viable for all tested scenarios. If a 20% operation
and maintenance cost increase were to be combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the
EIRR would be 15.4% for the Project. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR
is more sensitive to changes in benefits. Therefore, the governments should keep high
traffic level and continue to promote public transport development.

       Annex 7 Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.       The Project and Its Objectives. Fuzhou is the capital city and a major cultural,
commercial and industrial center of Fujian Province. Early in the 21st century, Fuzhou Municipal
Government has been implementing the urban development strategy of expanding east and south.
Nantai Island development is the key component of this development strategy. However, the poor
infrastructures in Nantai are far behind the requirement of development. To accelerate the
development of urban infrastructures including roads and public transport system in particular is
the first priority of the urban development strategy of expanding east and south. The Fuzhou
Nantai Island Peri-Urban Development Project (the Project), together with locally financed
initiatives, was designed to relieve transport infrastructure bottlenecks in Nantai Island. The
objective of the Project is to support sustainable peri urban development in Fuzhou (as it expands
to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport infrastructure and by
strengthening the city’s decision support system on land development and management.

2.      Summary of Project Implementation. The Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban
Development Project consists of strategic road development component, public transport
development component and capacity building component, including four structural subprojects:
NJBL (phase I and phase II, construction of 4.1km long urban trunk road), the Third Ring Road
(construction of 11.6km long urban expressway), Kuiqi Bridge (construction of a 1115.1m long
double-pylon, double-plane, cable-stayed bridge crossing Min river), and Jinshan depot
(construction of a depot with a total floor area of 38,199 ㎡ and parking capacity of 360 buses).
The project completed the construction of 4.1km long urban trunk road in Nanjiangbinlu, 11.6km
long urban expressway in 3RR, Kuiqi Bridge, but will complete Jinshan depot using local funds.
All projects have achieved and will achieve their expected targets including outputs and outcomes.
In addition, the project completed its capacity building targets to support Fuzhou port economy
development and urban public transport development and staff training activities. All loan
covenants have generally been complied with prior to loan closing and were accepted by the
World Bank.

3.       Performance of Borrower and Executing Agency. The Borrower, Executing Agencies
(EAs) and Implementing Agencies (IAs) have jointly and individually fulfilled their obligations
during project implementation and regularly communicated with the World Bank. Fuzhou World
Bank Loan Project Management Office (FPMO) ensured there was adequate coordination
between the World Bank, the IAs, contractors and various supporting consultants. The Project
Leading Group (PLG) demonstrated strong leadership by providing the necessary counterpart
funds to the Project. Two IAs implemented the project in an effective and efficient manner.
Construction standards for the 3RR and Kuiqi Bridge were evaluated as meeting international
best practice. However, as the rapid but unclearly defined urban development was simultaneously
happening in Fuzhou, particularly in Nantai Island, the PLG despite much effort in providing
policy decisions and inter-agency coordination, was unable to totally resolve the Land
Acquisition and Resettlement (LAR) issues for Jinshan depot subproject in time so that the
construction of this subproject would not be completed by the loan closing date and the loan
proceeds originally allocated for it could not be disbursed completely, thus greatly reducing the
loan utilization efficiency.

4.      Performance of World Bank. Overall, the World Bank performed satisfactorily during
Project preparation and implementation. It has sent 10 missions to carry out semi-annual/annual
reviews during the 7-year period and in December 2009 Mid-Term Review (MTR) was sent to
conduct midterm review activities. The review missions provided various valuable pieces of
advice on Project implementation in particular, they provided very valuable guidance on wetland


                                               32
protection and historic cultural heritage protection. The World Bank took active actions to
process from the borrower and FPMO promptly and efficiently including bid evaluation, contract
awards and the extension of loan closing etc. Withdrawal applications were processed and
disbursed on time. All of these inputs greatly contributed to the successful implementation of the
Project.

5.       Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome. Achievement of the performance targets was
moderately satisfactory. Except for Jinshan depot which has not been completed, all other targets
(including development objectives and intermediate results) were met and exceeded, notably the
targets of travel times from Nantai Island to Fuzou downtown area and other designated areas and
public transport coverage in Nantai greatly exceeded the anticipated targets, and these targets will
certainly be sustainably developed. Although the achievements of the designated development
targets cannot be entirely ascribed to Project implementation, the significance of the Project to
improve urban traffic infrastructure in Nantai Island and to boost its rapid urbanization is possible.
In addition, the successful experiences on taking active and effective measures to protect affected
ecological environment and historic cultural relics during Project implementation would have
active demonstrational significances on the ecological civilization construction in Fuzhou as a
famous city with its history and culture.

6.      Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs. FMG utilized the World Bank loan to
implement the Project to the right locations, reflecting development priorities, which have greatly
mitigated the traffic tensions in Nantai Island and Fuzhou urban areas, increased traffic capacities
and velocity, substantially reduced traffic operation costs, improved the public transport networks,
and effectively reduced the travel time of residents as well.

7.       Lessons Learnt. The successful implementation of the Project mainly attributed to its
design firmly relevant to the local economic and social development strategy. The subprojects
included in the Project were the development priorities of the local government - notably the
three strategic roads subprojects. These three road subprojects were listed as the key projects and
for the people’s project, therefore, all related to funds, LAR and other policies required for the
project implementation received priority support and full coordination.

8.      TA-Fuzhou Urban Public Transport Planning Study was designed by the Project to
address FMG’s urgent issue. Therefore, the very important research outputs have been given by
FMG and its concerned authorities and most of its study recommendations have been well
adopted, which has played a significant role in Fuzhou urban public transport development. It is
recommended that the TA in the future loan projects should be designed through extensive
consultation with the local government authorities so that the TA could address the government’s
urgent issues and TA outputs could be fully adopted.

9.     During the Project preparation and implementation, protecting the ecological
environment and historic cultural relics possibly impacted were considered, and effective
measures were taken to minimize the adverse impacts caused by the Project implementation,
which has all played an important role in achieving the exceeded targets of ecological
environment and social development of the Project.

10.    The cost estimates for external environmental monitoring prepared at Project preparation
were not incorporated by the design institutes into the overall project cost. As such, no
government approval on the specific budget allocation for External Environmental Monitoring
(EEM) was obtained. The absence of budget provisions resulted in such services conducted after
the mid implementation period. Fuzhou Environmental Monitoring Station (FEMS) was


                                                 33
eventually appointed to undertake EEM at no cost to the Project. They have provided their best
effort and adequate resources to fulfill their EEM obligations, but this is causing a huge cost
burden to FEMS.

11.     The Project did not make arrangements to engage the consultants to support project
implementation, which resulted in Project management not properly being in place and the
Project performance monitoring and evaluation not systematic. Therefore, the consulting services
to support the Project implementation need to be improved. The consulting services financed by
the loan proceeds were arranged to facilitate the establishment of Project Performance Monitoring
System (PPMS) and assist FPMO to prepare and submit various reports in timely manner in the
formats acceptable to the World Bank.

12.      Recommendations. FMG shall actively coordinate and facilitate Fuzhou Urban
Construction Development Company (FUCDC) to complete the remaining construction activities
of the remaining ramps at Fu-Quan Interchange under 3RR, the LAR activities related to the
remaining two ramps for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles and their construction activities
under Kuiqi Bridge. All the remaining construction activities are to be completed in time so that
the full functions of 3RR and Kuiqi Bridge could be brought into play.

13.     FMG shall provide sufficient budget funds, actively coordinate and facilitate Fuzhou Bus
Depot Management Company (FBDMC) to progress with the construction activities of Jinshan
depot so that it would be in operation as early as possible to promote the optimization of public
transport networks in Nantai Island and even in Fuzhou city.

14.     FMG shall increase the budget for operation and maintenance of urban facilities
including roads and bridges. Meanwhile, FMG shall also cause the respective operating units at
all times, to operate and maintain the completed roads and bridge in accordance with sound
administrative, financial, engineering, environmental, and O&M practices.

15.     It is recommended that at the appraisal for projects like the Project for the loan financing
the World Bank should pay more attention to the implementation arrangement, assessing the
project management capacity to identify the project management risks as possible, and designing
the proper options to strengthen capacity building. If the project could not establish the permanent
project management office equipped with the full time professional project management staff,
arrangements to provide consulting services for the support of project implementation shall be
made to build up EA’s project management capacity so that the risks of the project management
not attune with the requirements caused by various unpredictable reasons could be avoided as
possible.

16.      Considering the reality that China is in the course of fast urbanization, while PRC’s laws
and regulations on the rural land ownership and property rights are not perfect and prevailing
mechanism of land and housing expropriation could not adapt to the development demands,
resulting in the substantial delays of lots development projects due to the LAR activities, it is
recommended that the World Bank initiate the technical assistance related to the improvement of
land and housing expropriation mechanism for development projects and it is priority to carry on
and try in the PRC’s projects financed by the World Bank loan.

17.     Cost estimates for external environmental monitoring and external resettlement
monitoring prepared at project preparation should be incorporated by the design institutes into the
overall project cost, and all these costs should be financed by the World Bank loan. These



                                                34
external monitors are to be recruited through proper consultant recruitment procedures to ensure
essential    services       are      conducted      throughout      project     implementation.
