7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it
expands to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport infrastructure and by
strengthening the city's decision support system on land development and management.

                                               3
Specifically, the project supports peri-urban development in Nantai Island with: (a)
investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and public transport); and (b) TA that
would help the city to strengthen the manner in which the development is planned (to
encourage development patterns that promote public transport while integrating environmental
concerns upstream in the planning process), and the manner in which the development is
implemented (to improve urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods,
and to increase the city's capacity to phase and stage development in a market environment
while increasing the quality and competitiveness of public transport).

                                                           city.

Government also requested for another four months as grace period. For Jinshan Bus
Depot, the city government decided that it would continue financing the construction
after the Bank loan is closed.

7.        To better utilize the Bank Loan before it is closed, Fuzhou Municipal Government
also requested the following reallocation of proceeds:
    (i)      to cancel US$6.33 million of loan proceeds in the Jinshan Bus Depot
             construction and related technical assistance activities;
    (ii)     to transfer US$2,465,267 of loan proceeds from Nan Jiang Bin Lu Road to
             Phase 2 of the 3rd Ring Road and increase the percentage of expenditure to be
             financed from 59.95% to 60.14%; and
    (iii)    to create a new expenditure Category 1(c) for Civil Works of Jinshan Bus
             Depot and set the percentage of expenditure under the new category at 100%.

   C. Proposed Changes
8.     Based on the request from the Borrower, the following project restructuring is
proposed:

       Urban Development Project, [Loan No 48120], P070519 will be extended from
       March 31, 2011 till May 31, 2013.

   (ii) Cancellation of the Bank loan. US$6.33 million of the loan will be cancelled.
        The proposed cancellation includes US$4.16 million under Category (2),
        originally for ITS system procurement; and US$2.17 million under Category (3),
        which contains US$0.32 million for a construction supervision fee for Jinshan
        Bus Depot and US$1.85 million for Technical Assistance expenditures.

   (iii)Categories of Expenditure. Category 1 Civil Works of items to be financed out
        of the proceeds of the Loan is revised to include three sub-categories: (a) Part A
        of the Project – Nan Jiang Bin Lu Road; (b) Part B of the Project – Phase 2 of the
        3rd Ring Road and Kuiqi Bridge; and (c) Jinshan Bus Depot (a new category).
        The percentage of expenditure of Civil Works under Category 1(c) is set at 100%.

   (iv) Reallocation of loan proceeds. Following transfers are proposed: (1)
        US$2,465,267 of loan proceeds will be transferred from loan disbursement
        Category 1(a) for Nan Jiang Bin Lu Road to Category 1 (b) for Phase 2 of the 3rd

 CHINA — FUZHOU NANTAI ISLAND PERI-URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                    P070519 {LOAN NO.48120}

                                 Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for China, Fuzhou Nantai Island Peri-Urban Development
Project, [Loan No 48120], P070519 will be extended from March 31, 2011 till May 31,
2013.
2.      The Loan became effective on February 16, 2007, and disbursement of the Loan
experienced significant delays during the early stage of project implementation, primarily
related to resettlement. However, the project implementation started progressing well
after mid-2009. As of February 15, 2013, 89.45% of the Loan has been disbursed.
3.      Implementation Status of Major Project Activities. All investments under the
Strategic Road Infrastructure Component are either completed or close to completion.
Remaining civil works of Kuiqi Bridge and the Third Ring Road will be completed by
the end of May 2013. Construction of Jinshan Bus Depot, which is the remaining activity
under the Public Transport Component, started recently after a lengthy delay due to
various issues related to land acquisition. As the planned construction period for the
Depot is 15 months, the Depot will not be constructed before the project closing date. But
Fuzhou Municipal Government has committed that it would continue financing
construction of the Depot after the Loan is closed.
4.      Justification for 2 Months of Extension. The Borrower has requested for an
extension of two months to the closing date of the loan. The proposed extension is
necessary to ensure completion of the remaining project activities under the Strategic
Road Infrastructure Component, which accounts for 76.63% of the total original project
investment and is critical to achieving the development objectives of the Project.
5.      The PMO has prepared an implementation plan which sets up milestones for
monitoring completion of all remaining project activities within the extension. The task
team reviewed the action plan and found it acceptable.
6.      This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension occurred in
June 2011. The first extension period is 21 months, from June 30, 2011 to March 31,
2013.

2.      Category 1 Civil Works of items to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan is
revised to include three sub-categories: (a) Part A of the Project – Nan Jiang Bin Lu
Road; (b) Part B of the Project – Phase 2 of the 3rd Ring Road and Kuiqi Bridge; and (c)
the Jinshan Bus Depot (a new category). The percentage of expenditure of Civil Works
under Category 1(c) is set at 100%.

3.      The Loan became effective on February 16, 2007, and disbursement of the Loan
experienced significant delays during the early stage of project implementation, primarily
related to resettlement. However, the project implementation started progressing well
after mid-2009. November 29, 2012, 89% of the Loan has been disbursed.

4.      Implementation Status of Major Project Activities. All investments under the
Strategic Road Infrastructure Component are either completed or close to completion.
Remaining civil works of Kuiqi Bridge and the Third Ring Road will be completed by
end of May 2013. The Public Transport component, which is the construction of Jinshan
Bus Depot, has been long delayed because of very difficult and slow land acquisition
process. Given the planned construction period for the Depot is 15 months and thus the
Depot will not be built before the project closing date.

5.      The construction Nan Jiang Bin Road is already finished. The remaining loan
proceeds under this subcomponent (Category 1a), around US$ 2.47 million, will be
transferred to Phase 2 of 3rd Ring Road (Category 1b). This transfer will not affect the
percentage of expenditure under Nan Jiang Bin Lu Road to be financed.

6.      Cancellation of the Bank loan. Due to the delay of Jinshan Bus Depot
construction, Fuzhou Municipal Government proposed to cancel US$ 6.33 million bank
loan to reduce the expenditure of commitment fee. The proposed cancellation of US$
6.33 million bank loan includes US$4.16 million under Category (2), originally for ITS
system procurement; and US$2.17 million under Category (3), which contains US$0.32
million construction supervision fee for Jinshan Bus Depot and US$1.85 million
Technical Assistance expenditure.

7.     The proposed reallocation and cancellation is necessary to better utilize Bank
Loan and reduce Fuzhou Municipal Government’s financing cost.
