                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to support sustainable peri-urban development in Fuzhou (as it expands to include Nantai Island) with the provision of strategic transport
                         infrastructure and by strengthening the city's decision support system on land development and management. Specifically, the project supports peri-urban
                         development in Nantai Island with: (a) investments in transport access to Nantai Island (road and public transport); and (b) TA that would help the city to strengthen the
                         manner in which the development is planned (to encourage development patterns that promote public transport while integrating environmental concerns upstream in
                         the planning process), and the manner in which the development is implemented (to improve urban design, preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods, and to
                         increase the city's capacity to phase and stage development in a market environment while increasing the quality and competitiveness of public transport).

                         Almost all project activities have been fully completed, as 99% of the loan has been disbursed as of April 20, 2013. The Strategic Road Infrastructure component including the
                         Nanjiangbin Road, the Third Ring Road, and the Kuiqi bridge, has been completed. The bridge and roads have been already in operation and generated expected benefits to the city.
                         Some small-sized civil works, i.e., four non-motorized ramps at Kuiqi Bridge and eight ramps at Fu-Quan Interchange, are not yet completed but they are progressing towards
                         completion by August 31, 2013. Construction of the Jinshan Bus Depot which is the main investment element of the Public Transport component has finally commenced and currently

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In March 2013, as per the request from Fuzhou Municipal Government (FMG), Government of China and the World Bank agreed to extend the closing date of the project loan to May
                         31, 2013 to allow FMG to complete the remaining work of the Road component and address outstanding issues which delayed commencement of the construction of the Jinshan Bus
                         Depot.

                         The Fuzhou Municipal Government (FMG) has committed to continuously financing and supervising all remaining civil works of the Project, i.e., construction of the Jinshan Bus
                         Depot, the four non-motorized ramps at Kuiqi Bridge, and the eight ramps at Fu-Quan Interchange, after the loan closing date, and committed to ensuring they will be completed in
                         good quality and in a timely manner.
