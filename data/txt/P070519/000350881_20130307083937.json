Specifically, the project supports peri-urban\n            development in Nantai Island with: (a) investments in\n            transport access to Nantai Island (road and public\n            transport); and (b) TA that would help the city to\n            strengthen the manner in which the development is planned\n            (to encourage development patterns that promote public\n            transport while integrating environmental concerns upstream\n            in the planning process), and the manner in which the\n            development is implemented (to improve urban design,\n            preservation of sensitive and historic neighborhoods, and to\n            increase the city's capacity to phase and stage\n            development in a market environment while increasing the\n            quality and competitiveness of public transport)."}, "docdt": "2011-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
