The extension is necessary to ensure completion\n            of the remaining project activities under the strategic road\n            infrastructure component, which accounts for 76.63 percent\n            of the total original project investment and is critical to\n            achieving the development objectives of the project. The\n            Project Management Office (PMO) has prepared an\n            implementation plan which sets up milestones for monitoring\n            completion of all remaining project activities within the\n            extension. The task team reviewed the action plan and found\n            it acceptable. This will be the second extension of the\n            project. The first extension occurred in June 2011. The\n            first extension period is 21 months, from June 30, 2011 to\n            March 31, 2013. The reallocation and cancellation is\n            necessary to better utilize Bank loan and reduce Fuzhou\n            municipal government\u0092s financing cost."}, "docdt": "2013-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
