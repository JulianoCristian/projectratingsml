Memorandum of the President
From: The President
China - Proposed Loan/Credit for Huangpu Port Project
1.       The following report on a proposed loan/credit to China for US$88
million equivalent, comprising a bank loan of US$63.0 million equivalent and
an IDA credit of SDR 19.8 million (US$25.0 million equivalent), is submitted
for approval. The loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate; the credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity.
2.       Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed by
the pace of recent economic development and capacity constraints are evident
in all modes. China needs to substantially expand its port and waterway
facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused by inade-
quate berth capacity and container handling capability. China's Seventh Five-
Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes these needs. Substantial investments are
envisioned: these include technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal zransport centers. To facilitate these
improvements, significant institutional changes are being carried out in the
iector, including an extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises, and delegating greater
authority to local managements.
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The project is designed to assist the Government
in the effort to relieve congestion and increase the handling capacity in the
ports. It provides infrastructure development in a key port in southeastern
China, as well as technical assistance and training to strengthen the port's
management and improve its operating capabilities and to address intermodal
aspects of port operations.
4.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project consists of: (a) construc-
tion of quaywall about 1,000 m long for coal, iron ore, bulk fertilizer and
two general purpose berths, and construction of a 850 m long wharf for
lighters and operations vessels; (b)basin dredging and reclamation; (c) dredg-
ing of an east Channel (about 7 kms long) to the new terminal; (d) construc-
tion of four bridges, the necessary railway, highway, water supply and
sewerage connections and auxiliary buildings; (e) procurement of the necessary
cargo handling equipment; (f) training of the required personnel; and (g)
technical assistance for construction supervision, specialized designs, opera-
tional improvement, updating the master plan including a study of the
*         intermodal distribution of cargo in the hinterland, and a study of channel
improvement.



-2-
5.       Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  The Bank Group fully recog-
nizes Government's objectives for development of the transportation sector and
is supporting its initiatives with both financial and technical assistance.
With Bank assistance the Government has added port facilities, enhanced
container handling capability and othcr specialized facilities appropriate to
modern traffic, initiated new organizational arrangements designed to improve
the productivity and efficiency of port operations, and trained a large number
of persons in long term planning. The Huangpu project is a logical next step
in this program of financial, technical and institutional cooperation.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Huangpu Harbor Bureau (HHB) has agreed that it will:
(a) submit to the Bank Group its audited financial statements not later than 6
months after t.e end of each financial year; (b) carry out the training
components of the project in accordance with the program agreed with the Bank
Group; (c) carry out a channel improvement study and the updating of the
Master Plan including an intermodal distribution study, both according to the
terms of reference and timing agreed with the Bank Group; (d) maintain its
revenues at a level sufficient to cover its full costs of operation including
depreciation, and to meet from internally generated funds all its financial
obligations including debt service, taxes, and allocations to special funds.
Government of China (GOC) has agreed that it will onlend the proceeds of the
loan and credit to HHB at current terms for ports (20 years maturity, 5 years
grace and 4Z per annum interest, with HHB carrying the full foreign exchange
risk). 
7.       Justification and Risks.  In 1985, the average waiting time of ships
arriving at Chinese coastal ports was over 11 days, costing about Y 187,300
per ship. Economic benefits of the propused project derive from: (a) ship
time savings; (b) cargo handling cost savir7s; (c) cargo time savings.  The
only risks foreseen for the project are of delays in construction attributable
to domestic procedures for civil works international competitive bidding.
8.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve them.

dollar amount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
