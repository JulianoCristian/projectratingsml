Some lessons learned included: bidding\n            documents for the procurement of large equipment should\n            provide specific post qualification criteria to avoid\n            confusion during the evaluation. Tariffs should be adjusted\n            every year, based on the local price index or some other\n            reasonable indicator. Guangzhou Harbour Bureau (GHB) has no\n            authority to set its own tariffs and revenue gains were\n            offset by cost increases that were even higher. GHB still\n            has room to improve performance by improving management\n            techniques and periodically revaluing fixed assets. GHB\n            should also consider introducing competition among terminal\n            operators to improve efficiency. It is recommended that GHB\n            update the master plan of the port periodically, since the\n            port serves one of the country's most rapidly\n            developing areas and traffic patterns will change quickly.\n            Also, the relationship with other nearby ports such as\n            Shenzhen and Hong Kong should be considered."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
